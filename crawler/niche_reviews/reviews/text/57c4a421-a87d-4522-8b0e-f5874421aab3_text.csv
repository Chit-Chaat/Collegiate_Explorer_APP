Freshman,5,"Blackboard is their online platform that they use with every student whether you are online or not. It tracks all of your classes for that semester and you are able to interact with other students and your teacher as well. It also tells you all of your upcoming assignments that are due so that you won't miss a deadline, and it lets you track you grades as well."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere when you walk onto their campus. Although they are a Christian college, they don't push religion on you. They always have a great athletic program that's really great to watch. I love that the campus isn't really big. You can make you're way around fairly easy and its lot's of campus parking. Lastly the campus is visually stunning to everyone who sees it."
Niche User,5,"I attended Belmont University from 2010-2014 graduating as a Songwriting major and Sociology minor. I had such an incredible experience! I am looking forward to returning to Belmont in the spring as an architect major. Since graduating Belmont I have start two successful companies in the music industry, Roscolusa Music Festival and What It Is Collective. After the pandemic and an immediate halt to the entertainment industry, I have decided to go back to school and pursue my love for architecture."
Senior,5,"I took online classes last semester. Both the students and professors had to give grace to each other as this was something unexpected, but for the most part, my professors did a good job with the transition."
Senior,5,"I love Belmont. It has been a great experience so far. It is expensive and they need to offer more scholarships to music students, but other than that, I love it here."
Senior,5,I love the atmosphere at Belmont and the opportunities that you get out of going there. Everyone there has been so friendly and helpful no matter what.
Sophomore,5,It is a very loving and welcoming environment with great students and teachers. There is also an immense amount of talented people.
Senior,5,My online learning experience with Belmont has been good! I have been able to balance my classes with my daily life and my professors have been very flexible!
Senior,5,"Belmont University was the college of my dreams, and from the very moment that I stepped foot on campus I knew it would be my home for the next 4 years. I have gotten so many leadership opportunities, internships, and research opportunities. Though the school is known for its music, the science program is top notch and should be considered!!"
Junior,5,"Very manageable with direct interaction and feedback from your professors. You also get to interact with your classmates through group discussion boards, which is nice."
Junior,5,"I love this school! It's in a great location, has a beautiful campus with new dorms, and the professors are generally very well-educated and helpful. I wouldn't give up my experience at Belmont for anything!"
Sophomore,5,"Belmont University is a spectacular community full of wonderful, genuine students, and professors who will go out of their way to see that you succeed. Of course, that being said there are some exceptions (as there are with any university), however in this case the highs greatly outweigh the lows, making me beyond glad that I've decided to attend here."
Junior,5,My time so far at Belmont has been such a wonderful experience. The faculty at Belmont care about their students' wellbeing as well as academic achievement. Belmont provides a wide range of opportunities for students in each college. The quality of education at Belmont is immaculate and I feel well equipped to enter the work force after I graduate.
Senior,5,Belmont has always been my dream school. I knew from the second that I heard about it that it was where I was going to get my degree. No other school would give me the resources and opportunities that I need to become a music industry executive.
Graduate Student,5,Belmont is a very prestigious university with a great MSOT program. The director is an alumni and is up to date on current events. Great program.
Sophomore,5,Belmont is a college that feels like home and you can find your people. I learn something new every day!
Freshman,5,The campus is so beautiful and you just get a good feeling when you are there. Sports games are so much fun. Only thing I would like to see change is there should be a more diverse population of students.
Alum,5,"Veteran here,

I graduated in 2019 and really appreciate Belmont for my 4 year experience. I learned a ton and made great friends. Interesting, now that I am done I enjoy looking into Belmont to see what is new. The University is always changing for the better. An amazing basketball program."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a student at Belmont University studying Music Business with an emphasis in Live Venue Management. Belmont has allowed me to discover my true passion and provides many resources to learn about the music industry. I've attended over 20 seminars discussing different sectors of the industry, the roles people have and the needs within the industry."
Sophomore,5,Everyone can get along with one another. The campus is beautiful. It it very cleanly presented. Every major can find something for them here at Belmont.
Freshman,5,Absolutely amazing! The university offers endless opportunities for every student and continues to stay up to date with modern cultures. Students strive for excellence and consistently offer help to peers and locals. Highly recommend the university for anyone seeking acceptance and encouragement.
Niche User,5,My son is a Belmont Music grad and he absolutely loved his experiences here.  He received an excellent education and made life long friends.  Our family is grateful and proud to support our extraordinary and beautiful Belmont University!  SFW
Freshman,5,"I love Belmont!!! All my professors are amazing and I find all my classes to be challenging yet very manageable, not too difficult if you're willing to study and work hard. I also love the campus."
Junior,5,I love the history of the school when it opened in the 1800's as a women's college. I also love that it's a christian college.
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful, the professors and staff are extremely caring and always wanting to help each individual student succeed. There is an incredible sense of home and community and it is apparent everyone cares greatly for one another."
Sophomore,5,"Belmont University is a great campus with a rich academic environment! The professors are always available and very invested in their students! The student atmosphere is also very welcoming and easy to find your niche in! The school is located in the heart of Nashville so there is plenty to do outside of campus as well, as well as many free and low cost concerts and activities for students/young people."
Niche User,5,Belmont University is a student and family-friendly University. I recommend BU to all students who want to get the best education and be seen as a student and not just a number.
Sophomore,5,"I love the music program at Belmont. I am a harpist and have appreciated their flexibility to make the harp program they way I would like it. I am taking not only classical but jazz as well, which is the reason I chose Belmont."
Freshman,5,See more interaction between students and staff on personal levels for the benefit of students' educations.
Sophomore,5,I'm having the time of my life at Belmont University. The school has top-notch facilities and you can really tell that the faculty and staff care not only about the subjects that they teach but also about the students themselves. The campus is beautiful and the people are very nice. I am incredibly happy with my decision.
Freshman,5,"I have been at Belmont for only one semester, and I can honestly say that it is an amazing school. That said, I have some friends that are already looking to transfer, but the main reasons are because of the lack of a party scene or the cost (two things that you can definitely figure out before committing). Also, when it comes to having fun, if you're determined to have a good time, you'll find a way. The community at Belmont feels so special and welcoming, so the first few weeks are smooth for most students. If you aren't outgoing, you may not LOVE Belmont, but most people come out of their shells quickly. It is really a wonderful, nurturing environment. It could be much more diverse, but I have met lots of students with different perspectives on life and had great dialogues with them. I genuinely feel that my professors and friends care about my success and my well-being, and I wouldn't trade that for anything. Come check it out for yourself!"
Senior,5,"I loved their undergraduate majors, internship opportunities, the small class size. The campus is well kept and everyone was very helpful."
Niche User,5,Can't wait to go here! Everyone is so nice and genuine. People go out of their way to be welcoming even when it benefits them in no way. Love Love Love!
Niche User,5,"LOVED IT! This school is amazing! The people are amazing, the teachers are amazing, the dorms are amazing (the list could go on)! Music is very popular at Belmont, but so is Nursing. Nursing students get to work in fantastic hospital systems nearby, and Music students are in the country music capital! There are so many opportunities for students, and the faculty want the students to succeed. Not to mention, the dorms are HUGE! Nashville is a great area, so the campus is safe too."
Freshman,5,"beautiful campus, nice people, excellent food, clean dorms! Professors are kind, generous, and want you to succeed."
Niche User,5,I loved touring Belmont they actually care for their undergraduate and graduate students. The classes are not too big so you get plenty of time with the professors. It's a large campus and you can get involved in a ton of things.
Freshman,5,I feel very at home here. When I go to eat lunch I see at least one person I know. The professors really care about you and want you to succeed. I feel very safe and secure.
Niche User,5,The campus was amazing; the people were friendly and welcoming. I would love to attend this university.
Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed the time I have spent here, and I look forward to spending much more time here! I've had some ups, downs, and turnarounds, but there was always someone there to help, not JUST provide comfort. That is what I really appreciate the most about the school, they want you to be your best and it shows."
Sophomore,5,"Belmont University is a place for connections and community. It is constantly growing, and each program encourages the students to get connected with each other and reach out into Nashville. They offer many seminars with famous influencers of our society that helps every student expand there horizons if they so wish to do so. I would love to see even more teachers on campus in various fields of study that need the attention, but the teachers that are already there are devoted and fantastic."
Freshman,5,I love the Professors and the mood of the whole campus. When I was visiting the campus when I was still in high school I walked on campus and all of a sudden I felt the warmth of the people and felt like I belonged
Senior,5,"My experience at Belmont University is amazing! I really love the professors, the campus, and the organizations and clubs that you can be a part of!"
Freshman,5,I loved the diversity and the way in which they brought everyone together. One thing I loved is the integration of the Nashville seen on their campus
Junior,5,Great school. Lots of helpful professors and plenty of great students who are ambitious and are willing to work towards their goals.
Sophomore,5,I cannot think of any other school I would ever want to attend. Belmont was the best choice I could have made as far as school goes. I love everything about the school and am grateful to be enrolled for another year.
Senior,5,"I really, really love Belmont. I've had a great experience here as a student so far. I am a woman in STEM and have found a great, supportive community here among my peers and the faculty here. It is academically rigorous and I know that  I'm getting an education that's worth the tuition."
Niche User,5,"I took a look around Belmont University, and I was amazed at how beautiful the school looked. This university is also a Christian school which drew my attention as well."
Sophomore,5,"Belmont University has enlightened me not in only in my area of study, but in the world around me. In just a year I have learned so much, felt so accepted, and become extremely involved. It is a fabulous university."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Belmont. It is the best decision I have ever made. I have never been so happy than my time at Belmont University.
Freshman,5,The campus is stunning and full of life. It is a safe space where you can grow towards your career while having a whole lot of fun. the people and professors are also top notch.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus and atmosphere. Nashville is such an amazing town, and there is always something to do!"
Freshman,5,"Amazing campus, amazing faculty, amazing experience! Belmont is not only the perfect school for those who dream of pursuing a career in the music industry, but it also is an excellent choice for those who want to pursue a career in Nashville in general. there are so many different opportunities for internships and learning experiences. Already I have learned so much and have been granted so many great opportunities to expand my knowledge at Belmont. Belmont is a place to go if you want to grow not only as a student, but as a person in general."
Freshman,5,"My first visit with BU was very warm and inviting.  The instructors, faculty, students were very excited to spread all their BU information, and give me the information I needed to become a Bruin.  I was very excited to be welcomed.  I have nothing but good things to say about BU. From the structural buildings to the classroom, to the professors to my new friendships are given an A+."
Niche User,5,Belmont is a great school. I start there this upcoming fall. They are o welcoming and will go out of their way to help you and answer any questions you have. They are very efficient with answering emails and I never feel confused. They care about their students more than anything else and it shows.
Freshman,5,"Belmont University is one of the most beautiful college campuses. It  is located in downtown Nashville where there is so much to see and do. Yet, the campus is tucked away among tall stately buildings and protected by great security. There is a path to succeed here for anyone who takes advantage of the many opportunities. You are more than a number to the professors who want you to reach your potential as a person as well as a student."
Senior,5,"I adore Belmont. The most accepting loving school. As a member of the lgbt community I have never felt so loved by other students. I was worried about being accepted but I feel so at home. The teachers are amazing, the classes our amazing, everything about this school feels like it was made for me. Campus is located in the heart of Nashville."
Niche User,5,I am not a student yet but it is a beautiful campus with amazingly talented students that would be an an honour to join in the near future.
Niche User,5,"When I visited Belmont University, I felt very welcomed by the staff and students. Everyone that I talked to was very helpful and provided useful information about the school.

There are a few other colleges that I have visited and Belmont definitely has the best campus I have seen. The entire campus is beautiful and scenic. It gives off a friendly atmosphere and made my college visit very enjoyable.

I am interested in majoring in Audio Engineering Technology at Belmont and was given the opportunity to sit in on a class. I was nervous to attend the class at first because I was afraid I would be a distraction to some of the students and inhibit their learning. However, everyone was welcoming and made me feel like I was right where I belonged.

I had a wonderful experience at Belmont University and I believe there is something for everyone to like there!"
Niche User,5,"I am a prospective student for Belmont University. I have recently been accepted and it is my dream to pursue my education at this school. I atteneded preview day, and I automatically knew it was where I belonged."
Niche User,5,"It has been all sorts of supported. The faculty is amazingly supportive, and the food is well above par."
Niche User,4,"I definitely prefer classes in person, but the online class experience at Belmont was overall a good experience."
Senior,4,"I was worried about doing classes online at first because in the past I was not able to succeed, but the set up this time around has been very easy smooth."
Graduate Student,4,My experience is so far is just with the regristering produre of starting school in August 2020. My experience had been good with the interacting of the staff their emails or some phone calls.
Sophomore,4,"Belmont is a great place to be surrounded by not only creative peers, but a creative staff and amazing teachers. Going to Belmont University means you have a beautiful home to come to every night after exploring and enjoying the bustling city of Nashville. Belmont helps you find plenty of networking options within the city, nationally, or globally, and equips you to handle the career of your choice through hands-on classes."
Sophomore,4,"The online transition because of Covid was tough, but our teachers were extremely accommodating, making the online experience great. When you take a class from Belmont, whether that be in-person, hybrid, or online, you are always guaranteed a great experience no matter what, because the teachers are absolutely amazing and so qualified in what they teach."
Junior,4,"I like how small class sizes are, allowing students to develop strong relationships with professors. I wish the school would work towards more clarification on finances."
Senior,4,"I do not personally like online classes, so I prefer them in person, but the professors do a great job of being available via email and other forms of communication to facilitate the online classes."
Senior,4,"The learning environment is really good if you are someone who enjoys a slightly smaller classroom. I've had positive interactions in classroom settings between myself and my professors. It is a Christian college, but they do encourage curiosity into other religions as well as providing  vast information on the theology of the Bible. Student life is great, and there is a nice mix of greek life and non greek life. It is not dominated by fraternities or sororities, but those options are available to someone who enjoys that. Overall, I am having a great experience."
Junior,4,"I had to take classes online due to the COVID situation. Most of my professors did everything in their power to make it a worthwhile situation. Even though it was a bummer to miss out on in class opportunities, I felt like I successfully"
Alum,4,"Belmont University is a beautiful school with professors who are well educated and experienced in their fields, and truly care about their student's success. The course material is valuable and helpful when entering the professional world. Something Belmont has room to improve on is their administration and their communication skills. Administration takes quite a long time to answer questions, and they do not necessarily seem like they want to help."
Freshman,4,"More focus needed on enrolled students, rather than prospective students. Professors are conscious of students' needs. Athletics are hit or miss. Nursing and music are the main majors, so if you are not part of those, be careful. Housing is good if you can get it. Parking is decent. Freshmen can have cars on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Belmont has great academics, however, there is limited diversity and it costs an arm and a leg to attend."
Alum,4,"The professors and students made my overall experience one that I would not change if I had the opportunity. However often times the University Administration were so focused on expansion it came at the expense of its students and faculty, which left an obvious rift between university administration and students."
Sophomore,4,"Belmont is a beautiful place to go to college.  There are amazing opportunities and amenities here. My program in the Curb college gives the opportunity to all students to intern at entertainment industry companies.  The faculty members here really want the students here to succeed and are always there to help you.    With that being said, Belmont University has been a great experience so far and is the place to be if you are aspiring to be in the music industry."
Sophomore,4,"This university is a wonderful place for anyone to increase his or her education.  Not every major has the best representation or accreditation, but there is a great variety of colleges and academic disciplines to choose from.  The value of the school is great, as the relatively high cost of tuition and attendance is balanced out by fantastic student life and a great education.  I would encourage anyone looking for a private education to apply to Belmont University."
Junior,4,Belmont is a great place! They have lots of opportunities to connect with industry professionals. They also provide a well rounded liberal arts education.
Sophomore,4,Belmont is beautiful campus but crime has been getting closer and closer to campus but there is an escort program run through campus security. My freshman dorm is suite style which is very nice and upperclassmen dorms are apartment style. I wish my dorm specifically had more of a lobby area or a study area as the dorm itself is small. There is not much diversity at Belmont; majority of the students are white and 60% of the student body is women. There is plenty of restaurants and stores near by. Student life is excellent there is something for everyone to get involved in. I stay busy in the showcase program which will help me with future jobs. Belmont does not have football but basketball is where all the spirit is on campus. The first mens game for Basketball has an annual tradition of first on the floor to get students excited for the upcoming basketball season.
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus with the perfect size of students. You often run into people you know but not too often, so you can hide if you need to. The location is great. The food is great, they have fun dining hall events sometimes. My only complaints would be the high tuition I have to pay, and some of the GenEd requirements are kinda redundant. But overall, I have enjoyed my time since Belmont has such a great learning environment."
Alum,4,"I loved my experience at Belmont for the opportunities and relationships it afforded me. I studied Music Business in a time of rapid industry transition, so the degree I earned is mostly irrelevant and outdated now, but I grew as a person in many ways and the environment and staff at Belmont are the primary reason why."
Niche User,4,"Belmont University feels like home. It's got a lively party scene, but also a quiet charm for people who want a different sort of social interaction. To top it off, the campus is gorgeous, which makes walking to classes a pleasant experience in its own right. As for the classes themselves, while some classes may be a bit of a miss, the science department is wonderful and engaging."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful and all the professors genuinely want to see you succeed both in college and later in life. As 80% of the school is white and a majority is Christian, there could be more diversity at this school which would just add so much. The students are all very accepting of anyone from any background. Also, Nashville is just a great city to become a young adult in."
Sophomore,4,"I really appreciate that so many of my professors have real Music Industry experience. However, I wish that it could be a more diverse school. Or that it would cost less money, because it is crazy expensive."
Sophomore,4,"Belmont is a wonderful environment. The people are kind, the teachers care, and the connections and access
to the music industry are invaluable. My only complaint is the lack of diversity. Belmont claims diversity when in reality, the campus is wildly caucasian and I have experienced some negative effects of being a Jewish member of the LGBTQ community on a Christian campus."
Senior,4,"Belmont has a unique way of creating a community-feel in the large city of Nashville, Tn. Through its unique offerings of personal development programs, I give credit to Belmont for who I am today!"
Freshman,4,"I love Belmont and everyone there! The professors, classes, students, and the campus it all feels like a far off dream. It is incredibly expensive though and I am struggling to pay for it all. So make sure you can afford it before you fall in love with it."
Alum,4,"Belmont University was a great place to get my undergraduate degree. The professors were amazing and the classes were challenging. It would be nice to see transfer students become eligible for scholarships, as Belmont is not inexpensive."
Freshman,4,Belmont University provides many resources for its students to be successful. The campus is beautiful and the city of Nashville is a great place to live. The small student population creates  a strong sense of community on campus.
Freshman,4,"I love Belmont University, I have met some amazingly talented people there. I have also gotten many opportunities to go to different events on Music Business and other unrelated topics to expand my knowledge. It also has a beautiful campus."
Niche User,4,"Actually visiting the school, I had a really good time. I was able to go to the boy's and girl's basketball game, which was my first ever college game that I attended. The people there were welcoming and I felt like I was already apart of the college experience just being there. The only thing that made me give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that just because I was able to attend a basketball game and see people that actually attended the school didn't necessarily mean that I was able to communicate and get the actual full experience of being a college student."
Freshman,4,I love the environment. Professors are friendly and want you to succeed. Even the staff are always friendly and welcoming.
Junior,4,Belmont provides great classes and seminars for music business majors that you can't get anywhere else. The community is great and the campus is beautiful. My only complaint is that they keep adding more students without adding more classes to accommodate the increase.
Freshman,4,"I would love for more scholarship money to be awarded based on things other than test scores. Other than that, I love the campus, the professors, and the overall community of Belmont."
Freshman,4,"When I visited Belmont, I fell in love with it. The campus is beautiful, and everyone is as nice as come be. You have to go visit!"
Alum,4,"Awesome student community with knowledgeable professors that want you to succeed. What started as a small, private school in Nashville has become one of the best schools to go to in the Southeastern US. 

Favorite parts of Belmont: Student community, helpful and knowledgeable professors with real industry experience outside of academia, campus life, the entrepreneurship program, the entertainment and music business programs and all of the industry connections they have to offer."
Sophomore,4,"I love how great the professors are and how nice they are. They always seem to go the extra mile to make sure I am understanding the material given to me. I love the campus, it is gorgeous and they do a good job with its up keeping. I would just like the see the library be updated. Most buildings on the campus are gorgeous and updated, but the library is very old and outdated, which I feel like the library is one of the places students would like to do their work at the most."
Freshman,4,"I love how is within walking distance of many places in Nashville, which opens up many opportunities for students."
Niche User,4,"Great experience, Great Campus, Great People, Great City, lots of things to do. You will learn alot while at Belmont. Life changing experience"
Junior,4,"My time at Belmont has overall been great! The campus is beautiful, the curriculum is challenging, and the staff cares a lot for their students. I do have issues with how safe the campus is at night (barely any lights around campus, which is terrifying for the young women walking home at night), as well as how upper administration treats different situations. Our sports teams are doing well this year, and the school just built a state-of-the-art new dorm so it is getting better. This is not a party school at all, we usually put on house shows for our classmates who are up and coming musicians, but we aren't a state school so hard partying doesn't really exist."
Junior,4,I love the community of the campus. Everyone is so friendly and I love how the campus is fairly small because it gives you the opportunity to get to know everyone around you. I also like how class sizes are small because the professors get to actually know your name and know you in general. They're so helpful if you ever need help outside of class. As a con I wish there was more diversity on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I haven't been here long, but I've enjoyed my time so far. As an African American at this school, it is pretty clear on the percentage of those ethnic students to caucasian. It is quite small, and intimidating at first, but everyone is so nice and welcoming, you fit right in. There are many clubs that you can join to help you feel more comfterable. I love the dorms, the food, the campus, the teachers, the students, and more. Its a great environment to be in, and I'll be proud to graduate from here."
Freshman,4,Belmont is one of the best schools in Tennessee. It provides several opportunities that allow students to grow and connect with possible career options. Belmont's location in Nashville allows for adventuring and interesting showings. There is always something to do and the food choices outside the cafe are diverse as well.
Junior,4,Belmont University is incredible. The relationship with the professors and the connections you can make here are unreplaceable. The campus is fairly safe and conveniently located in Nashville. The parties are pretty wicked once you can get in and the compass life has the option of being religious or not. The theater is incredible as well.
Junior,4,"I love the open atmosphere and the caring professors. No matter how you're struggling, your professors and fellow students really want you to succeed. Belmont is a great learning environment and has unlimited amounts of student opportunities. The surrounding Nashville area is great for going out on the weekends and campus is so close to so many amazing places (especially music row!)."
Niche User,4,"Belmont is the most beautiful campus that I have ever stepped foot on. I flew out over Fall Break to Tennessee with my mom to check out a couple of schools, and none could compare to Belmont. We joked that it was almost as if it had this halo above it. Everyone there was super friendly and helpful. The only problem is the expense and minimal scholarships that are handed out to students."
Freshman,4,"I love going to Belmont. I am a performance student, and the staff and students in the theatre program are incredible, talented, and supportive. Going to Belmont has definitely made me more well-rounded and given me a lot of perspective. The only critique I have of Belmont is it's lack of diversity, both racially and religiously."
Sophomore,4,"Belmont is a great school! I am here for songwriting and it definitely sets you up with connections and opportunities that you cannot get anywhere else. However, it is very expensive. They give minimal scholarships and really like taking your money. I'm not kidding. I am a transfer student with a good GPA and I received no aid."
Freshman,4,"From the very first visit I made to the campus till now as a second semester student, I have loved the unique sense of community here at Belmont. I think the university upholds strong values and promotes their student body to do the same. 
If there were to be anything I would like to see change, I think it should be the institution of ""visitation."" To have the opposite sex in your hall, the process is frustrating and strict. The hours are short and quite restrictive for college students who are otherwise expected to act like adults."
Sophomore,4,"It’s a good school, but most of the problems I have lie within the schools administration. There should be a very good ratio on priorities between improving the school and keeping current students satisfied. Some of the improvements are great, but their close-minded focus on only expanding the size of the school has lead to countless complaints from students. Their ratio is lopsided and has made the gap between students and administration much wider."
Freshman,4,"I'd like more food options, as well as options for underclassmen to live off campus. There are very strict rules on visitation and practice hours that I would also like to see change. The food is the main problem. Those who live on campus are not given an option to not have a meal plan. Otherwise, the campus is beautiful, I am getting an amazing education here, and the location could not be better!"
Sophomore,4,Amazing student body with countless opportunities. But it's way too expensive and upper administration sucks.
Freshman,4,Belmont University is an intimate university where everyone feels apart of the close-knit community and is welcomed by all.
Alum,4,"Belmont was a great place! It was small but not too small, and the campus is beautiful. All the professors that I experienced were great teachers, some of them experts in their field. It's on the expensive side, but I felt like I had a great college experience here. It's not a great school for partying, so if that's what you're looking for, then you should try elsewhere."
Freshman,4,I'm a freshmen at Belmont currently and so far I have made a lot of connections and friends. The classes I have had been useful in making me a better student and I feel like I have learned a lot. The amount of possibilities and opportunities Belmont offers is incredible and makes it nearly impossible to not be getting involved with something or experiencing some kind of event that will help you evolve with in your major and become the exceptional kind of student you seek out to be.
Sophomore,4,Belmont has some wonderful professors and opportunities for work study and aspiring musicians. I wish that it were better about financial aid and diversity.
Freshman,4,Only have been here a couple of weeks at Belmont University I already love it! People are so welcoming and the campus is beautiful.
Junior,4,Belmont is an incredible school with incredible professors and an incredible community. The honors program especially has given me a place to meet people who are kind and driven. I love this school.
Senior,4,"I love the small campus environment and how nice all the students are.  I would definitely change how the ""higher ups"" really do not listen to students.  And the biggest thing I would change is the fact that they give NO money to their students for scholarships.  They love to brag about how much money is collected each year from their donors, but I will be the first to tell you that I never saw any of it."
Sophomore,4,"Belmont is a very unique and inclusive university. My first year was beyond expectations and I thoroughly appreciated the effort Belmont puts into making the college experience one of growth and learning not just about one's degree but the world. My only complaint is that our president tends to take some extreme measure to ensure ""inclusiveness"", such as the recent and highly-controversial decision to force a 100% bid distribution rate for Greek organizations. While not being a member of these organizations, I feel this defeats the purpose of bids in the first place."
Freshman,4,"Belmont is an amazing school, with an even better atmosphere. Everyone is extremely friendly, and there's always stuff going on around campus to do. The professors are extremely credible, and they make it fun to learn by including experiences they've had in the music industry, nursing, etc. The only thing I don't like is the food served. Since we're paying so much money to the school each year, me and other students I've talked to would like to see better food options!"
Freshman,4,"Belmont University is a very welcoming community. Its Music Business and Music colleges are incredibly strong, as well as their nursing program. Set in the heart of Nashville right on Music Row, there are many opportunities to network and learn about the music industry. Academics are above average, but nothing exceptional, given that this is a more music-oriented university. It is a Christian school, so while there is diversity among students, there have been issues in the past with the administration discriminating against the GSA on campus, Bridge Builders. Only other issue is that it is expensive, but you definitely get your money's worth. The campus is gorgeous and you are given tons of opportunities to improve in your field, both in class and the real world."
Junior,2,"Considering music therapy? Don’t do it! Worst experience of my life. If it interested you, transfer to another university. It won’t be hard to find a better qualified department. If one music therapy professor doesn’t like you at Belmont, prepare for the worst experience of your life. Favorites are a thing and professors can prevent you from graduating if they don’t like you. Transfer or choose another major to switch to at Belmont."
Sophomore,2,"I’ve been at Belmont for two years now, and since I am no longer someone they are trying to get into the school, it becomes obvious how little the administration cares about it’s later students. The only thing the money seems to go into is attracting new students with a pretty campus and neat events. However, once they have you, they will stop caring. The financial aid/ scholarship program had several issues, there is not enough housing for what the school is trying to bring in and the available housing is obviously not complete, with the newest building tall hall falling apart because of the rush to house students. The money that is extorted from students is not put back into its students but instead placed on more important things like overpaying the administration. There are some great people and wonderful teachers at Belmont, but I would not recommend for the fact that it has some of the worst heads that care nothing about the students."
Niche User,2,"When I toured the campus everything seemed great. Everyone acted super nice and accepting of all sorts of different people and I became interested in the music business and audio engineering majors. When I actually arrived on campus, I realized how wrong I was. Unless you act, look, and think like everyone else, come from similar backgrounds and do greek life, you are not accepted. I had several instances where people looked down on me because I didn't come from a rich family and didn't join a sorority. The majors I was interested in ended up being very boring and and the professors, while experienced, were not the best teachers. I also had a problem with mold growing in my dorm. I was having allergic reactions and complained several times and never got it fixed. The food was horrible and also gave me allergic reactions. I did always feel safe on campus but I was so unhappy that I decided to transfer after my first year. Many people love it but it was not the place for me"
Freshman,2,"My favorite thing about Belmont is its academics. I have met great professors. The class sizes are great; some are even smaller than classes I had in high school. However, since the school is so small and so concentrated with music students, I feel like I am not getting the entire college experience."
Freshman,2,"I came to Belmont hoping to get a normal, fun college experience. What I got instead was an overly strict school that has no parties and only cares about its music majors."
Senior,2,"The main frustration I have with Belmont is the lowered standards to increase enrollment and tuition profits to build more extravagant buildings. The scheme is to beautify the campus and market the school well to attract more upper-middle class applicants and thus continue the revenue stream. To my understanding, this is mainly the work of President Bob Fisher in an effort to grow this shady university.  A student a few years back tried to find transparency in Dr. Fisher and was met with repression and punishment. Dr. Fisher takes home an annual salary, including benefits, of over a million dollars. Belmont is for sure a private entity with their own agenda; the aggravating part is their antics are devaluing my degree. 
Choose a school that values you as a person and not for your money."
Freshman,2,"This school is actually dead during the day. The only time people are outside is at 2 in the morning on a strange week day.  No one is on the lawns and no one goes outside. Although this may seem like a good time, it is not."
Sophomore,2,"It's not very commuter friendly. There's not as much opportunity to connect with others on campus, and you miss out on one of Belmont's core values, the sense of community, especially if you're not into Greek life."
College Freshman,2,Belmont parties are non-existent and probably always will be.
College Freshman,2,The only parties that take place are through Greek life at off-campus houses.
College Freshman,2,"Saftey is fine. Health services are terrible. You are better off just pushing through whatever you have than visiting for help. A friend was diagnosed with mono by a doctor after the campus health center had insisted that it was a cold for over a month. Health services will also refer students to the disciplinary process if they come in to get help with any sexual health issue. The school also fails to provide condoms and does not allow them to be sold in the pharmacy. There have been mass-outbreaks of food poisoning stemming from the caf that the school has failed to address and have instead brushed them off claiming that it was ""just a stomach virus""."
College Freshman,2,I degree value is very good. Nobody knows the school unless affiliated with music
College Freshman,2,The courses and professors are really easy for the most part but don't teach much
College Freshman,2,Greek life is okay here but nothing compared to bigger schools. Nothing special
College Freshman,2,Its bad on campus. off campus. different story.
College Freshman,2,Not alot of diversity. Its increasing. But still majorly white.
College Sophomore,2,I just had a terrible experience. It was just paying for obligatory friedahips rather than meaningful ones.
College Freshman,2,There is an air of positivity when you first get on campus but it disappears fairly quickly and becomes a blur of egos with virtually no party scene and nothing to do.
College Freshman,2,"Belmont is a Christian campus so they are strict on alcohol which means no parties. However, Vanderbilt is a few blocks away and they always have parties. But it's important to remember that you at college to get a degree, not to party."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not a picky eater, but I find Belmont's caf to be pretty not good. The only meal I would enjoy was my morning omelette (except on Saturdays, no omelettes available), but that was a hit or miss depending on who was making it.  Lunch can be alright if you get there at the right time, or if there are several people touring campus that day. 

For the other campus options, those aren't too great either. The Chickfila is and insult to real Chickfilas and the Papa Johns hardly ever has pizza. Mcallister's is probably your best bet, but it's pricy for the quality of the food and isn't always quick. On the other side of campus there is a not real Starbucks and a Sandella's. I've had trouble with the not real Starbucks, as they don't often put espresso in drinks that are supposed to have espresso. The lines also tend to be long, but it is the only Starbucks like thing for a few miles so you just deal with it.  The only thing I have to say for Sandella's is that it is not yummy or cheap. Peace"
College Freshman,2,Stereotypical college parties do not exist at Belmont. There are house shows though that showcase talented djs and bands at the school.
College Freshman,2,There are hardly any healthy options. Every food option on campus mainly sells just sandwiches. It gets old after a while.
College Senior,2,Don't expect the school to actually help you when it comes to paying for the ridiculous cost of tuition. The student financial services at Belmont are some of the least helpful people at the universtiy. They do not do their job correctly and couldn't care less for those students whose parents can't write a check for the full cost of tuition.
College Freshman,2,"Scholarships are few and far between. One of the only ways to get a scholarship is merit based from when you originally applied. Belmont does a great job of helping low income students get scholarships and the money they need, but they leave the middle class students on the hook for full tuition."
College Freshman,2,"No options and caf food is almost never tasty or healthy. I would say the worst part about the caf is that there are never healthy or normal fruit/vegetable options. Always pizza, carbs, and more carbs. Even chick fil a and non-caf options get boring after a while. Hopefully our new dining center comes with a wider range of options that include healthy things too."
Recent Alumnus,2,There's really not a whole lot of transparency
College Freshman,2,"Best place by far is subway! Everyday, it is life."
College Sophomore,2,Belmont is not very diverse at all. It is a Christian University with strong religious beliefs and majority white.
College Freshman,2,A lot of guys here are already taken. They usually prefer the blondes from cali.
College Freshman,2,Financial is not a simple task to complete. I went through all the hoops possible and still did not receive nearly as much as I should have.
College Freshman,2,"Belmont tends to not give many scholarships out, unless a student participates in a sport. I applied for financial aid and got a decent loan, however I didn't receive any scholarships that I was hoping for. Every other school I applied to granted me a decent scholarship for my good grades in high school, but Belmont did not. Belmont is also an expensive university to attend to, and applying to scholarships and loans is a confusing process that I still don't really understand how it works. I was hoping that my first semester/ year grades would give me a chance to receive a scholarship next year, but I'm having trouble finding information on how applying for next year works."
College Senior,2,"Belmont University consists of a fake, racist, and dishonest administration and community. First of all, what NAME are you paying for? No one is going to recognize this institution outside of Tennessee. I give Belmont two stars out of five for many broken promises, few friends made, and a strange college experience that few will give weight to on my resume."
College Senior,2,"On campus housing is a rip-off. Get out of there as soon as you can. Poor amenities and elementary, summer-camp like policies!"
College Senior,2,"Very little diversity on campus. The marketing tries to fool you by cycling through the same 5 African-Americans in the entire campus on the website. Don't be fooled by the marketing, this community is racist and not diverse."
College Senior,2,"The academics are sub-par. Professors give out course materials that you won't go through. Book purchasing is highly superficial. Most of the courses are un-memorable as there is little student discussion involved. The professor aren't interested in facilitating student discussions about a subject, but rather preaching from the lectern their golden word and glorifying in their power over you especially in the business school. It's a very unpleasant experience."
College Senior,2,"Students are close minded, racist, and generally not interested in meeting anyone outside their little social circles. Unless you are hipster or in greek life, you will not make any real friends on campus. I'm sad to say especially if you are a minority group, you will be discriminated against for the color of your skin I'm sorry to say."
College Senior,2,"Unorganized, unpredictable and superficial. The administration hurtles you around like cattle at orientation. Enough said."
College Freshman,2,The University does not say much about the crime that happens on campus. Instead they like to focus on what's happening in the surrounding community. If the students want to know about crimes on campus they must find out from their peers.
College Freshman,2,Belmont needs more international and non-Christian students. I think this would make campus more lively.
College Freshman,2,"Belmont is just not very diverse.  Of course, it is a conservative Christian college.  It's predominantly white and predominantly pro-Murica in its political views."
College Freshman,2,"If you are a student who has usually enjoyed school and learning, and you have been very successful in your academic pursuits, please make a better decision than I made.  Go somewhere else.  I'm not saying that there aren't wonderful professors and intelligent students; I'm saying that this is not a challenging academic environment.  These students will not keep you on top of your academic game.  The days you will get excited about school are the days when the teachers actually teach you something completely new and off-topic from the course at hand.  If you would like to breeze few four years doing some busy work and reading, Belmont might be for you.  I want something more academically."
College Freshman,2,"There is little diversity in the level of academia in Belmont's students.  If you are a pretty intelligent individual who enjoys doing little coursework and relearning a lot of what you did in high school, and you enjoy engaging in some but a very limited amount of in-class discussions, you will fit right in.  If you want more, go to a state school if you're choosing between fallbacks.  There is more academic diversity in a larger pool of students."
College Freshman,2,"The administration doesn't really care about Greek life.  I don't really care about Greek life, so that doesn't really aid my evaluation.  It's pretty low-key at Belmont - I believe only 4 sororities and 2 fraternities.  They don't have parties (because Belmont)."
College Sophomore,2,i have not recieved any yet
College Freshman,2,"This school is insanely strict. Do not come here to party if that is what your plan is. However, if you're the type of person to want to go out here and there, there are people on campus that know what they are doing and if you befriend them, they will help you find parties. The campus isn't as dead with parties as some people say it is, but it is not a party school. If you are the type of person who can control themselves and is responsible, you will be fine. Visitation is ridiculously strict (no guys can stay overnight in your dorm and must be out at 11PM during week days and 1AM during weekends). Personally, I'm never one to get into trouble so I have no problem with the strictness though."
College Sophomore,2,Getting financial aid to talk with you or help you is almost impossible.
College Junior,2,"Belmont is quick to give a person financial aid, however they don't give away much. Even when you ask for more, they don't give you much. It is a constant struggle to pay for school and multiple loans must be taken out."
College Junior,2,"No aid, even though every other school I applied to provided me with a decent amount. I have been awarded a very small fraction for this coming year, but it basically only covers the cost of the tuition raise... so I am paying the same amount I did last year anyway."
College Junior,2,"Pretty much nonexistent. It's a dry campus so on the weekends no one is around really. The student body doesn't have a TON of school spirit for a school with a D1 Basketball Team. Games are still fun, but only if you really enjoy the sport and have friends who do as well. During the week (if its warm enough and the signs are not our front preventing it) many students (mostly male) will play sports on the lawn. That's about as ""socially active"" as the campus gets"
College Senior,2,"Many choices if you have a lot of money. Parking is bad, but the location is perfect."
College Junior,2,Everyone is a music major so don't think you're unique if that's what you're going to Belmont for. You'll be a very very very very very small fish in a very very very very very large pond.
College Junior,2,"Greek Life at Belmont, if you even want to call it that, is a joke compared to most other schools in the nation. They take themselves pretty seriously but they would be the laughing stock at any other school."
College Junior,2,Rainy and cold all the time. Not as cold as the northeast or the midwest obviously but the weather comes up from the Gulf of Mexico and just dumps gallons of rain on Nashville. The temperature hovers around 30-40 degrees from about mid-November until April.
College Junior,2,Belmont made me hate Nashville.
College Junior,2,Almost everyone at Belmont is white. Lots of economic diversity. No religious diversity whatsoever.
College Junior,2,The sports at Belmont are laughable. Basketball is the only popular sport and they aren't even that good at it compared to the rest of the NCAA. They just play the worst teams ever so they look a lot better than they actually are.
College Freshman,2,"Well for starters, we have free Metro bus passes that you'd think would be extremely convenient. Think again. I am nearing the end of my first year here and I have never once used it simply because the bus stops aren't in convenient locations. Furthermore, the campus does have a free shuttle service that they provide to and from the airport. The catch? You have to call 24 hours in advance so they can pick you up. While normally this wouldn't be a problem, almost every flight I've had has been delayed by a certain amount of time, so I've usually just asked my friends to drop me off and pick me up."
College Freshman,2,"I myself am not much of a partier, but the nightlife here is kind of pathetic. Very few clubs that you can go to dance; the only ones I can think of currently is the local gay bar, Play. There are house parties and shows just about every weekend, but you have to know the right people, and from my experience, I have never wanted to stay more than an hour or two as certain people will drive you insane."
College Freshman,2,Belmont University is diverse in terms of sexual orientation but not much else. Economic backgrounds here and ethnic groups don't have much variation.
College Freshman,2,"At belmont University there are no campus shuttles and it is hard to find a bus stop. Students over 21 are not allowed to rent cars, making transportation difficult for those who do not have cars."
Sophomore,1,"DO NOT GO HERE--- IT IS A SCAM!! I went here for a year and a half before I ultimately transferred. It is full of quirky hipsters/theater kids, the administration doesn't care at all for students, classes you are required to take are impossible to get into, the food sucks, and the campus life is terrible and made me lonely/depressed. Since leaving, my financial aid for the last semester I was there mysteriously disappeared, they admitted it was their error, but won't resolve the issue and are trying to send the balance to a debt collection agency (trying to charge me extra because I left that hellhole???). Such a waste of money and not at all a real college experience. You will only be happy here if you are going for music, save your time and money and go somewhere better. Just trying to save people from having the same bad experience I did :("
Freshman,1,"I am trying to transfer out of Belmont as soon as I can because my experience after one semester was completely miserable. Before I even began classes, I already had a bad impression of the school because of their week-long orientation. Yes, it is an entire week long from 9 am to 9 pm every day! As an introverted person it was an awful experience. It is a very stifling environment because they shove their community-oriented lifestyle down your throat at every opportunity, and you will feel outcast if you're shy or don't enjoy socializing every minute of the day. There are so many rules and lack of independence for all aspects of campus life, so it feels like you are at a summer camp rather than college. The cafeteria has very limited healthy options, and if you are vegetarian you will probably starve.  I had more freedom as a high schooler living with my parents than I do at Belmont."
Niche User,1,"Very disappointed with Belmont's admissions office.  Very little contact.  Unresponsive to emails. Never could reach a live person to talk with on the phone.  When leaving a message no one replies. And months later still no word if accepted or not as a student. Seems like they couldn't be bothered if a student went to there school or not.  Thankfully this was not the case with Lipscomb! They have a very responsive admissions office and made you feel like they actually were interested in you as a person.  Very, very disappointing Belmont."
Niche User,1,"First off, when you visit they assure you that although they are a christian university, you do not have to be a christian to attend and fit it. WRONG. There are required bible courses and most of the professors led a prayer at the beginning of class. I was a christian who had taken a step back before arriving and I felt like religion and God were being shoved down my throat.

Further, my counseling department experience was such a horrible experience that I can't begin to even put it in to words. Thank God I am level-headed and not in a life-threatening situation because my experience was the opposite of helpful.

I didn't find the classes to be too rigorous or stimulating. I ultimately left Belmont and the majority of my classes didn't transfer and I ended up having to change my major."
College Freshman,1,"It's bad. The administration has continually refused to allow a gay-straight alliance on campus. If you do not follow the brand of Christianity the school preaches, let alone, a non-christian, it can feel very awkward. Belmont is also nearly 100% white."
College Freshman,1,Don't go here if you are not involved with music. Waste of money and time.
College Sophomore,1,"As a transfer student, I got absolutely zero financial aid. I'm trying, but nobody I talk to knows how to help me. They always have to ""ask their boss"" or ""email my information to someone else"" and it is exhausting going into the financial aid office multiple times and getting the same answer. I can't do this on my own and nobody is willing to work with me."
College Freshman,1,"I know this is a Christian University, but I would like responsibility I deserve as an 18 year old."
College Senior,1,"The administration at Belmont is the worst part of the university. It's obvious that those in administration only care about gaining future students, not the students they already have. They are too busy focused on using tuition money to build new buildings for a larger amount of students, but they forget they need more professors to teach the increasing number of students. Education should the primary concern of a university, but it's clear that the needs of the students are not a priority for the administration."
College Freshman,1,"It's Belmont, we are a pretty strict Christian university. Yeah some people drink, but they aren't stupid enough to do it on campus. If your looking for a party scene and kids who party every night, Belmont is not the place for you."
College Sophomore,1,hahahahaha its belmont... we go to vanderbilt for fun.
College Sophomore,1,"If you are looking for a party school, Belmont is definitely not the place for you. I have been at Belmont for 4 years and have yet to attend a party"
College Senior,1,The food program is an abomination. The same company (Sodexo) that serves Belmont food serves food to public prisons. Freshman students forced to enroll in a year long meal plan suffer from malnutrition.
College Senior,1,There are not parties. Belmont treats its students like they are in summer camp and babies them around disrespectfully not allowing ANY fun on campus.
College Freshman,1,"If you at all enjoy the thought of partying in a remotely safe environment, don't come to Belmont.  The only parties that take place with Belmont students are off campus in houses.  They are almost all bring your own alcohol, and you'll have to rely on the creepy kid who deals drugs in front of the Circle K for your alcohol.  Best case scenario, you hear about a party at Vanderbilt: super safe vibe, get to party well, people there are super nice.  Regardless, either figure out a place to sleep afterwards off campus or really work on your steady walking skills, because if you get caught on campus after you've been drinking, you're screwed."
College Freshman,1,"I don't know exactly what I was looking for coming into college, but I quickly discovered that it wasn't what Belmont offered.  Visitation hours are enforced with a strictness and intensity one would only expect at a children's summer camp or field trip.  Drugs and alcohol are completely unacceptable in the eyes of the administration.  They say they ""want more for us"" than to waste away our college years on booze.  Frankly, I'd like the opportunity to decide that for myself and make my own mistakes.  I feel as though I'm treated more like a ten-year-old going off to camp for the first time than a college student.  Belmont was not completely up-front with the intensity with which their policies must be adhered to when I was applying and deciding to enroll."
College Sophomore,1,"I love Belmont University and could never go anywhere else, but I would transfer in a heart beat if I hadn't fallen in love with all the amazing people that go here.

That's right, I would transfer. 

The fact that I have to sign a girl into my room and will get written up if I don't is insane. And she has to leave at 11pm? She can't stay the night? If this is a measure taken to keep the student body from sinning then it's futile because most people here do anyway. I'm an adult and I would like to be treated and respected as one.

As far as alcohol and drug violations they're pretty normal about what's allowed and what's not. The only issue I have with their policies is if you come on to campus with alcohol in your body you can be written up for possession of alcohol. And when you're caught with any of this, the consequences can be extremely aggressive. If you're caught with alcohol once it's just a pain to deal with. If you get caught multiple times it can lead to potential suspension. Being caught with weed is a pretty automatic suspension and probation. As of late though, they've been much harsher on things. Just today my friend was suspended because he admitted to cop that he was high when he was off campus. The cop brought the case to Belmont, and after a hearing they suspended him for the semester. There was weed or paraphernalia on him and he was of campus. He'd been at college for a month and a half. He left today...if I was him I wouldn't want to come back. 

Belmont is a great place where great things happen and the best people in the world live, but the administration needs to stop trying to be a really strict southern parent and grow up...or be extremely explicit on how strict they are, because frankly I would have liked to know this going in. A lot of my closest friends have been suspended or expelled for innocent things like alcohol and weed, and it's ruined a lot of peoples college experience. If it wasn't for the amazing people, I'd transfer."
College Freshman,1,"They treat us like we are little kids still…. we have to check guests of the opposite sex in our dorm rooms and have to have a sign on our door. There are visitation hours as well (Sun-Thurs 10am-11pm) and (Fri-Sat 10am-1am). The opposite sex cannot sleep in your dorm room, not even if it is your brother or sister visiting you. If you accidentally fall asleep watching a movie or something then you will get written up. I don't like that the school tries to press their Christian values on us. We are old enough to make our own decisions when it comes to dating or hanging out with friends at whatever time. You can stay off campus with them all you want. Also drugs and alcohol are a big no-no. If you are caught with any drug you are done here. For alcohol you have 3 strikes and you are out."
College Junior,1,"Is this a college for twelve year olds? Visitation check-ins, visitation passes on doorknobs, visitation hours... its all like my mom came to school with me."
College Junior,1,"Just terrible: the food quality is terrible and the way it is cooked is terrible. The hours are also very inconvenient. They are closed during prime eating hours (closed 9:30am - 11:30am... what?!) If you don't eat dinner before 6pm, they don't really put anymore fresh food out. I ate dinner at 5pm every night  (and I felt like and elderly person) to make sure I at least got food that wasn't cold... then again I ate pizza or cereal for almost every meal after the burgers, chicken, and international stations gave me food poisoning. So overall, I would say ""AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!"""
College Junior,1,Getting into Belmont in general is incredibly easy. The acceptance rate is 82%. Getting into the Music Business program is also very easy. People act like it is really difficult but it really isn't at all.
College Junior,1,It was the worst year ever.
College Junior,1,The transfer out rate is somewhere between 30-40% which is completely obscene and really all you need to know when considering to go to this school.
College Junior,1,"So strict. Dirty, small, cramped. The RAs can come in your room at anytime and look through your things in search of drugs and alcohol. They call it a ""safety check"" and they say they're looking for fire code violations but everyone knows what they're really looking for."
College Junior,1,I stopped eating on campus after the first week of school because it was simply unbearable.
College Junior,1,If I could do it all over there is no chance I would go to Belmont. You literally could not pay me to go back there.
College Junior,1,Its similar to what I would imagine prison is like.
College Junior,1,"The ""nightlife"" a Belmont could not possibly be any worse."
College Junior,1,Everyone there is a music major. I can't think of any reason why you would go to Belmont for anything other than music.
College Junior,1,I transferred so I was pretty unhappy.
College Sophomore,1,"There is little to no diversity on campus. However, Belmont likes to pretend they are diverse by finding the six diverse people on campus and posting them on the Belmont homepage. Belmont University is a closed minded school that is heavily populated by white, conservative, christian, southern students."
College Freshman,1,White and upper middle class. There ya go
College Freshman,1,"I didn't recieve any financial aid for my first semester, and when I did it was in loans."
College Sophomore,1,"The opposite sex are allowed into others' dorms only at certain hours and need to be checked in at the front desk, which is ridiculous. "
College Freshman,1,Belmont is awful at giving away money.
College Freshman,1,There aren't really transportation options except for Metro Nashville bus lines.
College Sophomore,1,"the health services is seriously lucky that i don't have the time to sue them... 

they will turn you away and refuse to treat you for no reason at all if they feel like it, even if you have an appointment, no matter how urgent the situation.  if you call to make an appointment, sometimes they will not actually schedule you into the system so you think you have an appointment but they never actually made it.  oh, and most of the time it is not free. it takes about 4 different people to stick you before some sort of blood will actually be drawn. just a few things you should know.

if your insurance will pay for treatment off campus, you are more likely to get help off campus.  the benefit of the clinic is that it is cheaper, though not free, and they will surprise you with all sorts of extra bills you didn't know about later on.

just so y'all know. if all you need is some cold medicine you should be fine but lots of the things they claim they do they don't actually do."
College Junior,1,"There are only three options for transportation at school.  1) You bring your own vehicle to freely use.  2) You pay to rent a Zip Car that may or may not be available at the time you need it so, you'll often have to adjust your plans.  Or 3) You use the public transportation, MTA buses, which are free with your Belmont ID.  However, the buses literally take forever and the schedules aren't exactly user friendly.  If you don't have a lot of experience riding public transportation I don't suggest your first year at Belmont to be the best time to learn.  You're better off driving your own car around or finding friends with cars."
College Junior,1,"Scholarships? At Belmont? That's funny. Unless your family is rich, you won't be able to afford it. If you had a really good financial aid package your freshman year, it's going to get a lot worse in the upcoming years. My experience with the financial aid office is pretty awful. I've cried almost every time I've ever spoken to them."
College Sophomore,1,"Very unhealthy. If you keep track of your weight you have to be extremely careful, or just avoid eating on campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,Nothing is happening on the campus at night unless there is a scheduled event. It is in a city though so there is plenty to do in Nashville but the campus itself is pretty quiet overall.
College Freshman,1,Belmont is very strict. It is a tobacco free campus so no one is aloud to smoke on campus. Also alcohol use is strictly monitored. If a person is caught intoxicated on campus they will have negative repercussions. (even if they are of age) If you are found to have any type of illegal drugs you can be kicked out. Overall Belmont is really strict.
College Freshman,1,"I can't explain how awful Sodexo is. If I were a student, I would get my doctor to write me a note to get out of it, or at least only 5 meals a week."
College Freshman,1,Public Transit in Nashville needs some major improvements. I have been stranded multiple times because the buses just aren't reliable.
College Freshman,1,"If you're under 21, don't expect to have fun in Nashville. If you don't like country or hipster music, expect to have a terrible time in Nashville."
College Freshman,1,Belmont over-admits Audio Engineering Technology majors. There is no room for everybody to graduate within 4 years.
College Freshman,1,"As a transfer student, I was not eligible to receive any Belmont Scholarships which made it important for me to look at outside scholarships."
College Student,1,No smoking on campus. No alcohol on campus (even for those 21+). Visitation hours limit the possibilities of hooking up. Hawk-like RAs try to catch students frequently.
College Junior,1,"Parking is a disaster at Belmont. You should get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class because you will be driving around and around looking for spots. Part of this problem is attributed to the fact that Belmont allows everyone, even Freshman, to have cars on campus. The campus also was not made for so many people, but Belmont is continuing to expand and taking in more people each year. Parking permits are free if you apply for them. Campus police issue out tickets left and right and fees are typically around $50-100 for violations, such as parking in a place where your parking sticker is not visible,  backing into a parking spot, etc."
College Freshman,1,"The cafeteria food is similar to eating cardboard. They bring out the good food on visitation days for upcoming students but other than that, it is a complete waste of money eating there. The Curb Cafe is somewhat decent but easy to get sick of. Lack of options makes you spend more money off campus for food"
College Senior,1,There is practically no diversity in Belmont. It's mostly white upper class. But you will see the random international student here and there. The diversity does seem to be improving since I started.
College Senior,1,"Parking at Belmont is like the lottery, either you find a spot right away or you drive around in circles for 20 minutes praying someone leaves and you are in the right spot at the right time. It mostly depends on what time you arrive, after 12 you usually have a couple of spots open."
College Sophomore,1,"Hard to Find! It's pretty hard to find cheap off-campus housing in Nashville.  It's a popular area to live.  Most students are required to live on campus until they have completed 60 credits (Junior standing) however, there are ways to apply for off-campus while an underclassman.  If you can find a house or apartment, stick with it! There are a lot of neighborhoods around Belmont and a lot of places to rent out.  If you can find a good place to live within walking distance, consider yourself lucky because parking at Belmont is terrible!!! Most places you can find to live aren't going to be any lower than $500 a person per month, which is still better than the on campus price.  However, saying that it is a lot more convenient to live off campus because of the dorm rules."
College Sophomore,1,"The caf gets old after a week. Typical greasy food, but it usually tastes all right. I'm sure it's possible to eat healthy, but it probably requires intense effort. Hours are odd, especially for dinners. I prefer the Curb or Corner Court, which take dining points or bruin bucks. Unfortunately they force students to buy a meal plan when living in a dorm. At least the workers are usually friendly and helpful."
College Sophomore,1,It's very hard to find a parking spot. Especially if you live in one of the older dorms. They'll make you park across campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Mostly White Students – Student body is largely white, but some ethnicities are present. Same for religious views; most are Christian."
College Freshman,1,"Could Be Better – Parking can be a nightmare. There are a ton of spots, but with the extremely high rate of commuters, these fill up very quickly. With the new buildings, hopefully there will be more parking spots available. However, allowing all students to have a car may be slightly unnecessary as a lot is accessible to students within walking distance or by free access to the public bus system. Tickets are usually fairly negotiable. But parking in general is not fun at all."
College Student,1,"Seriously horrible for vegetarians. As a vegetarian, I realize I am a minority, but I feel like I genuinely cannot eat healthily in the cafeteria. The vegetarian option is often protein-less, and any hope of getting protein is lost. The salad bar is stocked with ICEBERG lettuce which has the nutritional value of water. The other lettuce option is usually that weird purple lettuce that no one actually likes. Romaine lettuce is just as inexpensive as iceberg, or maybe slightly less, but is so much healthier. Breakfast at the caf is a complete waste of time, unless you happen to like rubbery scrambled eggs and stale biscuits. The pizza at Belmont is pretty consistently good, but obviously someone can't eat pizza everyday. It doesn't help that the cafeteria is much too small to accommodate Belmont's seriously increasing population.
One of the only good things about the caf is the workers, who are incredibly nice and helpful."
College Freshman,1,"Absolutely Awful – The dining hall at Belmont is just downright terrible. The food is always questionable. The food is labeled, but I still end up questioning it. Belmont supposedly has the Grade D food plan from Sodexo and I wouldn't be surprised if that were true. (Prisons have the Grade C food plan.) As a prospective student though, you wouldn't think this because they buff up the caf and they bring in better-tasting food just to persuade you to think that they serve good food. You're better off eating out of a trashcan."
College Sophomore,1,Public transportation basically does not exist in Nashville or at Belmont. They don't offer buses to get anywhere and the public transportation I don't think even stops near campus. You basically have to have a car or have friends that do to get anywhere that isn't walking distance.

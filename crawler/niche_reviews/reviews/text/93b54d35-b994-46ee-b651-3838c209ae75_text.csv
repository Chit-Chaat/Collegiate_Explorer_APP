Junior,5,My school has amazing professors that would do anything to help their students succeed. The school does well with giving their students ways to express themselves.
Graduate Student,5,"While I did not take online courses, there was an online platform for students to submit papers and contact teachers. This was extremely helpful because students did not have to go to the library to print out papers. They could just refer to their laptops."
Graduate Student,5,"What I loved about Columbia International University was the Christian atmosphere. This atmosphere allowed for a spirit of love to cover the entire campus. I also loved how the teachers were very open for conversation with students. Since the university was small, teachers had an ""open door policy."" I wouldn't want to see anything changed about the university, but, I would suggest that chapel be shortened to twice a week or something."
Senior,5,"CIU has changed my life! Every professor is so intentional with students, they really care about us and want to get to know us."

Freshman,5,"I love Columbia International University.  The campus is clean and very family oriented.  The professors are friendly, helpful and understanding. CIU is expanding and giving students more opportunities to excel and succeed during and after the college experience.  The dorms could use a little updating, but overall they are well kept."

Junior,5,"Columbia International University is an excellent school, CIU is the place for you if you're looking to build your relationship with God, everyone is like family. all your teachers know you by your name, When i went to visit it so welcoming it was like they all have met me before CIU is the place me and it should be the place for you too if you are looking for a higher education and building your relationship with the Lord"
Sophomore,5,"The community at CIU is incredible! The faculty cares so much about every student, regardless of any differences they may have. Student involvement is high and there is much fun to be had! This is one of the few colleges that I know of where your professors invite you for dinner and you have their personal cell phone numbers. Their care and compassion for every student is incredible. 
The facilities are being updated, thanks to our new CIU President. The campus is beautiful and somewhat secluded from the city, with many walking trails all around the campus. Beautiful view, as well!"
Senior,5,I have a lot of disabilities that make attending school a challenge. I need seve accommodations  and require flexible teachers who will work with me when things happen I expectedly. CIU has gone above and beyond my expectations with this and has even brought in a vocational rehabilitation specialist to campus to farther help students with disability's succeed. The professors at CIU all have a desire to teach and a passion for it! They aren't there for money or personal fulfillment; they are there to teach you and help you succeed and will go far beyond the requirements of a teacher.
Freshman,5,"I just visited and I plan on attending this fall. The campus is super small and community driven, everyone is super friendly and helpful."
Freshman,5,"CIU is a small Christian school with a real family atmosphere. You get to know fellow college students and your college professors.  I feel like I’m learning a lot, growing in my face, and making relationships that will last a lifetime"
Senior,5,"Columbia International College has changed my life. My desire is to have a better understanding of the Bible, and Columbia International is fulfilling that dream. The campus is very warm and inviting. The instructors are very knowledgeable of their subject area and expects nothing less than the best from all students. I would highly recommend this school to any student who is seriously considering a degree in Religious Studies."
Niche User,5,I loved this university. It's so Christ focussed but it also has great education. The professors really care for you Ben outside of the classroom and your school work.
Sophomore,5,Colombia International University has provided a positive outlook on what people following Christ should look like. The teachers and students show true joy in Christ and discuss Christ daily. CIU prays together daily and comes together every month to have prayer day which helps students grow in Christ. CIU is a great school for Bible believing Christians.
College Student,5,CIU is a very safe and healthy school to attend for anybody.
College Student,5,"The courses are fun and very interesting, and the professors are phenomenal and caring."
College Student,5,"Prospects for jobs and internships are excellent. Alumni are all over the world, yet very related."
College Student,5,"As far as community dorms go, I have yet to see a school with better and more customizable dorm rooms."
College Junior,5,I love the school. The teachers and faculty are personable and truly care about you and and their field of study. They are experts in their fields with many years of experience. The community community of students is fantastic and warm.
Recent Alumnus,5,Security is always around campus
College Senior,5,My time at Columbia International University has been very great so far! The community is enriching and I love the size of the campus.  The professors strive to teach truth and strive to genuinely help students.  The classroom setting is surprisingly enjoyable as well.
College Sophomore,5,"My time at CIU has been such a blessing to me so far. The professors are knowledgable and care about the students, and the student body community is great."
Recent Alumnus,5,I have had a great experience because of the people I've met at this School I've grown so much transferring from a two year college into CIU.
College Student,5,"The housing is nice. This is my first time living on campus so I'm just enjoying it. The students in my dorm are wonderful, we all get along and the atmosphere is wonderful. Its very costly especially if you don't have much, but God always provides."
College Student,5,"We have one Computer lab, it's rarely full because most students have laptop. Laptops are mandatory for some classes. At the library if you don't have your personal computer you can rent on for an hour. Other than that the network is fast and reliable, some sites are block which is understandable."
College Student,5,"The campus is not to big, so we can't walk everywhere. The only time a car is needed is if your going off campus. "
College Freshman,5,"Plenty of labs, areas to print, etc. Network/wireless is fast and reliable. Library has laptops to rent, but it is helpful to have your own computer."
College Freshman,5,"Plenty of parking, low cost for a permit, and near to everything."
College Freshman,5,"Small school with good security, very aware, and the health services on campus are good and available."
College Freshman,5,"School standards have rules against drug and alcohol usage for all students, and the people that this school attracts are usually very willing to follow these standards."
College Senior,5,Seriously! I can leave my house at 7:45 for an 8:00 class and arrive on time without worrying about parking!
College Senior,5,The standards are very high. I feel this is the first time since I have been in college that I have not been able to breeze by in my classes. The classes are intense and it would be impossible for you to do well without having to apply yourself and really study. 
College Junior,5,"The computer lab at CIU meets the needs of the students. Most of the students have their own lab-tops or tablets. The WiFi is excellent on campus, it serves the students well."
College Junior,5,"CIU is in a class all by itself. It embraces Christians from all around the world.  It's main focus is reaching the lost regardless where they are for Christ. They prepare you to minister to unreach people groups from all around the world. 
The online courses are just like being on campus. The professors make themselves available to us, it's as if we are on campus in the class room."
College Sophomore,5,"One of the most important things for me in a school was a drama or theater program. The CIU Players put on a play every semester and so far have been a favorite among students as well as faculty. It is completely student led, and even if you aren't cast, you can help with make-up and hair, prop setup, costuming, or even assistant directing!"
College Sophomore,5,The security system on campus is very good. We have a security office int he middle of campus and a patrol car that drives around 24/7. Our dorms have special keys and they are monitored after a certain time at night.
College Sophomore,5,If we have any Greeks on Campus they are treated fairly and just as anyone else on Campus is treated. Since we have a wide variety of nations represented at school the students are used to hearing and seeing different cultures.
College Freshman,5,CIU is a very diverse campus with a variety of people from many different cultures and countries.
College Freshman,5,The school is really firm about protecting the innocence of the girls and guys. Visitation is only on the weekends between certain hours. Door are not allowed to be closed and light are to be on. There are lounges where guys can come anytime. The school is very positive about the prohibitions they put on us.
College Junior,5,"It's great! The cost is cheaper than the dorms. However, your will need to appeal for special permission to live there."
College Sophomore,5,There are always enough computers to use in the computer lab.  Every computer is updated and have no lag time.
College Sophomore,5,"As a student at CIU, you will be getting a double major.  It is very challenging, but all the professors include Christ as the center of the education."
College Junior,5,"The rules set in place are to support clean Christian living.  Although we should be held to this standard on our own, CIU is here to help and not condemn."
College Sophomore,5,Certain Things – Ciu gives us the opportunity to learn and grow but has guidelines to keep your mind right
College Sophomore,5,My school provides an amazing environment to grow spiritually
College Sophomore,5,"Bible College – Since I attend a Bible college where everyone is required to adhere to strict no drug or alcohol policy, and most people have personal morals against using drugs and alcohol, there is very little to no drugs or alcohol present within the student body."
College Junior,5,No Drugs Period – Drugs are not allowed at my university. It is a Christian school and there is not a problem with it.
College Junior,5,"Lots of Variety – Columbia is the capital city and multicultural. There are Indian, Chinese, Thai, and Mexican restaurants. Many students go to Chick-fil-a, which has a student discount on Thursday nights."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Of Course I Enjoy It...That's Why I Chose It! Intercultural studies helps prepare those who feel a call to international ministry.  As foreign missionaries, this training is invaluable."
Recent Alumnus,5,A Very Unique Opportunity – What I am learning to do is something that is very rare nowadays.  It's great to have an institution that puts so much emphasis on my major.
College Sophomore,5,"CIU is a Christian university, howevever, pretty much every single denomination is accounted for from baptist to Lutherans, to Pentecostals. Everyone is family here!"
College Sophomore,5,Excellent University – This university is truly unique.  Every staff member that I have encountered is committed to helping me succeed in my educational career.  It is truly an exceptional school.
College Senior,5,Better Than I Imagined – I picked CIU because of their amazing community environment and was shocked to find the community was better than I even had thought. CIU is a great place to learn and to grow and to stretch yourself beyond imagination and to prepare yourself for the world.
College Sophomore,5,There are many people from all different cultural background and they are all excepted @ CIU regardless of where your from.
College Sophomore,5,"General Campus – On campus you'll find a gym with different scheduled activities, prayer and worship available in chapel and excellent food in the cafeteria."
Sophomore,4,When I got to CIU u I likes everything I seen. There campus is nice the people there is nice and I love how the coaching staff worked
Sophomore,4,"CIU is a great school. The professors really care about the students and want to help them succeed. Classes are rigorous and I know I am definitely getting my money's worth for my education. Most people are true Christians and are very friendly. The only complaint I have is that it sometimes feels a little out of date. Many theological views are kind of legalistic, and professors are not always the best with technology. However I am able to ignore these things and focus on the good, because the good definitely outweighs the bad!"
Freshman,4,"I have just applied to this school but the president of the University personally invited me to apply, waved the fee & gave me a $500 scholarship."
Sophomore,4,"My first year of college was both challenging and a fun experience at the same time. I have learned how to balance my work and life with having better self discipline while living on campus. CIU is bible college and I understand that but if I could change a few things I think it would be to allow students who's major isn't bible related, not be required to take bible courses. I would also like to see a better lunch menu with more fresh food instead of food that is frozen and re used all year."
Freshman,4,I have thoroughly enjoyed studying at Columbia International University as I am surrounded by like minded individuals. The professors and staff make being so far from home feel as though I was there. They are very intentional in getting to know you on a personal level. The education is also tremendous as I am challenged in my classes to do further than I would think I am capable of doing.
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming freshman for this school and have visited the campus many times. Everyone from the staff to the students, are super open and friendly."
Freshman,4,"The teachers are incredibly nice group of people. They really want to help you and just be their for you when ever you need them. Truly everyone, ranging from students to faculty, has a smile on their faces and want to help you in anyway. Classes are hard but you will learn a lot from them, and their is always something going on, you will never be bored. I honestly recommend this college for anyone looking for a great education and a great place to grow with your walk with the Lord."
Sophomore,4,I really like the fact that this college teaches every subject from a biblical worldview. I just wish that the school taught more applicable things that can help build a person for everyday life
Senior,4,"I have attended CIU for 3 years now and am entering into my fourth and final year  this fall.  I have greatly enjoyed the community and and many experiences I have had.  the school is beautiful and the staff are friendly and very encouraging.  They truly care about your development and growth.  The campus is small, but it has plenty to do, and the surrounding area has plenty of hangout possibilities.  The school has definitely helped me grow and develop many different skills and has better prepared me for the working world."
Sophomore,4,"The best aspect of Columbia International University (CIU) is the professors that work there. They have an incredible amount of knowledge in their fields making for an exceptional opportunity to learn. The most difficult aspects of CIU is simply paying to study there, and the size. Due to its small student base, CIU has a community that seems to pull its students into a bubble which hinders them from reaching out to the community beyond CIU."
College Sophomore,4,I am having a blast but a bit stressed out about financial help.
College Student,4,"Sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in a bubble, but in general CIU is a great school with wonderful people."
College Freshman,4,"We haven't really had to make use of many of our security measures, but we have been assured that they are all in place, and I feel very safe whenever I am on campus. This school does a lot to make sure that we are all safe and healthy while we spend our time here, and I generally never worry about it."
College Freshman,4,"I feel like I'm learning lots already, even though I am still only a Freshman and in a few general education classes. The professors are generally very kind and quick to say they are there to help and want you to succeed. There are lots of different classes, although most of them are Bible or Missions oriented, and I feel like I can take pretty much anything I want. I like how most of the class sizes are pretty small; it is reassuring that you are a lot less likely to get lost in the crowd."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus provides you with even more of a sense of community; there are plenty of activities to take part in, and whenever anyone has free time, they're always spending it together, whether on or off campus. Plus, the proximity to classrooms is fabulous."
College Freshman,4,"There is a wonderful program for student athletes; they have great opportunities and teachers are usually understanding about their various travelling schedules. All other students are actively encouraged to attend games and support our athletes, and everyone rejoices with the teams when they win."
College Freshman,4,"One of my favorite things about my school is the way that it truly is one big happy family. For the most part, there isn't too much drama or pressure to be a certain way, and almost everyone is kind, friendly, and you can always be sure you'll make friends no matter what you're taking part in."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms really allow for a great social atmosphere! None of the dorms are co-ed which is great and although there are community bathrooms, it's nice and clean!"
College Junior,4,The nurse on campus is wonderful and if you need to see a doctor then one comes to campus at least once a weak.
College Junior,4,I believe the administration is great and helps campus life
College Junior,4,We could use a pool and baseball
College Junior,4,Not bad but there could be more closer to campus
College Freshman,4,Good lesson learned. Very good experience.
College Freshman,4,The Facilities at my school is very people oriented.
College Freshman,4,"It is a convenient walk to campus for the most part.  The campus owns quite a bit of property used for on campus apartments for graduate/seminary students and their families.  There are also dorms for men and women in the undergrad sector of the school.  Ben Lippen school, a Christian K-12 school also resides on the campus of CIU.  It has been around since the 1940s.  When weather conditions get rough CIU normally follows the lead of USC by closing down the school until inclement weather goes away so classes can resume.  South Carolina is mostly a sunny and warm atmosphere in the south with varying temperatures in the winter."
College Freshman,4,"Columbia International University is a Christian University, so our core values determine much about our life and conduct as students of CIU.  CIU is focused on developing Christian Servant Leaders who impact the world with the message of Christ in their professional vocations as well as ministry based activities in churches, parachurch organizations, and mission agencies.  The atmosphere is relatively quiet due to the intense amount of studying that is done around the campus library."
College Student,4,Here is the South the weather is not bad at all.
College Student,4,"Campus dining is ok not the best but it will do. Everyone eats and the same time and the cafe close at a certain time everyday. So if you miss breakfast, lunch, or dinner at the given time thats it. "
College Student,4,"I love my Major, don't think I could choose a next one. My career goals are to become a child psychology, counseling in schools and homes. "
College Student,4,"The campus it self is great, wonderful atmosphere. There is really nothing to do off campus especially for a transfer student who don't know much about the area. The campus is very isolated form everything, you have to drive some miles to see city life."
College Freshman,4,"People come to CIU from all over the world; variety of ethnicities, races, and backgrounds. Political beliefs vary, but people at this school are Christians (it is a Bible school). "
College Freshman,4,Campus is so small that the weather doesn't affect things much.
College Freshman,4,Relationships are better at CIU. Perspectives on relationships are often very different for believers at this Bible college.
College Freshman,4,"Love the program. It is preparing me to teach English overseas, and I'm so impressed with the professors and material."
College Freshman,4,"The environment of CIU is unlike anything I've seen at other schools. Such an honest, wonderful social environment. This is a Bible college, so the options for majors are still few, but slowly expanding."
College Senior,4,I don't live on campus so I really cannot say. But I visited a friend's apartment and it was very nice and the rent was affordable.
College Senior,4,"Columbia International is a Christian college. Some of the standards people may not like, so it is not for everyone. I have not felt that anyone in the school is following me around to ensure that I abide by the rules. It is very much an honor system in that you are expected to follow the rules because you signed an agreement that you would."
College Senior,4,Columbia International has the best TEFL program that I could find in the state and that is why I chose it. I have found all of my teachers to be excellent except for one. My particular program offers student teaching abroad as well as here in the states. 
College Senior,4,"As I mentioned before, the school does not have the financial resources that other schools have. But what I notice is that the school requires excellence. I have attended graduate school for a semester at a university before I decided to change programs and this school is harder than anything I have ever known. But it is good because the program ensures that you understand what you are learning and retaining information instead of simply memorizing things for a test. As well as academically, the school provides a small, intimate community. The small classes create a sense of family."
College Senior,4,"Like all schools, it is not perfect. It is small so financially they cannot offer services that big universities can. I would love for them to have longer cafeteria hours, a bigger fitness center and to actually get paid as a graduate assistant as well as get a free class.  But other than the few inconveniences, it really is a great school. I  have found the professors are very helpful. The classes are small and that gives them more time for individual assistance. The school staff is very friendly; when I first started at CIU I was amazed at how everyone was always smiling and ready to offer assistance whenever I needed it. Oh! And one more thing:  It is so great knowing that I never have to stress about finding parking!!!"
College Junior,4,Strictness is used to preserve community. And it works really well. 
College Junior,4,Love the professors. Registration is easy. Most common study spot is the recently renovated library- I just wish it didn't have shorter hours this year. 
College Junior,4,"Psych major is great. Empirical approach with Christian presuppositions, while teaching you about other views as well. Unique that it isn't integrationist like most undergrad Christian psych programs. Classes are informative but not super hard. 
Bible major is also great, and can be quite challenging. "
College Junior,4,"Happy with the Bible major, and love my Psychology major. The friends I've made are keepers. "
College Junior,4,It's fun. There's a lot of community. Some weekends everyone goes home and the campus feels dead. 
College Junior,4,Overall it's good- everyone is more friendly than the average school. Most of us are a bunch of Christian hipsters. Athletics is changing the social culture a bit. Lots of pressure to get married; people can be quite nosy about relationships. 
College Junior,4,"Good community, recently renovated dorms. Wish you didn't have to be a senior to move off campus. "
College Junior,4,"No tolerance is pretty strongly enforced. I can't imagine that it's not in a few closets somewhere, but it definitely hasn't been a problem disrupting campus life. "
College Junior,4,Sports at CIU is very good for students. The School encourages taking care of the natural body as well as the spiritual body. Both are extremely necessary to help advance the Kingdom of God.
College Junior,4,"CIU involves the students in creating and making a differences on the campus. The professors are very sincere in helping us to achieve what God has called us to. There's a variety of activities for the students to get involved in; such as, on campus; missionary, and off campus ministries."
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely LOVE CIU's campus! The atmosphere is perfect depending on what you want to do for the day. If you want to study hard, the library is just the right place with private and secluded study rooms as well as tables, chairs, and an occasional bean bag chair scattered all over. The gym is great for working out, large gatherings, and time on the court. The field in front of the library is great too, for a good game of frisbee or right-rope-walking (you have to see it to believe it), or a study break outside."
College Sophomore,4,"Not only are there high zero tolerance policies and standards against any drug use at CIU, the students also have a similar outlook. The vast majority of those who attend CIU are personally against drugs and therefore the is no drug presence at school."
College Junior,4,Reasonable cost. Only takes about 10-15 minutes of a drive to go anywhere.
College Student,4,Some Issues – There are some issues with campus security with breakins in parked cars but mostly the campus is very safe.  I feel safe as a student
College Senior,4,Youth Min – the youth ministry program at CIU is great at preparing the future leaders who will help parents train and bring up their children in a biblical way prescribed by God in His word. recently CIU has revamped the program to allow for different areas of intrest of work to better prepare for futur careers.
College Sophomore,4,All instructors work with you closely on learning. Not studying for a test then do a brain dump and never remember the stuff 10 mins later
College Sophomore,4,"Process Requires Repetitive Visits to the Office – I ended up over aided with scholarships (because of third part scholarships that didnt come from the school) and i had to make at least 5 trips to the financial aid office every time a new semester rolled around, because they constantly forgot to transfer money to the new semester, didnt award me enough, took away some of my scholarships on accident, forgot to credit all scholarship to my account, etc. It was very frustrating and made me almost want to take the money out of pocket and pay it myself."
College Junior,4,"Fairly Easy – My program is very small. They needed more students in my major. I just applied to the school, there was not a special criteria. I just had to meet with my adviser who is over the program."
College Junior,4,Hot and Humid – It can be very hot and humid in Columbia. This makes it hard to concentrate on classes and walking around outside. The weather can make you want to be at the pool and not in a hot building.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Extremely Important Curriculum – I think you will find that there are very few seminaries that are as committed to teaching the Bible.  Unfortunately, many have turned to the universalism that is so prevalent in our culture."
College Freshman,2,"Its hard to find money for this school, especially since its so expensive."
College Senior,2,"Missions School, Not Bible College – There are alot of ethnic groups but it seems like it is primarily made up of mission kids."
College Sophomore,2,Dating is taken much more seriously at CIU compared to other colleges.  Spirituality is normally the most important factor in finding someone to date.  Both guys and girls tend to care less about appearance and fashion than elsewhere.
College Freshman,2,"Wish This Was Easier – It's not that easy to pay for college and CIU isn't always there to help.  Everyone seems to care about helping you pay for college but no one helps very much, they tell you what to do but they don't help any more than that.  This is just my experience though, other students have had better luck with financial aid."
Sophomore,1,I haven’t done online yet. But I feel it will be good . I really don’t have a problem doing online. I think I will get more work done to.
Alum,1,Had extremely terrible experience with CIU.  Everyone turned their back on me when support was needed most.  Was treated as a complete outcast.  Should be expected from a legalistic school led by Pharisees.
College Student,1,"I was hesitant to say that CIU's athletics are the worst, but it's true. There is little to no support. Fewer fans of either team attend the basketball games than the number of students for the away team in high school. They need to make sports a bigger deal, and the facilities are pathetic for students and athletes alike."
College Freshman,1,Not a lot of fields to choose from
College Senior,1,Columbia is a terrible city when it comes to public transportation. It would be difficult for a student to come here without a vehicle.

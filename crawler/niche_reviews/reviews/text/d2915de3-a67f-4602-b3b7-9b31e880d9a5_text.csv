Sophomore,5,"Although Kutztown University is mainly an in-person university, I have really enjoyed the couple of online classes I have taken with them. Teachers were very accommodating for the different schedules students may have as a result were very flexible. They also did a good job of providing the learning content in a way that was understandable easy to navigate. I would suggest taking at least some classes online if you are a Kutztown student, especially anyone with a job or busy schedule."
Senior,5,"Wonderful institution. Classes challenge you to think about the world around you and critically analyze aspects of your field. Staff and faculty are almost invariably friendly and approachable. Library provides a lot of research/support services while keeping a homey small-town feel. Love the fact that they have a resource center for LGBTQ+ students. Large weekend party scene with fraternity, off-campus apartment, and bar options. Biggest complaint is that the university has cut student success and library staffing since I have started as a student, despite instituting a student success fee. Also safety score is lowered due to ""Hawkinson's Folly"" in reopening campus during COVID."
Junior,5,Kutztown is a great school overall but could use more diversity in the student body as well as professors. I think my learning experience has been pretty good so far though and I can't complain.
Niche User,5,As a freshman student athlete excelled on the 3.60 Dean's List.  Professors always available all day and night. They had genuine care and concern about you excelling and doing your best.  It wasn't easy but with hard work excelled. Kutztown coaches have a long time bond and look after other students athletes.
Niche User,5,"My daughter attended as an out of state minority student athlete. The professors were always available and had a tremendous amount of professionalism and patience. The dorm, dining and facilities were top notch. The office staff and even the police and towns people look after the students. My daughter was very safe and I love visiting her at Kutztown. She also excelled academically and felt very safe."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school. The campus is beautiful, the food is great, the professors are even greater, I could go on and on. I feel like I'm getting a really good education from this college. The town surrounding the college is very laid back and there are a lot of local restaurants that serve the best food around."
Freshman,5,It was very easy to walk through. I felt like learning online was similar to learning in the classroom.
Freshman,5,I was able to mold in with other students and staff. Everyone seems to be so friendly and I have stepped out my comfort zone
Freshman,5,"I don't take online classes at KU. However, do to covid the online experience for freshman have been amazing. There is a zoom every Wednesday to help incoming students ask questions and learn everything we need to. They constantly go on Instagram live to do the same. They have gone over and beyond with everything they could to help kids while staying quarantined."
Freshman,5,"My favorite thing about Kutztown so far is that you never feel alone. You got a question or need help? There is no one in the whole place that isn't willing to help you become the best version of you, you can be. You're safe and cared about and that is something you really need when your growing in life."
Sophomore,5,Deciding to become a golden bear was the best decision i’ve made. Kutztown has a beautiful campus and amazing people. My favorite place is the DMZ!
Sophomore,5,I really enjoyed the whole college atmosphere. Its really a once in a lifetime thing. I would recommend Kutztown University to everyone.
Sophomore,5,"I took all of my five classes online due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was a little rough at first, but with the professors help and dedication, everything smoothed out as the semester continued. Hats off to the professors and everyone involved."
Senior,5,It went well and professors were helpful. Most of my were lenient with extensions. Many were accommodating to things going outside the classroom.
Junior,5,I took online classes during the COVID-19. It was very easy to learn and my professors were very understanding. I loved it! I love in person classes the most! I think networking is very easy and try to get yourself involved as many clubs as possible!
Junior,5,I liked that the students were so nice. I met some of my best friends my first week of college. I had trouble paying for school due to some personal financial reasons. Kutztown was very understanding and tried to help me to the best of their ability. I love Kutztown. Everything about it! When I had to go home during breaks I cried because I didn’t not want to leave!
Freshman,5,"My mom went here so naturally I felt like I  gravitated to Kutztown University. It was the only college I applied to because it was the only one I wanted to go to. I went to a summer program that completely solidified my commitment and I knew i just had to go here. It’s also 20 mins away from home, offers great programs for my major, and is right in the heart of Kutztown."
Junior,5,"I am a Junior at Kutztown University of Pennsylvania. I love The classes, professors, faculty and food! Its a beautiful area with lots of surrounding land. I love all the programs that they offer as well as an immense amount of clubs/ activities. It really gives you a chance to get involved. I love that they have a Starbucks on campus because I love coffee! Overall there was a diversity of classes. They were all really great especially marine science classes. I was able to ride in a boat for the first time and it was an awesome experience! So far, my experience here has been amazing and have no complaints!"
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful. The whole town surrounding is there for the campus and loves it. The town and surrounding areas support the students and make it very welcoming. The new dorms are gorgeous. And the new dorms look stunning next to the new lacrosse/soccer field. The campus has an adorable food court which is welcoming and makes the students want to stay for hours. Overall, Kutztown makes you feel at home from the welcoming professors, welcoming community, beautiful campus, and huge dorms. I would recommend this college to anyone who wants to feel like they're at home but can still have a college experience."
Freshman,5,I like the experience of meeting new people and connecting with others. I enjoy the academic classes and gaining knowledge of new things in my major. I enjoy the welcoming of the instructors and also the people who I meet.
Freshman,5,"Kutztown university is great campus and safe place to be for college students to attend. In my personal expeirence with the campus I have seen and expeirenced the military friendly campus and staff on a daily basis. The university takes pride in its kindness to military veterans and active duty members by having programs like ""i got your six"" where they teach the professors on the best ways to work with and help our countries hero's. Which in my opinion is a huge step for our nations colleges."
Senior,5,"My experience at KU was amazing. This was the most welcoming college I felt comfortable returning to. The students had a confident attitude towards anyone who entered the campus. It was calm and well organized. I saw a diverse culture that made me fall in love even more. Things I like most about KU is the amount of academic opportunities they offer. This includes free tutoring, access to computers/laptops in the library, and most importantly a safe environment that includes emergency phones. There is all around campus transportation that will take you to and from classes at any time. Lastly, the 24 hour dining hall is convenient for students who work/study late. I also love the athletic facilities, as an athlete myself, this is very important to me. This University has inspired me to take a chance and go through with my decision. It was like meeting a new family, who are caring, kind, and loving. For a change, I would like to see more ethnic food for example, Spanish cuisine."
Junior,5,I love Kutztown’s environment and how close you get with other students. I grew up in a little town with a small high school. Coming to college was very intimidating because of meeting so many knew people and interacting with them. I am on the softball team which gave me a little breathing room with making friends. I love the scenery of walking up/ down Main Street. You find your closes friends here and wouldn’t want to change schools if I had the choice.
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Kutztown.  I have had a great experience my first semester.  I met a lot of great friends.  I even made a great friendship with exchange students from the Netherlands.  I find the food to be very good on campus. I love the 24 your availability.   The campus is beautiful and look forward to my next 3 years at Kutztown.
Freshman,5,"I have applied and been accepted into Kutztown University and am attending this Fall. The campus, dorms, and food are amazing and the academics are well organized and customizable. I cant not wait to become a Golden Bear."
Junior,5,I love kutztown. The professors are all amazing and the library is so great. They also have lots of coffee places on campus and the 24 hour dining is awesome.
Niche User,5,"I was accepted to KU just a few days before i applied for this scholarship, i loved the atmosphere and the students energy. The professors were so lively and made you feel like you should be there. Overall it felt like home, i felt safe, happy and included. The entire day was filled with happiness."
Junior,5,Kutztown University is so beautiful. Everyone is so friendly. I appreciate all the resources that they provide for all the students. So thankful.
Junior,5,Kutztown is a great university! I have really found my home here from academics to so social life. Kutztown is the perfect size school where you are big enough to grow As a person but small enough where everyone Becomes a familiar face and welcoming!
Junior,5,"It's affordable, the teachers are amazing,  and the environment is beautiful. I have experienced so many things I never I will ever have and it's made me better than I thought I would become. This school helps you improve for the better and it's the school everyone should go to!!"
Junior,5,I couldn’t imagine going to any other school. Kutztown has given me so many opportunities socially and academically that I will forever be grateful for.
Senior,5,I absolutely love Kutztown. It’s a fantastic school with fantastic professors and I’m so glad I made the decision to commit four years ago.
Senior,5,It’s my home away from home. I have spent my 4 years here at kutztown and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I have made long lasting relationships with friends that will last a life time. I also have built lasting relationships with professors that have played a huge role in my life and will continue to make an impact on me after I graduate.
Alum,5,"Kutztown was amazing! The campus was beautiful, and the faculty and staff were so lovely. My experience was so good here, I considered returning for a masters! I have no complaints about this school, and couldn’t think of one if I tried!"
Senior,5,An amazing Experience in an amazing town. I learned a lot and met a lot of great people! I went to high school local to the area and didn’t even know about everything kutztown was about. The food is also amazing!
Senior,5,"I like the atmosphere of Kutztown. All the dorms are near each other and after class gets over with, every one is next to each other having a good time and also I love the layout of Kutztown. The best school I could ask for!"
Graduate Student,5,"There is nothing quite like being a GOLDEN BEAR. As someone who had no interest in leaving my comfort zone, this place has helped me grow personally, and professionally. The faculty, staff, administration has gone above and beyond to ensure I have a strong experience. I was able to seek out many leadership opportunities, and was even able to secure a graduate assistantship before I graduated undergrad that provides me a stipend, and a full tuition waiver. This place.... words do it no justice. This is more than an institution, it's a home away from home."
Freshman,5,I love KU! I always feel like I can be myself. Also I am receiving great education and meeting so many great people! I totally recommend coming to Kutztown. It truly is an amazing place. It's good to be golden!
Freshman,5,Kutztown provided a summer program for students that may have had a hard time adjusting to college. After attending the program I feel very comfortable with college. Also they have an abundance of resources for student success.
Sophomore,5,"The academics are very good. Diversity is high. Athletics are fairly successful. Most of the professors are super friendly, intelligent, and just want to see you succeed. Dorms are well kept and comfortable. Safety is okay as there are many blue emergency buttons. You get a lot for what you pay for at KU. The campus is absolutely beautiful. The town outside of campus is a wonderful place to walk around and grab a bite to eat. The campus food in the two dining halls is pretty good. The student life is great as they have over 250 clubs, so there's something for everyone! Highly recommended. It is my favorite home away from home."
Sophomore,5,Kutztown is the perfect size campus.  You are able to walk all over campus and feel safe.  The amount of friends that I made the first year was surprising.  There are clubs and groups that allow everyone to fit in and feel comfortable.  I would like to see more student involvment at sporting events.
Freshman,5,"Very much felt like home. I was anxious to start college in an area new to me, but Kutztown made me feel like I wasn't really leaving my town."
Sophomore,5,"I love Kutztown University! My freshman year went very well, and I'm excited for my sophomore year! Kutztown offers a variety of clubs, sports, and organizations to to make getting involved on campus easy. The professors I've had so far truly care about the students and are willing to assist them in any way they can. If you'd prefer a college that offers mostly small class sizes, the opportunity to build beneficial relationships with your professors, and a friendly community of students on a beautiful campus, Kutztown University is the place for you! The only critique I have is that it is centered in a very small town, and outside of that town is a lot farmland. So if you'd prefer going to a college in a big town or city, you might want to rethink coming here. Otherwise, I have no complaints about this university!"
Niche User,5,I toured the Kutztown University this summer as a possible incoming freshman. I really liked the campus and the faculties. The surrounding area is also great. I liked the rural setting with downtown Kutztown still being close by. I could definitely see myself as a student at Kutztown University.
Senior,5,"When I first came to college I was one of those people who was really afraid but didn't want to admit it. On the very first day I met people who would change my life forever. Some of those people are still in my life and some aren't but they all helped me grow into the person I am today. I learned how to stand up for myself, learned what true friendship was and found my voice. I went from someone who had maybe three friends in high school to being the vice president of my social work organization, a safe space advocate, a cheerleader,  a phi sigma sigma member and a Kutztown strong member. I used to not care about school at all and now I am apart of the phi alpha honors society. Now, being at Kutztown is not all sunshine and rainbows. College is hard. Growing up is hard. This place made even the hard times worth it in the end."
Sophomore,5,"College is one of the scariest things a person has to adapt to. Especially if you’re dorming and moving away from home. I was terrified when I started, but Kutztown provides such an amazing and welcoming environment. I joined a club called Actors Creating Theatre and I was able to continue my passion for theatre in a loving atmosphere. I’ve made life long friends here in just two short years."
Junior,5,It's super welcoming and accepting for all people. The Allies program is great and my major is super supportive to all.
Junior,5,"My absolute favorite thing about Kutztown is the helpful staff in every department! It doesn’t matter how complicated a question is, they will always give you a satisfactory answer."
Freshman,5,"I love going to Kutztown University. Between the awesome environment, great academics, and nice people it is the perfect place for me and many others."
Niche User,5,"I liked that there are plenty of open available spaces to go when you need to study. for example, in the library, there is more than one floor and they divide it into sections where yous study alone or with a group but everyone is happy with the space they have. Also, I love the cafe ahs many options when choosing your meal. I love to be able to have a choice of what I can eat for that day"
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Kutztown University. The campus is beautiful and has tremendous amounts of space for activities. The dining halls are above average for a college campus.
Freshman,5,"I love it here. I applied when I was a senior and it was very easy to get in! The professors are very sweet and caring and  I made a lot of friends here. The classes are very challenging but that's a good thing. It makes you study and want to do well in each class. There are many things to do on the weekend besides party! Like adventure, go out to eat, go to the mall, etc. Personally this is my favorite school and I wouldn't have wanted to go anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,The campus is very nice. 24 hour dining hall is a big plus. Great programs for academic support and very helpful when you need it.
Sophomore,5,"Kutztown is the perfect small town- the downtown is adorable. Its between Reading and Allentown so you're never far from doing something (bring a car/make a friend with a car). There's tons of places to get food- Tommy Boy's is a favorite for pizza. There's an on campus movie theater and the one downtown is $5. Kutztown also has $10 bus trips to NYC, Philly and other cities. Events go on all the time ranging from pet therapy to Karaoke. 
There are numerous clubs on campus- You have to get involved somehow. Don't be the kid who mopes in his/her room all day. Get out, speak up and make friends- no one else will do it for you- you gotta make the first move. There are also numerous jobs on campus ranging from the dining hall to residence life.
As a freshman you will be assigned to a traditional dorm. You want to live in a traditional dorm- you'll meet more people, save money and make a ton of experiences. No A/C bring a fan. Communal bathrooms are fine- there are single toilets/showers."
Alum,5,"I attended Kutztown University as a nontraditional, adult student.  I would have liked to have more options with evening classes, however the professors were extremely accommodating.  Two professors gave me individual instruction courses to ensure I met my degree requirements.  Thumbs up!"
Freshman,5,"So far I've been loving attending this University. The professors are kind, and as I am a music major, the music program is absolutely amazing!"
Niche User,5,I love Kutztown University!! The college is not too big and all of the classroom building are on one side of the campus and dorms are on the other side. I visited  Kutztown many time because my sister go there. The have great food at the cafeteria and have a lot of event throughout the year.
Niche User,5,"Out of the 6 colleges I have visited in the last few months, I felt the most at home at Kutztown University. Since August, I have visited twice for a campus tour and an open house. Everyone was so helpful and enthusiastic."
Freshman,5,My experience as I entered my first semester as a freshman in college has been wonderful. Kutztown is a diverse campus filled with amazing people. This college welcomed me with open arms!
Junior,5,"I transferred to Kutztown University from my local community college. I have loved the decision completely. I feel as though I am getting a far better educational experience at KU than I would have received at home. I live on campus, as my home is over an hour away. I have a just a few issues with the housing, but even those issues can't change my mind that KU was the best educational decision of my life."
Sophomore,4,"In my experience, Kutztown University offers lots of great classes and opportunities for its students in my time there so far. I have really enjoyed being part of the business department because of the excellent teachers and tutoring they provide. I also know they have an excellent art and music department for anyone interested in either of those majors. Plenty of opportunities are offered regardless of your major such as internships, personal career counseling, and mentoring. It's also a very affordable option for people looking to go to college on a budget. Diversity on campus is pretty broad as well with a good mixture of races and backgrounds for both professors and students. The only drawback for the school in my opinion is the surrounding area which doesn't have much going on. But activities within the school such as intramural sports and clubs more then makes up for it. I would suggest Kutztown University to any high schooler unsure of where they want to go."
Junior,4,My online experience was okay and could have been better for some classes. Some professors used the class time and some didn't (some held zoom classes while others just sent notes and left it at that.)
Sophomore,4,My first online experience with Kutztown was due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The transition was rough at first but I eased into it and my professors helped me a lot too.
Junior,4,"The atmosphere on campus is invigorating. The professors support and cultivate students, which allows us to excel. The campus offers space to study and hang with friends. The resources are sufficient as well. The administration could be slightly more cohesive, but other than that, I would not change anything about the school. It takes days to receive responses from personnel and I have had trouble getting in contact with administration on one occasion."
Junior,4,"Personally, I had a great online experience this past semester because I have taken online courses prior to colleges switching online. My campus and my professors were all proactive in communicating with the student body as well as converting curriculum to an online learning environment. I feel like I still learned everything on the syllabi and I gained valuable skills."
Freshman,4,I have friends who took online courses. They told me how much easier it was considering they could do it on their own time. The teachers also make themselves available. I was online for the remainder of the Covid pandemic causing the schools to shut down. The teachers made it work and are always willing to work with their students.
Freshman,4,"It’s a good college with good students. The few downsides are minor, such as the food choices being very unhealthy, or the dorms having mold in the vents that are only on in the winter. The students are friendly though, and the teachers as well. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate."
Senior,4,Pretty good. Some of my friends had issues with the professors and the dorms. I didn't really have an issue. I enjoyed walking around campus when I had free time. The fountains and art are nice. The rec center is also worth going to visit.
Junior,4,"The Spring 2020 semester was my first semester attending Kutztown University. The time I spent on campus was extremely enjoyable and I look forward to going back to campus when this pandemic is over. 
The professors I have are extremely willing to help me and make time to answer my questions if necessary. The other faculty is very helpful. The application process was extremely easy with the help of the admissions office. What is great about Kutztown is that everyone, including professors, faculty, and students, are all willing to help each other out because we are all aiming for success in college."
Freshman,4,"So far my first year at Kutztown has been great! Even with the current situation of Covid-19 my professors have all done a decent job with such a quick and drastic change. I love the campus, its so pretty no matter what season it is. When I first toured here years ago I knew that I could call this place my second home. I would really recommend Kutztown to anyone looking for a wonderful University!"
Freshman,4,Kutztown is a very diverse and home feeling place. I love just walking on campus and seeing friendly people and always seeing someone i can ask for help when needed. KU has been a very positive experience for me.
Sophomore,4,"I  am a current transfer Sophomore at Kutztown University. As my first semester came to an end, I  was very pleased with my decision to transfer into Kutztown to continue my education. The affordability does not allow this campus to fall short on opportunities, financial aid, academic resources etc."
Junior,4,the campus is very nice and clean.  They also provide great professors who know what they are teaching as well as make time to go over stuff that the student may not be understanding. the people at the campus are all nice as well be it the students or the staff such as the Starbucks barista I haven't meet anyone who was rude to me. the only thing I would like to change is to have less online courses
Freshman,4,"Kutztown university has a beautiful campus, filled with a very diverse student population. We have successful sports teams, great teachers and an amazing student population. I Have been loving my time here at Kutztown."
Junior,4,The University is very welcoming to all types of students and there are many ways for you to get involved with peers. The campus atmosphere is very friendly and professors are always eager to help when you need it.
Freshman,4,"I love my professors, my on-campus job, my classes, and my advisors! Great academic experience! The dorms are clean and nice. There are plenty of on-campus activities and clubs to be apart of. Making friends here is super easy!"
Junior,4,"I like that there are a lot of opportunities to expand your social network and learn from caring professors. There are clubs/organizations for all kinds of different interests you might have; there is a club for every one. The community in Kutztown is very caring. I have met a lot of nice people who I will be friends with for life. The campus is beautiful and continually gets awards for being recognized as one of the more beautiful state campuses in Pennsylvania. The local area is full of beautiful landscape and and natural scenery; I would recommend Kutztown for any one who loves nature. If I could change anything it would probably be most of the dorms; I believe only about two or three of the dorms on campus have air conditioning. Also, the party scene can be somewhat dry unless you join a fraternity or sorority because their parties are usually very exclusive."
Sophomore,4,"I love how beautiful the campus is. The professors always make time for the students and they are always willing to help them. The food is wonderful, with many options to choose from. There is always a lot of fun options for students to do in their downtime."
Junior,4,"No one from Kutztown University is like everyone is back home. I like the fact that there is a variety of people you can meet and that all are willing to have a conversation with you, even if you are different. What I think needs changing is the way a student's voice is heard in the offices run on campus. There are committees with student positions, but the students picked usually have low initiative to go to meetings and thus there is no student mind.  Also, the food is okay, there's some variety, but you can only eat so many chicken nuggets before they taste like nothing."
Sophomore,4,"What I like most about kutztown is the campus. It’s a big campus and truly gives off the feeling of a college atmosphere. During the warmer months, the campus thrives with students having picnics or playing sports outside. There are also many programs and ways students can get involved around campus. Kutztown offers many jobs and internships for students. While some freshman dorms are outdated, many of the dorms and apartments are newly furnished and modern."
Sophomore,4,"Kutztown feels like my second home. I was very nervous to be starting out somewhere completely different, but coming to Kutztown makes me feel right at home! I loved all of my classes thus far, and for the most part my professors have been great. The campus is beautiful as well! I look forward to the next semester starting and can’t wait to meet new people and make new friends."
Junior,4,"excellent food options, recently updated dorm rooms, caring professors, beautiful campus, many on-campus social activities. 
more university scholarship options needed. rather expensive cost-of-attendance versus rate of return (projected income for recent graduates)
university offices (housing, financial aid) do not reply to questions in a timely manner. 
Off-campus housing options close to campus are almost as expensive as living on-campus."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Kutztown University is very good because of the on campus student opportunities and events. Also, the professors are very knowledgeable and the classes are excellent. Other than the beautiful campus, the food is actually pretty good for a college. The dorms are average."
Sophomore,4,I do absolutely love the campus I think it is gorgeous whether it be covered in snow or brightly colored fall leaves. One thing that I absolutely hated was that they implemented a new rule for sophomores this upcoming year(2019-2020). You are forced to stay on campus for 2 years instead of just 1 year. Paying way more than I would off campus with 2x more people in one apartment.
Junior,4,"Kutztown University is a very beautiful campus. With a diverse student body, everyone finds their place here. The athletics here are very competitive and fun to watch and cheer on classmates/teammates."
Freshman,4,"Kutztown isn't much on the weekends as most go home, but overall, it's a traditional college experience."
Alum,4,"Kutztown University was a great place to be! I enjoyed 4 years there and don't have many complaints. My one complaint would be that administration can be disorganized and the website often had wrong information. Often times letters were sent out with incorrect dates, etc... But I loved my time as a student there and made great memories. Great food in town and campus food isn't horrible either (I had a meal plan for 4 years, even living off campus)."
Senior,4,"The question you should want to hear from a senior as a prospective student: Would you go to Kutztown University again, if you could do it over?

My answer: This university will give you what you put in, and much more. Take the opportunities from the start of freshman year, and you will have all the resources available to make your goals a reality. KU works hard to build the connections around the globe, to foster prosperity for its students. I myself was unsure of what my ambitions truly were, but found my passions at this university through it's inherent collaborative spirit. So again, I say to take advantage of the opportunity. Complete an internship, join a club/organization, form some relationships, study abroad, or do anything that catches your eye that will be offered to you from this great university. I will personally look back at KU, as the place where I found my ambitions, dove into course material, and made lifelong connections."
Freshman,4,"So far, I am really enjoying my time at Kutztown. The staff and professors are friendly and helpful. I've made great friends. The only problem I have the workload in my one class. The workload might be beneficial for time management purposes, but it can be stressful at times."
Junior,4,Overall have had a pretty good experience with Kutztown. Would like to see more changes in DSO. The advisors aren't very good at communicating what you need for academics.
Sophomore,4,"Small rural college, professors care about students and affordable. Won't close when it snows and roads are bad."
Freshman,4,"Kutztown is a great school. Professors are really generous and helpful, and all the faculty and staff are well respected. Good environment around the campus. A lot of student support and aid. Campus is really nice, people in the area are peaceful. So many fun things to do off campus, and on campus. Great sport teams and Fraternities."
Freshman,4,"Kutztown University allows it's students to have great success. However, you must put in the work to get there. Kutztown University provides the resources needed to succeed."
Freshman,4,"Kutztown is such an amazing school! The campus is kind of in the middle of nowhere so if you want a place with off campus activities other than sitting in a corn field, then this probably isn't the place for you. But if you like corn, great! There are still many fun and engaging on campus activities to take part in. Most classes have around 25 students in them so its not hard to get help from your professor when you feel lost. All the professors are so helpful and so willing to help you exceed in your work. The only thing that is slightly irritating is that our grading system does not let you see your current grades. You can only check them when the semester is over, which isn't really helpful. Of course, you could always set up an appointment with your professors to see how you are doing, but tat tends to be a struggle when you are dealing with many classes. Other than that, Kutztown is amazing! Go golden bears!"
Niche User,4,"I picked Kutztown for the small campus and being local to my home. Overall the school is great for someone who would be looking for those things. South helped when I was up late at night studying. But when it came to wanting to change my major kutztown didn’t have what I was looking for. Most people on campus are nice and welcoming. Bonner Hall has the friendliest staff by far. Although I decided to drop out I don’t regret my decision of committing to Kutztown. Beautiful campus, friendly community and lovely little town."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy how open the small college is with very supportive teachers and many resources that help the students succeed.
Junior,4,My current experience at KU is great. I admire the fact that they take their students needs into consideration. They also have many opportunities available. The staff works with you and wants to see you succeed. In my experience they have been helping me go study abroad which is one of my goals. KU has helped me look forward to my future.
Sophomore,4,"I've been at Kutztown since last year and it's been great ever since I got here. There are so many activities and communities to participate in, there's almost always something to do as well. The students and professors here are all so kind and accepting, nobody ever feels left out."
Sophomore,4,I have had a wonderful experience here at Kutztown University. I’ve met some of the greatest people here and have made life long memories. Somethings that could be changed around here is having a more affordable payment plan.
Junior,4,Kutztown University is placed in a very small area. It is a beautiful little place with not a lot of activities to do. I would like to see some more variety in the town as far as things to do. I do enjoy the campus it is very pretty in both the spring and fall. The classes are not too challenging but not too easy either. It is a perfect balance of school life and personal life. The professors are mostly nice and understanding. I have had a great experience at Kutztown University.
Junior,4,I made awesome friends.  Everyone at Kutztown University cares and supports each other.   What I would like to see changed is Kutztown to become more diverse.
Junior,4,"I like kutztown because it’s a very small town and kinda in the middle of nowhere which I like, very peaceful! They have a lot of festivals all year and the biggest one I think is the folk fest. Everyone you meet there is extremely nice and friendly. Their academics are also very good. Kutztown is and always will be a good time!"
Sophomore,4,All the professors are extremely helpful and there is help available 24/7 for students. On-campus living is amazing and the campus itself is beautiful.
Sophomore,4,"The education program at Kutztown is absolutely excellent! I honesty could not ask for any better way to prepare to be a future teacher. Along with education, Kutztown offers  wonderful music, business, and pre-med programs just to name a few. Some of the other wonderful parts of this school is the ability to get involved on campus and in the community. Kutztown University hosts the Eastern Spring Sectional for Special Olympics which is a wonderful opportunity to get involved, not to mention a tremendous resume builder. There are a great amount of clubs to join and many opportunities to start a club of your own. KU also has a great, involved, and close-knit greek life. There are so many wonderful things about this school and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to receive a top quality education with numerous opportunities to get involved."
Sophomore,4,I'm going back to Kutztown University this fall as a sophomore and I couldn't be any more excited. They have so many groups that students can be a part of that you couldn't possibly have any free time to waste. I am an art major and the Visual and Performing Arts college is absolutlet amazing; it's like a whole other family full of creative and happy minds.
Sophomore,4,"Campus is beautiful, gets a little dead during the winter season. However during the warmer months its fairly lively. Academics and professors are pretty good with a top rated computer science accelerated masters program which I am in."
Sophomore,4,My professors have been very helpful. There have been some bumps with advisement but once the dust settled I was able to meet with respectable advisers who want me to succeed.
Junior,4,"Such a welcoming school that's very close to home to attend! Everyone is friendly and the class sizes are small, which benefits the professor in engaging with their students and getting to know them on a personal level."
Freshman,4,"What I really enjoyed about Kutztown University of Pennsylvania is the environment that surrounds you. Kutztown University is a small college, which allows you to meet new people all the time. This also gives you the opportunity to get to know a lot of people on campus. The town of Kutztown also adds to the many perks of attending Kutztown University. The town is full of cute little shops so you are never bored on the weekends."
Freshman,4,"Everyone all the time us so friendly and nice, I have never had a single problem with anyone. The campus is so beautiful, it is never boring. No matter what time of year there is always something wonderful to look at."
Freshman,4,"Feels like home, course load is not more than high school loads. Atmosphere is homely, caring, and helpful. There are many resources on campuses for you to take advantage of. There are also a diverse amount of clubs and sports you can join."
Niche User,4,when I went there to visit the campus i really liked it and I fell in love with it immediately. I know that they have a great criminal justice program and that is what I am going for.
Sophomore,4,"The professors seem to genuinely care about students and want to help. Those in the History Department are especially friendly. Courses are fast paced, as are all universities so be prepared. Food could be better, although there is a ChickFilA on campus! Dorms could use some work in the cleanliness department as well."
Freshman,4,"Its a great college to get immersed into. The classes are easy when you put your mind to it, and you meet a lot of new people. Kutztown ensures that you can have new experiences in a safe environment. The art programs are wonderful as well. You get new opportunities to prove yourself as a great student."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Kutztown University and right now I am in my second semester. The professors are wonderful. They are passionate and want to help you and see you succeed. The campus is beautiful and I feel very safe walking around. I think both cafeterias are excellent and there are so many choices, including a sushi bar! I live on campus in Dixon Hall and it is extremely nice, the dorms are suite-style and the whole building is secure and airconditioned. My favorite part of the campus has to be the student recreation center. The fitness center is my absolute favorite place to go and it is packed with any machine that you could want. Also inside the rec center is an awesome rock wall, some courts, an indoor track and a smoothie bar! I spend most of my time here and I love having it just a walking distance away from my room. So far Kutztown has been great!"
Freshman,4,I love the layout of campus. Nothing is too far away from other buildings. The campus has a lot of nice features that make it enjoyable and pleasing to the eye. The programs are well organized. There's classes for every interest so students can find something they like. Resources are readily and conveniently accessible to everyone. The 24 hour dining is great for late night study session or midnight cravings. The shuttle is perfect when the weather is bad or if you need to be somewhere on time.
Freshman,4,"Kutztown University of Pennsylvania granted me the opportunity - and resources - to fully develop myself both academically and socially. The discipline, work ethic, and dedication required to utilize these opportunities and resources helped me build character, as well as overcome adversity."
Niche User,4,"It is affordable, thus enables me to study abroad. However, the Admissions Team is not very professional, or they just simply don't live up to my expectations. Instead of sending me 1 email full of questions, they would break into 2 or even 3, which is a bit annoying for me. Other than that, I have nothing to complain."
Freshman,4,"It is good! I which we'd have more options as far as the food is concerned, and everything in the campus store is so expensive! I wish there was a little more diversity, as well."
Sophomore,4,"Kutztown University is a quality school.  It is affordable, and provides students with many resources for achieving academic success.  The teachers are all amazing, and will do their best to help you make the most out of their classes.  There are also plenty of other services that can be utilized for help in class, such as tutoring and the writing center.  The campus is small, and there is not much around it, but the main street does have many stores and restaurants that are hidden gems.  The living arrangements are alright, not bad, but not amazing either.  Overall I would definitely recommend it."
Graduate Student,2,"Professors don't care, staff that directs you to another line that directs you back to the phone number you just called.I dont know about people in ither majors, but as a Cinema Major in kutztown I was actually really disappointed to find just how little the school has taught me upon graduation. In the past year I have learned easily 10x more major skill sets from youtube than i have in that of my 4 years at this school. They never taught anyone about frame rates or shooting in 4k or 1080p or how / when to do it, they implemented a ridiculous new rule for the equipment cage which basically makes it next to impossible to rent out equipment when you need it, and when i asked one of the kids why they made it so the only time available for renting in and out equipment is for 2 hours during the day he basically told me word for word that its because the kids who work there want to waste time on their phones and goof off with their friends because a normal 5 hour work day is ""too much"".."
Sophomore,2,"I only took online courses due to COVID-19. Only one of my professors met every time we were supposed to have class, while the others just gave us a list of items to get done by the end of the week. This was not beneficial for students who just got kicked out of, what they thought to be, their home for the next few months."
Niche User,2,"I have lived around the college for all of my life and nothing about it ever seemed appealing. The campus is subpar, the classrooms are not ideal, and only the food is good."
Senior,2,"Kutztown is a small town filled with great people. However, Kutztown has a lot of needs such as transportation, affordable living, food security, and mental health. It is a nice town but filled with college kids that can be cumbersome at points."
College Senior,2,Nearly nonexistent. Most of the social frats have a bad reputation.
College Freshman,2,"As a Hispanic, the times when I have been on campus I feel completely out of place. There is very little diversity on campus."
College Freshman,2,They don't call it Kushtown for nothing. The whole campus often reeks of weed.
College Freshman,2,I would describe Kutztown University as the epitome of mediocre. It's not the worst but it's certainly not the best either.
College Freshman,2,Students w/disabilities will struggle here.
College Freshman,2,"I'm rating the college I'm currently transferring from. I am excited about going to the one I have listed next semester, but my experience at my current school has been bad. You can never get a feel for the social aspect from a tour or a website. I wish I talked to people at my school or spent a weekend there. I didn't put enough thought into my decision and although the academics are good. You can't stay motivated if you aren't enjoying yourself."
College Sophomore,2,I might have chosen a different school had I tried the food here before august
College Freshman,2,The things that should matter the most seemed to be overlooked in University Place if a staff was breaking the rules but very serious if it was not staff...
College Freshman,2,"It was so confusing and awful, I had to call the school and email them weekly about the process. Such a nightmare that I dred each year but I know it's worth it for the money."
College Freshman,2,The school tends to be more concerned about whether kids are sitting around getting high and not hurting anyone than whether or not a woman is being sexually-assaulted in South Golden Bear Apartments.
College Freshman,2,I still owe 4000 dollars for my semester and have no idea how to get it because I've tried everything. That's why I'm applying for instant scholarships!
College Freshman,2,"I absolutely cannot stand upstairs or downstairs South Dining Hall. I feel like I'm wasting my meal plan because the only thing I will use it for is to eat Chic-Fil-A twice a week, which I know is unhealthy. Otherwise, I just burn up my flex buying things to eat at the P.O.D. market."
College Junior,2,A lot of my friends regret living off campus.
College Junior,2,I unfortunately have not received financial aid yet.
College Junior,2,"Housing is such a gamble. I love living on campus, but being able to to live in my own place would be nice. I sare an apartment style dorm with four other guys, and I was one of the ones picked to share a room. I am a very quite person and I share a room with a very annoying guy. Everything he does gets under my skin. Word of advice, pick your own roommates."
College Freshman,2,"Do not eat at South, it's god awful. They do have really good options at the AF but then again its closed on weekends and doesn't serve dinner so your only (somewhat better) option is the SUB but that just has greasy chick-fil-a and burgers."
College Junior,2,"I am a vegetarian and there are two places in town that have quality, healthy food. As far as ethnic food, we have a sub-par China King and an over-priced sushi joint. However, the local brewery is delicious and nice for when parents visit."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Sketchy areas, run-down housing, and high costs kept me away."
College Junior,2,"Cheap, but the quality of the building is usually poor compared to other off campus housing such as places off campus in a University like Temple"
College Junior,2,"If you believe in eating healthier (More fruits/veggies): in town is not for you, campus options are a joke, there's a healthy cafe on the edge of town going East but has limited hours of operation, GIANT you can get them there fresh but hope your place has a kitchen.

What's in-town?  Typical, east coast, Italian or PA Dutch Style places which love to serve up dairy and meat.  That's why many people get sick on campus often, gain weight quick and seem to be in a brain fog most of the day here.  Is the quality of product at these places good tasting though?  That answer is HECK YES however."
College Freshman,2,"All of my gen. ed. professors treated us like numbers. No one took the time to get to know you personally. However, my major-specific professors made me feel right at home."
College Freshman,2,"Let's just say, I'm transferring for a reason. When I filled out the paperwork, many, many others were too."
College Sophomore,2,Policies are strict and public safety is annoying
College Sophomore,2,I have gotten multiple alerts of sexual assault in my inbox from kutztown
College Sophomore,2,I wish I could live somewhere where the staff wasn't always trying to get the residents in trouble or cause problems. Kutztown housing staff are like high schoolers always causing drama and talking about things that the residents do. Do your job and stay out of our business
College Sophomore,2,It was not that great of a school for me. I don't feel the academics are preparing me to be the best I can be in my career and I really think I can do much better and am transferring out for the sake of my future. The school is in the middle of nowhere and offers little opportunity to expand your horizons. I feel like I wasted an entire year of my life.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you like binge drinking in a dingy basement, there really isn't much of a nightlife. You have to be 21 to get into any of the bars on campus. Most of the places in town shut down in the evening. And many students opt to go home on the weekends, making it a ghost town. If you want some real fun, hop on a Bieber Bus to NYC, which is only about 2 hours away."
College Sophomore,2,"I was in the College of Business and it is a complete and utter joke. Most of the students are unmotivated to actually learn or do any of the work. During exam day, I was always surprised to see there were so many people in my classes because people never showed up! Professors were often rude and condescending, and often just handed out busy work. The freshman course load (except for Economics because the professors are horrendous and barely speak English) is a walk in the park. I helped run a club in the college of business and our advisors were almost non-existent; they NEVER once came to a single meeting or oversaw any of our activities. It made it difficult to really accomplish anything."
College Sophomore,2,"I attended some of the internship and job fairs and was not all that impressed with what they had to offer. It was mostly just small, local businesses that only offered you a limited experience."
College Sophomore,2,"Eh, the food off campus isn't really that great either. It's mostly a slew of the same style, hole in the wall restaurants that serve the same things. Everything is really cheap though and it's somewhat convenient. Mama's has great pizza and sandwiches and the Kutztown Tavern has some great food as well.  Whatever you do, stay far, far away from China King and Pink Taco!"
College Sophomore,2,I think public safety spends more time looking for parking violations than actually going after serious crimes.
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, there really is little to no diversity on this campus. Most of the student population comes from white, working class, families within the state of Pennsylvania, with many of them from local communities near Kutztown. You'll also run into the occasional student from New Jersey."
College Sophomore,2,I am not a fan of the current dining options. The main dining hall food is awful. The SUB food is very expensive and does not work well with a meal plan. Hopefully the new changes will be more beneficial towards dining. The best place is definitely the AF. I do not like that you can only use one swipe in a session and certain amounts in one day. Another thing I am not very fond of is that you are forced to get a 14 meal plan even if you do not use them all. I wasted so many meals and couldn't do anything about it
College Junior,2,"People are still divided like it's High School for the most part, the rich kids are hanging with the rich kids and the poor kids are hanging with the poor kids."
College Junior,2,There are a lot of reported rapes and even more unreported rapes.
College Junior,2,The rain and snow makes it difficult to stay accessible or to maneuver.
College Freshman,2,It's only bad for me because I'm a vegetarian and It's tough to find healthy alternatives to pizza when Mama's is the only place open past midnight.
College Freshman,2,"Kids get caught with drugs and alcohol all the time. Public safety patrols south campus on a daily, and probably hourly basis. Everyone does it, but most do get caught if they're on campus."
College Sophomore,2,It's a hit or miss with Kutztown. Some nights are so good you can't believed it happened. Some nights you just want to forget.
College Sophomore,2,The guys here are unfortunately not the best looking. If they are hot they will probably be players.
College Freshman,2,The campus shuttle can be convenient but it's known for being late. Kutztown is more rural area which I'd suggest a car to leave campus since there's no public transportation.
College Freshman,2,If you don't like living with a roommate during your first year it might be hard to adjust to living with someone.
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid department is always busy. It's hard to schedule appointments with them. Sometimes, it's best to have money set aside in case the aid doesn't work out. However, it's hard to plan for such a thing if you are expected some type of aid and usually the aid is never enough."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, I'd say Kutztown has organizations and clubs that have try to include diversity in any form. However, on campus it's about 80-90% the same beliefs, background, and diversity."
College Freshman,2,"I hate the snow, and Kutztown is a very snowy area. The ice is the worst when you're walking to class."
College Sophomore,2,I don't live on-campus just yet but you need to connect to wifi after entering a new building.. just connecting wouldn't be the problem but having to enter your username and password each time is rough
College Freshman,2,"The diversity on campus is very little in different race rather than white. The school is populated by that race. There is a Multi-Cultural Center near the campus dorm and people are welcome. However, white race doesn't go in and it not fair."
College Freshman,2,"I am not around to see it because I never drank or smoke before. However, I heard people get rape or shot out in party. Not too long ago, a girl got hit by a truck. It is really dangerous out in Noble Street. It is one of the biggest parties and most popular that people go to."
College Student,2,"Right now it's very cold, windy, snowing or snow on the ground.  Not a pleasant walk from the car to the buildings."
College Freshman,2,My english teacher didn't know what primary discourse or ethos meant
College Freshman,2,I still dont even know where the greek houses are located
College Freshman,2,The sports go relatively unnoticed and the rec center is small and awful
College Freshman,2,"The school is in the mountains, so it is either very hot or very cold."
College Freshman,2,"The food choices are all the same, and you get tired of the choices quickly."
Recent Alumnus,2,It's bad when it snows because the school does not close down classes when it should. There are many hills and commuters have gotten into accidents trying to get to classes because of the extreme weather conditions.
College Freshman,2,There's probably about 3% minority. I would not know about the other topics.
Freshman,1,This school is a waste of time and money. Do not come here if you actually want an education. The professors are rude and honestly do not tech at all. Spend your money somewhere else
Junior,1,"Attending Kutztown University was one of the worst choices I ever made. Academically, this University was a joke. Professors are highly unqualified and coursework is so easy it’s a joke. Kutztown has two dining halls and both are a joke. Kutztown’s 4 year graduation retention rate is 38%- thats a clear indication of the academic environment. Even worse, the 6 year retention rate is 56.4%.  If you want a return investment in your dipolma, Kutztown is not the place to go. Don’t waste your time and money on a dipolma that will not help you."
College Senior,1,"Terrible food, subpar housing, easy classes. Don't."
College Senior,1,You're better off commuting or renting just outside of town. KU housing is a substantial waste of money.
College Senior,1,"Classes are a joke. Food and dining halls are horrendous. Tuition seems reasonably priced at first glance, but they'll nickel and dime you for everything they possibly can."
College Student,1,I am living on campus
College Freshman,1,I don't know much about off campus housing.
College Sophomore,1,So many drunks on the streets. I guess the parties must of been great for them but for a student who just wants to stay at home and ignore those people I find the parties to be an annoyance.
College Freshman,1,I only enjoyed my major- specific classes/ professors. My English and Sec. Ed. peeps. Everything else sucked.
College Freshman,1,"Class size for gen. eds. expect at least 150+ people to be in the same room as you. Expect for the professors not to know who you are and expect them not to care about your well-being as a whole. Some professors were hard to figure out in terms of note style/quiz-test style. My college algebra professor was the only one who took the time to get to know you and try to help you. These classes were all in auditorium style rooms with two large projectors. 

My program-specific classes were small roughly 20-30 people. The professors were incredibly nice and welcoming. By the third day, they knew my name and asked how I was. We developed close working relationships. They were always available and genuinely concerned about your progress as a freshman. These were all in typical classrooms with personal desks and only one projector."
College Sophomore,1,"Kutztown University's dining is absolutely horrendous! If you're an incoming student, be prepared to stock up on microwavable food and spend some extra money on groceries/take out because I guarantee you will be fed up with the campus dining within a week. The South Dining Hall takes the cake for the most disgusting food on campus. The upstairs buffet is pretty bad. Many of the options are deep fried, bland, and just flat out unhealthy. The food at the salad bar is old and spoiled. The homestyle options are somewhat healthier but again, taste really, REALLY bland. The downstairs food court is all fattening, deep fried, unhealthy options too. Here's another kicker; you get soda for free with your meals downstairs, but get charged an extra dollar on flex if you want a bottle of water. The best food on campus is in the Academic Forum building, but be prepared to spend a ton of money on flex. They have great wraps and salads and even though the starbucks isn't real, it still beats Java City's coffee by a long shot. Then there's the Cub Cafe in the SUB Building, but it's mostly more deep fried, overpriced, unhealthy options. I would recommend Mexican on Main though; they have a good Taco Salad. Just don't get the guac because it's not fresh and very bland. As far as meal plans go, don't get any of the premium meal plans. You can only use your meal swipes as a designated time of day. Get a block meal plan to avoid that. And also be prepared to get bored with the lack of food options very quickly. There really isn't much variety; you'll quickly find that you can get the same things everywhere. There's a Giant within walking distance of the school. I would recommend going there for your food."
College Sophomore,1,Kutztown is surrounded by farms! In the summer time the campus reeks or manure!
College Sophomore,1,"I seem to have issues with Financial Aid at every school. I have 6 little brothers, a single mom, and my EFC is always 0 yet it seems impossible to get grants or aid!!!"
College Junior,1,Complete ripoff if you do the math of the meal plans
College Freshman,1,It was a process that took entirely too long to accomplish
College Freshman,1,Absolutely dreadful. High school parties are better than KU parties
College Freshman,1,"The food is really bad it isn't anything I would pay money for, but I have to because meal plans were mandatory."
College Freshman,1,The weather makes walking to class a struggle because classes are all the way across campus depending on which classes you have. Also depending on which dorm you live in the weather makes walking to the dining hall inconvenient.
College Freshman,1,The parking lot for students is far from both the dorms and the academic buildings. 
College Sophomore,1,The parking cop are the worst people ever created and take their job very seriously.
College Senior,1,To park on campus you need a parking pass which is pretty expensive. After you purchase it you notice that it's miles away from where your classes are located. The later you arrive the lesser of a chance to find parking at all.
College Sophomore,1,"The places are good, if you get there on time before everything is gone.  Also, could use more variety of food."
College Senior,1,The school is unfair to the cultural side of people.
College Senior,1,"Parking is awful at Kutztown University. I would never give it a passing grade. There are more staff parking than needed. I would say it almost doubles in the number of staff members as there is for parking. Parking is a definite nightmare. If you have under a certain amount of credits you may only park in ""fair grounds"" which floods every time it rains and is about a mile from the farthest dorms. It also is $100.00 to park a year which is crazy since parking is so awful."
College Junior,1,It rained most of the fall and caused the parking area to flood
College Sophomore,1,The security is very strict on where you can park.
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife for students at Kutztown, in my opinion, is very boring. There isn't really anywhere to go unless you like the bar scene, which I do not. There is a movie theater that shows about 3 movies, there is a hookah bar that I do like, however there are barely any parties to go to. In order to have fun you have to have a nice set of friends that will be able to make and find fun things to do."
College Freshman,1,"People are always blazing up. Some people smoke weed right outside of their dorms, some at the fountain in the courtyard, and I can always smell it when walking past some dorms because people smoke it in their room with the window open. As for alcohol, that's also very prevalent here. Alot of people easily sneak alcohol into their rooms. I've had roommates that have done it a number of times."
College Freshman,1,All public safety does is ticket cars who are Parked in the wrong lots. Besides that they're worthless.
College Junior,1,"parking is very far from most housing. The no parking areas are not labeled very clearly, and when you need to pay a parking ticket, it is not a simple process"
College Freshman,1,"old outdated and beaten is the condition, your always hot or cold never comfortable and you cant find a nice bed anywhere"
College Junior,1,"There's Nothing to Do. Absolutely nothing here, it's the middle of corn fields. Hope you like corn and farm smell. That's all you've got to look forward to."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Very Good – The parking on campus is a bit nightmarish. The freshman parking lot is a bit of a walk from the dorms. The upperclassman parking isn't much better. Though it's closer to the dorms, many students end up having to park way in the back because of how packed the lots can get."
College Junior,1,You need to get there extremely early to get a good spot.
College Junior,1,"Lots of Commuters That Just Don't Care About There Looks. There is a large spectrum of looks but for the most part,  no one really dresses like they care."
College Junior,1,"Parking is so confusing at Kutztown, make sure you park in the right lot or you will get a $40 ticket, every hour on the hour, no exceptions. A decal is $50 at the beginning of the year and parking lots are a long walk away from the campus, especially if you are a freshman."
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid that I received wasn't what I expected. Due to my progress while I was in high school I was hoping to receive enough aid to cover my entire tuition, but instead, I ended up having to borrow money from a friend and paying whatever was left in cash. I have stopped by the school's financial aid office several times and I always seem to be sort of ignored or brainwashed with lies saying that they will review my financial aid package and see if they can provide any more help. 
I currently live with my mother, my two brothers, and my niece. My mother just recently got a job and is being paid less than minimum wage working at a kitchen in a deli store. One of my brothers works at a warehouse and the other was laid off. Since I am in college, I really cannot afford to get a job and try to do excellent academically, hoping to receive a scholarship, and at the same time work at a part-time job. This past fall I ended the semester with a 3.11 GPA and the help that I have received financially is invisible. I have even talked to the Director of the Financial Aid office and I feel as if they value other things more than what the students can produce. What good is it for a student to perform well at a University, but not afford it? I do not blame the staff for maybe  feeling bombarded with questions and stories from the majority of the students who need financial support, but I just don't get why  some of them seem to ignore or not listen carefully to some of the students concerns. I have learned a lot while in college, but I just don't know if I will be able to afford it now that the State Governor cut the fundings for higher education by 20%. I do not know whether to blame my school's financial aid office or Governor Tom Corbett. I just wonder what the next couple of years would bring to me."
College Junior,1,"Stranded Within the Campus Limits – So there really is nothing around Kutztown, so many many people go home on the weekends. The social atmosphere is that everyone who stays the weekedns parties and smokes weed on the fountain in the DMZ(the center on the residence halls). Additionally, the food service is horrible on the weekends, since they assume more people go home. Everything in Kutztown is within walking distance, and everything else is about a 15 minute drive away. As far as dorms are concerned, right now there are plans for a few of them to be redone. Johnson Hall is gross, and the dorms around it are all pretty old as well. Dixon Hall doesn't offer that much social interaction, it's kind of like a mental ward and no one is really in the hallways or common areas. The cost is also way too much for the quality of education. Most all of my classes were like the average level classes in my high school. My first semester I only had to write a handful of essays, and most of them weren't more than 2 pages. The tuition money is currently going towards renovating the residence halls and a $14 million addition to our performing arts building (note that theater majors were dropped last year....) and the building contractors all are surprisingly issuing stock to the Kutztown Administration. Financially this ""business"" is corrupt."
College Sophomore,1,"Not That Good – Your going to have to really be on top of things. Also, they dont really take the time to promote the scholarships"
College Sophomore,1,"In Kutztown University the weather is very diffrent when you come to the country it's cooler in the summer and very cold in the winter but where I""m from the city the weather is diffrent it's warmer in the city all the time."

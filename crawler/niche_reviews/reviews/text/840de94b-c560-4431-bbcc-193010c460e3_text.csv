Junior,5,"It's been great, the professors and staff have been extremely helpful! My advisor helped me figure out what I truly wanted to do as a career."
Freshman,5,I like a numerous of thins at ST. Thomas Aquinas college. The campus and class size being small was the first thing that stood out to me. Then the support and Professors were a bigger surprise because while attending community college the professor and support was low. So being at a college that supports you and have many resources for you to succeed is wonderful. I would change the dorms if I could because It’s fairly cold in my suite.
Niche User,5,My experience was really amazing!! The environment of the school really stuck with me and i was amazed by the community and coaches.
Graduate Student,5,The school of education is fantastic. The staff support you and make sure you are prepared for the world of teaching.
Freshman,5,Saint Thomas Aquinas professors really focus on the students and always have time for us. They work really well with student athletes. The people around in the sports department are all so supportive of one another and so are other students who are there for just academics and a college experience. It is nice being so close to the city it leads to job opportunity and more social experience and exposure.
Junior,5,I transferred to STAC after attending NJ community college.  STAC is in New York however less than five minute drive from my home.  I am a commuter.  I love the small class sizes and the personal feel with knowing all of my professors and them knowing me as well.  Everyone is so friendly.  So far there isn't much I would change.  I am very happy here and would encourage others to attend as my experience has been a fulfulling one.
College Sophomore,5,If you want to have a good time its pretty easy to go out and have some fun!
College Sophomore,5,hasn't been a problem from what I know of
Recent Alumnus,5,Experience was fantastic. Couldn't have asked for a better experience
Recent Alumnus,5,Teams are really winning a lot recently. It's great!
College Sophomore,5,"St. Thomas Aquinas College is inviting, engaging and full of opportunity. They offer a variety of programs in which they have some of the best resources for. I have to say for those who have negative reviews, then you are not making the best of it. Any college is what YOU make of it. STAC has given me the opportunity to not only grow in my program and my future career, but to grow as a person. I've had the opportunity to be involved in so many different aspects from clubs to career experiences, everything from student activities to campus ministry. STAC prides themselves on allowing you to be the BEST YOU EVER and they have certainly allowed for myself and many others to do that."
College Sophomore,5,I was a fairly competent student in high school and I received almost a full ride at St. Thomas
College Freshman,5,they give out scholarships easily 
College Senior,5,"I attended community college before coming to this school , my GPA 2.9 remained the same from high school.  The first semester here it change a to 3.2 I feel great about that and I'm proud to say that this school has encourage me to do more."
College Student,5,There is a mall nearby where you can get any kind of food you like.
Junior,4,"I transferred here from Georgia because got athletic and academic scholarships. The faculty stuff and coaches are great, I can definitely say that this is kind of college experience I was dreaming of. And it’s also really close to the city, so I enjoy my weekends there."
Junior,4,"So far my time spent at Saint Thomas Aquinas College has been great.  They have so much to offer, from Sports, clubs, academic help, a plethora of majors Including mine the not so well known Therapeutic Recreation.  Wonderful personable professors, online courses, on campus food options, lots of convenient parking, and a safe environment.  Some areas of the school are a little outdated, but my biggest issue is how some of the staff (business office, financial aide, sports coordinators, don't communicate very well, are rarely available, and don't seem to enjoy there job.  Small area of complaints but overall a wonderful school to earn a degree.  Im excited and proud to be a student and excited to graduate."
Junior,4,LOVE the professors! Haven’t had a professor I dislike yet. Each class is informative and the perfect small size. The campus itself is boring though they do try to make it fun I’ll give them that. The cafe hours are purely awful for student athletes away at games. And the food isn’t the best anyway. I spent way to much money eating out even with the meal plan :/
Freshman,4,For an incoming college student STAC is a very welcoming place. The students and staff all develop strong relationships along with kind encouragement. The campus is clean and safe with stores and other facilities near by.
Freshman,4,I love how St. Thomas made home away from home feel warm and cozy. The classes are very interactive and interesting. The people there are very welcoming and very interactive and life in New York keeps you socially interactive.
College Junior,4,The professors always go the extra mile for students and there's always something going on with campus activities
College Junior,4,Campus Safety is always present and the head of safety cares about the students
College Junior,4,Aquinas Village have dorms that are convenient and spacious
College Junior,4,"STAC is a small school with a community feel, where it feels like everyone is friendly and connected"
College Sophomore,4,I think this school does a good job to prepare you for the real world if you use the resources offered to you
College Sophomore,4,Being a student athlete I think my school has the best facilities that fit our school size.
College Sophomore,4,It's small and focuses on their athletes a lot which makes me feel important. The professors are great but my advisor does a terrible job getting me prepared for graduate school however there are other people that can help and are more knowledgable.
College Sophomore,4,"Both health and safety services are run by highly intelligent and caring officials who are concerned for the safety of all students physically and emotionally. Although they are often not respected by the students on campus, they do get their jobs done effectively and efficiently despite criticism."
College Sophomore,4,STAC has been preparing me for the real world since day one. The connections they have made with outside businesses and their alumni has created the utmost of opportunities for their current students. I am highly confident that when I graduate I will be hired fairly quickly and I truly believe that is because of the excellent reputation that STAC holds and the connections they have created over the years.
College Sophomore,4,"St. Thomas Aquinas College has so much to offer, it provides a welcoming atmosphere and provides so many opportunities for all students in all fields. Whether it's social life, academic life or financial assistance, STAC allows for success in all categories. I am proud to be a SPARTAN!"
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life on campus is not as many expect. Many believe that STAC doesn't have a Greek Life scene or that it is crap and not what they view as ""true"" greek life. The largest and most known is the Co-Ed Service Fraternity known as Alpha Phi Omega. They pride themselves on Leadership, Service and Friendship. It has become and integral part of the STAC community and is a great way to get involved."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics is a large part of the STAC community. Many STAC students are varsity sports players that are attending STAC on a partial or full athletic scholarship. STAC has a variety of sports teams, with several sports recently added including men's and women's field hockey and lacrosse. The facilities are some of the best around. A professional grade, multipurpose turf field for is used by the majority of sports on campus. STAC also has exclusive access to a minor league local baseball stadium for the Spartan Baseball team. STAC has also recently expanded their work out gym so that athletes and all students can have the best equipment and facilities. Not to mention the constant upkeep they do to the gym and athletic offices to ensure the best experience for the athletes and the coaching staff."
College Freshman,4,The school has opened amazing experiences for me and makes me feel at home.
College Sophomore,4,"its a small school, the lecture halls are small so its great to have that one on one connection with your professor. since the school is smaller it is easier to know where your classes are. overall the professors are excellent."
College Freshman,4,There are a variety of places to eat close to the college.
College Freshman,4,The Romano center has the best food
College Senior,4,Very nice area that is safe and has lots of things to do
College Senior,4,There are plenty of options and good places to dine off of campus
College Senior,4,Security and staff keep an eye out for any reckless behavior and makes sure everything is under control
College Senior,4,It's a small campus with plenty of security to keep students safe
College Sophomore,4,Its a great area just not for a college. Its more of an area to grow up in or to raise a family. The college life doesn't fit in here
College Freshman,4,"basically, theyre the whole point of going to the school "
College Senior,4,Well the old coach for. Basketball paid very little to the team and the potential players. He passed up some great players that could have put us on the map as a team. But overall the other Sports are what really carry the School. New Coach watch for the winners that's coming your way this year  don't sleep on them.
College Freshman,4,There is enough parking and the campus is small so it's all close.
College Freshman,4,"The honors program offers a full tuition scholarship, and there are a bunch of other scholarship programs."
College Senior,4,Overall I believe that the Academics at St. Thomas Aquinas College were exceptional. The staff was extremely knowledgeable in their areas of interest. Since St. Thomas Aquinas College is fairly small the professors know you by first name basis and are geared towards making sure that you truly understand the material. This assured that I truly understood the material in each of my classes. As a Biology major this was extremely important to me and allowed me to interact with my professors which is something I would not have been able to do at a larger university.
College Freshman,4,"The diversity at STAC is very present. It's great being able to make friends with so many different types of people, especially those form other states or countries. Most people get along very well with each which makes the experience of makign friends even better."
College Freshman,4,"As this is my freshman year, I haven't had much time on campus as upper classmen have had. However, I've never felt unsafe on campus. There's almost always other people or security walking around. Also, the school is very small so if you need security they can reach you quickly."
College Sophomore,4,STAC's business program is a great program. I am getting a great education from knowledgable professors and the experience is unforgettable
College Sophomore,4,The campus is pretty lots of places to hang out outside when it is sunny and nice weather
College Sophomore,4,There are all quaint places to hang out. they fit the school nicely
College Senior,4,"Highly Accredited Programs – I came to Saint Thomas Aquinas due to the physical therapy program they have to offer. Out of all the schools I was choosing between, STAC offered me the shortest program and was affiliated with a very well known school."
College Senior,4,"Drinking Is Most of Our Scene. The drug lifestyle is not seen too frequently on our campus. Our campus is mostly athletes, and for us, that is against NCAA regulations."
College Senior,4,"Sports Are What Make Us. Without sports, most kids that attend our school would be else where. Our school is mostly made up of kids attending college on a athletic scholarship."
College Senior,4,"Many Choices. Being that we are in relative distance to the mall, there are many choices of dining possibilities. Also, we are next to the border of jersey, and once in jersey, there is another wide variety of choices to eat, along with a close by shop rite."
Senior,2,"You get what you pay for. Doesn't teach real marketable skills. Too many fluff classes. Overpriced for what you get. For many it's the ""best"" option. No ones dream school."
Sophomore,2,"The only people who enjoyed this school were the commuter students which there were an extensive amount of and the student athletes. I studied communication arts while I was there, but I am transferring and I personally felt as if the professors and teachers did not put much effort into their classes"
College Freshman,2,Not what I expected from college at all. This is a very quiet college with tight security who do not let a lot go
College Sophomore,2,"The reason I'm here is purely financial. My grades got me a really good scholarship and the school is only a 20 minute drive from my home. My parents thought I should take advantage of it rather than go to the nearby community college. I wasn't really sure what I wanted at this point since the possibility of staying at a far away school was now out of the question so I just kind of did what my family was nudging me to do. Unfortunately I came to regret not thinking my decision through a little further considering the scholarship I got is only a good deal if I were to stay here all 4 years which I sincerely don't want to do. I hear nothing but good things about my school but it doesn't really feel like it's helping me on the path I want to follow. Right now I'm majoring in Biology which I hear is usually smarter than narrowing my focus to Marine Biology so soon, not like the college offers any marine biology courses anyway. Ultimately there's no reason for me to be paying the extra money since I basically have the same relationship with this school as I would the community college. Show up, go to class, leave and just bide your time until you can transfer. A nightmare of mine is to have to attend this school for the next 2 years. I'm embarking on a scholarship journey to try and pave an affordable path to a more promising school for someone like me such as Stony Brook. It's clearly my fault for not trying to connect with anyone or make any friends here but something is stopping me that i can't quite describe. The college is really small and you see the same few people all the time in the halls and in your maybe 18 person classes. I don't feel like I can blend in at this school and everyone here seems to think so too which is why some classes are awkward, dead, and silent. I'm not sure if I'm projecting my emotions on to others but it seems like no one knows why they're at this college, no one is happy to be at this college, and this college was no one's first choice."
College Sophomore,2,They don't promote it at all nor do they help you if you are looking to live off campus
College Sophomore,2,"It is to standard nothing that would really attract you, overall just average or below average"
College Sophomore,2,The palisades mall is in close proximity to the school for people who like to shop or go to the restaurants and bars. NYC is about 20 minutes south of the school and if one is willing to make the trip a whole new world of options is opened up. 
College Freshman,2,playing a sport is good but the school sucks 
College Sophomore,2,You can call a taxi to take you anywhere in the town but there arent many places to go. Its located in a very boring area of New York.
College Student,2,"It is great to have a car on campus as a freshman, however residents cannot park near their dorm when they are a freshman."
College Junior,2,"I did not receive much financial aid, after going through the process.  I think there needs to be a better way to determine the amount of aid I needed. I believe a personal interview is needed to make a determination."
College Sophomore,2,We are a D3 school. Sports are okay at best and gym facility has the bare minimum
College Freshman,2,There is no transportation at STAC because its too small of a school
College Freshman,2,"STAC Drug Usage – There has been mot too many counts of drug abuse or usage on the campus. One or two write ups I did in fact here about, but they were not very serious or along the lines of expulsion for the students."
College Freshman,2,Cookie Cutters – there seem to be a lot of people from the same areas (the bronx and rockland county) in this college. we have people of different ethnic background but you have to search and this is a catholic college so religion is basically assumed. However when there is a difference people are definitely accepting of this.
College Freshman,2,"Meat Grease and More Meat – Personally, I am a health conscious vegetarian and because of this there aren't many options for me. Other people seem to like the food so maybe it itsn't all that bad but more variety would be nice so people like e have something to work with."
Niche User,1,"College or prison? Here at stac, you often won't be able to tell the damn difference. Last week, I found a full-sized cockroach in my cereal at the dining hall. Yea, that's how it's done here at the Aquinas. My roommate and his dumb friends trashed our room. All the chairs were flipped, there was garbage everywhere, and a microwave was tossed out the window. Let's just say campus security wasn't havin it. Do not come here I'm serious don't come here whatever you do. Whenever you're having a bad day, just think to yourself: ""Hey it could be worse, I could be attending STAC."""
Freshman,1,"This school is cock robin. Last week, my dumb roommate threw my fridge out the window. To be honest, I wish I got kicked out, that's how bad the school is. It's in the middle of bumfuck nowhere and everyone is gone on the weekends. I would rather be doing anything else than attending this school. About 99.9% of the football team has a .0001 GPA. LISTEN TO ME OKAY, don't come here."
Freshman,1,"This school is cock robin. Last week, my dumb roommate threw my fridge out the window. Yea we live on the 4th floor so it was stupid. I hate this school so much, it’s in the middle of bumfuck nowhere and everyone leaves on the weekends. I would rather be doing literally anything else than attending this school. The athletics are terrible, as probably about 99.9% of the football team has a .0001 gpa. LISTEN TO ME OKAY, don’t come here."
Freshman,1,Stac is shit. Do not come here I'm so serious do not come here. It is not valid. The diversity is extraordinary but besides that campus life seems to be nonexistent. The cafe is open for brief moments of time and the food is atrocious. Some professors arent bad but history classes are not the move.
Niche User,1,"If I could I’d give it a zero. The cafe is open till 8 on weekdays, 7 on weekends so get ready to starve or be a big time spender on take out. If your one of the 55 people that stay on the weekends get ready to do nothing. The professors are a joke. No classes on fridays is a plus. The dorming situation is probably the only decent thing at the school."
College Sophomore,1,There is one co-ed fraternity that only does community service.
College Sophomore,1,"I would not choose to go here again because federal funding is minimal because it is a private college and they do not have an ecology program. Even though it is a ""science"" school it is more tailored to people who want to be doctors or physical therapists. "
College Sophomore,1,Only sport worth watching from this school is the baseball team.
College Freshman,1,There is very little Greek Life on campus that I know about
College Senior,1,"Greeks? What Greeks? Saint Thomas does not have a sorority. I have heard of one fraternity, but it is nothing like what you would expect it to be."
College Sophomore,1,"STAC's Lacking – STAC does not have many traits that make it unique. To me, it is still behind in the whole college scene and definitely needs to make improvements."

Niche User,5,"Every two years, students receive iPads and apple pens, which is so cool! The food at this college is amazing, not crappy like most colleges. The teachers are great with students, getting to know the kids in a small class, and helping everyone."
Senior,5,I love that its a small school that doesnt feel small! It feels like home and everyone is so welcoming. All of the faculty and staff are truly there to help you become an adult ready for the real world!
Freshman,5,Merrimack College has a campus that is home to a tightly knit community of people that are all working towards similar goals.
Freshman,5,"With remote learning this semester, my professors have been great. Half my classes met weekly over Zoom and the other half used things like discussion boards or posted their lectures."
Niche User,5,"It is a great school!!! When I first stepped on campus, I felt welcomed straight away and it was a good feeling!"
Sophomore,5,"I honestly love Merrimack. Being an International student, they made me feel right at home and helped me during the transition. The vibe on campus is definitely one that makes you want to come back as well as the parties are by far one of the best things on campus. We are a community and joining Austin Scholars was the best decision I have ever made!"
Freshman,5,I’m in my freshman year and recently we have had to move classes online due to the COVID-19 virus. During my first semester at Merrimack I had a great time and now that I’m home I greatly miss being at school.
Senior,5,I transferred to Merrimack my sophomore year and it is the best decision I have ever made. I made so many friends and have become so close with the faculty and staff. Everyone at Merrimack makes you feel at home and is always so supportive. Merrimack's close community and school spirit amongst its students is so great.
Freshman,5,"I love Merrimack College, it is my home away from home and I couldn't be in a better place. I made the right decision going here."
Niche User,5,"Merrimack faculty and staff really really care about students. The community has a real family feel. I also like that everything is open to everyone - like you don't have to be a business major to be Bloomberg certified and that being in theater shows and stuff isn't competitive. It's not in a city, but you can get to Boston if you want since there is a train a couple of miles away. I like the safe and town feel and the campus is beautiful. Lots of school spirit for home games especially hockey and basketball."
Freshman,5,"Overall I love the atmosphere along with all of the people here. There is always something to do here. The classes are small enough where you can gain a strong bond with your professor which i believe is an important feature. When it comes to education, you want to be able to have multiple resources and people to go to when you need it. I believe Merrimack College does a great job doing that here."
Alum,5,"I'm a graduate with a 2.33 GPA.  When I took the FSEE exam, I was near the top of the list in my area.  No doubt that I received a fantastic education despite the fact that I was a poor, intercity kid."
Sophomore,5,"No matter where you go on this campus you're met with a friendly face and a toothy smile. Whether you're here for athletics, academics, or the culture, you'll be able to find whatever you need on this campus."
Sophomore,5,"Merrimack College sets you up for success. The professors are dedicated to their subject, offering optimal learning and success. The classrooms are all up to date on today's technology advancement providing easy access to all work and study material. The campus is safe, beautiful, and the perfect size."
Sophomore,5,"Merrimack College is the best college in my opinion. I met my soul mate and Bestfriend in my first year,  if you're struggling they do absolutely everything the y can to help you succeed and maintain your goals. I love it."
Graduate Student,5,"Merrimack College is a hidden gem on the north shore of Massachusetts.  So much to offer students, fantastic athletics, and a beautiful campus to boot!!!"
Sophomore,5,I loved my first year at Merrimack. Professors are really working for the success of the students and prepare students well.
Freshman,5,"My favorite thing about Merrimack is how the whole community is like a family. Everyone is nice to each other and respectful. The professors are very caring and want the best for us, as they will offer extra office hours and time to talk if we need it! I truly loved my first year at Merrimack and would not change a thing about it!"
Freshman,5,"I love it here at Merrimack. I really enjoy how the campus is small and everything is easy to find. The community on campus is so nice and everyone is always happy. One thing that isn't the best is the dining hall, however there are tons of other options for dining."
Niche User,5,"Merrimack College is a very good college. To begin with the college is private and it is like its own community. They have everything I want t offer. What I want to do to further my education. Although Merrimack is less diverse than most colleges, it still focuses on all students regardless of their ethnic background, sexuality, etc."
Niche User,5,Love everything about being a warrior!!! The community is amazing and everyone is so friendly. The second I walked on campus they welcomed me to their home and gave me such an amazing greeting. I call Merrimack College my home away from home.
Niche User,5,love the small campus.  Small classes are a must.  This is a friendly campus and a tight knit community.  There is always some activity going on on campus.  Study groups are easy to find and always welcoming.
Niche User,5,"I am committed to Merrimack and I could not be more excited! I have toured the school many times and each time I felt right at home on campus. One thing that really attracted me to this school was the advanced Masters program. I would be in school for 5 years, 4 regular years plus an addition for my masters. I am going for psychology, and with most careers in psychology, you need a masters degree."
Niche User,5,"Gorgeous campus, great community-like feeling! athletic games are super fun to attend and the feeling you get on campus is unmatched compared to others I've been on. Buildings and sports facilities are newly updated and the food is diverse and allows you to make the good choice when you want to!"
Freshman,5,"I love Merrimack College. I applied to mostly all small to medium size schools and this place is my home away from home. Merrimack College has around 3,500 undergraduate students and is very tight knit. Class sizes are around 20 students so you get to know your professors really well. It is also in a perfect location. It is 30 minutes from Boston and the city has great internship opportunities for everyone. I highly recommend coming to Merrimack College."
Sophomore,5,I'm so thankful that I came to Merrimack. I'm very involved on campus and the people here are amazing. The community is one of a kind. I am a member of the women's rowing team and I love the sport here. I do a lot of service work in the local community and it is super fun. Merrimack has a strong community bond that sets it apart from the rest. I do wish that Merrimack would stay small and cozy because that is what I love most about Merrimack. Everyone here is a family and I cherish that.
Senior,5,"My experience with Merrimack has been amazing. I transferred here my sophomore year, and was welcomed with open arms. They made the transition as easy as possible, and really care about each student. The transformation on campus from when I first toured it is amazing, they are doing everything to expand. Class sizes are small, so you really have a chance to connect with professors and the other students."
Sophomore,5,Love it here! Transferred here this year and I wish I came here originally! Very big community school and everyone feels like family here. Cute and cozy campus with an amazing staff in every field.
Alum,5,Was a fantastic experience that provided a work/life/academic balance. The athletic department was invested into ensuring that all athletes were supported to ensure a successful graduation. The dorms/apartments were adequate but they definitely don’t facilitate an environment for a big party school.
Freshman,5,"Merrimack College is a second home to me. It is easy to consider it a close community, as everyone holds the door, is eager to greet you, and professors are very willing to connect with you. These are things that may be missed out on by students who go to other schools."
Senior,5,There are a lot of resources available on campus not only for academics but also to assist with your career or personal life. The teachers are creditable in their field and most are very helpful to students.
Junior,5,I love everything about Merrimack and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great education. The faculty is knowledgeable and everyone is so approachable which makes the biggest difference in an education
Alum,5,Merrimack is a small school with an amazingly tight-knit community. SO many supportive resources and always good fun on the weekends!
Junior,5,"I love all the professors I have had during my time at Merrimack. Each professor cares about their job and their students deeply. The food at college is not great and can be improved. The campus also could update some of the dorms, and create more room for diversity."
Sophomore,5,"My freshman year was a success! I am very fortunate  I chose  Merrimack College for my college education for many reasons .  To begin with, I loved my dorm and the  Monican building. I was lucky enough to get the only room on the floor that had a bathroom in the room!

My classes and schedule were great and they made it an easy transition into college.  I couldn’t say enough about all my professors. They are dedicated professionals that truly love to teach students and care about us  succeeding.  I was  pleasantly surprised that I really enjoy my religion class, and of course the professor made it interesting. 

I loved watching the football games, especially at their new amazing
football field!  I did field hockey as a club sport and played lots of  basketball  right outside my building . 

I made many friends that I look forward to seeing in the fall. Go Warriors!!!"
Junior,5,School is great.  Teachers will help you out. Housing process is annoying. Food sucks. Fairly cheap to attend. Great administration staff.
Freshman,5,"Merrimack College is an incredible educational institute. The college has an beautiful community aspect to it. From athlete to sorority girl to class president, everyone has a place. The school has numerous ways to be involved. The tight knit feel. Staff members know their students personally. There's no such thing as being a number at Merrimack. It's impossible to take five steps on campus without seeing a familiar face."
Senior,5,"Merrimack College is a small community where you see the same helpful and friendly faces everyday around campus. Merrimack actually allows students to voice their opinions and is constantly improving. Merrimack is where I have made close relationships with professors who have written me wonderful letters of recommendations, which helped me get into law school. I have also met wonderful life long friends here. Merrimack college has provided me with exceptional academic preparation for the real world and stresses the importance of internships and jobs. Merrimack will set you up with a paid internship to help further your career, as most jobs want experience upon hiring. Merrimack also allows you to join a variety of club and meet a diverse set of people. Merrimack is what you make of it, as we are constantly reminded to ""make it your Merrimack""!"
Senior,5,Ever since i transfer to Merrimack college i have felt welcomed and staff was very helpful in enrolling me into classes and making sure i stayed on track for graduation. Great school.
Niche User,5,"I loved the atmosphere of the campus and cannot wait to commit to this school and obtain a degree. I will be studying Biology to get my Bachelor's o Science to go on and become a dentist. This school is perfect for me, its student to teacher ratio is perfect. Also, the support students get from teachers and staff is outstanding and keeps students motivated and positive throughout their college experience."
Freshman,5,"Even though I have only been here a short amount of time, I can say that coming to Merrimack College is the best thing I have ever done. I think the people are some of the best I have ever met, everyone for the most part is respectful and very kind. The dorms I lucked out because I am in ash, I manages to get a suite. Others though I know are in forced triples and even quads, which sounds awful. Great parties. Great everything. I love my classes, I love everything about this school. Except maybe the food, but no college has good food."
Sophomore,5,"Love this school so much!!
amazing community
 never short on resources
 teachers are always willing and available to help
 small class sizes which were a must have for me, all in all, there is an extremely friendly environment here and all of the students have something that no one can explain but everyone shares. I will say if you do not have this indescribable treat you will not like the school.  Most if not all of the kids who attend say they knew it was the school for them as soon as they step foot on the beautiful campus so it is dentify a school that should be added to your college tour list."
Sophomore,5,"As a business major and athlete I've had a great time here so far. The school is currently expanding which has its pros and cons. Parties are pretty good, but being an athlete helps with that. The housing options are good, but there isn't enough for everyone on campus so some people have to go to the appartments across the street."
Niche User,5,"When you go to Merrimack, everyone is extremely friendly and they make you feel welcomed. There is a great sense of community and everyone seems happy to be there."
Freshman,5,I really like how merrimack feels like a second home to me. I always feel safe and comfortable. The only thing i would like to change is the fraternities/sororities.
College Sophomore,5,"I love almost everything about the school! It is like my second home and I can't see myself anywhere else!  The professors are so helpful and really want students to succeed, the facilities are awesome and plenty of helpful resources for everyone to access."
College Sophomore,5,Very supportive and the whole community comes together to put an end to sexual assault
College Sophomore,5,"Mostly a D2 school except for Hockey which is D1, it is very competitive and Merrimack does very well in each sport!"
College Senior,5,"The professors at this school really care about their students and devote lots of time to helping students in and out of classes. The classes are generally good, though there are still a few teachers who mean well, but are not the best. Class sizes are usually around 25, though as the courses get more major specific, that number goes down."
College Senior,5,"The police and RAs do a fantastic job at keeping the campus safe. Though petty crime does happen, it is infrequent and usually resolved quickly."
College Sophomore,5,"There are so many opportunities to get involved (take as many as you can!) and the people are incredible.  Classes are appropriate for your study, professors are engaged, passionate, and helpful when needed, and the size allows you to walk around campus always seeing people you know, but also bunches of students you still have yet to meet.  I cannot imagine myself anywhere else and am grateful I made the decision to attend MC!"
College Junior,5,"I love everything about this school. With great friends and great organizations to explore my talents, there is nothing that I don't love."
College Junior,5,"I am quite biased because I have never participated in the housing selection process. Even so, I love living on campus and have never had any issues with it."
College Junior,5,I am in Zeta Tau Alpha and have received a lot from it. I definitely appreciate all that it has to offer.
College Junior,5,Merrimack College has truly become my second home. I have made countless friends who are all passionate about the same subjects as I am and I feel very connected and blessed to be at that school
College Freshman,5,"People are always on campus during the week and weekend. Night life during the week involves studying and hanging out, on the weekends, people go out to party. You can walk all around campus. The farthest walk is about 5 min."
College Freshman,5,You get to know your professors well. Curriculum isn't too much to handle. Registration process is easy online.
College Freshman,5,Its so cool meeting people from other countries in class or on a team. Its a great way in expanding your diversity.
College Freshman,5,"Not much campus crime, just people doing stupid things that creates a problem. Personal safety, people are always walking around watching out for people. Security services are good when you need their help, they come asap."
College Freshman,5,Courses are as expected from a college. Professors are passionate and will help students struggling. They have open office hours and are always open to new ideas and getting to know you.
Niche User,4,"pretty good honestly not that bad, the teachers are helpful, but with all classes being online is very hard, all students struggle with this but it is what it is"
Senior,4,Online learning is not ideal for anyone but Merrimack really took it and made it the best thing possible!
Freshman,4,"I have not taken any classes online yet, but I do have a couple online classes scheduled for this fall. I have been on zoom calls with Merrimack but not for classes. These calls were well structured and went smoothly."
Senior,4,"I enjoy Merrimack! It's environment makes every individual feel at home. The staff is there to help you succeed and learn. As an education major they are preparing their student teachers well. We are given opportunities to expand out of our comfort zone. Community is a big part of Merrimack, and we are always trying to help those around us. It is a school that keeps on growing, but never forgets its foundation."
Senior,4,Merrimack was quick to move to online learning. They understood that it was not ideal for each individual so they were able to accommodate for others.
Freshman,4,"Merrimack College is a smaller size school and has a wonderful community feel.  Everyone is really welcoming and with a smaller class size, you are able to have a relationship with your professor."
Niche User,4,Merrimack College is a great school. Very good academics and extracurricular programs. Awesome parties and nightlife. But there is a lack of diversity.
Niche User,4,"Merrimack is a unique school with a good work ethic and a great education-based community. The school is small, which makes it good to get to know the people around you."
Sophomore,4,As a commuter I can’t give a sense of what on campus life was like however there were many nights I stayed over and I have been attending for the last year and a half. The school takes immense pride in its sports and its accomplishments thus far and always seems to have plans for expanding. For the most part like other schools academics comes down to the professor and so far I’ve had a pretty successful time with that. For the most part with the exception of life outside of campus I can’t see many of its flaws being too far off from any other college’s.
Niche User,4,"Great environment, Great education! Lots to love at Merrimack. Business school is amazing. Sports are great, campus has great energy."
Alum,4,"I graduated in 2013, it was a good school. I did notice they were becoming more strict about campus life especially on the weekends. The teachers were great and I do feel like I got a good education. It is a very expensive school but it is outside of Boston so that is expected."
Niche User,4,The campus was really nice and the tour guides explained every building and the campus in great detail. They were really nice and welcomed you to the campus.
Senior,4,It's a good sized campus which helps you meet so many people here and feel included. The class sizes aren't huge which gives you more one-on-one time with the professors. All of my advisors and staff that I have both worked with and had as professors are really friendly and very helpful.
Freshman,4,I loved how some and personable they were to me when I visited. I visited over 3 times. They paid attention and made us feel comfortable. We asked questions and all of them were answered.
Niche User,4,"Campus is beautiful, people are friendly and great education. That have a lot of great oppertunities and programs that really help one to get the most of their experience there."
Junior,4,"They are in the process of building new and improved buildings. The new business building is incredible. The student life on campus and in clubs are lively and productive. The education portion of the college could use some work as well as the advising. Depending on the part of the college you are working with your experience will be different, so please meet with as many people as you can to get a good feel for who you will be working with throughout your experience here."
Sophomore,4,I like the variety of students. I feel there is always something to do around campus. I always see something going on and everyone is welcoming to participate.
Freshman,4,"I’m a freshman at Merrimack and so far my experience has been good. The academics is really good and if you need help in any way, you’ll always find someone to help you."
Freshman,4,"I am currently in my second semester at Merrimack College and I love it there! The community is so welcoming and I feel so comfortable. There is also a lot of help available for academic help when needed. The staff is amazing and so helpful, I am constantly asking questions and going to them for anything. They really want to help all the student succeed as much as possible."
Freshman,4,"There is a good amount of activities to do on campus, so combined with the cute small town vibes given off by Andover, the environment is full of things to do. The sports teams are fun to watch in my free time, especially hockey, although the dorms do leave something to be desired sometimes. Dormitories are never usually five stars, so this is understandable, and I have only been in one, so I don't have much exposure yet. There is a good amount of diversity, and I've felt it, having made several international friends. Nearly all the people are very friendly - students, staff, and professors - and I feel welcome wherever I go.
In terms of academics, I feel like some of my professors were very willing to help and really help us learn and understand the information, while some just blew through lessons and were kind of stingy in terms of the way they assisted students with learning."
Graduate Student,4,"I would put 3 stars for the entire experience and an extra one for the memories. 
Academics: DECENT
I had great professors and not so great ones. But the one’s that were great have helped me throughout my four years and I will never forget them.
Athletics:
Former athlete at Merrimack. They treat them great, some more than others. But overall athletics are supported and there are many oppetunties to see games/matches
Campus Life: 
ALRIGHT
Housing is terrible. Get off campus housing when you can! The food sucks too. I never ate at the cafe.
Dorms are small and stupid. Not what you paid for :)
Friends I made were amazing! However I wish there was more diversity!"
Niche User,4,Merrimack College is a comfortable campus. Everything is close enough where you won't get lost. It's easy to navigate through. I would like to see more school pride representation.
Senior,4,"I like all the different majors and opportunities they offer
I don't like some of the teachers/ advisors sometimes because I feel they are at a position in which they can't always achieve that positions goals"
Sophomore,4,"Merrimack as a whole is a great community however, the downfall is that the school is so small that I am sort of forced to see the same people over and over everyday. Which definetly gets boring after a while."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far has been very fun, and I wouldn't have wanted my transition into adult life to be any other way. The diverse culture and the great facilities for academics and athletics have been awesome."
Freshman,4,Amazing college with great staff and amazing sense of community! The professors are very helpful and always willing to help to better your education. The school offers a lot of different clubs and activities to include everyone.
Junior,4,"I like the people, including the faculty. I met all my best friends there and also my boyfriend. The school has been working on making changes since I got there, such as new buildings and redoing parts of old buildings. I would like to see a change in the food because it is subpar."
Freshman,4,"I like Merrimack because it is a closed off small campus. I feel safe there. the food is not the best, only the subs at the den are good. the professors are nice and want you to succeed. I also like how the class sizes are small, it is like high school. I like when the teacher knows my name, but some do not even try to get to know anyone's name."
Freshman,4,Great vibe here! You really make life-time friends here. Teachers are great and so are the rest of the staff here.
Freshman,4,The classes are good and so are all the Professor. The people are nice over all and there are a lot of activities you can get involved in. The town surrounding the college has some nice restaurants but the college is right next to a highway. Defiantly for suburban than urban.
Niche User,4,"I had a great experience at Merrimack College. The professors were very approachable and personable. As for the students, most are athletes of some sort."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are great and you can always find a staff member to help you. The overall room and board is not worth the money. The food is not all the great, and it is such a process to get something you need in the dining hall. The housing situation is limited and are not great, the dorm definitely need to be renovated."
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of opportunities to take advantage of job fairs on campus and the student centers are always helpful to find jobs for graduate and under-graduate students such as co-ops and internships.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are willing to help the students succeed who are determined and motivated to ask for help if needed.  They pave the way in order to give the student a clear path to success!
College Senior,4,"I have had no trouble finding internships every summer that I have been in college. Merrimack puts a lot of time into student career success, though I believe it is underutilized by the student body."
College Senior,4,"Merrimack has done a good job improving the housing selection process since I have been a student and adding nice, new, modern dorms."
College Senior,4,Merrimack is filled with great professors and great people. Hard work is always rewarded and there tons of resources to ensure student success. The only issue I have with the school is their determination to keep growing despite the limited space to expand upon on the campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Our career center is amazing at matching you with internships, externships, and job searches as you get further into your education.  They will work with you on building your resume and finding contacts that may be able to help you!"
College Sophomore,4,"When you decide on a major, you will have certain course that are required to be completed.  Advisers and professors are very accommodating and helpful to make sure you are able to get into the classes you need.  Class size will depend on your major, whether it is an honors course (those are typically smaller), and whether it is a gen-ed requirement.  The average class size I have experienced is around 20, but some freshman science/health lectures can be as large as 50.  Even with larger classes, professor are very good about keeping office hours and being available when you need them!"
College Sophomore,4,I love living on campus - you meet a variety of people and it is a great way to socialize and even have study groups with friends in your building!
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is no huge on campus - we have 2 sororities and 1 fraternity.  Their main role is community service and fundraising through events on and off campus.  Members of Greek life get along with non-members just fine, and are treated equally in every aspect."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of students attend home games!  The most popular are men's hockey, men's lacrosse, men's and women's soccer, field hockey, and baseball.  There are always students there cheering them on, and the athletes are as involved in other aspects of campus life as any other student!  We really are all one big community."
College Freshman,4,I love how the police are making rounds at all times of the day and I have walked by myself late at night with little fear. The RAs also do a good job of keeping the dorms safe. Personally I dislike the fact that the police have to let you in when you lose your key and you have to pay even on your first offence. Overall campus police are always present but don't make their presence very know unless they are needed. They are also understanding to the fact we are college students yet take sexual assault and alcohol seriously.
College Freshman,4,"I stay here because I enjoy the passion my professors have and the small class sizes that keep me motivated to do my work, as the professors notice. I feel like the courses are difficult but I have learned a lot by their teaching styles."
College Freshman,4,"Students are either very supportive in varsity sports or not at all, but there is always a large crowd at various games."
College Freshman,4,"Classes are all about 15-20 people I'd say, and most of the professors are really approachable, nice, and good at what they do."
College Freshman,4,"It's a D1 hockey school and I personally am not a big sports fan, but everyone gets really into the hockey games. The other sports are largely ignored though."
College Junior,4,"Our campus is a relatively drug free campus. One thing Merrimack does enforce is its drug safety rules. If a student is caught breaking the rules it often results in expulsion. Merrimack Police may be lenient about drinking and parties, however they enforce this. They feel their job is not to interrupt fun, but to protect and drugs such as these put our students in danger."
College Junior,4,"I LOVE Merrimack College. Although we are small we are a family. The class are tailored to your personal needs by friendly and passionate professors. The registrar tends to cause for quite a headache, the professors nearly always pull strings so you can prosper individually."
College Junior,4,"Hockey, hockey, hockey. Merrimack prides itself off of our D1 hockey program. However, little do most people know that we excel in just about every sport we have. In fact, our other teams are so good we are deliberating how to advance to make Merrimack a completely D1 school in every sport. You can tell how much athletics are loved here, by both the school and athletes themselves, but also the students."
College Junior,4,"Merrimack is home. Whether you live across the world, across the country, or just a short drive down the street you will always feel at home. Although we lack in a few areas such as dining and occasionally housing, as does every other college. No place is perfect but Merrimack comes pretty close to it. The school is one big family and community. No matter where you go or what you do there is always a friendly face. Our school is smaller, therefore one would think it is harder to get involved. Quite the contrary actually, Merrimack prides itself off of their student involvement. There is not a single person on campus who is not involved in at least one other activity, whether it be athletics, greek life, or a simple low key club. If i were to do this all again Merrimack would still be my pick for college, Like I said before, Merrimack is home."
College Junior,4,Athletics are an important part of this school.
College Freshman,4,"Security does rounds around the clock, they will give you rides to places on campus if you do not feel safe, they take any report seriously and make sure that all students are safe. The health center is excellent, they provide counselors, doctor appointments, perscriptions you can pick up at the CVS down the street, and other health needs."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics at Merrimack are Division 1 for both men's and women's hockey teams, and Division 2 for every other sport. The women's hockey team just had their inaugural season and a lot of the teams had great seasons. Students love going to games and supporting their athletes and friends. Fan sections keep the Warrior pride running through everybody's spirits and are all proud of their teams."
College Freshman,4,"Merrimack lives up to it's standard as a small school with a family feel. Walking around campus, you get hellos, how are yous, and you know almost everyone walking by you. The student body at Merrimack is for the most part very respectful. Students will hold doors for eachother, help others when needed, show support twoards other students, and make Merrimack feel like one big family. Academics are amazing at Merrimack, the small classes really let you get to know your professor, and gain a deeper understanding of your major, and lets your professor get to know you. The courses at Merrimack are very enjoyable and it is easy to stay on top of your work if you pay attention and keep an orderly fashion. The GPA point scale runs low for each letter grade which is a down side, but it makes you as a student work harder to achieve a good GPA. Food at campus could be better, both restaraunts are in very good shape and are maintained very well. Quality and variety of the food served could be improved. The Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are awesome and are hot spots for students. Housing can get a little confusing during the choosing process and some dorms could be improved on the interior and climate systems. The housing staff is always there for you no matter what and they will listen to every problem or compliment students want to get across. Saftey and security at Merrimack is great, all of the officers have the students safety on their mind always. There are a lot of clubs at Merrimack and you can participate in as many as you want, but do not overwhelm yourself. students get the opportunity to sign up and learn more about each club and organization at Merrimack at the beginning of the Fall and Spring semester. Athletics are great at Merrimack, they are continuing to grow and get better. The fan base is amazing and helps keep the Warrior pride in school. Overall, Merrimack has been a great experience and I reccomend it to every one who is starting the college search process."
College Freshman,4,"Hockey games are a big deal on campus, but overall there's a lot of support for all the sports teams so it's fun."
College Freshman,4,"The workload is managable, teachers are available to help,"
College Freshman,4,They help you get internships and externships.
College Freshman,4,Nice that they know your name.
College Freshman,4,Great athletics and school spirit.
Freshman,2,"Personally hated my time attending this college, so much so that I made the decision to transfer out after my first semester. My major was Graphic Design and none of the professors I had taught me anything. One of them was very friendly, but I absolutely was not getting what I was paying for. Some of the kids were nice, but many of them are very Andover. Just not here for it."
Freshman,2,"The social life, food, and campus are not great. Many people have already/are going to transfer out for next semester.  There is no diversity on campus other than the football and basketball teams. It is very cliquey, people tend to act childish. There is no diversity looks wise or in the way people act. People are rude unless you're on a sports team, they are a community but other than that, they walk around like they're better than you. As for the parties, it is difficult to have an actual party because they're shut down at 11 or they are very selective in who they let in. There's nothing to do on the weekends. Merrimack is growing but it is growing too fast. They have let way too many people in leaving the academics to be not the best and the retention rate fairly poor."
Niche User,2,"Transferring from Merrimack was the best decision I ever made. Absolutely awful dining, housing, and social scene. Nothing to go do in the area unless you have a fake and can hitch a ride to Lowell. Clubs and teams are cultish and make it feel like your high school nightmares all over again. From an academic standpoint, a diploma from Merrimack in anything besides Business or STEM majors is an absolute joke. Some faculty are great but others are super discriminatory and don’t take student illnesses or mental health issues seriously. ADA office won’t help you unless you look disabled. There are some people who are absolutely fantastic human beings on campus but they are few and far between. Spend your money elsewhere, Merrimack doesn’t deserve it."
Freshman,2,"I came to Merrimack with extremely high expectations of how the college life should be but was let down very quickly. If you loved high school this is the perfect college for you, it is cliquey, people are two-faced, and the professors hound you about work and attendance. Along with this, the college is outdated and growing at an unprecedented rate causing hectic construction as well as a dirty feel on campus. This growth is not only causing bad conditions on campus but it also takes away from the personal feel that I had been looking for in a college. Overall, Merrimack, in my opinion, is a great deal of money for very minimal in return. Save your money."
Freshman,2,"I personally hated it here. It's very small, very cliquey, it feels like high school all over again. Professors are constantly checking up on you and penalizing you if you miss an assignment. you don't feel like a grown up at all. there is no where to go either. the hype of the week is going to CVS down the street. you are stuck if you don't have a car and there are wayyyyy too many commuters. the parties are over-crowded and are shut down by 11:45. the only good sporting event is the D1 hockey games."
College Sophomore,2,Not very popular on campus
College Sophomore,2,"Two career fairs, thats really it. Career centre doesn't do a whole lot."
College Sophomore,2,"Professors are hit or miss, some great, some awful. The campus is easy to get around which I love."
College Sophomore,2,"Merrimack is a great school academically. Socially there's not many ways to get involved in on campus, and the weekends aren't too fun. Certain weekends they'll have people everywhere checking your body. Campus forces you to get a meal plan, which is fine because they don't want you to starve. However, it's a waste of money, not only is the food terrible but four hours out of the day when they're open you can walk in and find absolutely nothing to eat. The staff is more concerned with feeding themselves than the students. I've gone into Sparkys with ten minutes left in breakfast or lunch and they'll close down the food stations only to find them eating at a table next to you right after. All the meal plans cost the same, but there's no way an extra $50 a semester can make up for four less meals a week. I would only choose Merrimack again if I was a commuter."
College Freshman,2,We don't have a greek life at Merrimack. Maybe two sorties and one fraternity but it isn't very popular.
College Freshman,2,"The main dining hall Sparky's is good for about a week and then you get sick and tired of it. The food isn't in very good quality unless you get salads or wraps and sometimes they can have rotten veggies. The all you can eat at Sparky's is a plus but at some point there isn't much you want to eat. I've kind of stopped eating meat in college altogether because I don't trust the undercooked meat they serve!

The Den is good when you want a quick snack or drink. My favorite are the milkshakes they sell that you can make! However, I've only had fries as a food option from the Den (Never tried their sushi)

Dunkin Donuts and Zime are the best for coffee and breakfast foods! I'm a coffee lover so all my points and money goes into these two places more than anything. 

Make sure you pack up on snacks in your rooms because the food isn't quite great everyday."
College Sophomore,2,Its gross. Royal Crest across the state high way from campus is not the nicest place to live. Students have to cross a state high way in order to get there for one which is not safe at all. My parents would not allow me to live over there.
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid is a huge task. I have a twin brother that goes to school as well so my parents are helping two students at the same time try to pay for school. Its really hard for them. I really wish there was a way to get more financial help.
College Sophomore,2,Although directly across from campus it keeps its residents isolated across the busy 114 highway and is filthy and bug infested.
College Sophomore,2,"I have had 3 experiences in which my belongings were broken into pieces and destroyed within my own townhouse on campus causing me and 3 others to move out. However, campus police could not do anything to protect my safety or enforce punishment."
College Sophomore,2,Frequently finding bugs in the food or lack of options for gluten free and vegetarian eaters.
College Senior,2,"At merrimack, there is not much of a greek life, no greek housing, no greek social life that includes non-greek members."
College Junior,2,We have a very limited Greek Life and no housing options.  It is more of a club than anything else.
College Sophomore,2,Merrimack really needs to think about getting a campus shuttle.
College Sophomore,2,"The dinning hall at Merrimack is below average. The food is very repetitive, although lately they seem to be stepping it up."
College Freshman,2,There is barely and greek life
College Junior,2,The school is not big enough to have off campus housing 
Recent Alumnus,2,the weather can make it very miserable to be on campus.one minute it can be sunny and the next it snowing.
Recent Alumnus,2,the campus is almost 80% white there is not that much diversity. 
Recent Alumnus,2,there is stuff to do but if you dont have a car you are out of luck
College Sophomore,2,The athletes seem to receive the most financial aid. I am a hardworking student with good grades and I am not receiving enough financial aid to live there so I am forced to commute. I would really like to live there.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Better Food – We get served the same thing all the time pizza, burgers, and pasta. We have the options of getting a sandwich but because there is nothing else to eat the line is extremely long.And hour or so after lunch, dinner, and breakfast the food is not changed."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Lack of Varitey – 77% of the student body it white,  there are a few international students but most of the student body makes them feel alienated from everyone. And everyone here has there own little clicks, the athletes, the preppy white girls, the Dominican kids, and so on.  Many the sports guys walk around like they are better than everyone else and try to treat people how ever they want."
College Senior,2,some public transportation off campus but none available on campus
College Freshman,2,"There are a few sororities and fraternities at Merrimack, but it's not very big. No one will think of you differently if you're part of one or if you're not. You can have fun and enjoy the parties, but it's not about popularity."
College Freshman,2,"There are 3 different places on campus:

Sparkys: The main dining hall- Typically has 5 stations including a stir fry station (Chicken or Tofu for meat options), a Burger and french fry station, A sandwich station, a pizza and pasta station and a station that changes daily between fish red meats, and things like chicken nuggets or grilled cheese. Basically the same rotations throughout every week so its easy to get sick of.

The Den: A lot of fried and grilled food like chicken wings, onion rings, quesadillas etc. also, drinks, salads, and a smoothie machine.  Just put in a little sushi bar. 

Zebi- Located in the library, a healthier alternative offering sandwiches, hot/cold drinks like lattes and iced coffees, and soup. 

*** Each semester you are granted $100 towards Den/Zebi bucks on your card which is relatively low compared to other schools, and for the money that you pay for dining. You can put more money on that card at any time if you enjoy it over Sparkys Place."
College Sophomore,2,its mostly a Catholic school so there is not much religious diversity. its got relatively good economic background because were right near lowel an Lawrence
College Freshman,2,Not So Great!! It's really difficult to get a spot in here. because this is a small place and sometimes students park in a place where they are not allowed because the spot is just so small.
College Sophomore,2,There are no houses on the campus and people don't really seem to care much about them. It seems as if there are A TONE of rules around the sororities especially. Some people absolutely love it though.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life at Merrimack isn't like most schools. They don't have their own housing. Some sororities and fraternities are viewed as better than the others.
College Sophomore,2,Alcohol and drugs on campus – Drinking is everywhere and many kids smoke weed and yell about it during lunch.
College Freshman,2,there are some close convenience stores such as CVS and some food options like Panera and Burger  King across the street. I have yet to hear about any shuttles or busses that the school provides for students to get to the store. The campus is actually very dark at night and there are a lot of trees which make it scary to walk alone.
College Freshman,2,"Dorms -- feels more like a prison – personally, i am not a fan of living on campus. there does not seem like there is much to do and it is very strict. if you want a guest over you need to sign them in and they need their license and registration. every bag gets pat down, feels more like a prison"
College Sophomore,2,Not a ton of snow – Its cold most of the year here. Not a ton of snow but it get wet really easily and fast from rain and slush
College Junior,2,Most of the diversity comes from the football and basketball teams as far as racial/ethnic diversity. There is a center for Jewish/Christian/Muslem relations as well as an ALANA club and diversity outreach center in the campus center.
Freshman,1,"I attended Merrimack College for a semester and 2 weeks. The food is absolutely horrible, I got food poisoning the first day I ate from the dining hall. I found myself ordering in 3-5 times a week and going to the grocery store very often. Party scene is alright I guess. Most of the time you'll only be able in if you make out with the doorman, gross. They do not care about your mental health at all, some of the counselors are good but the health center as a whole is horrible. I met a few nice people at my time at Merrimack but most of the girls are fake and cliquey and the boys are creepy and just want to get with you. BEWARE of idiot professors and useless TAs. Don't even think about the random roommate selection working out for you either. The tuition is unbelievably expensive for the awful living accommodations. Austin Scholars is also a cult, you have to live together at all times. Just don't waste your money here. It drove me to insanity."
Sophomore,1,"This school is a money grab. I really hope I can get my friends to transfer someone worthwhile with me, and we have already talked about it many times. The food is horrible, so bad that I barely use any of my swipes which they force you to buy for some reason. The school is too expensive for what it is and what you get. You basically have to be the factor that makes the school somewhat enjoyable. I'm pretty certain that I would be depressed if I was here without my friends. Seems like they will hire Literally anyone to be a professor/adjunct and I’ve only had a couple that seemed qualified. If I had on recommendation, DO NOT COME HERE. I wish I transferred before I fell into this ridiculously wasteful amount of debt. Administration doesn’t care about the students at all it seems, even if you ask for help. What a shame this school is. Puts a pit in my stomach thinking about telling my mom that I think I messed up badly by coming here and regret it terribly :("
Freshman,1,Absolutely unreasonable institution that does not care about anything except for taking your money or wasting it.
Freshman,1,"Honestly a majority of the people who go here have been some of the worst people I've met. A majority of students are extreamly  self involved and have no respect for others. The price is absurd considering the resources and facilities the school provides. For example the ceilings leaking and almost collapsing in dorm halls, the food sucks and gym and libraries are constantly over crowded. Also if your not an athlete you will be treated poor compared to any students on the sports teams who get special treatment in unreasonable ways."
Niche User,1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL institution. Serving students flies in their food? Sparky’s and Warrior’s Den employees hitting on the female students and trying to search for them through social media? Broken glass all over campus? Outdated library and classrooms? “Religious” hypocrisy? Indoctrinating political bias? Completely misleading orientations? Jacking up tuition prices every year? Charging $25 for the campus police to unlock your room for you?! Shame on you Merrimack. Never again.
Niche User,1,"I completely regret attending this college. The price of tuition goes up every year to the point I can’t afford it, there’s broken glass all over the campus to the point I’ve received injuries from it. Professors make everything about identity politics and political correctness, one even stormed out of our classroom and told us not to waste his f*cking time. Their Augustinian identity is definitely falling apart, as I have been insulted by much of the students here because of where I came from and who I am. Parking is often a huge issue that is never addressed, and if the staff asks you how they can improve, they will not actually listen to your ideas. Overall do not let the tours and orientations fool you, this college is completely misleading on all platforms. I would recommend taking your money, time, and kids elsewhere to a place where they’ll actually treat them like humans, not walking dollar signs."
Freshman,1,"I'm currently a freshman at Merrimack and am already looking to transfer. First of all, housing is a disaster. In all likelihood, you'll be put in a forced triple your first year. I lived in Ash and it absolutely sucks. If you don't keep your windows open your room heat up to a cozy 80 degrees, regardless of the season. Living next to the stadium is a living hell. Teams always blast music at during practice and have woke me up at 6:30 am sometimes. As for the food, it grows old very quickly and I found myself ordering delivery at least three times a week. If you wish to have a car on campus, don't get your hopes up. The party scene is mediocre and there is nothing to do in the area. The academics on the other hand aren't as bad. I liked most of my professors but at the same time I had a couple that were terrible. At times I found the coursework to be a bit too easy. Overall, the school just isn't worth the money and would only recommend the school if you're an athlete."
Alum,1,It is a terrible institution that forces its liberal biasses on the student.  You have to basically be a communist or else they will shame and slander you.
College Sophomore,1,It is irrelevant on campus.
College Freshman,1,There's only 1 frat and 2 sororities and they don't even have houses.
College Freshman,1,"The school has almost no diversity, and the maturity level is similar to a middle school. I am continually chastised by students and RAs alike. There is no variety of food and I have gotten food poisoning from Sparky's (the school's cafeteria) three or more times. Finally, I have found myself teaching my classes and teachers multiple times. From a school as expensive as Merrimack, you would think it would offer better academia and living options. All these negative components are hidden by a visually appealing campus."
College Freshman,1,nothing around to even consider
College Freshman,1,The chicken is rarely cooked
College Freshman,1,The school doesn't provide any kind of transportation. Even if it did where would you go?
College Freshman,1,Literally is the joke at Merrimack
Recent Alumnus,1,"the Greek life is very small here at Merrimack, and they are stuck up"
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is very frustrating. The residence have one giant lot in the way back of campus to park in. The lot is referred to as ""Rape Lot"" by some students for is distance from the rest of campus. If you are coming back late you will never find a spot and are forced to pack in the way back, which can be frustrating if you have to walk to your dorm in the freshman quad (the farthest group of dorms from the lot). There are several parking lots throughout campus (many unused during parts of the day and at night) but residence are strictly prohibited from using those lots. Tickets are given out frequently and appealing them never ends in the favor of the student. The only good thing about parking on campus is the fee. There is no fee for commuter parking passes and the fee for residence is fair and much less than what I here many of my friends pay at their colleges."
Recent Alumnus,1,Start the finical aid process takes forever. The college takes forever to get loans passed and take forever to let you know what they need from you.
College Sophomore,1,Greeks Really Dont Do Anything – we have a few frats and sororities here but they really don't do anything great around campus. The most they do is some fundraising but no real parties.
College Sophomore,1,"There usually isn't a lot of parking, and if you are lucky to get a good spot, it most likely means your not moving your car for a while."

GCU has this thing called the ACE center where if you need help with math and writing then you can go and get help from a real professor and find yourself a tutor."
Sophomore,5,My online experience with Grand Canyon University has been absolutely fantastic easy to follow instructions from from the professors and very spiritual
Sophomore,5,The thing I like most about Grand Canyon University is it’s a Christian-based collegeThe instructors are great at the school online learning is fantastic easy to follow instructions and overall a great school to attend online

Junior,5,"I really like the online courses. Taking classes this way still gets you the education you are paying for, while still giving you spare time if you complete your classwork. The courses are broken down into week segments with different assignments and projects with deadlines so you just work to complete them and are able to have a schedule."
Junior,5,I took all of my classes online and loved it. The educators used the internet as a great tool to continue education.
Junior,5,"I took some online classes, it is a bit different compared to on campus learning but it is still fun and easy to get the hang of. The professors are always helpful and will answer questions when needed."
Junior,5,"Grand Canyon is a beautiful university. All the people there are so nice and will help you with anything and help understand things around campus as well. Professors there are great at communicating, communication is no problem!"
Junior,5,"Grand Canyon University is so communicative and helpful! They provided so many services to help with the enrollment process, and have so many degree programs to choose from."
Senior,5,Grand Canyon is a great school. All of the professors are friendly and work hard to help the students to succeed. The student advisor has been helpful to explain how to do things and working with my schedule. I would definitely recommend the university to working parents or people who want to further their education but are unable to attend traditional classes.
Sophomore,5,Online classes are amazing. 7 week long and teachers are super helpful and understanding. I really recommend it. Sometimes it takes a bit for teachers to grade work but that is understandable.
Sophomore,5,"I think GCU is great. I have learned a lot and online classes are amazing, most teachers are understanding. 

I would like to see more variety of scholarships and financial support."
Freshman,5,"When I first started my online classes, Grand Canyon University wanted to make sure that I understood the online classroom. So thankfully, they had me do starter classes to learn the system. Grand Canyon University makes sure you have the best chance at success at their school."
Freshman,5,"I have had a great experience at Grand Canyon University. All of the staff are super approachable. If was anything I needed or if I had a concern of any kind, the staff was there for me. I am so happy with my choice of school."

Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Grand Canyon University. I am an all online student that is majoring in Secondary Education, and so far, my experience has been incredibly smooth. The schedule is really flexible and you are able to know exactly what assignments are due because it is the same every week. The Christian heritage at GCU is phenomenal as well; where else do you have professors that pray for and with you? I would not change a thing about this institution."
Freshman,5,"I take all of my classes online. The instructors are sure to engage you fully, and are always available to you. They use an application called ""Remind"" where you are able to shoot them a text message if you need something after hours, and they have all been very accommodating in my opinion. There are so many resources available through the online platform as well, including free subscriptions to Office 365 for your laptop or desktop."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy going to this school. I am on online student and I work full time so this program works well for me. I enjoy the classes, they are challenging and informative."
Freshman,5,"I am on online student and as it implies everything that we do is online. GCU has a vast network of resources set up online for our usage. The instructors provide a lot of other resources also, and communication is very good too."
Junior,5,"The GCU program for Elementary Education students is a very well-thought out program for working adults.  It is set up for 7 weeks of interactive and thought-provoking, challenging exercises that ensure our learning. My counselors reach out to me and are on top of my progress, making me feel like I am a valued student and a part of the online learning community.  I have met many diverse classmates and well-qualified instructors. I'm very happy with the program all in all."
Junior,5,I am a GCU online college student and I feel like I am just as much a part of GCU than the traditional on-campus student. The counselors really work together to make sure I am on the right path for my major and make sure I have all the tools necessary to reach my educational goals. I feel supported and valued while receiving my education.
Freshman,5,"I'm incoming college Freshman this year, and they have done a great job answering questions I have had about college, they have done a good job of informing me about everything changing this year. My counselor has helped me sign up for classes and even switch around classes.  GCU has also sent me many free things, to help me feel more like a Lope."
Sophomore,5,"The online experience you'll have is you want to make sure you always contact your professors so that way they can help you out with everything you need to know. It's essential always to check any updates, emails, and any announcements online, so be on the lookout for that."
Junior,5,"The work load is manageable. I work a full time job and have other activities outside of work and school. As long as I create a schedule, I am able to get everything done on time."
Junior,5,"I've loved my experience at GCU. Campus culture is very friendly, outgoing, positive & school-spirited. Dorms & apartments are available for housing, & both are much bigger and nicer than a typical college dorm. Dining on campus includes several convenience stores, a small grocery store, & almost 30 fast-food restaurants. GCU is the largest Christian college in America. Initially I was concerned that I would have large class sizes & limited one-on-one interaction with my professors. However, this was not the case; classes were around 30-40 people, I was known by name by my professors, & I was easily able to get help from them.  I love that though you don't have to be a Christian at GCU, all students get to learn the Christian worldview & can choose to participate in Chapel & many great ministries on campus. During COVID-19, GCU has been very generous with their resources, giving all their stimulus money to all students, speaking to their humility & desire to see all students succeed."
Junior,5,"So far, the online learning experience has been phenomenal. I have felt very supported, and the professors have made success very achievable."
Graduate Student,5,"Had a great time at GCU. They really care about the students feedback and strive to make the campus the best it can be for all involved. Felt safe, felt I got a good education, and would recommend to anyone looking for a University."
Freshman,4,The application process is easy and is quick to complete. You are immediately assigned an admissions counselor who is dedicated to helping you in your process. My acceptance into GCU was within a week and a half. I had a very informational zoom meeting with my admissions counselor and then scheduled a campus meeting the same week. Big campus but small-town feel to it.
Senior,4,"The classes were enjoyable, and the online campus was easy to maneuver through. Deadlines were consistent, as were basic requirements."
Senior,4,"One thing I really like about GCU is that it’s a Christian university. I don’t have to be so careful with what I say, because religion is accepted and encouraged. However, GCU is very expensive, and I’m struggling to come up with the money to pay for my last two classes."
Junior,4,Pretty difficult but I do love it! You just need to stay on top it. It is a lot of work but You got it!
Junior,4,I like that I can school to double up on courses and switch around my courses. The student services are really nice and works with you.
Alum,4,Overall really good experience.  Great for undergrad.  Received the education and the BS degree needed to move onto desired doctorate program.  GCU should have started informational meetings for Grad school applications and placement exams earlier than provided.
Sophomore,4,"Taking online classes semester was a challenge, however, all my professors were really responsive when it came to asking questions and all made announcements on the topic we are learning and tips to prepare us for the up coming quizzes ."
Sophomore,4,GCU's academics are great. They have many resources to help you with any classes that you are struggling with and almost all professors are willing to help you out if you are struggling. They all have office hours so you can go and ask as much questions or get help.
Junior,4,I love the format of the online classes because I can still work full time. I also love all of the resources the university provides.
Alum,4,Simple assignment structure for the online business courses. Discussion questions and responses due every week to ensure participation. Professors were usually quick to respond which was very helpful.
Junior,4,"This school makes every day an adventure. You are constantly meeting new people and having new experiences. There is never a dull moment on this campus. Seems as if you focus and are passionate about what your doing in college, GCU will allow you to succeed! The one thing they need to do better is have better communications, specifically in the disabilities department. I personally have been battling cancer and they haven't made my life any easier, which is what I thought their job was. They need a smoother process that takes the stress off the shoulders of the disabled because they already have enough on their plate to begin with."
Sophomore,4,"When I took online classes, It was better to me than going into the classroom and doing work in the classroom"
Freshman,4,I love how there's a structure but I get to work at my own pace too! Plus the teachers give you fun tips like writing notes of assignments down early so when due date comes all you have to do is submit the file.
Sophomore,4,I love the humanity and understanding that professors give to students when in need or tough times. Coursework is realistic and will help students in both daily life and in the future as their careers take off.
Sophomore,4,"Since the beginning, I have felt more welcome and happy at GCU than I have at any other school. I met amazing people who I know will be lifelong friends, and everyone is always so nice and welcoming. I truly believe that this is a good school for anyone who is seeking peace but also community, faith but also fun, etc. All are welcome and anyone can excel here if they have the dedication to do so."
Sophomore,4,"My online experience at GCU is mostly made up of the classes I took this summer and the end of the year last semester due to COVID-19. But, many of the classes were very well put together and the teachers did a wonderful job at explaining everything to the best of their ability so that everyone can succeed. These online courses contained some difficult assignments, but was quite easy overall since I was so determined to do well and truly understand the curriculum. Overall, my online learning experience at GCU has been very good, and has convinced me to take more online courses in the years to come."
Junior,4,"The structure for online learning at GCU is so unique! Taking one condensed class at a time was so fast and efficient. The class format is very similar to those at other schools, and so effective!"
Senior,4,I love the online experience. I am able to log on to my classes when it is convenient for me for me and work around my own schedule!
Junior,4,There is a friendly atmosphere. I like that the school encourages religion rather than force it and there are many activities and cubs.
Freshman,4,"I will be taking a science class completely online, but at the moment all my other classes will be in person and blended, meaning I will be doing to online but I have to be there at a specific time."
Sophomore,4,"Grand Canyon University is one of the most affordable accredited colleges where any staff members are there to help you provide any information you need. Another thing about this university is also a Christian based college, so you'll be able to learn theologies about God and to grow your faith while having the education you need."
Junior,4,"I have been attending GCU for 3 years (currently on my third year now) online. It has been a great experience and surprisingly, not too overwhelming. I've been able to balance work, school and other activities without falling behind. My student services counselor is always available to assist me and answer any questions I have whenever something does arise."
Junior,4,"Personally, I prefer in-person classes over online ones, and my program of study is oriented towards community & performance, not making it a good candidate for online classes. Even so, amidst responses to the COVID-19 crisis, all of my classes had to be transferred to an online learning format mid-semester. Though it is not my preferred style of learning, GCU is well-equipped with online resources & technology that made the transition much more realistic and attainable than for many other universities worldwide. Their online learning system, LoudCloud, allows students to access all their classes, assignments, grades, and more. It also has a useful feature that allows students to message their teachers, classmates, or entire class directly. GCU also makes most of required textbooks available online so students do not have to purchase them."
Junior,4,"So far, Grand Canyon University has provided me with superb resources however there have been some issues communicating financially."
Graduate Student,4,"I took some classes online, and some classes on ground, both were a great experience. The professors are invested in your learning experience, and I would recommend this school."
Graduate Student,4,"The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. I love the set-up of the online classes and residence. However, the tuition is expensive."
Sophomore,4,"I loved being in a Community of Christ followers, can surround yourself with. But there are also numerous others that are not. There is lots of people for all types of people to get along with. I think GCU can improve on the online portion of school in loudcloud. But as a whole I think GCU is a great option for everyone, religious or not."
Junior,4,Online learning is hard no matter what major you are trying to accomplish. The best part about GCU online was that professors still had office hours over zoom that anyone could sign up for. Every week I would talk to my physics teacher so I never fell behind in class. GCU did a great job of trying to keep the class times the same for the zoom meetings so that it didn't feel like you had to do everything on your own.
Freshman,4,"If you are a religiuos person or you are wanting to gain more religious insight while getting your degree, then GCU is for you. The teachers are there to help you succeed while teaching you about God. My only issue with GCU, the student counselor assigned to you takes care of everything. If you need to talk finances, you have to talk to your assigned conselor. Other than the conselor taking care of everything, the school is great."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the medical facilities offered at grand canyon university, the abundance of events on campus and how helpful the advisers are.  However something I would appreciate changing is the percentage of diversity at the school."
Graduate Student,4,"Grand Canyon University has been a great experience. Everyone i have dealt with has shown a lot professionalism. I am taking all my courses online, but i do not feel like i am thousands of miles away."
Graduate Student,4,I am taking all my courses online and the platform they are using is very user friendly. They group all the things you will need in one area so when you land on that platform's homepage you can navigate very easily to what you need.
Alum,4,"It was very easy to navigate college life at GCU. They give lots of support to give you less in the process to stress about (finances, classes to take, etc). However, I do with they included you more in process. More of a consultation and less of dictating what will take place. 

I did consider them temporarily for my graduate program, but ultimately, I went with a university that carried more weight in the work force."
Senior,4,"At the last few weeks of the school year the school transformed the curriculum to online. But, unlike others I have heard about this year this school did an excellent job of switching to online classes."
Senior,4,"Grand Canyon University did an excellent job in keeping the staff and students informed and taking precautions regarding the pandemic. As well as, keeps everyone of the students engaged in school life other than academics. For instance, this institution has a lounge specifically for students that do not live on campus. To relax, eat, socialize, or do homework. This institution has many options for a student to eat or buy in order for the students to make their own food. This school is a good and wholesome place to learn, socialize, and stay safe even in the mist of  a pandemic."
Sophomore,4,"Overall the school is good, there is something that could be a bit better like teachers being more open, but you can't expect that with every teacher or at all so its just a getting using to its situation."
Junior,4,The admission counselor will give you all the information you need to know before you enroll at GCU.  The counselor moved quickly to make sure you enroll in class.  So far it is good experience.
Junior,4,So far I took one online class and its been pretty good.  The Instructor is accessible and will work with you through any issues.  The Instructor thoroughly explain the assignments for the class every week.  I liked it!
Sophomore,4,I am new to taking classes online; the professors are super patient and super attentive. they excel in responding to questions in a timely manner.
Sophomore,4,"I love GCU, they make the process of going back to school and working full time extremely easy. Especially during the covid pandemic. All the staff is super attentive and helpful. Over all there is a great sense of family on a campus."
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID-19, lectures were transferred online. It was difficult learning via Zoom calls, but a moderate amount of the professors were more than willing to assists students who required extra help."
Sophomore,4,"GCU online is good. It is inexpensive, and very manageable for those who are doing school on the side. The classes are an easy A, I wish they were a bit more challenging, and I wish that they had a notification system to your personal email or phone when something was graded or got a response."

Junior,4,"I decided to attend Grand Canyon University after highschool and absolutely fell in love with the school. The campus is amazing, the professors go above and beyond, and the student crowd is great. There are so many ways to be involved at GCU."
Junior,4,The online classes are a lot harder than the on campus classes. They require a lot of online discussion boards and involvement.
Freshman,4,"My experience with Grand Canyon University, so far, has been well. The Discover GCU trip was great in helping me to be able to make my college decision."
Sophomore,4,"I will be a sophomore this upcoming school year, and I didn't realize how much I can learn within my first year in college. As much as how difficult it was being away from home, I got to experience many new things that taught me a lot of valuable lessons. GCU provides many resources that help their students succeed in their classes. In addition, GCU is a private christian university that plans and executes many fun campus activities. The dorms and apartments are one of highlights of this university, however, this includes many strict policies that must be followed. One thing I wished I could change about this university is allowing the credits to transfer to other schools. Most of the classes taken at GCU does not transfer to other universities because the classes that freshmen take are courses specifically for GCU. Being homesick is very common with all the students, but GCU provides many clubs, activities on campus, athletics, and many other things to keep you busy."
Junior,4,"Although there are classes that I believe need more work to deliver excellent education, the teachers for the most part are very invested in their student's success. The only thing I would recommend for improvement would be more video lectures for math type classes, these need to be visual for many learners. Not everything can just be learned from a book. I would also split the statistics class into 2 classes. First should be basic theory and understanding the formulas, second class should be application and SPSS."

This unfortunately is a religious school, and the professor I had for the mandatory religion class was not a very nice person. I was able to brush her comments off, but there were others that were not. Their grades suffered due to them not participating in discussions where the teacher would bully them. This is the only negative I have for this university."
Graduate Student,4,"My classmates in my online classes cannot construct a coherent sentence or a coherent paragraph. There are many spelling mistakes, wrong word choice, run on sentences and sentence fragments. My classmates use your instead of you're. My professor avoids giving straight forward answers to student questions. Instead, my professor forces students to go hunting for their answers alone even though students have no idea where to find the answers to their questions"

Freshman,4,I am an upcoming freshman and I could not get to experience GCU's online courses yet in this period of time.
Freshman,4,"I personally do not like online classes and learning, but with GCU, they made it tolerable and very understandable."
Junior,4,I haven't personally done online learning through grand canyon yet but i have had friends and family and it has seemed pretty self explanatory and easy to navigate through. The teachers have also always been responsive once a student has a question
Freshman,4,"Online courses at GCU are good, of course there are a few issues that may occur when taking online classes, but nothing out of the normal. The learning environment is much different online compared to face-to-face lectures on campus simply because students aren’t as connected to their professors or peers like they would be in person. However, the actual learning process in terms of lectures is just as good as in person lectures because GCU professors make sure they provide as much information and resources to their students since they know some students may struggle in an online class environment. Overall, the online courses are interesting, but personally, on-campus classes are better."
Sophomore,4,"I love everything about GCU other than the fact that all of the food options are restaurants, however my apartment will have a kitchen next year so that will not be a problem anymore!"
Freshman,4,"GCU is a small but comfy campus. The staffs are very friendly, and they are always there when students have any concerns. There are a lot of fun activities and extra study sessions for those in need. After all balancing out work and fun is important."
Freshman,4,"Great four-year school offering a diverse  array of degree programs on-campus and online. GCU was also founded on Christian teaching and values which I wasn't really aware of, but I am very happy about that as I happen to be a pretty devout Christian man myself. I absolutely love the online degree program I am currently enrolled in! There's nothing that I'd really like to see changed at Grand Canyon University as far as I'm concerned! GCU rocks!"
Graduate Student,4,"Some of the professor have been great and very helpful when needing extra help. There have been some professors that I would not call instructors because they were not able to convey the content. At these times, I call on my other learners to explain the content. So.. the learning community is excellent!"
Sophomore,4,"Some of my teachers weren’t understanding that these circumstances were hard. However, there are far more teachers that care about the students wellbeing and education. It was difficult keeping track of everything to turn in but"
Senior,2,"Gcu is not a bad school, it just limits you from doing a lot. I  have tried to change a professor and was not able to without paying more money."
Senior,2,"The monies being raked in ought to be put to better use other than the athletic department. Nursing, Performance Art and most of all the Theology building DESERVES BETTER FUNDING, if not most of it! There isn’t even a football team and yet the funds are going to mediocre sports. This school better start doing what is right, or there will no longer be a school to do anything."

Junior,2,"I like how GCU counselors call to check on the online students. I think GCU need to work on getting more scholarships out to online students. I needed help during the pandemic and they told me the ""CARES ACT"" was only for traditional students. I want them to take care of the online student as well. I love the school, but I feel like they can give online students more resources."
Junior,2,"This was a rather pleasant experience, up until covid. The classes were well organized and seemed informative, but now with covid and all the classes were forced online it turned everything into a big mess. None of the teachers knew what they were doing and all the classes turned into busywork rather than learning. Would not do again."
Sophomore,2,My online experience at GC it was not super great. They were not very prepared for the whole coronavirus situation.
Freshman,2,I used GCU as a online learning platform to supplement my high school courses with their dual credit offerings. My experience was poor to average.
Freshman,2,I used GCU as a online learning platform to supplement my high school courses with their dual credit offerings. My experience was poor to average.
Junior,2,Some professors are engaging during the course while others do not even reply back within 3 weeks. Its always a 50/50 whether or not you get a good professor that will be engaged in the course or one that gives you the material without explanation on the content.
Junior,2,"GCU uses their own online learning platform called LoudCloud and it can be extremely frustrating. Lots of little errors and odd things that other platforms like Canvas and Blackboard never have. An example of an issue is that you do not receive updates, notifications or messages on the website. So if a prof decides to cancel class last minute or change the due date or requirements on an assignment out of the blue, you won't receive any notification of this. You would have to check under a very specific tab inside your class portal to look for this."
Freshman,2,i would like for grand canyon to have quicker online times and offices local that could help with tutoring
Sophomore,2,"I had to experience the online learning aspect of the university during the COVID-19 epidemic, and unfortunately the university wasn't prepared for sending all of their physical classes to an online environment. Instructions became very unclear, the professors were unable to control online classroom meetings, and it was difficult to keep up with the sudden shift in learning. As someone who learns better through face to face meetings and lectures, along with interactive work in the classroom, online classes did not have the best effect on me."
Junior,2,"GCU made it impossible to go back to school, for a “Christian” university they lack servant leadership"
Junior,2,"I am an online student & was looking for a school that completed their learning/coursework solely online. I expressed these expectations with my initial counselor & was told  their program matched my expectations. I was also told there were only 2 Christian courses & that was the extent of Christianity in my program. I was lied to concerning both topics. My classes required volunteering, researching/interviewing outside the virtual classroom, & every course had some type of Christian spin. I started my 400 level courses & decided to change schools. I only had a few instructors that actually provided quality/timely feedback on assignments & posts. My last class should have been a weekend seminar, not an 8 week class.  When comparing this school to a coworker's, I am paying more, doing twice the work, & learning less."
Graduate Student,2,"Way overpriced. It might be a good school if you are actually attending but if you are doing an online program and working, forget about it. There is absolutely nothing that is self-paced or ""on your own time"". You might as well be required to attend class and labs etc. Minimal flexibility. The online platform is not user-friendly at all. No notifications if you get a message from the instructor or other students. This is terrible if you have a group project. 

While the professors aren't bad or terribly unfair, I would NEVER recommend attending this school. If you want a RN to BSN specifically, try WGU. I have two other bachelors' degrees prior to being a nurse, and actually enjoyed school before attending here. Highly suggest looking elsewhere."
Senior,2,"The financial aid department at GCU is a complete joke. I got married while attending the school and it took them months to process my name change, which in turn caused issues with receiving my financial aid. The online courses rely too much on the textbook for learning the material, rather than actually having the professors teach the material. The assignments, particularly the tests and quizzes, are not helpful, as they do not tell you which answers you got incorrect (how else can you learn from your mistakes?) Overall I was not impressed with GCU. I expected more participation from the professors and more competency from the university itself."
Graduate Student,2,"As an online doctoral student I am feeling conned. They are really good at getting you in, and getting their payments, but they leave you high and dry with threats if you try to leave. I can't wait to get out of this school."
Sophomore,2,"The school overall makes it seem like its the best place to be and that they would try their very best to help you succeed, but it is the total opposite. I feel like the school can improve on the way they operate with their students."
Sophomore,2,"The school is barely worth the money. It feels like paying University tuition for a community college level education. You have to be independent and take initiative 100% on your own if you want to get anything out of your program- after you are a freshman there will be no one there who will help you. A lot of classes are a waste of time and have been remarkably disappointing with about 3/4 of my professors. The campus is in a horrible neighborhood and if you don't have a car campus can be very cagey-feeling. The public transportation in Phoenix is not an option because it is very dangerous. I feel like I am being cheated out of time and money, and learn more applicable knowledge listening to a podcast or doing independent research than I get from a whole semester-long class."
Senior,2,"This has been the worst mistake of not only my funds but of my professional career. Greedy money fueled school hidden under the label of ""Christian""."
Freshman,2,"If someone is going for the Christian education, this is NOT the place to go. Professors encourage students to party, it was very unprofessional. It did not seem like there was a genuine care and I felt very alone all the time even with lots of friends there. Connecting is very difficult unless you are involved in sports or something else n"
Alum,2,"There are some positives about the school like the campus, ability to meet new friends, and some professors that care about you as an individual. Mostly though the school is just trying to make as much money as they can and a lot of services are abandoned because of that (parking, dining, housing, career services). There has been almost no effort put into developing the courses and most of the professors are adjuncts with a very high turnover rate. It is virtually impossible to reach the Academic Counselors and they often make mistakes with financial aid, schedule, grades. There is no party scene and dorm rules are absolutely ridiculous creating other issues in the process. I have seen so many individuals who during their time at GCU have completely changed their opinion about it and are very happy to leave. Since I got to work in multiple departments, I understand what the school is all about and how their greed and bureaucratic structure will be their ultimate downfall."
Freshman,2,I think Grand Canyon is a great school in general. I would like for professors to elaborate more when teaching. . . Some professors are so focused on getting the whole lesson out of the way so we (students) can't have any of our questions answered. It's way to over priced.
Niche User,2,The campus was beautiful and the other students and staff are friendly. The financial adviser office has no clue what they're doing and does not communicate well with each other or with students.
Niche User,2,"I was very disappointed with Grand Canyon University. The Professors were very pushy and did not teach me very much. The only thing they have going for them is application teem, They are persistent."
Junior,2,"My experience at Grand Canyon Unversity has been very interesting and uncomfortable. My classes and professors have been very helpful and understanding, but the campus life is a bit different than the average colleges. First, it's not a diverse school which makes it difficult for colored/foreign students like me very hard to ""fit in"". I feel African American students and foreign students don't have much clubs to join and if there are, it is very difficult to be comfortable enough to join. I like how everyone at GCU has a Christian worldview and also they are very nice, but as far as diversity its very poor and that's the one change many students like myself would want to change or improve."
Sophomore,2,The professors weren’t invested into the classroom and student relationship. Student advisors don’t truly care about the student and will give them false information.
Sophomore,2,"DO NOT go here for the Pre-Medicine program if you are trying to get into medical school at some point!  The pre-med program here is broken, in the sense that you are set up for failure (for this specific program) and due to the school attempting to maintain its ""competitive image"", they refuse to be understanding and fair to their students.  A few examples of this: A 93.00% holds a 4.0 GPA weight and if you have a 92.99% you are S.O.L. because no teacher on campus is allowed to round your grade so you will be stuck at a 3.7 GPA for that class; The school does not allow any type of extra credit for any student; They are strictly by the book for excused absences, my fiancee died but because she wasn't immediate family they wouldn't excuse me; the list goes on and on.  IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO TO THIS SCHOOL THEN MAKE SURE YOU USE RATE MY PROFESSOR TO FIND THE BEST ONES AND DO NOT TAKE MORE THAN 2 LAB CLASSES A SEMESTER"
Senior,2,"Grand Canyon University is the place for you if you are interested in your entire education to be forced into the lens of Evangelical Christianity. My professors have been good for the most part, but as someone who is not a person of faith, it has been difficult to be forced to write papers and discussion questions from the Christian perspective."
Sophomore,2,GCU focuses too much on expanding and building but they need to focus more on their students. SSA's  are a MAJOR  problem because there isn't enough of them and most of them do not know what they are talking about. Talk to any student and they will tell you how frustrating they are. They are super disorganized and inconsistent with responding to their emails.  On top of that they are students going to school and trying to help everyone else just so GCU pays for their schooling..They need real employees who are willing to devote their time to students who can answer all the questions  effectively.
Graduate Student,2,"Their doctoral online program was not up to standards. It is a Christian university, but I was not able to take a single Christian course at the doctorate level. The doctoral faculty and advisors are not diverse and I felt were anti-Asian, even though I was a baptized Christian. The dissertation education encouraged ""paraphrasing"" instead of original citations. They claim to use rubrics in grading, but their grading is often based on favoritism."
College Junior,2,what I was going to school for I did not get the classes that I should have gotten in psychology. they work from the last class to the first class. that was a disappointment.
College Sophomore,2,The career option is not as in demand than in state career options.
College Sophomore,2,Your advisor only cares about you until you commit.
College Junior,2,"The online courses are A LOT! The assignments are hefty. Essays upon essays. On top of that, there are discussions questions, 2 a week. Then, 6 to 8 additional posts. Each instructor varies on their idea of a substantive post which makes it hard when taking multiple online courses. The good part is that their is an individual forum where you can communicate with only your professor or another student individually."
College Freshman,2,"SSAs do not try to help you and instead blame things on you, that they did."
College Sophomore,2,I believe online classes are a waist of time and impersonal. They are a bunch of busy work and assignments that aren't for me and some of the online professors arent that great.
College Sophomore,2,"Took very few of my transfer credits, even made me repeat some classes to make sure I was ""on the same level"" as other students. I feel like I paid for an entire semester of repeats."
College Freshman,2,GCU's university success sucked. I didn't learn.
College Freshman,2,It has been very difficult finding a job here on campus.
College Freshman,2,"I dislike the online courses, especially University Success, but I guess they are okay if you need to have less class on ground."
College Junior,2,"It is very had to have that work life balance. I care for a friend who has Lou Gehrig's disease after I get off work plus on weekends. It is very hard for me to find time to do assignments. I wasn't told that there would be this much to do. I was told I wouldn't have to ""put in too much time as smart as I am"". I just wish what people told you would be exact. I am the person who wants honesty in what you tell me. No problem with transferring credits."
College Junior,2,"I currently work 5 days/wk (10 hr/day) plus work in evenings at home caring for someone in my home. I am an online student. The workload for the class is very demanding. You have 2 discussion questions each week that you must answer and respond to another student's post every day for separate days. Plus you have 1-2 assignments each week. One assignment is an individual paper usually about 3 pages long. The other assignment is usually a group assignment. Currently, the curriculum is all theory and theorists and how they pertain to my career. There is not internship opportunities available. I will not be changing jobs. I am just advancing my degree for my current position."
College Junior,2,You only get connections if you suck up.
College Junior,2,It's all about kissing up to who runs the programs.
College Junior,2,They cram too many kids into one class that cannot hold them.
College Junior,2,Everything is on your own and the medical counselors do not help you at all.
College Freshman,2,Career services did not give me any information that would help me.
College Junior,2,"The school lulls you into a false sense off security and BAM you've paid $10,000 more than the original quote and you are living at a boarding school. I initially called the school in April and I was assigned a very eager recruiter named Courtney. She told me to send over my H.S. transcripts and within the hour I was conditionally accepted. I thought that it was slightly suspicious that I was accepted almost immediately, but that was eclipsed by the fact that I didn't have to take my SAT's. The school paid for my flight from LA to go visit the school and I paid my deposit for housing, and things were going fine. I kept noticing however that after my initial enrollment and fee payment Courtney was not calling me or answering my phone calls. I was trying to attempt to get my financial aid taken care of and was directed to Sean Gray. Sean told my parents to submit paperwork to the IRS without letting us know that we would be in review for 2 months minimum. Long story short both of these people avoided my calls and 2 weeks from the start of school I was still not financially clear. At this point we call Sean and he is apparently on vacation and thus unable to answer the phone. We are then given to another financial specialist that tells me I can't start school in 2 weeks. I am not 100% I will be attending school, but we bought tickets already so we just decide to go with all of my stuff. We end up having to call the supervisor and he ends up giving me an extension for my financial aid. This is the way the entire experience of the school feels. You feel like your advisor didn't prepare you and you owe more money than they said you did, but they will give you a little while longer to pay them because they are Christian."
College Freshman,2,"There is almost no alumni connection, so not much alumni network. Career center is just about non-existent"
College Freshman,2,Some professors care about you; everybody drinks
College Freshman,2,Not a culture/campus for the shy personalities
College Freshman,2,They are not helpful at all.
College Sophomore,2,"It look like a lot of people were admit by the school telling them that they are going to do nursing and while the school know for sure that they have a few clinical space,they can take all of them into the program.They now distracting people throughout course harden rethoric question to make people change their major."
College Sophomore,2,"This school took all my federal loan pellgrant and everything,they known that I don't have anybody to support me .They still asking me to paid $1340 semester to add to my  loans.And been full I can't work everyday they frustrating me to withdrew.I sometimes go to class with empty stomach because all my loans are been taking by the school.I don't ve nothing to eat and even place to sleep.I ve to sleep in my car to attend lectures."
College Freshman,2,For my online class it was very difficult to get on contact with the teacher I know many students hated there online class because of this reason and are teacher would ask so much for only one week. I really didn't know anyone in my class or how to reach them so there were times I just talk to people that had the same online class if I had a question. I rather have a class in a classroom then online.
College Senior,2,None of my prior courses transferred to GCU
College Freshman,2,"I believe the education is worth the tuition I paid.  However, my experiences with the financial aid workers has not been positive."
College Junior,2,GCU is expensive for someone who doesn't have much money and it is difficult to find scholarship money online.
College Freshman,2,"While the school I am going to has some of the lowest rates compared to other schools, my school has been known to lower scholarship money and raise the price of housing and meal costs each year."
Graduate Student,1,There were 2 classes that had no personal contact with the professors.  I was told they were adjunct professors and not in their system--meaning that gaining contact with them was either on public boards in the class or not at all.
Graduate Student,1,I have been a student at GCU since fall 2018.  I just completed my last class to get a Master's Degree in History.  I was told that my GPA of 2.99 is below a 3.0 and I would not get a degree. I was told that I had to spend $2500 of my own money to retake a class--to get one hundredth of %1 of a grade.  The icing on the cake was the incorporation of 3 grammatical errors in their 'official' letter. I am currently researching my options to fight this.  The school is a joke and very underhanded from my personal experience. I would not recommend getting involved with this school--there are many better choices available.
Senior,1,"Online teachers are terrible! Even when asked a question they answer with you an do it, The book is a good help. UMMMM so where in the book does it say X,Y,Z??? Because I cant find it have 5 hours of searching. I am working hard and spending the hours needed and with no support it is becoming impossible to pass. I PAY THIS TEACHER she needs to act like it and work."
Senior,1,I have completed 3 years with GCU and I am in my 4th year. The last 2 professors are teaching 4th year classes and are not helpful at all! I am in ECN-351 with professor Audra Sherwood and never get a real answer back from her. She tells me things like the book is a good resource when I told her I could not find the material in the book. We are also not allowed to review our quizzes. The point of a quiz is to have a review for the test. So if you do not get a good grade on the quiz you have no way of finding out what you did wrong and how to fix it. This is MY MONEY paying these professors and I am super angry and will go through every channel possible to be heard and have this fixed. WE PAY FOR PROFESSORS NOT AN AVERAGE JOE TO SIT ON THEIR BUM AND DO NOTHING. DO NOT CHOSE THIS SCHOOL THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR STUDENTS.
Niche User,1,"I was completely unimpressed with GCU. The initial recruiters, who sign you up for GCU, are phenomenal. After that, it is all downhill. Once you are on campus, everything is difficult. 

You have to see an advisor to change your schedule. Students can't even see the course schedule to give input about their own schedule. The on-ground advisors are terrible. I tried to switch my schedule and they dropped me out of my classes but could not get me into the classes I needed to graduate. It was a mess. Absolutely no effort to help me whatsoever from anyone in the advising office. Before you get to campus you are treated like they really want you there. Once you get there, it's another story altogether. It feels like this school only wants your money and doesn't care about you as a student.

Also, forget about online classes. You can only take one class per 7.5 week term, because they don't have enough classes available. This means it takes forever to graduate. 

Not impressed."
Niche User,1,"I was not impressed with the online learning environment. First, you can only take one class per 7.5 week term. This means it takes longer to finish. They make you take their College Success Skills class first, and this does not transfer to any other schools. I had high hopes for GCU, and it disappointed me on every level."
Junior,1,"Severely poorly run school. The student service counseling section of the school is terrible. Time and time again, I have found ""errors"" in my billing at GCU. So far, they have cost me over two thousand dollars extra because of their mistakes. When the issue was brought up, the student services counselor screamed at me on the phone, saying its not her fault, and hung up on me. It was never corrected by the school. Most recently found an error for seven hundred dollars that would have been lost had I not caught the error in a timely manner this time around. It seems the counselors only job is the get the student off the phone and not answer any of their questions. People who have over head my phone calls with them are all shocked at how poor they are. I can't help but think there are students who don't pay close attention to their billing that are being taken advantage of at GCU. I advise you not to attend this school and if you do, pay very close attention to your billing."
Niche User,1,With the rubic virginian standard of christian quality  heritage soundas theopsychosis.  Only god deserving individuals het their student loans processed accurately and done in a timely manner.  Only God deserving sounds pharisees...from christian..in a native Indian setting
Graduate Student,1,The online program is just a set of questions and answers that are already preset. The teachers grade you by clicking a button. There is real no thought that goes into their grading system of feedback. It's all generic and automated. Don't waste your money if you value your education.
Freshman,1,"I have never seen a more dysfunctional school. They say they are all for their students but they really only care about themselves. I lasted a semester. The school will do ANYTHING to get your money. They are very selfish. Communication with the school is impossible. Good luck trying to get anyone to call you back let alone answer. I attended when I was hurt and broke some bones, and I thought I had no worries since their ""morals"" were so inclusive. They left me high and dry. I met the rudest people ever when talking to the disabilities office. I missed tests because people forgot to give them to me when I called. I would 100% never recommend this school to anyone. I'd usually never come onto a site to say things about a place but for this I have to. Don't attend!"
Graduate Student,1,"The lack of knowledge and ethics, at least in the online learning sector, is palpable.  I never realized how badly I was treated until I enrolled in another grad program, outside of GCU.  GCU has advisors that are unknowledgeable and then they blame it on the student.  Worst college or even school experience of my life - unacceptable!"
Freshman,1,"My freshmen year I had terrible roommates.They were beyond trifling.They also wouldn't arrange the room so everyone was comfortable.But that isn't the worst part; when I tried to get my room changed they told me to wait until the second semester only to be told in January I couldn't move and ""I should be more understanding"" when I asked could I pay the extra money to be roomed with a friend they told me no.It had to be a random move and also said all the doubles were full which was clearly a lie.Also,since I was advised to wait till next semester to see whether I could move, instead of leaving the first semester I was charged over $3,000 for housing I could barely live in.I was eventually forced to withdraw from the whole University.Now I am in a University that actually cares for their students.One their genEd classes also rubbed me the wrong way when they asked students to come up with derogatory stereotypes for Black people,Hispanic people and Asian people."
Sophomore,1,"GCU is a catfish of a school. It presents itself one way but is completely different in all reality. I was so excited to go here and now I cannot wait to get out. Every dorm has different rules and different regulations which is completely ridiculous. Not to mention RAs completely over step boundaries and abuse their authority. Not to mention completely invade privacy and the only response is that ""I signed an agreement."" Excuse me but I do not ever remember being OK with a random person (still do not know who it was) coming into my room WHEN IM SLEEPING. The teachers do not teach. Giving kids an online program and expecting them to learn is not teaching. Finally the school is sexist. I've had male security guards and say its been this way for years."
Junior,1,"The classes are basically self-taught if you are using online. The professors barely interact in the classes. The classes consist of one or two textbooks, forum participation requirements, and an assignment due at the end of each week. You pay a ridiculous amount to just be reading a textbook and writing essays. The financial situations are messed up as well, because it is organized in a way that is hard to tell what you are really being charged for. The school counselors are rude. I went from expecting to graduate in four years to now looking like it is going to take five. Some of the required classes have nothing to do with generals or degree requirements."
Alum,1,"GCU is, by far, the biggest scam in Phoenix.  The school is too concerned about scamming their students for money than they are educating students to be successful.  The school has NO variety, is subtly racist, and only cares about their image.  Students aren't allowed to bring groceries from their car to their room without a $150 ticket, a carton of eggs is $6, and students who live in apartments are still required to pay $750 for a campus meal plan.  I wish I would have gone to ASU."
Graduate Student,1,This school is a joke.  I was in the online program for a Masters and quit in 6 weeks because I wasn't learning a thing. It was basically Independent Study where you read something and then post a 200 word comment about it and then comment on 2 other people's submissions a week. Ridiculous.  The technical problems were also unbearable. My professor quit after 2.5 weeks since she couldn't get any help from IT.  Don't waste your time if you really want an education.
Senior,1,I wouldn't recommend this program. I had so much trouble and confusion with my schedule and when I was going to be done with the program. It was hard to reach my student service counselor which changed during the program. I was told I was done with the program and three weeks later find out that I am not done. It took more than 10 months to tell me that I needed to take a class over. I was also told I was going to get a class refunded by check by mail and it has been weeks and have not received the check.
Alum,1,"Short story: Their academics suck & they just want your money.
Long story: I got my BS in marketing at GCU. Overall, the only thing that made GCU worthwhile was the oncampus experience; their academics did not prepare me for a career. 
A few years later, I decided to change careers and go into comp science. When I requested info from GCU, the admissions counselor told me I had to enroll now and, feeling pressured, I regretfully chose to go back to GCU.
Each class had major issues. I had a class where literally every student in the course reported the professor to their academic advisers and several of us contacted the dean (who never responded). Beyond academics, my student services counselor was not only unhelpful but a hindrance during my time at GCU. 
I've since transferred and, trust me, there are way better options out there. You are going to spend a lot of money at school, spend it somewhere that's going to provide quality services and treat you like a person- not a cash cow."
Graduate Student,1,"I started my Masters degree program online at GCU in 2013. I completed all of my coursework minus the student teaching component 2 years ago. I took the Required Go To training on my phone on my way back from Leavenworth to start my student teaching the next semester. I applied and got everything in on time. Nothing happened, so I just continued working as a 1:1. Fast forward to 2017. I applied yet again by the deadline of February 2017 for student teaching in the fall of 2017. I did not hear anything until I basically pestered them in June of 2017. They then had a placement for me that was confirmed on August 3, 2017. I got a call saying that I would have to wait until Spring of 2018 on August 24, 2017. GCU decided that 2 more classes were needed. I filed an appeal that I had already completed all of my coursework—-I had even gotten a grad box congratulating me in 2015—I was denied. So, I had to file an appeal to be able to take classes which was approved the day school started."
Alum,1,"This ""University"" was one of the worst experiences in my life. Constant tunover of advisors, high pressure tactics to get you to sign up, They will literally tell you anything, true or not, to get your financial aid money. I stupidly believed what I was told and regretted it later! Get everything in writing. I was told that I was given a "" scholarship"" then later told it was an ""error"" and I had to pay back over $2000 to receive my degree. Look elsewhere!!! Preferably find a non profit school!!!"
Junior,1,"I didn't believe what people were telling me about GCU just wanting my money until I got here. My freshman year went so well and I felt like this school really cared for me and what I wanted to do. After that it went all down hill. They don't hold up to any of the promises that they make to you when you visit as a discover student. My counselor screwed me out of 5,000 dollars this semester because they said I needed summer classes when I didn't. This means I have to pay over 1,000 dollars monthly on a students budget. They don't care that I pay for things on my own or that my parents don't help me pay. Don't do what I did find a better school that will actually care about you as a student not a paycheck!"
Freshman,1,This school is horrible!!!! Their teachers do not respond in a timely manner you write them and it can take up to 2 weeks to get a answer to a question that you need answer for a assignment that’s due that week! This is not just one teacher but at least 5 out of the 7 I had. You bring it to their supervisor and they act like it’s not a problem and always side with the teacher. Yes they should be called professors but they don’t teach at that leave. The whole campus staff is a joke!!! I could go in and on but I don’t have the time! I would not go to this school
Freshman,1,"This place is awful, the academics are terrible and the school only cares about making student life better. Maybe they should focus on academics and making their case as a Christian university more believable because everyone knows that this place is the least Christian, Christian university in America. The students are very immature and it really feels like I'm in high school again."
Sophomore,1,"Students are not welcoming. I have been going here for two years, and I still feel like an outsider. GCU is very unorganized and they are more focused on the growth of their school than the students. However, I love how the teachers approach the classroom."
Senior,1,"For 3 years I have been working on my Bachelors of Science in Elementary Education and Special Education. The support I have received from my SSA has not been timely and quite frankly has bothered me for a long time. A lot of people have dropped the ball on me and I am a 4.0 GPA student. I have worked hard and am on the President's List and yet they offer no commencement celebrations here anywhere in Florida.  I was hoping to walk with the high honors I have worked so hard for. Scholarships have not been an avenue my SSA has helped me to explore. If you don't want help, want to pay around 2k per class, and feel like just another number and meal ticket then this is the school for you. I started out as this school being a Christian school, but it is far from it in the way they treat a student of such high caliber as myself. I can only imagine how they treat someone who has a lower GPA. I regret beginning here, and if I was not so close to finishing I would transfer ASAP!!"
College Sophomore,1,They wont let you transfer credits to other schools.
College Sophomore,1,The nursing program is extremely competitive.
College Freshman,1,Online courses demand 20x more than ground courses and professors expect their class to be your number one priority
College Freshman,1,"Career services at GCU do not help underclassman find jobs on campus, they focus only on helping juniors and seniors"
College Freshman,1,They're a waste of time.
College Freshman,1,They always say things are over staffed.
College Junior,1,They screw you over with classes and take your scholarships away from you and make it difficult to earn them back.
College Junior,1,IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. The teachers are always behind with putting in grades.
College Freshman,1,"Once you are finished with your studies, you are on your own. Don't expect anything after that."
College Freshman,1,The school doesn't really do anything for you when it comes to careers in the future. They get your money and give you your grades. Nothing more.
College Freshman,1,"This school is very pathetic. All the school cares about is taking your money. The food on campus seems good at first because there are restaurants that are popular, but when you eat three times a day and only have eight places to choose from your favorite fast food places become dreadful to think about. The school is a ""Christian"" campus yet it feels like all they care about is getting your offering and moving on. THERE IS NO GREEK LIFE, so don't expect that. THIS SCHOOL IS IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THE WORST NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE COUNTRY. This is NOT a COLLEGE CAMPUS but a fenced in neighborhood keeping the people on the outside out for a reason. If you are interested in aviation this might be the school because the police helicopter flies over all the time with the spot light out. IF YOU HAVE BEEN ON A DISCOVERY TRIP TO VISIT THE SCHOOL, take into consideration that it is a very unrealistic view of the school and this school is not actually like that. I WOULD SERIOUSLY LOOK INTO THESE FACTORS BEFORE CONSIDERING TO GO TO GCU FOR YOUR COLLEGE."
College Freshman,1,"As a government major, I cannot enroll in any classes because it's a ""new"" program?"
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, I came here with  high hopes and an understanding that given it was a private Christian school, it may not be the typical college experience. However, I did not know that it would be NO college experience. I am not a troublemaker, partier by any means, but this is simply an extension of high school. I could go on and on about how they make it seem like a caring, compassionate, down to earth school but DO NOT fall for it. All they care about is their reputation. They'll genuinely care about you to reel you in, but once you're here, forget it. You will not be remembered or cared for. Meeting with a student service advisor for classes ,schedules changes, and other matters is near impossible. 

Here is my current situation to illustrate it for you: so I got a violation for having a boy in my room at 11:30pm with the door closed (I am 19...? we were writing an essay?) and have to do community service. They gave me a month to do it. I am busy with school and work so it was a bit hard to complete, so I looked into the consequences to see what would happen and it specifically said ""hold on housing application/no schedule changes."" My schedule for the next semester was already set and I am not living here next year, so I didn't sweat it.

It is now the first day of semester 2, and have been un-enrolled from ALL of my classes, meaning I do not get to be in a class and go to it until I finish community service. THEY TOOK AWAY MY CLASSES FOR BEING IN A ROOM WITH A BOY. To make matters worse, there is no one you can go to, talk to, get help on the matter with at all. This is a sorry excuse for an institution, I highly recommend you go to a REAL college. Skip this place, trust me you will not like it. Every freshmen I talk to regrets it because we were all tricked into thinking it was GRAND. Nope, just a personal hell (ironically)."
College Freshman,1,"If you enjoy long walks while dodging public safety golf carts, listening to the sweet sound of construction, and smelling the glorious aroma of manure, this university is the place for you. Not only will you be constantly woken up at all hours of the night to the ever so repetitive sound of the fire alarm that has yet to lead to an actual fire, but you also have the opportunity of setting off yet another alarm by trying to use the locked emergency exit doors. Guess all the students will just have to pile down one flight of stairs? But fear not my weary college explorer, GCU provides plenty of opportunities such as: daily comedy shows called classes, weekly chapel sessions treated as a punishment, basketball games that cost real money you probably won't have come basketball season, and fast food options that will make freshmen 15 your new reality. With a heavy heart, I must conclude my review and return to my tremendous life college hunting under the scorching Phoenix sun. Go Lopes!"
College Freshman,1,I do not think that this school is worth the time or money that I am paying. It is probably the worst University in Arizona. They offer so many scholarships because no one wants to go here and for good reason. The music classrooms are old converted office buildings that are off campus. The choir and students have very low professionalism and the school seems to spend most of its money building dorms for future students instead of focusing on the ones that they have. The only good thing about it is how easy the A's are to get because the teachers baby you.
College Freshman,1,I will not be returning to Grand Canyon University.
College Student,1,"It's just bad. I've pretty much said it all in my previous answers. I would (and have) warned people about GCU. It's all around awful. Poorly run, judgmental people, looks shiny on the outside but it's a train wreck on the inside."
College Student,1,There is no value of a degree from GCU.
College Student,1,"Class registration is awful. This school used to be small (1,000 students) about 5 years ago, but now it's 58,000 students. It grew too big for it's own good. With a small school having students have to meet with advisors to sign up for classes, makes sense, but with 58,000 students, it's awful. It's so inconvenient, and they ignore you at all costs. It's so hard to get into classes you want. Ugh, it's just awful. I would advise anybody against going to this school solely because of the class registration process. I'm infuriated just thinking about it."
College Freshman,1,they give very few jobs to freshman; some sophomores; juniors and seniors mostly seem to have jobs
College Freshman,1,Alot of the techers here are terrible with replying to messages and are very unaccommodating
College Freshman,1,i feel like i have learned nothing and am taking unnecessary courses
College Freshman,1,the professors never answer messages until a week after assignments are due
College Freshman,1,"I hate it, The wifi always crashes, professors never answer messages about anything. If you have a ccsc dont bother the volunteer head lady is very rude and its not worth the 5000 your best option is to try to get the higher gpa scholarships"
College Senior,1,"As a non-traditional student, I had nothing. I had some links I could click on, but was not reached out to or congratulated on my hard work and 4.0 GPA."
Recent Alumnus,1,Our online instructor was awful disappeared for 2 weeks at a time and changed assignments on the day they were due
College Junior,1,This school cares about us as students. They understand that  majority of the students there are parents going back to school. They understand that we need to be able to find classes that works with our schedule and if we are not doing good in class-they will check in with us to see what we can do.
College Freshman,1,I chose this because I am not able to get any financial aid because of previous schools I attend. I used all the money that I was eligible to get and I thought that this was not fair.
College Junior,1,"I have had a difficult time working with my current academic counselor, she does not answer her phone when I contact her on her direct line and it takes her at least a week to return my calls.  The employment office has not been able to bother trying to help me find even a minimum wage job, even though I have gone through several counseling sessions, stressing my 4.0 gpa and my dire need for employment. I have made several requests for help from the career center and they are not helpful."
College Freshman,1,I hated my online courses
College Senior,1,They charge for anything they can come up with.
College Senior,1,"SOoooo  many useless required online courses.
"
College Sophomore,1,Jobs are offered at school but you hardly get any hours and it pays minimum wage
Recent Alumnus,1,I'm am not able to continue because I have a current balance
Recent Alumnus,1,Not receiving the assistance I feel I deserve considering the cost of education

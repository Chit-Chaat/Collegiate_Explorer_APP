Junior,5,"Through COVID, they have performed very well at communicating any changes and many ways to help students be successful and safe. They really care about their students."
Junior,5,"Considering almost everything is online, I have never had to wait long at all to get a response on anything (professors, registration, financial aid, etc.) The school has adapted quite well and makes students a priority. As well as helping students to become more proactive in their educational paths. I have enjoyed my online experience and hope I can safely attend on campus classes (if I don't graduate first)."
Niche User,5,"In regards to any question or clarification throughout my application process, Fort's staff has been exceptional. With constant updates and reminders, you can rest assured application process and any help will be easy and available. The staff of Fort Lewis really personalizes with each student and makes you feel important- not just another applicant and/or student.  With even more flexibility, you don't have to contact strictly through email but also text right off of your phone!"
Niche User,5,"Personally I planned on attending Fort Lewis College in the Fall 2020 semester but with change of plans I was unable. However with how great the staff is on communication on its applicants, I have the same expectation for online learning at Fort. I'm fully confident professors and overall online learning is at the top."
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful experience as a Public Health major with a certificate in GIS. My favorite parts were the small class sizes, which allowed me to establish great relationships with my peers and professors, as well as living in Durango. It is a small, rural, public school- so I do feel like there may not be some of the same opportunities as a bigger and more well funded school. However, it is absolutely doable to seek out opportunity if you just look for it."
Sophomore,5,"Fort Lewis College has many great attributes like their diversity, location Colorado, friendly professors, and food. They give back to their community especially to those that were taken from, which were the Native Americans. They give us Native Americans free tuition."
Sophomore,5,My experience having classes online was great. The teachers are lenient and very understanding to those who don’t have access to WiFi or computers. Overall a great experience.
Freshman,5,"With my experience of online classes are organized because they use the same format that is similar to the program that my high school used. It's like learning in class because you can see your Professor and directions that they give are simple. The only tiny problem is have to figure if they are going to be holding classes on the day that they scheduled or just cancel class that day. Or another situation is the Professors having to change their minds of changing the class day of meeting in person instead of online, but they will email you that morning or the day before which is a plus. Learning online is not hard to figure out because this generation of students have at least had some experience with technology, like their phone's, tablets, and laptop/computers."
Freshman,5,"I am a first year. My experience so far on campus is great, even students and stuff on the campus are very nice and helpful. I go comfortable with the living space and environment on campus. I would love to explore for with my time on campus."
Junior,5,Fort Lewis is a great place to go... There are lots of people you can meet and the professor's are able to help you.
Junior,5,"I have loved my experience at Fort Lexis college, the two main perks for me would have to be the athletic and the Native culture. Being on the women's lacrosse team has created a new family that has helped me out all two years of college. Being raised in Oregon there aren't that many native people but going to the Fort has given the opportunity to meet people with the same culture."
Freshman,5,I have done zoom calls with Fort Lewis due to coronavirus and not being able to visit campus. But the calls have always been well organized and very helpful.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love the school. The students and staff are so welcoming and friendly. The campus is beautiful and the academics are outstanding.
Freshman,5,"During my freshman year at the Fort I instantly fell in love with the atmosphere, attitude and breathable environment. The campus almost feels hidden above the town Durango. At such a high altitude I loved the freedom to hike the numerous trails around the campus and town. With many opportunists to apply for different classes and majors from business, geology and fine arts I loved the flexibility the college offers for local and abroad students."
Sophomore,5,"Fort Lewis College is unique. The campus itself is open, almost like one with nature. One moment you see a raccoon, and the second you turn a corner, you're face-to-face with a deer. Not only that, but the campus is built on top of a hill, so there is a beautiful view on the west side of campus. Fort Lewis College has a homey feeling to it, well for me it is. The professors here are great; they are helpful and committed to their jobs in helping the students here."
Freshman,5,"I had four classes online and my professors were able to make a swift transition to online learning by recording lectures, and having more office hours, while changing the basic dynamic of how the class operated on grading levels, by more heavily weighting everything that was done online as opposed to the previously done in person classwork."
Freshman,5,"Fort lewis college offers tuition free to all Native American, they have a huge amount of different nationality. It's a one on one learning experience the professor will get to know your name in the classroom therefor a small school. Everyone us nice and friendly. They offer great majors especially in mine ( Business management area) its great for my own personality as well just how fit it is. I know I'll do great attending fort lewis."
Freshman,5,"Though I am still currently attending Fort Lewis College, my experiences so far could not be more memorable. While managing both academics and athletics at the college level, Fort Lewis provides numerous resources to make this possible. The faculty and administrators go out of their way to assist you on your pathway to success. I am overall very pleased with my decision of choosing Fort Lewis College to continue my academic and athletic career. Fort Lewis offers a very welcoming atmosphere for students all around the world, and I feel proud to be a Skyhawk! Truly, Fort Lewis College has given me a great college experience, and I can't wait to continue another three years at this institution that I call home."
Alum,5,"Fort Lewis College provided the academic, athletic, and recreational resources that I needed to become the successful person that I dreamed of becoming."
Alum,5,"A great small school with a lot to offer.  Small class sizes, so a lot of individual attention.  Tons of outside activities to do in both summer and winter.  Small town, so you can walk or ride your bike to get to most places.  Professors care about your success, and treat you with respect."
Freshman,5,"Fort Lewis is one of the best mountain colleges anyone can ask for. Their campus is nicely planned out, the class sizes are on the smaller side which creates opportunity for one on one with professors. They have fantastic program opportunities and you are not just a number at The Fort, staff and students really care for you, your well-being and mental health."
Freshman,5,"As a student who isn’t as social but would like to be. There are a lot of friendly people on campus that actually want to help you and want to be friends. Through my whole semester there I had not experienced a negative encountering. Also because I am a transfer student that came from a university college, It’s good to see the difference in schools. The school seems to be based on support and understanding, instead of feeling like you are by yourself and have no idea what to do. There are many friendly faces and once you get out there and talk to someone it’s easy to feel like you’re apart of a loving group."
Junior,5,"The environment and vibes of this school are out of this world! I enjoy the people within this school and the amount of hands-on experience that you get from this college. Something about this town being small, but not too small just makes me feel more connected to the community and its values as a mountain town."
Freshman,5,Fort Lewis College is a great college and it is a four year college. It is a great experience and a good way to start off your college. I like about Fort Lewis is the people are nice and they can help you with anything. I would like to change about Fort Lewis is people helping students with finical aid early and getting them started for the next semester.
Senior,5,The performance of the students at Fort Lewis aren't indicative of how good the professors are there. Great place if you like beer and the outdoors.
Senior,5,"It's a great school,  in a small town. From applying to starting school it's been a good experience.  On my second semester now."
Freshman,5,"As a second term freshman, there's not much I can say. All I know is that I love the campus and the environment is comfortable. I love it here."
Sophomore,5,I came here to experience learning about the great outdoors through their one of a kind Adventure Education program. This school regardless of the department is very student focused all the way down to class ratios. I recommend it for anyone wanting a sentimental education and for whoever seeks REAL hands on experience and networking for jobs/internships!
Sophomore,5,"I not only love the atmosphere, and the city itself, but the people that make up the city are just incredibly wonderful. The professors care with out a doubt, and not to mention the opportunity for fun and adventure is endless."
Freshman,5,"Applying and getting accepted to Fort Lewis was a breeze. Being able to talk to any one included in the faculty and staff made me feel like I was valued and all my questions were answered quickly. I truly enjoy my time on campus and I find it so easy to meet people, what with all the clubs and events they have."
Sophomore,5,"The outdoor experience, friends, awesome town, and education! I went to almost all of the athletic games and it was an awesome experience. Skiing, hiking, camping are just minutes away. Awesome school activities which includes intramurals and a great workout gym. Met some of the best friends I'll ever meet and I have never regretted my decision choosing this college."
Sophomore,5,"I love just about everything about the Fort (as us Skyhawks call it). The classes are simultaneously engaging and challenging. The dorms generate a tight-knit community. The food is a tad bit on the boring side but that's remedied by the fact that Durango is full of places offering delicious food. Finally, what is perhaps the Fort's most striking feature is the fact that it sits atop a mesa, which provides a spectacular view of the Durango area."
Freshman,5,"I am nearing the end of my first year of college here at The Fort and I couldn't be more satisfied. I have learned so much in classes and about myself this past year that I don't think I could have done anywhere else. I was definitely shocked at how laid back people are here and shocked at how little ""typical"" college parties are here. Overall: good people, good lessons, chill party scene."
Freshman,5,I haven't started there yet but I've visited many times and I enjoy it every time I go. I can't wait to start there this coming fall.
Freshman,5,"The Fort is very laid back, with great teachers. It's a great place to meet a vast variety of people and make friends."
Sophomore,5,One of the things that Fort Lewis College has going for it is that the staff and the students that go there tend to be helpful. The professors will work with the students to ensure that the professors can do the most that they can to help the students succeed. Fort Lewis also makes an effort to let the students know about available resources and opportunities. There are plenty of places on and around campus for the students to study. There is tutoring available and there is also a writing center for the students to receive help. There are also plenty of clubs and other opportunities for the students to become connected with the staff and other students.
Freshman,5,"Fort Lewis College is amazing. This wasn’t my first choice of college, it was my second but overall I’m really loving it. The campus is great, academics/professors are very understanding also helpful, student life is the best I’ve experienced and I love the scenery so much. You get to have a full-college experience and have so many opportunities in & outside of campus. 100% recommended!"

Senior,5,Small town college a step up from a community college. Professors know your name and you are not just a number. The environment is very beautiful and full of outdoor activities. People are friendly and surrounded with good food.
Junior,5,"My favorite fact about Fort Lewis College is the classroom size. The classroom size is less than thirty to a classroom. Its the ideal place if you are new to college. I was accustomed to it because I transferred from a community college. Also, due to the classroom size. The professors offer more one on one instruction."
Senior,5,I've had a wonderful experience so far being at FLC. I am a non-traditional student who has transferred here and I have had nothing but positive experiences with staff and faculty.
Freshman,5,"Since beginning at Fort Lewis, I have been focused and confident in my work. There are multiple resources for everything and anything on campus. As a student it is easy to connect with other students and find ways to be engaged on campus.  It is also easy and very encouraged to talk to your instructors and they always have time for you if your willing to communicate with them."
Junior,5,"My time at Fort Lewis was excellent. The classes were diverse and interesting. The professors were professional and very kind (except the yoga teacher, but he’s gone now). I regret that I had to leave Fort Lewis and look forward to returning. The area is beautiful, the people are quirky and friendly. The college is great at supporting and encouraging students to take advantage of the many outdoor sports in the area, from frisbee golf to ice climbing. The bike and hiking trails both on campus and in town are endless and entertaining. The local food is great, the community is fun and the landscape is breathtaking."
Alum,5,"Fort Lewis is a great 4 year undergraduate school that deserves the best and graduates the best,  It has great majors, and offers two masters programs."
Junior,5,Fort Lewis is a beautiful college! So many opportunities with amazing professors and assistance to succeed!

Freshman,5,Fort Lewis along with its community is an awesome place to be. Nothing but welcoming arms. One thing I would like to see change is the participation with school events. Individuals need to take an adventure sometime.
Niche User,5,"Fort Lewis College is a great place for people who want to get away from their hometown but question living the city life. FLC is located in Durango, Colorado which is a town with plenty of outdoor activities and various places to eat. The school and town are interconnected; sharing a history that compliments one another. This place can help any student step outside their norm and feel comfortable about finding themselves."
Freshman,5,"Me experience has been really amazing. Being apart of the John F. Reed Honors Program has led me to make connections with people and faculty. The sense of community is amazing here on campus. I'm proud to live and go to school in such a wonderful, beautiful state. The Professors are willing and wanting to help at any moment. My peer are as excited to be here as I am. The activism here on campus is great, having multiple organizations to join."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the small class sizes, this ensures a teacher-student relationship and, as a student, I feel more apt to engaging."
Sophomore,5,I really like being a student at the Fort. Anytime I have needed anything whether it be a bit more time to finish an assignment to getting around campus. Everyone that I have interacted with at Fort Lewis College has been real helpful. I really love the professors and administrators in the Education Department. You can tell that they really want you to succeed.
Freshman,5,I liked the experience of being at college in my first semester. On-campus living made getting to class a breeze. The professors made an effort to get to know you and help you when you need. The classes are taught with style to learn from the professors. There are resources available on campus within just a five or fifteen minute walk.
Niche User,5,"Fort Lewis College has a breath taking scenery and campus that makes you at home and also part of nature. They have amazing clubs that are student run and have many Native American clubs. It is almost free to most Native Americans, so applying and entering the school is very easy. Fort Lewis is never a dull place, as it is Durango that is very lively and full of adventures."
Niche User,5,I was Amazing. Everything is so vibrant and energetic. Everyone was so nice and the area was very beautiful.
Freshman,5,"Fort Lewis offers so many activities, people, and events that will always keep you busy and entertained. The outdoor life here is incredible. There are so many activities that one can do such as, mountain bike, raft, fish, hunt, cliff dive, cave explore, ski, and so many more things. You will never get bored in a place like Durango. The academics are good as a whole. The teachers and all other staff are so helpful and willing which adds ease to the college experience. I would not want to go to any other school."
Freshman,5,My experience here at the college is great so far. The classes are not so big which gives me the opportunity to talk and interact with my professors. The diversity here shocked me. The people here are really nice and outgoing. The town is great. The life on campus has been great. 
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is not all that huge, but i love that about it! The location is in the mountains, where everything is so natural and beautiful. There are deer roaming the campus, and occasionally walk with you to class (not exaggerating). The classes are smaller than universities which makes it easier for the professor to get to know the students and help accommodate to their learning abilities and preferences. Professors and helpful and very open minded. There are a wide variety of courses offered, and since it is a liberal arts school, it is important in the curriculum for there to be a little of every subject, not only to learn about your major, but it is important to be well rounded in all subjects, to know and be able to pertain to all information around you. Most professors even love to be involved in outdoor activities with students in clubs, and also have class outside and not in the classrooms most days. It is a great and immersiable experience here at Fort Lewis College."
College Sophomore,5,"The value of a degree for this school will be well worth the money, the professors are incredibly set on helping students as an individual and not treating them as a number on the roaster, but as an actual person to get to know. the techniques of each professor are amazing, and they all make me excited to share the knowledge that they pass on to me."
College Sophomore,5,"I just attended a Glow in the dark Run, called Light Up the Night on campus, where we were given glowsticks, and black light paint and black lights, and took pictures. There was also a speaker, food, and drinks. The main goal of the event was for people to become more aware of how serious Sexual Abuse and Assault is. It was a 5k run and 1k walk i support of the social issue, and it was amazingly influential. I gained a lot of support and talk. This week there is also a supportive run on Suicide Prevention, with a candle light vigil and speaker that I will also definitely be attending!"

Freshman,4,Small community schools and living allowed for me to form closer connections with my peers and professors.
Junior,4,"The campus is so pretty and i love how diverse it is! it's so easy to make friends with everyone.  the teachers are really good at working with you, even if you need one on one conversations!  the advisors are always there to keep you updated and let you know if you need certain requirements. the transfer councilor really works with you, especially if you need help with financials! in the dorms and or on campus apartments its so easy to get along with your roommates.  they ask you questions and try to pair you with the best compatible person, unless you have a roommate already picked out!"

There are many resources for new students to feel comfortable. The community outside of the college is awesome. Durango is a town that is very strong. All sports are locally supported, and other clubs that are hereon campus."
Graduate Student,4,"Fort Lewis College is located in beautiful Durango, Colorado. I love the area and the community. The college is small and allows you to develop relationships with your professors. As a health sciences major, I wish the program was developed more. However, the college is working to improve this area of study. The geology program and business programs are popular at the college."
Niche User,4,My experience at Fort Lewis College was for a college tour. From what I saw everyone was nice and it had a good aura around it. They offered students on campus activities.

Niche User,4,Fort Lewis is a beautiful campus with so much to do. The community is safe and friendly with someone is always willing to assist you. It is a smaller school with smaller classes so you are sure to get the help you need. Your professors are going to help you till you get it right.
Sophomore,4,I went to the local high school and then when to a private college in Missouri and decided to transfer back to my hometown and go to the Fort. The school its self is beautiful with an over look of an even more beautiful town.  I won't say all the students all amazing because that would be a lie. But so far most everyone I have met really wants to be there.  The professors seem passionate about what they teach and how the teach.
Freshman,4,My experience at Fort Lewis College was great! friendly environment in a great little town that is not to crowded. With great opportunities to enjoy the outdoor environment. and great professors and wonderful programs.
Junior,4,"Fort Lewis College is centered in a small outdoorsy town that offers many degrees to pursuit your career choice. Their faculty loves the impact they have on their students and are very focused on the students' wishes upon the school. This school waives tuition for Indigenous people that meet the requirements upon tribal enrollment and the school occupies the land of Ute natives, as well as the Navajo tribe, Dine. So this school is very supportive and surrounded with Native American culture, identity and events."
Junior,4,"The faculty is amazing. I transferred here from a bigger university. Being on a first name basis with your professors is something I never really experienced before. When you're at a place like Fort Lewis you really feel like you're a part of the institution, not just someone in the background like in bigger institutions."

As we tour around the tour guides were very helpful and resourceful on any question you ask. I would like to go there again.
Freshman,4,"The scenery itself is beautiful! This made me feel right at home. I love how classes are just right there. Walking distance is about 10-15 minute walk, depending on where your classes are located. It has just the right amount of students who applied here as year, if you compare it to another college, or say university their population is much more than Durango."
Freshman,4,"Although I've only been here for about a week, they seem very friendly. Their food service - Sodexo, could be better quality. However, the classes, programs, and people are all very good. The location couldn't be better."
Senior,4,The school's location and the professors are amazing. It is a beautiful setting with a very peaceful campus. The professors are incredible and always willing to help. The administration is the only aspect that is lacking in strength.

Freshman,4,"Fort Lewis College is in a great location with a friendly environment. I like the look of the campus, and dorms as they fit my college experience.

It's a very diverse school that has other native americans like myself, which makes me more comfortable in the environment."
Alum,4,"Fort Lewis College is a school where students can participate in multiple club activities and sports. As an alumnus, I have had the chance to enjoy my college life by entering in the AIGA club on campus. This club is for graphic designers to participate in different activities that improves a designers skills and knowledge. Fort Lewis College also has programs like TRIO that help students improve academically and have resources for one-on-one tutoring. What I like about this college is that professors help students achieve in their academic skills by setting real-life examples in the classroom and in grading. What Fort Lewis can improve on would be having more financial advisors that can help students who have deeper problems within financial needs."
Freshman,4,"Overall a good school. Beautiful town and surrounding area, lots to do outdoors. School itself is alright."
Sophomore,4,"I love the people and the environment, but the location is kinda sucky if you're looking for public transportation out of town or things to do. I prefer the city life."

Sophomore,4,"I can't tell if i'm on vacation or actually going to a college in Durango, Colorado. I end class at 11 in the morning and use the rest of the day to train for cycling season and then do a little bit of homework then spend time with friends. I then tend to stress out during the end of the semester because of finals, but the professors are so caring, they REALLY WANT YOU TO SUCCEED!"
Sophomore,4,"I really loved how small the classes were compared to big universities. The campus is just the right size not too big, not too small. All the necessary things you need are not too far from campus. There are a lot of outdoor activities for people who love being outside. Durango is also a very beautiful town."
Senior,4,"I am a non-traditional student at FLC.  I'm older than many of my classmates, so I don't live in the dorms on campus, or go to many college parties.  However, academically, I think the college is very underrated.  Since it's a smaller school students get more opportunities to get one-on-one help from instructors.  The professors I've had in the FLC business school so far are some of the best I've had; I'm usually able to meet with them for extra course help, and when I've had trouble with a difficult assignment some of the ones I've had are able to explain the concept in a way that is easy for me to understand.  My last school was a larger university, and it was a good school but very easy to get lost in the crowd."
Niche User,4,"I went and visited Fort Lewis as an incoming freshman and the campus was amazing. It is a very outgoing, hands-on type of school, and you can tell the kids enjoy that aspect. Many kids were out involved in activities, and one class was even having their lesson outside. the only downside is they didn't have the program that I was wishing to take. "
Freshman,4,I really like the campus and how it's not of a huge college. There is space for you to explore. The people here are very nice; the students and the villagers.

College Sophomore,4,"The dorm's offer greta opportunities. There is an option for professor in residence, in select dorms on campus. RA's are very helpful and always there in case of questions concerning housing supplies like cleaning materials, i.e.. mop, broom, vacuum. There is also the possibility of living on campus in Adventure House where you are able to be in school, live on campus, and be immersed in social activities like hiking, learning outdoor skills, how to rock climb, ice-sbhooing, who to build your own portable stove, and other wilderness survival skills while backpacking."
College Freshman,4,The school seems very diverse and open to new ideas and ways of life.
College Freshman,4,Health office is clean and efficient. Campus seems very safe.
College Freshman,4,"Campus housing seems to be fairly nice, some dorms better than others."

College Freshman,4,"There are posters all around my residence hall promoting no alcohol, drug usage, and sexual assault. The school provides numbers and contact information if something were to happen."

College Freshman,4,Fort Lewis is a great college to find yourself and learn about yourself every single day. The campus is breathtaking and every day I am eager to learn. The professors make it exciting to come to class.
College Junior,4,"I never felt threatened by a student or faculties. The on campus police are helpful, very little if any violent crime takes place on campus, and security is very tight."
College Junior,4,Haven't done a lot with the athletics department. The few times I did go to the student wellness center I was very impressed by the quality. It is a school with a wide variety of exercise options.
College Junior,4,"The professors are knowledgeable and approachable, and do their best for every student they can. 

There are some hiccups administratively, and some professors are more open and communicable than others."
College Junior,4,"Every part of housing is great. If students can function are their own, the dorms are fine"
College Sophomore,4,"Courses are great, challenging but not unpassable. And professors are great, they feel the panic with you when it's time for finals. It really bonds you."
College Sophomore,4,"I rated it ""generally safe and comfortable walking alone across campus"" simply because I'm a girl and have been taught that it's the social ""norm"" to grip your keys between your fingers and walk fast. Nothing bad have ever happened and I've never felt threatened it's just that we're paranoid. The weirdest thing that has happened what some guy in a squirrel costume asked me if I could hold his nuts. He was carrying a box of peanuts."
Freshman,2,"I hate my overall experience of Fort Lewis College never in my life have I hated a place so much. When I first got here everything seemed to be this lust red carpet life then I noticed the cracks this carpet covered. The campus is about the size of a huge high school yet it doesn't feel like a college. The campus food is the same stuff put on repeat so you notice that you are eating the same miserable food every day. I have a roommate who doesn't leave the room and really makes it hard for me to study and the walls in our dorm are paper thin. The whole building I live in is really dated. I call it the bunker because its like a World War II bunker, pipes run over my bed, concrete walls, basic beds, and really cramped environment. You don't here about sporting events if you do it's really rare to notice."
Alum,2,"extremely apathetic student body. The philosophy department is always talking about the ""atrocities of the white culture"" . I've seen staff condescend and talk behind the backs of older students, which is funny because those are the ones that actually do something in class. If you're 18-21 and want a so-so education that is hardly challenging , and definitely set you up for a $15/hr job, this place is for you."
College Senior,2,"Although the cycling team is awesome, all the other FLC teams are subpar."
College Senior,2,The school needs to get a better career services department for engineering.
College Senior,2,You can't do laundry on campus because none of the machines ever work.
College Sophomore,2,The food is not worth what we pay.
College Student,2,"The town and campus are not very diverse, however, there is ample opportunity to learn more about Native American cultures."
College Student,2,I never feel safe on this campus. Many people I know have been sexually harrassed while walking alone at night or simply travelling from one dorm to another. This environment causes anxiety.
College Student,2,"I have not at all enjoyed my experience at Fort Lewis College. I have done everything in my power to make this experience better for myself, but overall feel I have wasted a year and $10,000+ in this experience. I wish there was more spirit, vigor, and excitement about receiving an education. I am so sick of feeling like a complete outcast—no person should feel that in college because it should be a diverse and inclusive community, but this community is anything but. I can understand that people may be drawn here for small town life and for the beautiful San Juan mountain environment, but the people here ruin that all."
College Student,2,"No one has heard of this school, and I can't imagine that employers would be impressed with a degree from here as pretty much anyone can get in and succeeding is not difficult or very rewarding here. The job fairs are all local, which I guess is great if you're into that."
College Student,2,"The dorms here are just like any other dorms, for the most part. There aren't amenities like ice or trash rooms or anything like that. The RA's and RD's, in my experience, have been terrible and unhelpful, and they do not make the community welcoming or reach out to their residents. They also are not good at their jobs and I find myself awake at 3 am on Wednesdays because the people in my hall are loud, disrespectful, and inconsiderate, and the RA's never enforce rules."
College Sophomore,2,The dorm housing and apartments on campus are all old. They are small and not worth the money.
College Sophomore,2,Most housing immediately says no pets or students. The housing that students can live in is extremely expensive. You have to either work two jobs or get a bunch of room mates.
College Junior,2,"For my campus specifically there are not a lot of options we have 2 sections within our dinning hall that changes daily one that only serves ""american"" esc foods (i.e. burgers, fries, grill cheese, etc.) and other that tries to do ""italian"" food (i.e. pasta with marinara sauce, pizza, bread sticks, etc.) . While the other 2 main options in our dinning hall with occasionally change things up from home cooking to ethnic food and whatever holiday is that week. We also have avalibe to us are a constant salad bar that isn't as fresh as you would like it to be, a constant sandwhich station which many students use to have a late night sandwhich saved that they recieved during dinner time, and finally a 4 option soup section which sadly is mostly made up of what scraps were left from previous nights dinners. If you don't have a long meal plan you end up asking friends for meals at the end of the semester or even asking your parents for money for groceries. Thankfully we do have 2 small cafes that offer very little, but they are prepackaged so they last long enough to enjoy a few hours later or even 2 days later depending on what it is of course. The best thing that is offered to students is the coffee shop that if you are regular at you can earn yourself a free drip coffee from a punch card."
College Freshman,2,"It is very expensive if you are out of state, and they do not offer too many scholarships."
College Freshman,2,School spirit regarding sports tends to be low.
College Freshman,2,A lot of students here smoke weed.
College Freshman,2,"Its fun but not practical. The academics are mediocre at best and the social scene is tiiiinnnny. There are a few people that I here making successes of them selves, but its not usually the result of the school. If you enjoy the town and the outdoor life that this is a nice place to be."
College Freshman,2,"Theres public transport that picks up on-campus, and all durango trans if free to students but its pretty inconvenient "
College Freshman,2,"Though the girls here are nice and friendly, there are so few of them. Im talking at least a ratio of 1 girl to 4 guys, on a good day, at a great party."
College Freshman,2,"Weed, and alcohol are huge here. Don't worry though, nobody will pressure you into doing anything that you dont want to do. There is definitely a presence of coke, psychedelics, and prescription ""study"" drugs, but you really have to want to find them to get a hold of them."
College Freshman,2,Yep its pretty white here. The  only other large population are native americans. But that doesn't mean that there is a problem with intolerance. Everybody is friendly about other people's personal beliefs and cultures.
College Freshman,2,Okay some dorms are vary old and run down. 
College Sophomore,2,It is very good but after awhile you get tired of eating the same thing and only having those same options of food throughout the semster.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Durango is a college community. If your real lucky you can find housing at a reasonable price that is close to the college. Otherwise, it's hight rent with low quality that is available. Students need to get a head start in finding housing as well. Starting months in advance."
College Freshman,2,The food is ok for the fist few weeks but it is always the same. No change. You get bored of it. It's not super nutritious but it's not super disgusting either. It is also expensive!:(
College Student,2,It's nice that they always have pizza pasta and sales but the meat is always gross. I would also like almond milk n
College Sophomore,2,"Well, I didn't come to Fort Lewis for the academics... While it is a wonderful community of kind, open-minded people, I often feel like I am surrounded by people who do not value their education very much, and this is reflected in the way teachers structure and grade their classes. Education is what you make of it, though. You can get a good education if you really try, but it will more often than not be on your own terms. Teachers won't force it on you."
College Freshman,2,"Although they do offer a good amount of scholarships here at Fort Lewis College, they aren't the best at encouraging students to apply for them. They also aren't very good at making them easy to find/figure out. In order to find scholarships that you are eligible for, you have to do a lot of digging around the website. Once you find them, however, you can access them very easily!"
College Freshman,2,"Though any off-campus living is ten times better than living on-campus, off-campus living seems to be very limited as well as expensive. Durango in general is an expensive place to live."
College Sophomore,2,"As Colorado has now legalized marijuana, it is prevalent in this school. As far as harsher, more dangerous drugs, this school gets a B."
College Freshman,2,"There is a bus that runs from the school into town, or at least there is supposed to be. I once tried to use the bus system to go give blood since I shouldn't drive after donating, but the bus schedule I had picked up did not correspond to where the bus actually went and I ended up having to drive myself to an appointment I was then late for. I would recommend double checking with the transport center and not the bus schedule maps that are at the stops before trying to get somewhere via bus."
College Freshman,2,"Living on campus is okay as far as the rooms, but otherwise I highly dislike it. I feel like I could live off campus for a lower cost and have more privacy, better amenities, and less stress about getting in trouble for things. Also, there are rarely any hall activities that people actually go to, which is something that I was told was a huge focus in Fort Lewis dorms."
College Freshman,2,"The Exercise Physiology program is fun, and there is the option of taking a cluster-course as a new freshman. The classes I have taken vary on workload, from hardly any to homework every night. All of the department's faculty and professors are very friendly and knowledgable. However, the classes her are very small and if you don't register early, you will most likely not get into even required classes."
College Sophomore,2,I wish I went into college knowing my major only because it is another thing to stress about.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I hear horror stories about housing all the time. It's Durango. You kinda pay to be close to the mountains, not to live in luxury."
College Sophomore,2,FLC isn't really known for its academics... They call it Fort Leisure for a reason... But teachers are great and always willing to help out. All the ones I have had seem like they love their job
College Freshman,2,"Can't Wait to Earn My Degree – To be in the program (Engineering), that I'm in at FLC sounds interesting. It's only the 1st day of classes and I know that I'm going to enjoy my well-being here around this positive atmosphere. The classrooms are small but are filled with big, bright minds of students. The teachers seem determind for us all to learn much in an understanding and fun manner."
College Sophomore,2,If you just go to get your education and learn what you need to learn for your degree then it is okay.  Most professors try to influence your way of thinking and change the way you believe.  It is difficult to stay grounded for those who are young and weak.  Those who are religious or conservative have a difficult time.
College Sophomore,2,Depending on the sport depends on the fan participation.  Most athletic students are upbeat and love what they do.  Soccer players are treated better than other sports players.
Sophomore,1,"If you're different from the typical Colorado person (not ultra sporty or outdoorsy), don't go to this school. It's very cliquish and nearly impossible to make friends. Everyone who goes is from the area and outsiders stand out badly."
Niche User,1,"I like the local area, the city of Durango is what brought me to applying here in the first place. I love the state of Colorado and the energy here. I'm excited to possible attend"
Freshman,1,"The dining hall  gave me a bacterial infection because they don't keep things clean. The dorms have zero circulation and are either 1000 degrees or freezing, not to mention the rank smell- probably having something to do with the black mold in our shower. The management- especially of the dining hall- are rude and less than helpful. Not to mention, it is virtually impossible to live here after your freshman year unless you want to be spending a ridiculous amount on rent for a home that's 30 minutes out of town. Fort Lewis will do anything in their power to screw you out of money and mess up your financial aid. Save yourself from some of the worst years of your life and don't come to Fort Lewis College."
College Senior,1,Worst in the nation I bet. SO outdated. Except for Animas Hall.
College Senior,1,Absolutely no greek life at FLC...just hippies
College Senior,1,We don't have greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life.
College Sophomore,1,What is Greek life? :(
College Freshman,1,A lot of weed everywhere can't really escape it a lot of the time. The peer pressure is not bad though. Not many people are caught.
College Freshman,1,"We do not have greek life, and we like it that way."
College Student,1,"The food provided on campus leaves me sick every time I eat it. The hours are not flexible and that is hard for students who live on campus and have jobs that prohibit them from eating in the cafeteria from 5-7 p.m. There are so few options and the food, no matter what it is, all tastes the same. Even the coffee is bad!"
College Junior,1,It's almost impossible to get a place off campus unless you personally know a landlord.
College Freshman,1,I wish we had Greek Life! I think it would be so much fun :(
College Senior,1,There is not enough parking in almost every lot (even though EBH is the worst) and it makes being a commuter very difficult. I am often glad that I take the bus.
College Sophomore,1,We dont have Greek life on Campus which one of the many reasons why I love Fort Lewis.
College Freshman,1,"As someone who used to work for campus dining, I would highly suggest avoiding it at all costs. The food is horrific, and without variety. Not to mention that it often  causes digestive problems. The fort is the home of an unfortunate digestion problem called, ""The Sodexo Squirts"""
College Freshman,1,"Off campus parking is basically all out war-fare every morning. There is a huge disproportion between students and number of parking spaces. But if you live on campus, parking is guaranteed. "
College Freshman,1,"The only frats on campus are academic. social frats are banned so don't expect to enjoy the frat life. The biggest frat is the accounting frat, and it only exists for professional networking."
College Freshman,1,"If you're related to allum you can get some nice scholarships. Other than instate, and your initial academic merit package, dont really expect a lot of help from the school. The fin-aid office is the absolute worst though. Unless they're signing you up for a loan they are pretty much useless. It took them 9 months to process my fasfa paperwork after they received it. And I had to heckle them relentlessly to get them to even look at it."
College Freshman,1,"Vary cold, snows often and schools does a shitty job of cleaning up the roads/pathways. "

Freshman,5,"I did a full semester online, which was an overall decent experience. 4/5 of my teachers were very responsive and organized. One of them just never got to responding my email when he didn't have scheduled office hours, but that's okay. UMW offers student tutors that you can zoom call with for help on many different subjects. I never took advantage of them but the FSEM teachers and counselors showed me where to go so that I have that help. The programs, such as MyLab or LaunchPad, were very helpful!"
Alum,5,I loved the vibe of the college--I stepped onto campus and immediately felt my creativity and intellect being cultivated. The professors genuinely care about their students and will check in on them if they have been missing for a bit. I couldn't recommend this college more!
Alum,5,I took a few classes online while at UMW and it was a positive experience for me. My professors were always quick to respond to any emails or questions. I even had a professor have a virtual meeting with me to answer any questions I had about graduate school or the process of it after I told her what I was pursuing. It was a great experience.
Freshman,5,I came in as a Transfer student a week before classes were about to start! It could have been a hectic process but the transfer coordinator was amazing. He did everything for me and made sure I would get in the school and register before the deadline which was in a week! I'm so happy I could beat the deadline and get in school thanks to the best staff I could think of. They are so professional and fast.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love my teachers! They are kind and patient. They really want you to learn and encourages questions. The work I not to bad as long as you stick with a schedule so that way you are not falling behind which can cause stress.
Freshman,5,"University of Mary Washington is small liberal art college with perfect distances from major cities. Its small size gives the campus a sense of community and a place to call home. Everyone is friendly including the teachers. They also do an incredible job of making sure first year students are well guided and comfortable. With their first year seminar classes, no student is left feeling lost. That is what I love about University of Mary Washington."
Sophomore,5,"Because of COVID-19 it was hard to adjust to online learning, but thanks to many of my awesome professors, they adjusted accordingly and were very lenient and understanding of the situation. I didnâ€™t have much difficulty thankfully :,)"
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent school, caring faculty, beautiful campus and area. The people in the community are kind and genuinely care for one another, professors truly want to see their students succeed and make themselves available to help them do so."
Freshman,5,"Wonderful College! Great people, and the administration really cares for its students. I would highly recommend this school for anyone!"
Freshman,5,"UMW is a fantastic campus, small enough to not feel overwhelmed but not to small. Everyone there is fantastic."
Junior,5,"Mary Wash is the best school ever!! there is a place for everyone, the campus is beautiful, and fredericksburg is a wonderful place to live! Also the professors are so KIND!"
Freshman,5,Overall my experience at Mary Wash has been great! The professors are great and the smaller class sizes make it so easy for you to get to know them and ask questions. ALL of the staff are super helpful and will help you to the fullest extent that they can. The campus is beautiful and I am able to walk from one end of campus to the other in about 15 minutes or less (depending on how fast I walk). Everyone is very friendly and willing to help.
Graduate Student,5,"I have really enjoyed my time at UMW. Having never lived on campus I know that my viewpoint is skewed, but there isn't much I would change. I think that the main issue I have heard on-campus students complain about is the housing issues."
Sophomore,5,Great resources and facilities that are constantly being upgraded. Challenging courses and fantastic professors.
Senior,5,My favorite thing about UMW is the small class size and campus environment. Walking around such a small school you get to know your professors and peers on a close level and I feel as though that has excelled my academics. I also love the campus. It is beautiful and they are making a lot of improvements on the buildings.
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and everyone is friendly! The small class sizes are just right for students who want to build connections with their professors!
Freshman,5,"The University of Mary Washington has actually changed my perspective on everything. When I first came to this school I was so nervous that I wouldn't people and I wouldn't fit in, but it was nothing like that. Everyone here is so welcoming and they include you in everything. This is a judge free school and everyone feels welcome."
Junior,5,"This was my first semester at Mary Washington as a coenrollment student and I love it. I am going to officially start attending as a transfer student in spring of 2020 and I am so excited! The University of Mary Washington has a gorgeous campus that is rich with history. Everyone I have met so far has been really kind, and I can't wait to get involved!"
Niche User,5,"I loved the proximity UMW is to me and the flexibility of classes! After going a few times to visit, the students and staff are really friendly. I would like to keep seeing what I am seeing right now!"
Freshman,5,"Professors are willing to help students, even with the smallest things. UMW has a strict honor code which everyone follows ."
Freshman,5,"Before entering the college as a freshman I attended the  Student  Transition Program  during the summer of 2018.  I feel that it has truly prepared me to enter college this fall. The staff at the University is very kind, compassionate, and accommodating. I am very excited to attend the University of Mary Washington and be a part of the community."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love the campus, it is so beautiful year round. It is a very welcoming and safe environment that is inclusive to all. I cannot wait to spend the next 3 years at UMW. There are so many things to do and get involved in to make the experience everything you could want it to be. The surrounding city has plenty to offer as well. UMW truly does become home as soon as you step foot on campus."
Sophomore,5,University of Mary Washington is a welcoming campus with an amazing environment. The people are kind and happy which makes for a fun year!
Works Here,5,"The University of Mary Washington is a gem on the East Coast. As a small campus, it attracts professors who want to teach undergraduates. It is a public university, and believes in its public mission to serve the state and nation. Students love to walk down the hill to the awesome town or drive 60 miles to DC or 60 miles to Richmond for the day. Its Athletics program regularly competes at the top of the DIII level. The biggest challenge is resources, but I believe UMW does the best it can and is continuing to improve. The faculty and staff love working here, and it is very obvious in how much they care about students."
Senior,5,"Mary Washington is an absolute gem. It quickly becomes your home and you are instantly connected with everyone on campus. There are many different majors to choose from, including the availability of creating your own major and internships. The professors are easy to contact and reach and will remember your name even if you only take one class with them. The campus is beautiful year round and there is plenty to do on campus and within the Fredericksburg area. It's proximity to the Washington, DC area makes for great weekend adventures and amazing internship and job opportunities. The resources that are on campus with help you succeed and thrive here."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at this small liberal arts university. Fredericksburg is a quaint town and the campus is condensed and pretty, but the faculty is where this university really shines. Four years after graduation and my professors still have a profound impact on my life."
Junior,5,"I love that the campus is the perfect size for this school. It's good for getting exercise and the weather is gorgeous. The professors are friendly and willing to help their students succeed and the community of students, staff, and faculty is warm and welcoming to all who want to succeed in whatever path they choose."
Freshman,5,"I love Mary Washington, it being a small school lets students not be a number and a person. Gaining friends is really easy at Mary Wash, and I definite found my home here and I love it will all my heart. Its history gives it a really nice touch and is really beautiful. I am so glad I choose to go to a small school where I don't feel lost and a number, professors know my name and I feel wanted here. I would recommend UMW to anyone who wants to feel like they belong and have an amazing college experience."
Alum,5,"I loved the campus because it was so beautiful, with a lot of natural areas to relax or study. I also really liked my professors. Almost every professor I had truly enjoyed teaching and was invested in his or her students."
Freshman,5,the perfect mix of a big and small school! small enough to know a lot of people and say acknowledge people you know and big enough to not know everybody!
Freshman,5,I love Mary Washington. It feels like home right as you step on campus and has an amazing student life!
Niche User,5,"It's a very nice school! Good environment, very open and accepting community. Makes me feel as though I am home."
Niche User,5,"I visited Mary Washington this fall and it was a wonderful looking campus. Their Historic Preservation department has great professors, while there they gave me the Historic Preservation Handbook that they usually give to declared majors. I highly recommend this college if you want a career in Historic Pres."
Niche User,5,It is a safe place. Everyone there is very welcoming and very nice. I heard that the school it self is very good. It is small so the students has more opportunity to get involved in classes.
Niche User,5,"I love Mary Washington and all that it offers, I took a college tour and the student leaders were very sweet and knowledgeable. I was able to ask all my questions I had to the students and received answers to them all. They offer a  wide variety of undergraduate majors for college students and offer great supporting programs to plan and guide your way of life at college. From what I have explored and researched of this college, it is a great place to spend your time for a college degree. 10/10 Recommend."
Junior,5,"Overall a good school. However, it's certainly not a big school. There is little to no party scene but the academics are good and the area is very nice"
Alum,5,I went to UMW for all 4 years of undergrad. The campus was beautiful and the ratio of more women to men isn't noticeable. There is always something to do on campus thanks to the student activities office. More often than not the field will have an event going on every other week.
Freshman,5,"I love this school so much. I remember going on my accepted students tour and falling in love with everything about the school. The students and professors are extremely friendly, the rooms are very comfortable, and the food is pretty awesome. My classes are all intimate and I love it."
Alum,5,"UMW was the perfect school for me. As a freshman who was undecided on my major, the liberal arts approach of UMW gave me a variation in classes which allowed me to choose which direction I wanted to go. The small classes allowed me to become close to my professors, which helped me get a into grad school and get a job shortly after graduating. The campus is gorgeous and Fredericksburg has everything you may need. If you want to go to big Project X/P Diddy style parties UMW is not the place for you. It is a small liberal arts school, not Ohio State. If you want to go to house parties (there will always be parties, trust me), hang out with friends, or hit the bars UMW is good for you. There is always something to do - the people who say otherwise expect fun to come to them rather than them go out to seek it. UMW went through a growing phase recently and has come out stronger than ever. I love UMW and would not trade my experience for anything. The campus food is not the best though..."
Niche User,5,"Gorgeous campus, wonderful professors, fantastic local area, and perfect size. It really doesn't get any better than this."
Sophomore,5,UMW is an excellent school that actually cares about its students and not bogus US news rankings. Professors are amazing and truly want to help their students. Students with mental health problems don't have to face unfair discrimination. I would recommend UMW to any prospective student in Virginia.
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed the University of Mary Washington because it met all of my criteria. Not once when I applied or attended did I hesitate on a single aspect of it. Fredricksburg is a wonderful little town with lots of history and good things for college students to do on the weekends. UMW, even though it is small, has plenty of things to do on campus and places to just hang out with friends. Going to cheer on friends at sports game or going to see concerts is one of the numerous things that I enjoy doing at UMW."
Freshman,5,"I was drawn to the University of Mary Washington because of the campus, student to faculty ratio and class sizes. I can say after my first semester all these have exceeded my expectations. The campus is always thriving throughout the seasons. There is always something to do on ball circle or someone outside sitting with their dog; it is simply impossible to not be social on such a beautiful campus. The student to faculty ratio and class sizes really makes your success in the classroom possible. I have developed ongoing and strong relationships with my peers and professors due to the fact that I am able to interact with them on a more personal level. That being said, getting involved on campus is more than doable. With club carnival at the beginning of every semester and clubs constantly being advertised, there is always something to join and at any time."
Freshman,5,"The University of Mary Washington is a warm and welcoming school where everyone fits in! Professors are always interested in helping students succeed and maintaining a good quality of life. There are several opportunities to get involved - from academic clubs, service clubs, and social clubs. The campus is beautiful and clean, and the university makes a conscious effort to maintain environmental sustainability and respect. The University of Mary Washington is a perfect fit for everyone."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, I honestly love Mary Washington. They make transitioning from high school a breeze, but also just the right amount of challenging. The teachers here are very friendly and caring, and the environment is really great."
Freshman,5,"UMW is a thriving school in Virginia that stresses the importance of Student-Professor interactions. While attending you get to experience Professors that are demanding yet also helpful on a regular basis. It's extremely easy to get personal time with Professors as the school is so small and all of the staff are willing to help with anything that might be necessary to your success. Besides strictly the professors, everyone on campus that is a part of the faculty is helpful and friendly. The best part about going here is the feeling that your academic career is cared about by those who don't have to. Everyone here wants you to succeed."
Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed my time at UMW. It is very easy to get involved with over 100 clubs on campus. Everyone is very welcoming and our honor system is really important. You can set your belongings down and come back to them later because no one steals them.
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed the well rounded education I received here. The campus is beautiful, there are a lot of events going on all the time, and a ton of clubs to join.  Degree programs are tough but professors are willing to help you."
Sophomore,5,"UMW is the best! It's a really small school which allows students to get to know their professors! Also, everyone is really friendly & welcoming."
Junior,5,So far my experience with the University of Mary Washington has been pretty darn good. Everyone is super friendly and most opf the teachers actually want to hekp you succeed in our school career. I'd recommend this sochool top anyone.
Freshman,5,I love the campus! The people are all friendly and willing to help and the professors care about knowing your name!
Freshman,5,I love the size of the college. It is perfect for those that are looking for a smaller community where you don't feel like just another number. The history of the area also was a factor for me personally. I have made life long friends here and I am only in my 1st year.
Freshman,5,"I  love this school! The small size is one of the biggest reasons that I chose to come here. The class sizes are small, so it is easy to form relationships with professors and to go to them for help outside of the classroom. The campus is beautiful, the facilities are excellent, and there are tons of resources to take advantages of. The only downside is that, if you are looking to join clubs, many of the clubs are not very active. I would not want to attend any other university."
Alum,5,Great school with awesome professors. The writing intensive requirements are a pain but really help to improve your writing skills especially if you are interested in majoring in the sciences.
Niche User,5,I have been accepted but I have not yet attended as I am still a Sr. in high school.  I have a friend who goes there and I have visited the campus.  It's awesome. I knew it was where I wanted to go the first time I saw it in person.
Sophomore,5,"The University has a great home feeling to it, the faculty here makes you feel at home and they're very helpful when you need help with an assignment. There are some professors that are even willing to help you with assignments even if you're not their student, but if they teach that course too, they're more than happy to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,"I really love that you always have the feeling of being in a close knit community and that you all feel like family. Also, I was really amazed at how people knew many other individuals when walking on campus walk and would call them by their name when walking. Overall, Mary Washington is the best school anyone could go too that wanted to get that home environment feeling."
Senior,5,"I've had the experience of a life time. It's not the dream school that people think of when they plan for college, but it's grown to be a dream. I love the academics; the professors teach with the perspective of using the information in a career not just a classroom. The campus is beautiful. The University's weaknesses are diversity of staff and student  body. Also The allocation of the school's budget in recent years has favored infrastructure that has had it's necessity questioned. With the arrival of a new president both of these issues are at the top of his list from what I've heard."
Freshman,5,"The campus is gorgeous and the professors are amazing. It's a small campus, but it's big enough to make you feel like you are still at college."
Freshman,5,"High Schoolers, I am here to tell you what this school is really like. Back when I was picking schools i came on this website and I read some of these reviews and I almost didn't come here because of them. im posting this to save that kid like me. This school is fantastic. I love everything from the academics to the social life. The professors here really care about you and care about your future. They want you to succeed and get to know you personally because of the small class sizes.  A big thing that made me almost not come here was the apparent no party scene. Well i'm here to tell you that that's false. There are party's Every weekend. there has not been a friday or saturday where I have not gone to a party. Sometimes you gotta look for them and ask around, but there are always parties. The food is incredible. The campus is gorgeous. Lots of things are always going on in fred. Dorms are nice."
Freshman,4,"Overall UMW has been very sensitive to Covid-19 and social issues. From what I've heard from my friends, all of the FSEM teachers are very reachable and willing to help. They have so many resources and majors to choose from. I feel like contacting financial aid or the UMW billing offices was easy. They are very quick and helpful."
Senior,4,Online classes will save your GPA (granted you actually take the time to independently learn the material). Most professors want you to reach out and ask questions and usually give weekly feedback.
Freshman,4,The professors at the University of Mary Washington are very flexible and are easy to communicate with.
Freshman,4,"Located in the heart of Fredericksburg, Virginia, Mary Washington carries a lot of historical weight to it. Opening in 1908, it started out as an all girls college. It has since become a co-ed school, welcoming all types of people. The campus is full of history and magnificent scenery. 

The university is on the smaller side and is perfect for those who do not want to be put in a large school with large classes. The community is nice and comforting and anyone would be glad to attend the University of Mary Washington!"
Freshman,4,"I have yet to take classes at UMW, but in the fall - due to the pandemic, they are hosting both online and in person classes."
Sophomore,4,"While thereâ€™s not much to do in the area, Iâ€™ve made great friends and have met some awesome professors that make my college experience so wonderful. The good thing tho is that if you just drive about 30 minutes-1 hour, youâ€™re in DC! I love being able to go to downtown near the university as well, itâ€™s so lively and full of other people my age and itâ€™s especially cute in Christmas time. Overall lots of fun at Mary Wash :)"
Sophomore,4,"I like the atmosphere that the buildings and greenery give the campus, it's very  beautiful, particularly in fall and when spring starts. Classes as far as I've seen are for the most part good, too, although the quality of the class depends on the department and the instructor's teaching style. There's a good variety of clubs; I was in the bhangra team and fencing club. The website and technology are kind of hard to work, though - registering for just about anything is confusing, and it's generally kind of hard to find services you need around campus."
Graduate Student,4,"Professors communicate effectively, online instruction is delivered successfully and assignments contribute invaluably to learning."
Junior,4,"The University of Mary Washington has a great selection of courses for anyone seeking to round themselves out with a liberal arts education. The small, open campus allows for more socialization compared to other institutions, and the natural flora around the area enhances the aesthetic quality of the University. Furthermore, professors are well versed in the subjects they teach and accommodate for the needs of many students. The smaller classroom sizes enhance the learning space by making it feel more personalized to each students' experience.  Overall, UMW is a great college that isn't too small, but has big opportunity."
Junior,4,I love Mary Washington! Everyone is so nice and the professors care about the students. I have made so many great friends. It is in a great and safe location. It is also the perfect size for me!
Freshman,4,"What I love about the University of Mary Washington is how supportive the community is and how beautiful the campus is. The professors are very helpful and they care about their students. I love the classes sizes, the mindset of the students and how everyone cares and respects each other. I love how the classes challenge the students, and the school pride."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy my time spent at May Wash. Being at Mary Wash is like your second home. Everyone is friendly, polite, and always willing to help. I like Mary Wash because it is close to a small town, which gives it more of a home feeling."
Sophomore,4,"I love Mary Washington. All of the staff and faculty truly care. Everyone is always there to help you no matter what. I have made amazing friends here, and love their music program."
Sophomore,4,"I like the small-ish campus size. It makes it easy to feel connected to many people on campus and easy to get involved with many activities, which is important in getting a true college experience. The school could market this advantage better."
Alum,4,"I had a great experience with UMW, but I think a large part of that was being a student athlete. It is a pretty small school, which I liked because I was able to get to know many of my professors 1 on 1."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus and environment, but facilities and staff are not quite there. There's always a lot of renovation going on so it's always noisy on campus."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus and how small the campus is. You can really meet a lot of people here. I would change the layout of the campus though and have the academic buildings be closer.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, this is a great school. It's relatively small and has a great community feel to it. There are lots of great extracurricular opportunities and ways to get involved with both the  campus and the greater Fredericksburg area. The quality of the food and housing leave something to be desired, but still bearable."
Junior,4,"For a small college community, the community is very nice and the professors are the most helpful people in my school life. Due to the smaller student count, it allows for professors to have more ""one on one"" interactions with students, helping improve our learning experience and being able to grow professional relationships with professors, leading to potential opportunities in the future."
Junior,4,I transferred to UMW my sophomore year and itâ€™s been a great experience for me. In and out of class I have learned a lot that has shaped me into the person I am today.
Senior,4,"The University of Mary Washington's quality of professors, administration, and education is unmatched in so many ways, much like their neglect for building maintenance. UMW, or to some, the University of Moldy Walls, has neglected many seriously needed leaks and repairs, in a handful of buildings, resulting in more costly renovations and construction projects. This being said, the professors, campus culture, quality of education, and low tuition are to die for, and make UMW a serious contender to any prospective college student. Either way, UMW is sure to grow on you."
Freshman,4,"Compared to a many schools in Virginia Mary Wash is very much student oriented in its everyday life. There are no decisions taken by the schools officials which havenâ€™t been discussed with the student body beforehand. There is a great sense of community here and everyone always ends up finding a good friend or two or more. Academically speaking, it is often tougher than people think. Despite the acceptance rate being well above 50% the school work can be hard but it is always rewarding. On top of that, many professors are easy to talk to and are always eager to help and give guidance."
Junior,4,"A small university with respected academics and a surprisingly active social scene.  Classes are small, you can take courses in any college (I'm a history major with a business minor) and the professors are (for the most part) very good and passionate about their subjects. The campus is beautiful during spring and summer."
Freshman,4,"I love the vibe and the appearance of the campus. Just the right medium size. Near civilization and historic areas. I have enjoyed my classes. Class are not any bigger than they were in high school. Professors and staff are easy to talk to. I like my dorm room and college amenities. The only down side, is the cafeteria food. The food is okay, but they bring out the better food when there are formal visits."
Freshman,4,"I attended UMW my freshman year of college and enjoyed the experience a lot. The professors are kind and helpful, the staff has set up multiple welcoming events for freshmen and transfer students, and the academics are challenging yet tolerable. The community is active and friendly, the campus feels very safe as the campus police are incredibly involved. The school is lacking heavily in terms of diversity and is also definitely not a party school."
Freshman,4,I like UMW because of the class size. Only thing I wish would change is how the dorms are maintained. Some of the older dorms have mold problems.
Junior,4,The University of Mary Washington has great staff and support systems available for students. The location is fantastic and the small class size make it feel like I never really left the Community College I transferred from. I feel welcome and appreciated and not at all out of place as a non-traditional adult student. My only complaint would be the schedule of courses does not offer a lot of options for flexibility with my full-time work schedule and is more geared towards traditional students.
Sophomore,4,The campus is very inclusive and works to engage students. Professors are always willing to aid students academically and personally. UMW pays attention to students mental and physical health.
Freshman,4,"Mary Washington is tucked away in the town of Fredericksburg. I am involved in clubs and work on campus. It is very easy to get into a routine because nothing ever changes. There are a lot of odd bodies on campus and the sports teams are very close.  The academics are good, the professors actually know who you are and are willing to help. Overall UMW is for someone who is more focused on their classes and not sports."
Niche User,4,"I personally went there for an athletic visit, but was able to stay and attend some classes, eat in the cafe, stay in the dorm, and etc. The campus is absolutely gorgeous, and its very surprising that it is a public college!"
Junior,4,Good academics  and a great place to live and learn.i also played field hockey which was fun. Food is fair but not too bad and they have different meal plans.
Sophomore,4,"UMW is such an amazing & beautiful campus, & it's not a big school so it's easy to meet people and join anything you have an interest in. This also means you have more of an opportunity to meet with professors and have them remember you."
Alum,4,"I have a spectrum of feelings about Mary Washington but I think the spectrum is inherent to learning and personal growth. I always felt safe because of the honor system, both with my belongings and walking to my car late at night. I felt all of my Mary Washing professors knew what they were teaching. However I had two adjunct professors both of those classes were very unorganized.  

I loved many of the other students, the the concerts in Dodd, the greens and all the benches, and I LOVED the multicultural fair and all the events that were constantly going on. 

I think the parking situation could be better as I had received quite a few parking tickets for unmarked areas. The Underground food should also go back to what they had in 2011. got worse after my freshman year 2011. My experience in Fredericksburg was exactly what I needed."
Junior,4,"I am a third year transfer student from Germanna community college and from the orientation at Mary Washington I thought classes would be more difficult than community college classes. But that wasnâ€™t true for all my classes this semester. There was one class where a professor poorly explained a very important project which caused a lot of confusion throughout the class, making it hard to do well on the assignment but other than that my other professor were very good. As for the campus, I found it very nice and the landscape is nice as well."
Freshman,4,"I love the people and clubs that are offered at the school. The food is just alright but there is always something good to eat, you just have to find it."
Junior,4,Being a student at the University of Mary Washington has been an amazing experience. The first thing you would notice is how beautiful and peaceful it looks. The campus is neither too big or too small. It is also very easy to make new friends. You would feel part of the community with lots of opportunities to join clubs. Mary Washington can support you with your career goals. Their advisors are very supportive and they even have a career center that will help you find a job or career. One thing that I wish Mary Washington have would be to have more fast food restaurants on campus for students .
Junior,4,"UMW is the perfect sized school, where you see many familiar faces around campus, but are not constantly running into the same people. Due to the smaller nature of the school's size, many professors gain a more personal relationship with their students. One thing that I do wish would change is office of financial aid and their handling of the students accounts."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful, everything is within walking distance, and I'm really enjoying my first year."
Freshman,4,I liked how everything was close and that the campus was not in the middle of a city. It was almost like its own little community. i did not like that some dorms didn't have air conditioning. I feel there isn't much diversity in the campus I noticed.
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed the environment that the professors have created for the school.  The size is great and because I am undecided this school is perfect for me because its a liberal arts school. I am able to try different things while completing my general education.
Niche User,4,"Mary Wash is set in the beautiful city of Fredricksburg. The school has an awesome dining hall at the student union and the dorms are pretty sweet too! I recommend the apartment style dorms across the from the gym by giant if you are a student athlete. Also, athletes are highly supported at this school which is awesome being that it is D3.  Besides the sports program, I think the school is pretty artsy if I were to classify the students."
Freshman,4,"I love it here! I love the UMW community and the friendships I have made! I love the small campus, it makes it really feel like home. Everybody is very friendly!"
Freshman,4,"I love Mary Washington! So far, all of my professors have been easy to work with and they genuinely want you to succeed. There are a lot of on-campus resources to help you succeed as well such as the writing center or speaking center. Overall, my only complaints about UMW have only been the UC's hours and  sometimes the quality of food. My only 'bad' experience here has really been some of my roommate's friends who I politically disagree with but you can avoid that by hanging out with people who share common values/ideologies with."
Niche User,4,Mary Washington is perfect for anyone who feel overwhelmed in large classes and prefer smaller classes. The campus is very beautiful and clean.
Sophomore,4,"I loved the size of the school, I loved the energy and enthusiasm my professors and other faulty maintained throughout the year! Everyone there made me feel very welcomed and at home! I can see myself growing, obtaining the skills and abilities needed to obtain my career goals alongside with developing as an individual to take on the real world after graduation! Its always a great day to be an Eagle!"
Freshman,4,"I love mary wash. Its my home and I'd never go anywhere else, but i feel i should provide the negatives first. The on campus food is quite subpar, they have a decent number of shit professors(just talk to peers to avoid that) and some of their budgeting makes NO sense. Like building the UC, a building that is 4 floors, designed FOR students, and the only thing students use it for is to eat. The cafeteria is at the TOP of said building and the food is lile i said, subpar. Why i love the school, however- most of the staff is SO great, I've had a great time here. party scene is..decent. Beautiful town, lots to do, and great people. Very accepting and caring community. Our honor code is so strong-I've lost many things on this campus including a wallet with $100+ in cash in it, which was promptly returned to me. i have never felt unsafe since i got here.  Glad i chose this school. Its a great day to be an eagle!"
Niche User,4,Located right in the middle of historic downtown Fredericksburg. It is a great campus to stay active and fit on while taking classes.
Sophomore,4,"It is a great small school environment. Students are able to connect and interact with their professors, who are all great and eager to help their students succeed. Tons of resources on campus like the writing and speaking center as well as all of the offices in Lee Hall. Tons of clubs and activities going on on campus to keep everyone involved and busy. Campus is extremely safe. Everyone that goes here loves it."
Senior,4,"Overall, a solid school that can offer a great education and well-rounded student life. Not for those looking for those seeking frat parties and keggers. There are many resources available to students and professors are readily accessible. In-state tuition is comparable to that of other state schools, though housing and dining costs are not inexpensive. Attendance costs are roughly $20-25K per year to attend full-time and live on-campus (depending on which dorm and required meal plan you select).

My primary gripe is that I do feel like the school has prioritized quantity over quality, making great efforts to attract new students with bright and shiny new buildings, nonstop campus tours, and marketing. Currently, there is definitely an excess of facilities given the current size of the student body and having print ads and TV commercials really cheapens the image of the school and threatens to tarnish its credibility and reputation."
Freshman,4,"When researching future colleges, I knew I wanted to attend a four-year university. I had looked into plenty of schools in state and out of state, but Mary Washington had always come back in my search. Iâ€™ll be honest, it wasnâ€™t particularly glamorous to me at first, but once I finally visited
the campus I was convinced this was where I wanted to start my higher education.
The academics had a consistent reputation for superior quality, the campus is very regal, an thereâ€™s always something going on either on campus or off. The campus size is small enough to have a close knit group of friends early on in the semester, but still large enough that youâ€™ll meet
new people even in your senior year. The surrounding area is full of life as well. Whenever I go downtown I always find some new treasure, like the restaurants with seating in the alleys, which is sure to satisfy the curiosity of any student to come."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful and the professors really care about your success. The atmosphere is very calm.
Freshman,4,"So far life at Mary Wash has been great! Of course, not everything is going to be hunky dory, but everything in life has its drawbacks. UMW provides extremely nice faculty and staff, the students themselves are (for the  most part) wonderful and inclusive, and the campus itself is GORGEOUS. There are an immense number of services for students to take advantage of, as long as they are willing to put forth the effort and look for them. I cannot imagine how I would have fared had I chosen a different school."
Junior,4,"UMW is a good place to be a big fish in a small pond. The small class sizes allow you to personally connect with committed professors. With ambition, it is relatively easy to become a leader on campus in almost any area of interest. One area of improvement for the school is diversity. The culture on campus is very white, and the school lacks connection with the surrounding community. However, these are things students could play a role in shifting; conscientious student activism is present and growing at UMW."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at the University of Mary Washington and my experience at the university has  been excellent so far. I chose Mary Washington because of its friendly atmosphere paired with good academics. There are many opportunities for students to get involved at UMW. The professors are qualified and available for their students. For a small University in Virginia, the school is pretty diverse and makes diversity an important aspect of campus life. Overall a great school. Can't wait to come back next year! "
Freshman,4,"Mary Washington is an amazing University. I very much like the tight-nit community and all of its wonderful traditions. My favorite part about being at Mary Washington is the feeling that I am Home. It did not take me very long to call Mary Washington Home. When I first arrived, a really big thing that I noticed about the campus was that everyone was so friendly. Nearly everybody gave me a welcoming hug. The only thing I would really like to change or improve is the Amphitheater. It has started to become neglected and I would like it if Mary Washington would fix it up."
Freshman,4,"The University of Mary Washington is a very old, but a very beautiful campus. I've been here for three weeks now, and every time I walk down College Dr. I get a smile or a hello from someone I don't know, this shows how close we are as a student body. I feel very safe here due to the fact UMW has it's own security detail, and they also have blue lights to press if you ever feel unsafe at any point in the day. University of Mary Washington doesn't have a football team, due to the fact that when the college was established in 1908 it was an all woman's college, and women don't play football. Therefore our homecoming sport is rugby!! Residence life is great, even if you don't like your roommate (LOL) you can hang out with other people in your hall and in other residence halls. There are plenty of places to hang out like the lobby, the parlor, or even in Ball Circle. My life at University of Mary Washington has been great and I can't wait to say that I am an alumni from UMW."
College Junior,4,The professors are great and my classes are interesting.  Classes usually remain on the small side about 30 or so students and the largest was an introductory class of about 80.
College Junior,4,I generally feel safe but there is an escort service.... it there to be used.  Be smart and don't walk around by yourself.
College Junior,4,Professors are nice and generally helpful.
College Junior,4,Class sizes are all relatively small and a range of offered courses.
Freshman,2,"Tuition increases each year and there is asbestos in the dorm rooms. The separate the asbestos with a piece a plywood, while continuing to build new buildings that increase the academic fees. The professors are ok, but a foreign language is difficult to learn here. The school continues to get rid of good restaurants on campus."
Freshman,2,"While the professors are decent, the University of Mary Washington does not provide for its students very well. Most of the facilities, such as the dining hall, HCC, and library, are subpar and are too small to accommodate the growing student population. Housing is poor given the overgrowth of mold in many of the residence halls, causing health concerns. Some of the older residence halls are also in desperate need of repair or complete renovation. Filing a complaint with Residence Life is also frustrating due to their lack of urgency when addressing studentsâ€™ problems. Additionally, the campus is very homogenous. While claiming to have a focus on diversity, the campus is over 60% female with most students coming from Northern Virginia. There is also very little racial and ethnic diversity. While other colleges have an array of dining options, the ones available at UMW are very limited. In terms of academics, some professors are great while most are average."
Freshman,2,"This is a great school to go to if and only if you're an athlete, otherwise you're a NARP (non-athletic regular person) so there will be no parties just once a week trips to brocks and your actively excluded from all the sports cliques. I felt like I was redoing high school."
College Sophomore,2,Not full of the best quality people. Very snobbish. One experience we had was with a sorority and they had a set time for occupying the pool (6-8). It is 8:30 and they are still there. We went in and they immediately kicked us out. No one had any control over it in the front desk and they were using equipment that should not go in the pool.
College Senior,2,The parties are rare and a good one might last until midnight
College Senior,2,Its almost more accepting of minorities. If you are in the majority you are looked down upon.
College Senior,2,"Average at best is the best way to describe this school. Upper level (300,400) professors are above average, lower level (100,200) are below average. Housing options are good but not at the price they are at. Food is ok but the timing options are horrible. The upper level administration do not care about the students while you can always talk to people at lower levels. The school is constantly changing and most of the time it is for the worst."
College Senior,2,People like to ignore any issues because they do not want the school to get any bad press. There are great support services if you go to the right people. There is a large homeless population in Fredericksburg that is constantly encroaching on the campus.
College Senior,2,Their goal with the Gen-Ed classes is to weed out people who they feel do not belong. Once getting into major classes the professors actually care about their students but below that they do not care.
College Freshman,2,We do not have any nationally recognized organizations.
College Freshman,2,I don't think they really have a great life like big colleges.
College Freshman,2,I would rather buy somewhere outside than on campus food. It's just that awful.
College Freshman,2,"All-in-all, the parties are boring."
College Junior,2,"Won't give me the correct catagory so ill write it here.

but straight from the UMW dept of music fb page: ""the administration has immediately suspended the Art and Music Education degrees here at the University of Mary Washington and will not even teach out the remaining students..."" The rest of the quote was just tellingthe students to complain to the appropriate people and listing their contacts.

There are severe budget cuts everywhere since, imo, so many students transfer out and they lose students to other schools. The school says ""state budget cuts"" but I highly doubt it considering the state, to my knowledge, never funded state schools that much ever anyways. 

The school changed its budget policy for its clubs so now, to my understanding, clubs are funded ""more"" equally. For example, according to an article in the Blue and Grey press had a budget of 100,000 to 200,000. Now its been reduced to 9,000...to make things more equal for all clubs. Sounds fair, right? But the thing is, the school never really funded any of the other clubs anyways. Yes, they could technically fund the clubs, but 99% of the time they dont and theres a like 20 page rules and reg online on when you can get funding. So basically, no, you're not gonna get funding. So now, with this new policy, NO clubs are going to get funds from the school. It pisses me off, not that the school doesnt fund the clubs, but that the school (like during tours) says clubs can get funded (technically they CAN) but it never happens.

Most recently, the mens rugby team got in trouble for chanting some song about raping and killing women. The transcript for it is online and there is audio for it being distributed but its really graphic. I dont know much about the situation since it is a very recent thing but it doesnt surprise me at all coming from them."
College Freshman,2,Like any program you take good and bad courses.
College Freshman,2,A bit on the strict side...
College Freshman,2,"I can't speak for the people who live on campus, since I commute. But, from most of what I have witnessed in real time and on here ring true- it is quite a boring and static environment in terms of University standards. While of course academia is half the importance, I think a social life and actually developing social skills is another component and they just lack in that department. Most parties are really exclusive and secret and even then most of the time they do get shut down. Greek life is not recognized here and it's a whole other freaking topic to debate on ( In my opinion I am neither for nor against it, it's whatever). There are clubs but most are lackluster in when they meet or if they meet at all. At the mandatory freshman orientation they say the thing here to do is called ""benching"" which basically is people watching. So I don't get that part. As for sports, it's division three but even if it was not, much of the school atmosphere is not that invested in it. Students vary, like any place you have people you mesh with well and think are genuinely great to hang out with or talk with, and then their are others who act cold,  judgmental, and/or unpleasant. I found the latter to be more common with the student body there, especially the judgmental fact considering the school and the students themselves claim to be ""open-minded"" well... they are open-minded until you disagree with them about certain topics and opinions, god forbid I have a different opinion on issues, sue me. The housing process from what I hear from many of my friends is hit or miss, and that's all I really have to say on that. As for dorms, like I said I commute so I am not there all the time, but from the dorms I have been in, I say Randolph and Mason are fairly nice, but they are for freshman (as of Fall 2015), Alvey is kind of nice also. Ball Hall is very nice, but it is all girls. Marshall and Russell are fairly okay, but one of them is sinking into the ground i guess."
College Junior,2,"Need a car to go anywhere; especially the places that the school loves to advertise as if they are just across the street walking distance. Google crime reports, sex offenders, etc for a scary time. Whoever says this is a college town is drunk."
College Junior,2,"80% white and mostly kids from northern virginia. Really no diverstiy however much they tell you its diverse. 

Off topic but the ""new"" ITCC tech center aka the convergence center/""the verge"" is already falling apart! LOL People have been posting pictures and videos on facebook and sharing them of water leaking from the ceiling and flooding different rooms. The building was obviously built sacrificing quality for speed and cheap materials (took 1 yr to build). They must have really needed it fast to try to attract (trick) new students to come here by showing off their awesome new building that they can be the first to use. So exciting! But yeah, instead of investing in quality they went for cheapness and speed and decided to spend money on the really uncomfortable spinny chairs that look really cool but no one uses. Such marketing tools this school uses but they're failing."
College Junior,2,"I know somebody who was flat out told at a job interview his grades (~3.0) weren't good enough because he went to an ""easy"" school like UMW. The employer must know about that over 80% acceptance rate. Around campus you'll see a lot of the college grads working hourly wage blue collar jobs even though they have a degree. The degree here is worthless here seeing as the proof is all around. Some are successful, obviously.

The administration seems to be pretty insensitive to the students' voices. There was a very bad snow storm recently and lots of roads and parking spots weren't clear or safe to walk on but they still wouldnt cancel school regardless of the students speaking out. The schools lack of money likely led to this because so many students transfer from this school. Also spending money on stupid things like using leaf blowers to blow snow off the grass IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WHILE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO SLEEP instead of clearing the top deck of the parking garage!"
College Junior,2,No one goes to the games. Teams aren't very good.
College Junior,2,"Don't go here lol. Theres already enough reviews telling you the reasons why. Every person I know who transferred said it was the best decision of their life and UMW was the biggest waste of time (and money). This school has a HUGE transfer rate so the freshman class is as large as the other 3 classes to account for the # of people who are disappointed in being conned to go here. They get told its one thing but it turns out to be nothing like they were 'sold' into believing. A good majority just cant transfer out because they cant get the grades, partly because the school accepts almost everybody who applies including subpar students."
College Freshman,2,Not all receive same punishments for same offenses
College Junior,2,nothing special. it was talked up way too much and overrated.
College Freshman,2,Not many opportunities for scholarships within the school.
College Junior,2,"I think more people are into their club than the sports unless you are in a sport or live with someone who plays a sport. Since we do not have a football team, homecoming is always mediocre. The only time there is a lot of school spirit is when a team makes it far into a championship or soemthing related and we get news about it through email. Besides that, no one really cares for it."
College Freshman,2,The dorms are all pretty old and it's just obvious that housing is not a priority here.
College Freshman,2,I can barely get any financial aid and my FAFSA shows I am in need.
College Sophomore,2,It is sad! There is stuff going on but it is so hard to find!
College Freshman,2,"Few places to eat off campus but the good stuff you gotta drive to. Gets boring after a while. The school advertises the places that require a car to get to though. Cant get over that ""college senior"" who wrote those positive reviews. Sounds more like someone who works at admissions spilling the typical saleman baloney to try to trick prospectives to come to this school. Sure knows way more than a regular student should know about the school. I don't buy it. As others have said, this school is shady and such a fake. No matter what, don't buy into it."
College Freshman,2,Most of the people I know are stuck working service level jobs. You'll see a lot of UMW grads working at local stores when you walk around town. Dead end degree.
College Freshman,2,"They can only be described as eating natural laxitives. Takes about a few weeks for your body to adjust. Till then you'll have some terrible diarrhea. Very overpriced and every year they raise the price because the school is ""losing money"" even though they sell a bottle of naked juice for 4 bucks and 95% of girls have over 100 meals unspent which they pay for and go to waste.

Costs 5 bucks for a 6 inch sammie/pb and j with a few slices of ham, chips, and a drink. Rip off. But the school is ""losing money"""
College Freshman,2,Good luck finding a parking spot- which are also expensive as heck! Tough to find a house/roomies.
College Freshman,2,like every school PARKING IS A BITCH
College Freshman,2,we have it... but just join a sport or club
College Junior,2,"Great program but handled very poorly and administrators in charge of program, seemed to be very disorganized."
College Freshman,2,"Almost no one I've met here is interested in the sports. It's just not really something many people seem to be interested in, though the campus is trying to make sports more popular. This isn't really a school to go to if you're interested in sports seriously. (Although we do have a great women's rugby team!)"
College Freshman,2,I don't know much on this subject
College Junior,2,Don't take the Fred. Don't do it. Make a friend with a car
College Junior,2,there is a limited number of spaces to park and parking pemits are $300 and spots are hard to find and every year the number goes down due to construction around campus and the number of people enrolled growing.
College Junior,2,"You come to UMW thinking ""65% girls? YES!"", then you realize they're stuck-up..."
College Junior,2,"Not many options, too many men, people steal your stuff (my jacket and shirt were stolen), and people are cockblockers and act stupid drunk."
College Junior,2,"I mean... I love sports, but I don't expect anything from D3."
College Sophomore,2,Just lots of busy work. 
College Sophomore,2,I would not go to this school again for the generic major I chose or any generic major in general. The school claims small class sizes however only upper level classes are small. This is not good as you will not be able to get into the class (many students fighting for only a few seats) and you end up having to take classes you dont want to and or delaying graduation.
College Sophomore,2,terrible at sports. No one goes to the games no matter how much your tour guide tells you they do.
College Sophomore,2,stories of school messing up your financial aid happen all the time
College Sophomore,2,"Really...nothing. Maybe just that the facilities, social scene, academic programs, etc are really bad. There's really no redeeming qualities about this school."
College Sophomore,2,Always seems to rain here
College Sophomore,2,"Drinking, not really an issue because they're pretty strict here/students here don't like to drink or party (partly because the parties suck).
Drugs...you hear about them but you don't see them. The Psi Up frat has a reputation of drug use and roofie'ing girls. Never seen it myself but every once in a while you meet a girl who tells you they drugged her.
Peer Pressure...only to believe in liberal ideas.
Policy enforcement...pretty strict. RA's here loveeeeeee busting students. "
College Freshman,2,theyre prety strict about everything. its like they dont want any fun
College Freshman,2,"parties suck, and you end up hopping from party to party, trying to find a good one"
College Freshman,2,social scene is virtually nonexistent.  see the same group of people as you attempt to party hop (none of them are worth staying at)
College Freshman,2,"only three places to eat. and the dining hall tastes terrible, many options at the nest/underground are unhealthy, leaving you with pretty mush just subs"
College Freshman,2,There really is only one night club that is pretty awful and getting much more strict.
College Freshman,2,There is no true transportation for the students. The people don't like UMW for the most part.
College Freshman,2,The school is not what I thought of in a school. There are no serious or good athletic departments. They have zero school pride. The parties are awful and its very small.
College Freshman,2,Good variety of dinning options of campus and very accessible.
College Freshman,2,I had some difficulty in the beginning. I was not happy at all and completely regretted choosing my school. I still have some problems from time to time. The school is not completely awful but it has its moments.
College Sophomore,2,"honor violations for lying, cheating, etc are very harsh here. Some people like it, some people don't. It is more common than not for people to snitch if you do make a violation here; ""friends"" included."
Niche User,1,I did not have any courses online and I had some professors who did not care about what they were teaching and who were rude to their students.
Niche User,1,"When I went to this trash school I experienced garbage roommates my freshman and sophomore years, very superficial and fake hall mates, a fraternity that was full of fake a@@holes, and garbage parties that would be over at midnight and where the girls would leave by 11:30 to midnight. Also I experienced a@@hole professors and an administration that cared more about my abusive and mentally unstable freshman roommate than me and my mental health. The school did not press charges against him when he got drunk freshmen year and broke my property, punched a cop, and peed in the girl's bathroom and exposed himself to women in the process. The school did not help my autistic brother find internships or a job after graduating despite his reaching out for help. They only care about student's  money. Don't go here if you want parties , fun, or an administration that cares about the health of its students.  This school is basically a super boring wannabe UVA & a high school clique social scene."
Sophomore,1,"Is college is an all-out boring place to attend with boring parties, little or just boring activities, boring and harder class and the only great thing about UMW is the beauty of the campus and the nice, but quiet teachers and staff. When I was there no one really did anything in my resident hall or the hall below, all people did was sit in there dorm all day until Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Sports, and or Clubs. This is why I left the University of Mary Washington as there was really nothing exciting there it was a waste of my time and a waste of my college experiment. P.S unless you like a party where you just sit away and listen to boring music, a place with no spirit, and want to sit in your room almost day be my guest."
Senior,1,This school is a waste of time and money. NO social life and the activities they offer are similar to a high school. NO greek life like other Virginia colleges. Food is below average. There is nowhere to park on campus because everything is nitpicked and picky. It is a shame that this is even an institution. OH and to add financial aid is awful and doesn't help or answer calls/emails.
Freshman,1,"DO NOT come to this school if you wanted a school that has fun sporting events, a lot to do on campus, or any sort of diversity. It is boring, very few clubs, the athletics are DIII, so no one really attends any events. If you are even considering a school like VT, GMU, or JMU, go there and avoid a small school like UMW. Alongside that, this school is so mismanaged itâ€™s not even funny. The cafeteria workers are miserable, the people who work in Student Affairs (Lee Hall) rarely crack a smile and are difficult to deal with. I have not had a good time at UMW, and I recommend that anyone looking for a well-rounded, fun, college career look elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is not supported by the University.
College Junior,1,"The people here carry a morally superior elitest attitidue. It kind of comes with the hipster territory. What I just said is not a fact, but merely an opinion about the people here ( a very popular opinion might i add). If you go against the grain, you will be punished (usually online in the form of cyberbullying). 

Anyways, discovery day should be renamed to manipulation day. The school brings out all of their good food, mop floors well, pick up garbage etc only when they know prospectives are coming. Once they leave they go straight back to negligence. My favorite is that they sent out an email to all its students to try to sell the school to prospectives (ex: "".the entire campus should assume the role of the host."" blah blah blah ""the impression and decision to attend UMW depends on how they feel while they are here."" ""#bestdecisionever"") and basically telling students to be on their best behavior and tyr to hype the school up. You know the schools hurting when it resorts to national advertising and to begging the students to sell the school when it itself cannot because it cannot. The school doesnt produce what it should so it resorts to selling an illusion that doesnt exist."
College Junior,1,"The school locks you into a 2 year on campus contract meaning you HAVE to live in the overpriced crappy dorms (they only show you the good dorms during tours or the good rooms that students pimped up and volunteered to show off; very misleading to potential students). The school, from what I hear, is requiring ALL incoming freshman next year to purchase the unlimited meal plan which costs like $600 extra. Most freshman, girls have trouble finishing the 150 meal plan. Most guys have trouble finishing 275. The unlimited ONLY allows you to eat at the all you can eat place (which has limited serving hours). So generally, even big eaters will only eat twice a day here since its all you can eat. You also wont eat here every day because you get sick of the food thats served with little variety every day and go off campus to eat or buy groceries. Do the math...EVER IF you at their every single day: 16 wks in a semester x 7 days a wk x 2 meals a day = 224 meals. Why in gods name are they forcing the unlimited plan *now*? MONEY. The school is on the down slide and everything they do now-a-days is to nickel and dime the students. They've already shrunk the cup sizes in HALF at the nest. You also CANNOT use your unlimited meal plan at the nest; only at the all u can eat. So if you need food on the go...SORRY, you need to use extra money or spend your limited flex dollars. 

Now you cannot spend the meals YOU paid for to feed your friends either (whether you are on the unlimited plan or not). It is considered an honor violation to my knowledge. You have 5 guest meals per semester, thats it. Its really dumb you cannot spend the money you pay for on your friends. 

As for the UMW divest thing i talked abouits all over the news, and to look up the several videos posted online. Its ironic UMW loves to exploit/sell the image of civil disobedience (J. Farmer) but arrests students who do the same for PEACEFULLY protesting. 

This school is fake. They sell an image, not a product."
College Junior,1,"Ignore the trolls who post positive reviews about this school; my bet is they work for the school. This schools got very low enrollment and a huge transfer drop out rate.

In other news, trending on facebook right now: UMW divest students were arrested while peacefully protesting as ordered by the campus administration. The cops look like they even have guns. There is video footage too. Students were ziptied, put in chains, and taken away. 

So much going wrong at this school. This is NOT the school to be at. The only positive is that people confuse this school with william and mary sometimes (a legitimate school). The degree here is worthless."
College Junior,1,You know the student body is bad when the biggest controversy at the moment isnt the fact that a student killed himself the otherday but the app called yikyak. Cyber bullying is out of control here. I see it on facebook all the time as well. its more prevalent on yik yak because its anonymous. the student body here is so negative and filled with gossipy people who do nothing but bring others down. You see it online and in person. Its amazing how the school has to address the students to be nice to each other. Its like Highschool over here hahahahah (oh wait..it basically is ). The students here act are all +18 but they act like 6 year olds.
College Junior,1,not really good. just professors all reading straight off a powerpoint slide and telling you this book or that book is required for a class so you go out and spend hundreds of dollars on the book at the book store only to find out you really actually never use the book. Huge money trap for the school.
College Junior,1,"Have to drive to get anywhere good. Some places are walking distance but they are few and far between. A tour guide can probably name 5 restaurants downtown. Apart from them being OK at best, imagine eating at those same places for +4 years (most students at UMW take more that 4 years to graduate, I wanna say its actually +5 years according to a published article I read that was linked on another review).

When the cultural norm and the school promotes ""benching"" as an activity, there really is no question as to why the students are so judgmental and politically violent here. If your beliefs are different, you will be bullied and you will lose a lot of friends (and be bullied on app's like yik yak). 

Recently sweet briar college was closed and UMW annnounced that it will ""seamlessly"" accept all its students. Great PR move, but in reality, its also to make up for the fact that this school desperately needs students. 

The need for students is SO desperate here, UMW has to spend millions of dollars (your tuition money) on advertising NATIONALLY just to attract enough students to barely fill its seats and to make up for the # of studens who decide to leave after they realize this school is a farce."
College Freshman,1,Yeah. Are they adding it anytime soon? Nah.
College Freshman,1,No one is invested in athletics here that much.
College Freshman,1,They are very rarely given out.
College Freshman,1,The party scene is non-existent
College Junior,1,"would i go here again, hell no! Every one who transfers always talks about how it was the best decision of their life lol"
College Junior,1,"Awful. Recently, students overwhelming petitioned to bring greek life to the school. By bringing greek life I mean just acknowledging their existence in that they are already here instead of ""pretending"" they don't exist lol (it really is as stupid as it sounds). The other thing was the UMW divest movement. Im not sure about UMW divest movement but greek was passed at student senate and +1000 students petitioned for greek at UMW. The administration said no to greek citing the recent Rolling Stones Fraternity Rape article as their reason for saying no to the idea...even though shortly after it was proved to all have been a fabricated story. A very poor excuse. As for UMW divest, they had a similar # of petitions and im not sure if there was a vote with the student senate. 

The school loves to preach and give students a false sense of say or control in things but really they have none. Its like politics, politicians will say one thing (to trick the masses) but do another. Student voice at this school (ie: student senate) is only an illusion with the exception of changing very minor things (ie: bringing back more napkins to the nest). You have no power at this school and if you are told otherwise it is probably a lie."
College Junior,1,"Awful for most. They're starting to refine dorms but it'll be a long process. Come to this school in 15 years after it's all done, then you'll get your money's worth. Its not worth staying in a dorm thats 50+ years old with no A/C and falling apart paying an absurd rate. This is about half of the dorms on campus."
College Junior,1,"The acceptance rate is over 80% and rising. They have been spending millions on advertising on spotify, pandora, malls across the nation, and other places because they are desperate for students and (in my opinion) trying to ""artificially"" bring down the acceptance rate by having more people apply due to their ad's. The ad's are very ""ITT tech"" or ""DeVry"" university esque.

The largest class by FAR is the freshman class every year. More than half of the dorms on campus are exclusively for freshman meaning the other 50% are shared by sophs, juniors, seniors, and super seniors. Less than 10% of students are commuters and or choose to live off campus (I believe 93% of students live on campus the last I heard). This is significant because the school accepts so many freshman students because such a disproportionate large # of them transfer out after 1 semester or 1 year because they realize how awful this school is and they were conned into thinking this was a legitimate well-rounded school with things to do (run-on sentence, sorry lol). Other students drop out because they had no business being in college and only got in with the ridiculous acceptance rate. Others choose to goto a communiy college instead to save money and to transfer easier. The vast majority get broken down and just accept it when they realize how hard they have to work to get the grades needed to transfer.

Do not go here. Stay far away. Do not be tricked like all the other students! The featured writer on this website even transferred as a dozen other reviews have said. I checked facebook hahahaa says a lot about this school"
College Junior,1,There is a serious national tragedy waiting to happen at this school with the lack of security. If I was a bad guy I could think of a million ways to do horrible things at this school. There is little to no security because generally nothing happens on campus other than like sexual assault (whch in itself is bad)
College Junior,1,"This is more a general review but I am CONVINCED many of the 'positive' reviews on here are written by school admins. They really are complete BS and its disgusting how they trick students into going here by selling themselves as a school they aren't and with these positive reviews. Just look at all the millions they spend advertising on spotify, pandora, malls, etc."
College Freshman,1,They are rarely given out and are a hassle.
College Junior,1,"everyone here thinks they are the greatest and that they are soooo smart even though they got into a college with over an 80% acceptance rate. They say the academics here are as hard as UVA yet they've never taken classes at UVA hahahah. 

readers: take notice sandy nicole, the featured writer/contributer for this school transferred to virginia tech. confirmed this with facebook."
College Junior,1,non-existent lol goto DC or another school. i cant believe i found the one college with no parties...
College Freshman,1,"There is somewhat of a variety overall, but not day to day. The food pretty much sucks."
College Freshman,1,"It's a dump. Have you seen the town? Just google the # of sex offenders in a 1 mile radius of campus. And oh hello to that ""senior mary washington student"" who doesn't sound paid or anything to write good reviews about this crappy school lol. Very salesman like."
College Freshman,1,"No school spirit. No parties (no really...no parties lol; okay a few every once in a while but they consist of 20 people huddled in a basement drinking keystone). Run down buildings (they show you the nice ones however like the convergence center which I'm pretty sure they built solely to attract students with the ""shiny"" new building). Horrible internet. Horrible dorms (they show you the nice rooms though). City hates the students. Sketchy city. Get frequent emails telling you to watch out because someone was shot or a place was robbed etc.Frequent hobos and beggars on campus which is uncomfortable. Pretty much homogeneous student body (social conformity is real!). Nothing to do on campus (it's not a coincidence every time you visit there isn't anyone out and about on campus unless its during the weekday when classes are going). Everyone goes home on weekends since there is nothing to do. The local bus aka the ""fred"" is late, never on time, and takes an hour for a normally 10 minute drive. The college tries too hard to try and sell itself as something it's not and people come here expecting what the school told them it would be and it just pisses them off because they don't get what they were told. What more can you expect from one of the lowest tier schools in Virginia (+80% acceptance rate). The common theme as others have said is to get good grades in case you want to transfer (most freshman do) that way you can transfer if you make the very unfortunate decision of coming here. Don't be that student who gives up and accepts his fate and stays lol it happens a lot here because transferring is tough."
College Freshman,1,"The school tries to sell itself as diverse (a blatant lie) but the #'s don't lie. Its 80% white. If you have a minority belief you will be basically condemned. UMW: where we say we are open minded but if you are not open minded like us, you're wrong lol

Complete hipster school btw."
College Freshman,1,"Very into themselves. Mostly hipsters who know even realize they're hipsters. Everyone thinks they're god's greatest gift and that they're self-righteous beliefs are right no matter the facts. But seriously, it takes a very special person to tolerate the students here. I'm not sure why the kids are like this or its social conformity or what but it is WEIRD. The kids are also very lazy then when they get bad grades they talk about how tough the classes are and how 'great' the teachers are. The classes are ""tough"" because kids here do not study and the teachers are 'great' even though my commmunity college teachers were arguably better."
College Freshman,1,"I watched a prison show once and the inmates had better rooms. The school however hosts a contest for the 'bestrooms' so a few people try to win it. The school will then show prospective students those rooms and put photos of those rooms online to attract students into thinking how awesome the rooms are. Notice they ONLY show you those rooms. They won't show yo the typical rooms that didn't take 50 hours worth of time to clean and set up. 

Don't fall for their trick of only showing you what they want to show you to make you think its great."
College Freshman,1,the only people i know who graduated are struggling to find a job and the one that graduated Cum Laude is working a minimum wage job.
College Freshman,1,"I'm Bio/premed and am not impressed at all. From all the professors I've taken and professors that my friends have taken we all agree on one thing: The professors just read verbatim off the slides; I am unsure whether they even have phD's because even a Highschooler can do this. Chemistry department is OK, its hit or miss with quality teachers. Physics is a JOKE at this school; its convoluted and you don't learn anything but you still walk away with an A lol. 

The only bigger joke is the premed program. Don't let the advisor fool you when/if he gave you a tour when you were a prospective student. When he is not in front of parents he is unhelpful, condescending, rude etc. Read his reviews on rate my professor to verify what I said. The ""pre med program"" is a bulletin board with brochures sloppily stapled on that are out of date by about 5+ years. Everything I know I know from doing my own research because the program is useless here. No wonder only about 5 students get into medical school each year here (mostly DO schools; not an MD school).

Here is the WORST part. The school offers very few classes with very small sections. Wanna take anatomy/histology/virology etc? Sorry, we only offer it next semester or once every other year. OR we only offer one/two sections and sorry it overlaps with your other classes you need to graduate. This affects you because 1) you cannot graduate on time which makes you spend an extra semester's of tuition/room/board money 2) You can't get the classes you need to be prepared for material tested on the MCAT. I'm positive point #1 affects all majors, not just bio/premed. 

Lastly, I cannot verify this or provide proof but I give you my word (for what it's worth), I read a recent article that was praising the school but then went on saying that 74% of students of entering students graduate in 6 years. Read that again. 3/4 STUDENTS TAKE 6+ YEARS TO GRADUATE. Refer to #1."
College Freshman,1,"As others have said, this school is a complete sham. I have no idea how anyone can endorse this school. Ie: They say the professors are the best yet have never been to another school (What does this say about the intellect of the people making these ignorant statements?). 

Very boring with no much to do so people just gossip and spread rumors about each other; like on yikyak."
College Freshman,1,"The gym equipment hadnt been inspected in 2-3 years past its due date. Rumor has it they are getting new equipment though. Either way, horrible safety issue. The weight lifting belts (so you don't tear a muscle in your stomach lifting heavy) are velcro so they come undone easily so they are worthless."
College Freshman,1,"Horrible. Virtually no parties. I've been to a few ""parties"" and its usually like 5 people sharing 2 beers and dancing to kesha. 

I never thought it was possible for a college to have such terrible parties."
College Freshman,1,"People don't realize just how unsafe this campus really is. The doors to all of the dorms, with the exception of Eagle Landing and MAYBE randolph and mason can be pried open if you give it a good yank and put your foot to the wall. There are no staff to check to make sure the person entering the building is a student or a resident. Every so often you'll find a homeless person in the common shower room. There was a guy who pretended to be a pizza man who'd come into dorms and put peoples computers inside the fake pizza boxes to steal them. 

I know of many people who have been sexually assaulted on this campus. The campus tells you to report it to them and not to the actual police because the actual police will ""just turn you over to campus police."" The school doesn't do anything about it because if it gets known/proven then it makes the school look bad. I went to a sexual assault support group event on campus called take back the night and dozens of girls went up and talked about their experience being assaulted. The ones who went up were just the ones brave enough to speak up. It's really sad actually. A girl was raped on campus while walking back to her dorm by a non-student who jumped her from behind a few years back while in the parking garage. It went to court and I'm sure you can google it.

No security camera's anywhere except in Eagle Landing.

Frequent homeless people on campus asking for money/favors.

You get emails on a monthly basis to take caution because there was a shooting near campus.

Do not walk out into the city at night alone. Although this applies anywhere, especially HERE. 

The food at WOW wingery is often undercooked. Some guy had metal in his food at seaco. If you look up the state Health report on seaco, you'll probably never want to eat there again. Definitely do NOT eat the sushi."
College Sophomore,1,only come here if you are interested in a major that is unique to this school. example: do not come here for english. Do come here if you want to major is say historic preservation. My best advice is to pass up on this school. Horrible horrible experience in every aspect. Does not prepare you for the real world however much they try to trick you they do with their advertisements.
College Sophomore,1,"Complete rip off. They'll charge you 5 bucks for a 6 inch sandwich with 3 slices of ham or crumbled dry chicken bits. WoW wingery food is often uncooked.

Overall, food here is not good. It's only good when the school is expecting lots of visitors."
College Sophomore,1,Computers are okay..the internet here (in the dorms) is AWFUL. you have to pay extra for high speed internet. Bring a ethernet cable. Too bad many of the jacks in the rooms for the cables are broken though!
College Sophomore,1,Not that great. Average or worse in comparison to another college town.
College Sophomore,1,"Hobos on campus/beggars/people get mugged on campus/girl was raped on campus in parking garage. <br/>Police park empty cars around campus but they're no where to be seen. <br/>Try giving a small yank to the Dorm doors...you'll notice a good yank will get you in. Sure an alarm will go off but those don't alert police or anyone because those go off all the time. Doors are left unlocked often times (try side doors) so you can just walk on in. No one to check you in/make sure you are a student, with exception of eaglelanding. <br/><br/>This school has SO many security flaws it is scary. You don't notice a lot of these things unless you go here."
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone here thinks they're a 10 and they are the greatest thing god ever made. Very unapproachable UNLESS you are a highschooler inquiring about the school. Otherwise they're some of the rudest most stuck up people I have ever met. Most of the friendly/normal people transfer out after the 1st semester or 1st year. I know this review sounds subjective but seriously, I'm not joking. I think it's just the demographic of student that goes here thats why the same issues perpetuate. "
College Sophomore,1,"old, broken down, homeless shelters. Upon first glance they look alright but when you go to this school and start noticing how old they are...its a completely different feeling. Goto fitness center and you'll notice much of the equipment hasn't been inspecting in several years. Library has only TWO MCAT books. Neither are subject studies, practice questions, etc. What a joke."
College Sophomore,1,"Cost of living is pretty high if you try to find a place to live off campus. The accommodations aren't even that nice. 
Dining is pretty gross. Lack of healthy options, although they'll tell you ""woodstock aka the underground"" is healthy...really? Try picking up the nutrition binder hidden away just to the left of the water jug...you'll be blown away...some of the most unhealthy garbage you can possibly put into your body. Utensils often have grime on them.
Locals HATE UMW students. never understood why considering how lame and tame they are. Maybe cause UMW students as a whole are the weird theatre kids from HS? I really don't know.
Museums...a few antique shops downtown. Thats about it.
Nightlife...literally non-exisitent. A few really REALLY crappy bars where you get hit on by creepy locals and they follow you.
parking...terrible, expensive, etc.
Parks/rec...not really sure. Can't think of any so I guess non-existent unless you wanna drive.
Safety...muggings on campus, hobos begging for money, a girl got raped in the parking garage a few years back...it's not very safe. You got the ""blue lights"" to call for help. Just tell the baddie to hold up so you can find one, hit the button, talk to the police, and wait for them to come help you.
Scenery...its pretty nice actually. But it rains a lot :/
Shopping...not my scene.
Transportation...pretty bad. Taxi's always try to skam you and take extra long routes to get extra money from freshman. The ""grey hound"" is always an hour late and takes an hr to drive you to a place that should be 15 min away. "
College Sophomore,1,"First years can't have cars. Parking passes are very expensive and spots are limited. You'll spend 15 minutes daily trying to find a spot. Most upperclassmen leave campus on weekends and drive to a different college (hence the campus is always so vacant when you visit) because there is NOTHING TO DO HERE. 
Downtown has some restaurants and antique shops but that gets boring after about a month of so. Try doing that for 4 years.
A car is a must so you can leave this place on weekends to find stuff to do. OR, the alternative is to save yourself four years and not go to the school. "
College Sophomore,1,"I was at a party that got busted at 10:15 pm. That was the lowest point of my life. A typical party, if you can come by one, is generally about 15 kids huddled around in a small space with music playing and talking in their little cliques. Tour guides and students like to tell you ""there are always parties and things to do on the weekends,"" this is one of the biggest lies. Parties are few and far between because they get busted so often and students get sent to court, not only that, they're really lame. Be prepared to sit in your dorm every weekend for the next 4 years with a few friends talking about its just like hanging out with friends in HS except your mom isn't here.

For how many reviews there are warning students of how boring and bad this school is, its perplexing how many people don't believe what they read. I know I was too stubborn to believe what I read and I ended up paying the price by wasting my time here."
College Sophomore,1,Very strict. Students here snitch on your for the silliest things from underage drinking to being a little too loud.
College Sophomore,1,"80% white. However the school advertises how ""diverse"" they are. If you aren't liberal or have beliefs that go against the majority and you EXPRESS them, you will be punished. People get extremely offended at the most fickle things. "
College Sophomore,1,"Just lots of busy work. The premed program here sucks. As a premed, no one has any idea what is going on. The premed advisor is a jerk and not helpful. Of course he'll tell you how ""great"" the program is when you visit along with every other professor/director. The premed ""bulletin board"" is just a board with a bunch of ads tacked onto it; think of what an arts and crafts project looks like...made by a 10 year old. The faculty advisor is unhelpful and doesnt know much about the subject.
Financial aid loses your paper work.

"
College Sophomore,1,Just lots of busy work really
College Sophomore,1,Have fun trying to find a spot/paying an outrageous fee for the shoddy parking. Prepare to get rear ended once a semester. 
College Sophomore,1,god awful. SO bad. They only show you the 'good things/the good parts' of buildings during your tours.
College Freshman,1,"aI didnt know girls could be so ugly....its like in addition to all of the weirdos from high school congregating at UMW, al of the ugly ones did too.  mixture of weird theater kids and the weird horse girl from elementary school.  You do become close with the handful of normal people you meet.  That is, until you all are finally able to transfer to a better school.  Do not come here, all of the normal people I know are planning on transferring.  "
College Freshman,1,"it was not at all how they advertised it.  no one cares about sports, and the school is full of weirdos.  cant wait to transfer"
College Freshman,1,the greek life is made fun of by all of the normal students. no one takes them seriously
College Freshman,1,"typical d3 school.  Im on the soccer team and the same amount of people come to our games as in high school soccer (except for the homecoming game).  No one gives a shit if youre an athlete, and (ugly) girls will be more impressed if you tell them that youre taking environmental science"
College Sophomore,1,"This is a very big Transfer school. The freshman class is by far the largest class since most transfer out after their first semester or at the end of the year. 50% of the dorms are freshman only while the other 50% are shared among sophomores, juniors, seniors, and super seniors. According to the VP of the school, 93% of students live on campus so it's  not like theres a lot of upperclassmen living off campus..no its cuz everyone transfers out. Hard to maintain friendships here. Most people who stay though stay because they are afraid of having to find a new set of friends again/leaving friends behind. when you can just make the same friends at another university. Most students will transfer to pursue a better education and to be able to experience an actual college atmosphere which allows you to grow. There is literally nothing to do on this campus. You go to class, you come back, you chill with a friend, repeat. Weekends are no different. <br/><br/>visiting students: you think its just a coincidence that whenever you visit on weekends the campus is dead? its because everyone goes home its so boring here. The ONLY time you see people on campus is during the week when people are going to class. Do not mistake this for people 'doing stuff on campus.'<br/><br/>its hard to grow as a person and to develop skills too when you are limited to a small group of friends due to the mad scramble at the beginning of the year."
College Sophomore,1,It's like HS here. At the beginning of the year you make a mad scramble for friends and then you're stuck with that group for the rest of that year. If you don't make friends then you're on your own. Weekends consist of you going to your buddies dorms and just talking/hanging out. This is analogous to going to your friends house during HS except no parents. Parties are very rare and usually small and exclusive; they still get busted very early on in the night though. The school doesn't provide very many activities for the students either.
College Sophomore,1,Pre-med program here is disorganized. The premed advisor didnt even a new medical school opened up in virginia. The library has NO MCAT study materials. The school has no connections to the MWH and shadowing opportunities are scarce and up to you to find. I've spoken to many seniors who are applying this summer and they don't even know what the aamcas is or that they need volunteering and leadership positions. The program here is a joke and not worthwhile. Goto VCU if you want a REAL premed program.

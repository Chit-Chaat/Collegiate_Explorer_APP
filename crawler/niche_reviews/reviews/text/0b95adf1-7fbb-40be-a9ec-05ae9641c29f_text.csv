Junior,5,"Located in the Uptown area of Minneapolis, MCAD is a small school with superb teachers. The atmosphere inspires learning and creativity."
Sophomore,5,"MCAD is a great learning experience that gives access to an endless number of resources, facilities, knowledgeable staff and mediums to explore."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at this school has been awesome so far.  I have learned so much in my first year alone.  I enjoy my classes and my professors are great!  The dorms are comfortable, quiet, and safe.  The surrounding area has a lot to offer.  There are many restaurants to choose from. There are always fun school events happening on campus. I only wish that there were more diversity among my peers."
Freshman,5,The staff and students are always so friendly. I went there admitted student day and I was very nervous and the moment i started talking to people my nerves went away because it is such a welcoming and family like environment
Freshman,5,"I've had an excellent experience at MCAD so far. All the professors are artists that are still practicing their craft and are friendly and approachable. MCAD's an art school, the most athletics it has are the clubs and the party scene is more off-campus- we're close enough that you could catch a ride to the University of Minnesota if you really wanted to party. The housing is apartment style, meaning you have a bathroom and kitchen you have to clean yourself. There is no meal plan due to the kitchen you have in housing, but they do have a great cafeteria that opens around 8 and closes at 5.  Everyone just wants you to succeed and are happy to help you in that endeavor."
Niche User,5,I have yet to attend but everything that I have had questions about or just needed general information on they have been super helpful and accommodating. I have no complaints so far
Sophomore,5,"I'm a sophomore and so far my college experience has been great.
MCAD offers allot of opportunity for learning and exploring new ways to create art."
Freshman,5,"I love my school. I get a lot of one on one time with professors, and the projects force you to try things that you never really considered before. It's always really nice, and you get to work with amazing equipment."
Freshman,5,"There are a few classes that make you feel like its a waist of time. It is not. Most of the teachers here care for the students and many of them want to make sure that you will make it to the art world.  expensive, but worth the money."
Junior,5,The Minneapolis College of Art & Design is an excellent school. I've enjoyed practically every moment I've spent there. The curricula is well-rounded but intense. I've learned more than I ever expected to. I just hope I can keep going there. I love MCAD so much.
Sophomore,5,"A school that’s invested in its students and has an involved relationship with them as well. Knowledgeable faculty, communicative staff, all around friendly environment. Challenges you to be your best."
Alum,5,"A relatively small school with a deep body of artistic talent in its professors and its student body. A tight knit community , interesting classes and engaging faculty. On campus apartments were great. The workload can be tough, but it prepares you for the post grad life of a creative. I wouldn't trade the experience for anything."
Freshman,5,"A terrific school filled with helpful faculty members, resources, and opportunities. Each week is full of new experiences there, and the classes I've taken have taught me so much in just the few short months I've been enrolled. They are gracious with scholarships, eager to aid their students in any way, and real connections are formed between faculty and student."
Freshman,5,"Im in my first year here at MCAD, love the school! Its a bit expensive, just as most art schools, but it trys its best to make up for it. Constantly free trips and fun, food, activities, clubs, movie nights, etc. beautiful range of seasons here as well. Has great dorm pricing considering they come with personal restrooms, kitchens, and living rooms. Lovely people, friendly staff, real great community feel! Couldn't see myself anywhere else but here in the long run."
Freshman,5,"The faculty present are not only amazing teachers but amazing artists that will help you in the art world and can connect you with important people. The students are great, everybody is nice, you will fit it. Annual art sale that is a one of a kind opportunity that you will not find anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"The school is really open and inviting to everyone.  It's challenging and tough, but all the faculty are really nice and they do everything they can to make sure the students can succeed."
College Senior,5,"Alumni are a huge part of the college, there are regular events, and most alumni are invited back to give artist talks or to teach. It is awesome, as a student, to see so many successful alumni. The career center in extremely helpful with everything, from helping find an internship to helping find job prospects after graduation. The school is one of the top rated in the country, so employers are generally excited to work with students, and eventually hire them on."
College Senior,5,"My school is extremely student focused. Every faculty member is extremely helpful and 100% focused on what they can do to help you (the student) succeed. There are a wide variety of student run clubs, so there is a strong sense of community. Classes are small, so each student is able to get the attention and help that they need. Students are encouraged to explore the boundaries of assignments, and to get creative with how they choose to fulfill requirements. There are frequents artist talks, which exposes students to a wide variety of art and different professional practices. There are many opportunities to make contacts within the art community. Everyone is encouraged to submit work to galleries and/or publications. I never feel like I am being treated as just another student or as a number. I wouldn't trade my school for any other, even though the price is more than I'd ideally being paying."
College Sophomore,5,"So far, I'm thoroughly enjoying all the professors and classes. Professors seem to really care about their students' interests and help guide them. They are very encouraging of new methods, new ideas, and ways of improving their students' craft."
College Sophomore,5,"This school has been my dream school. The teachers understand students and their needs, facilities are state-of-the-art, and classes are incredibly interesting. This school will help me get to my dream job in life."
College Sophomore,5,"This school is extremely accepting of diversity, especially the transgender community.  Students are always pushing for more diversity and acceptance (such as within the classroom lessons) because it is very important to the community"
College Sophomore,5,"Literally the only setback I can think of for MCAD is the price, but to be honest, that goes for any university or private college. Otherwise, I love the small environment that the campus provides. Everything is accessible, including expensive electronic equipment that you can check out in their media center! They even have an art store that has amazing prices. All the teachers and staff love their jobs. They are laid back and are to converse with (which I feel is important to every aspect of academic success). I have only been attending MCAD for half a semester and so far, I have no regrets!"
College Freshman,5,The campus is great so far. I can't wait to see the studios! :D
College Sophomore,5,"I am an Entrepreneurship major with an interest in photography. I plan to pursue a career in traveling photojournalism upon graduating from Minneapolis College of Art and Design. My school experiences have been significantly above my expectations from the distinctive location, creative population and exciting events. While I was researching schools I could not find a degree that offered the two interests I was looking for, but I was thrilled to learn that MCAD offers both a business and art program. If I could do it all over again, I would choose MCAD every time."
College Freshman,5,Amazing. So many options. Very close to campus.
College Freshman,5,We have a eat street right next to the campus. It's great. but no student discounts!
College Freshman,5,The best scholarship program ever!
College Junior,5,Right next to eat street in Minneapolis. Can't go wrong.
College Junior,5,Although I have not lived on campus at my school I have seen the apartments and they are very nice and very close by.
College Junior,5,"It may not all be the healthiest options but they do have them. They have some vegan and lots of vegetarian options as well. Most the stuff is freshly made and the muffins are made by scratch each morning. They are also pretty nice, allowing you to get free refills even know they are suppose to be .50 cents."
College Freshman,5,Campus is two blocks away from 'Eat Street'
College Freshman,5,The school is in downtown Minneapolis so there is lots to do right around the corner.
College Freshman,5,"The computers and laptops are supplied, but they are bought through the tuition. There are computers already set in the buildings with all the technology and programs built in, but the laptops are used for homework, individual projects, and school related things. The wifi is great as well and it is accessible anywhere on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"It's really great here, and the teachers are all really smart and accomplished in their fields (even my english teacher is a published author, and don't get me started on the actual art classes). Even the freshman classes for the most part are interesting and teach you a lot of valuable stuff, and it only gets better from there. There's a lot of academic support, especially during finals (the library gives out cocoa, for instance). You learn a whole lot, and no one is mean because you didn't learn stuff yet. It's really awesome here."
College Sophomore,5,"I practically travel from my dorm to the main and Morrison building without any fear during the nights if I'm working overnight on a project. Campus Feels very safe to me in my opinion of course. especially when it's so small and conveniently placed so that i can take about 5 minutes to walk to my class. If anything around campus goes on, we're immediately notified through text and emails of what exactly happened that way we are aware of certain areas that are unsafe to be around during certain hours."
College Sophomore,5,"If you want to sculpt you can, If you want to carve hey they have that too, you want to spray paint pfft we have multiple spray booths available for use. There is practically a studio, and area for everything and anything you're interested in (art related of course) and everything available is up to date, and well taken care of. This school has almost everything, if you ever feel experimental and want to try out different media."
College Sophomore,5,Minnesota is awesome!! People love to complain all the time though. Lots of cold and snow anywhere from October to April although due to climate change it's hard to guess now. The spring summer and fall are beautiful everyone is outside doing activities.
College Sophomore,5,"You're required to get a MacBook at the beginning of each year, which holds the full Office and Adobe suites, and has so much power and creative capabilities. I rarely use the computer labs, but I hear they are amazing for the animation students.

A few studios house Cintiqs, which are incredible for digital inking, coloring, and various design and illustration.

Printing color and high quality can be costly, but it's better and infinitely more convenient than going to Kinko's."
College Sophomore,5,"There is an insane amount of good-looking people here. The women are anywhere from cute to strikingly beautiful. Same for boys. Girls tend to dress very ""art school"", which is not only awesome to see, but really different from what I'm used to. Nobody looks the same. As for interests: if you're not appreciative of art, it would be really strange for you to be at this school anyway, because everyone is hardworking, creative, and passionate. It's so easy to make friends here.

There is a lot of LGBTQA students, and 99% of people are open-minded towards various sexualities, gender identities, and sexual preferences!

Although this is an art school, you'll be able to find people of all types here, and if dating (or hooking up, or FWB-ing) is in your interests, I'm sure you'll find someone who will mesh with you quite well. I am biased, however, because I met my current boyfriend here (we're now in a strong, stable, and passionate LDR) and we are incredibly compatible in many ways.

In general, everyone is really cool here. You make a lot of strong friendships really quickly and bond over art, which is always amazing."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone gets their own computer when they come to campus, already loaded with every program they'll need for their foundation classes. There are also computer labs, and a wide variety of printing options, as well as student workers who specialize in helping with these things. There's also a tech help office. If you bring your own computer, you have to buy all the programs, and that can get expensive. The internet's good. You don't need your own printer or anything, unless maybe you live far away. But all the tech is very advanced and smart and nice."
Freshman,4,"lots of creative options to explore & comes with the necessary resources to do so. As a freshman there are alot of helpful sources to get information, & im not overwhelmed by the options either"
Freshman,4,"As a born and raised New Yorker, attending MCAD has been a great experience so far. There’s a huge focus on self-care for all students alike and they offer student counseling that students can attend either in a group or as a one on one."
Junior,4,"It is a very good experience! I would like to see them add more studio spaces for media majors, and some teachers are just okay, but overall it's a great school and a great experience!"
Freshman,4,"All of the instructors I’ve had so far really provide a professional, constructive critique of projects and work to better the students. Same can be said with the students themselves. It’s way more of a supportive community and less competitive like it can be at other art schools which really gives students the chance to truly support and better each other in the best ways."
Sophomore,4,"I have only been at MCAD for a year, so far I like it. The professors are nice and helpful. The school has a lot of good resources such as the 3D shop, media center, and service bureau for printing things."
Freshman,4,They offer the best resources for art students and have many fun activities and opportunities for the students! I do wish they did provide more for the gym and put more effort into the housing.
Sophomore,4,"This school is the perfect fit for me! The professors are professional, helpful, and want you to learn and are always doing everything they can to help their students succeed. The atmosphere and aesthetics of the campus make me so happy to be there even when I'm dragging my feet to class. Critiques can be harsh and take some getting used to but are usually worth the pain of it."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the environment and most of my professors and classes. Studio classes, which, for this type of school, are the most important, but liberal arts classes could use more work. Housing is absolutely terrible - there is no housing available for any class except for freshmen and possibly sophomores this upcoming year."
Freshman,4,"Excellent location for studying in art fields; Minneapolis has a solid art scene and the school itself neighbours the MIA. Obtaining materials and equipment for projects is very easy. Professors are generally easy to work with & provide good feedback. There are lots of opportunities to attend events, lectures, etc. for free or for a stellar discount. 
The downside is the price--if you're thinking about applying, look into scholarships and plan your application & portfolio well."
Freshman,4,They are very open and accepting of all. They try to make sure every student is happy and doing their best. They will help you when you need it and they are a super friendly community.
Sophomore,4,"I love how you actually feel like an individual with all of the professors, they remember your name easily and your goals. They really want to help you succeed and always make it known that they're there for you. There's a lot of good talented people at MCAD, you'll make friends easily. The dorms are nice and comfortable in size for all your needs."
Niche User,4,Minneapolis College of Art & Design or M-CAD as we call it here in Minneapolis is a perfect example of Education meets the 21st century.  Here you get a chance to study the classics as well as being introduced to the newest top of the line technology offered.
Niche User,4,"I really like the college! It's campus is small but gives you the best of both worlds (not too small, not too huge). There are tons of groups and activities that students can join, and there are also lots of on campus jobs available as well! Eat street is a block away so there is always good food, and campus safety will even drive you a mile off campus to get you home safely. They do weekly van trips to get groceries. The campus is also attached to the MIA, a very nice (and free) museum! Oh, and the dorms aren't traditional dorms, they're more like mini apartments."
Niche User,4,"During my tour at MCAD I loved the whole vibe the college had when I visited. Everyone and my advisor seemed so friendly and cool. There weren't many people around while I visited since it was during summer break but I did see a variety of people who looked very interesting to speak to. There are also many resources MCAD provides for the students to use. It is a non profit college which is a big plus as well. As for the surrounding neighborhood it looks clean and feels like it would be nice to walk outside when the weather feels wonderful. Speaking of the neighboring houses, they provide apartment dorms on the campus for the students. There are floor plans on their homepage to help you choose what you would like, other wise housing is on your own by living in an apartment outside of campus grounds. "
College Senior,4,"There are regular emails sent out from the safety/security team, updating students are crime in the area and giving tips on how to stay safe. Security is willing to escort students to their cars after hours (i.e. when it's dark), and will even give students a ride to their house, up to a certain mileage away. I feel that the school cares greatly about the safety of all the students."
College Senior,4,"We do not have school sports teams, but we do have club sports teams. And all the students take pride in our school, and so support the club run sports."
College Sophomore,4,"Security is on campus 24/7, and always patrolling the campus. They are very easy to approach, and are more than willing to walk students to their cars or apartments up to a few blocks away from campus if a student feels unsafe."
College Sophomore,4,"Students work very hard to earn their degree. Many of the students who graduate from this school end up in the field they earned their degree in. Career services is very helpful in guiding students to potential job opportunities. Job fairs are held once or twice a semester, with a few occasional single employers."
College Sophomore,4,"I've heard some pretty interesting roommate stories, but I got really lucky and have awesome roommates. The dorms are a little old, but they're very nice. The apartments are just across the parking lot, so it's nice and easy to get to class. The housing process was very easy and simple."
College Freshman,4,"Campus housing is apartment style and each unit has a kitchen, common space, and one or two bedrooms. It's a little cramped but compared to dorms at other schools I've seen, it's much more spacious. There are washer and dryer units in the building as well, which is convenient (even though the laundry room is kind of disgusting)."
College Freshman,4,"It's great for me. I've been able to meet a lot of great people and I feel like I made the right choice most of the time. So far I've only had the opportunity to take foundation classes and they've all been easy and a little tedious. I have a 4.0 which for me feels like it means I didn't learn anything (in my classes). That said, I'm really stoked for my second semester because I'm taking a class in my major (comic art) and comics are the reason I'm at this school. That said, a lot of students struggling because the school has some ridiculous policies and inadequate mental health services and disability accommodations. This school feels like a good fit for me. If you know what you want to get out of your experience and are motivated and willing to take advantage of opportunities as they come you can thrive here."
College Sophomore,4,"I wish art schools offered more rigorous and relavent general ed classes, but otherwise the classes here are good.  You will learn a lot about art."
College Sophomore,4,"So far my courses have been taught well and have been relavent.  If you know exactly what you want, chances are there is a way this school can guide you there."
College Sophomore,4,"It's never easy making a living as an artist, but this school is great at guiding one in the right direction.  Job and internship listings are posted on a bulliten board or emailed out.  Everyone is required to complete an internship before they graduate. You're also taught how to promote yourself better."
College Sophomore,4,"I did two years at public university before coming here.  Even though being a transfer student can be tough, I'm glad I did. This school is so much more focused towards my interests than anything the universities had to offer."
College Junior,4,"One of the prompts for this question is,""What makes your school unique?"". If you have ever seen a college campus before, the second you pull into the MCAD parking lot you will begin to see why my college is so different then any other, why it is unique. If you are an artist, you will fall into a trance of who is that, what's this tool, there's so much art everywhere. The school is honestly a ""Hit or Miss"" for people,and for the people it hits, it is a fun, challenging, and adultifying experience. This school makes you grow up, if we look like it or not. Being a student at MCAD, I have made more art then I ever have before. I originally went into this school thinking I was going for Graphic Design, but because they encourage you to keep an open mind for the first year and experience all the different paths that art can take you, I decided to follow the path of Furniture Design and I couldn't be more happy. I love my classes, I greatly enjoy my teachers, and I still get to take classes outside of my major. College is not a place you should have the mind set of ""I need to get in and out"", personally I believe that you should take every opportunity to learn something new, meet new people, make connections because once you're out, you have to find your own way to learn those things, to create an artist community of your own, put yourself on the line to make connections . It is a lot harder outside of campus, so soak it all up now while you're here. MCAD has an amazing assortment of tools for you to utilize to obtain a finished project. This school has more tools and resources then I have ever heard the name of before stepping on campus as a student, and you have access to every single piece of equipment there. MCAD is an establishment that truly wants their students to succeed as artists outside of classes and after graduation. College is a new experience. Do me a favor. Anywhere you go, Just get through your first year. It gets relevant to your interests after that."
College Freshman,4,"We have public safety, and RA constantly checking on us. Feels pretty safe."
College Junior,4,The school is very strict on attendance. Showing up to class is part of your grade. In order to succeed is to show up!
College Junior,4,Quick and if I have any questions about my aid there is always help.
College Junior,4,"Very helpful, would be nice to get more involved.."
College Sophomore,4,"Right off of eat street, theres lots of places to go!"
College Sophomore,4,"You usually get some really large/helpful scholarships, but it's dampened by the costly tuition."
College Junior,4,We are right next to eat street so take advantage of it.
College Junior,4,The teachers all treat you with respect. The staff around campus is friendly and will often strike up a conversation with you.
College Junior,4,They offered me a scholarship when I applied.
College Junior,4,"It's nice to live close when you are up all night working in the studio. You don't have to worry about having to walk alone at night with public safety and the large apartment style dorms are nice. You even get a kitchen to cook in, which is my favorite thing about them!"
College Freshman,4,They are really accommodating and clear about the rules and what the consequences are if they are broken. But this school is based on students reporting other students so if none of your classmates have a problem with what you are doing then you are probably doing nothing wrong and have nothing to worry about.
College Senior,4,All of the students at MCAD are attractive in their own way. Everyone has their own style and works it.
College Senior,4,"There is a large variety to choose from for classes. But once you've declared your major there are main classes that you have to make sure you take before you graduate, but I believe that's normal. There is a large variety of other classes available to take however, outside of your major, so that you can have the chance at a variety. The registration process is a pain, the workload can sometimes be overwhelming. The library and the college center are popular areas for students to gather to study or work on assignments together and there is also a learning center for getting papers looked over and study help."
College Senior,4,"There is a huge diversity at MCAD in how everyone identifies, their religions and views, their backgrounds and their ethnicities. It's part of what makes MCAD so awesome but there are for sure still issues involving all of these things."
College Senior,4,The off-campus dining options near MCAD is pretty great. There is a nice variety of ethnic cuisine within walking distance of the school grounds. And I believe most everything is moderately priced to allow for college students to dine out a few times a week if they choose.
College Freshman,4,I love animation and I would do it over again and relearn the basics of animating and such.
College Freshman,4,"I have gained a lot of experience while being in MCAD, the teachers are always there to help you and they are easily notified via email for questions outside of the classroom."
College Freshman,4,"The diversity on campus is wonderful. There are many ethnicities that come to MCAD to learn and and many clubs that promote sexual orientation, religion, and politics so no one is left out."
College Sophomore,4,The computers and wifi systems around here are all fairly reliable
College Sophomore,4,Declare the major that interests you and they'll teach you what you need to know
College Sophomore,4,Campus security is good but the neighborhood surrounding campus is often considered sketchy.
College Junior,4,It's not a very lively neighborhood.
College Sophomore,4,"It's one of the three colleges in the US that has a BFA in Comics, for one. Also, there's a really good art museum right next door that's free to see, anytime. Because of that, a lot of art classes involve themselves with it. The school is pretty small (something like 800 students) and the entire school, and the dorms, are all on one block. There's a lot of support for pretty much everything--academic, career, emotional, club stuff, whatever. The dorms are really nice too, like mini apartments. And all the technology is really up to date. This is one quality school"
College Sophomore,4,"There is a street known as Eat Street two blocks away, which is filled with a range of different restaurants. And, of course, there's the rest of the city. There's just a lot of decent, cheap, nearby places to eat. Just remember to eat at home sometimes. You have a kitchen for a reason!"
College Sophomore,4,The rules keep most people focused except it is an open campus school so homeless people can sometimes wander in.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms here are incredible. Previously converted apartments, MCAD's dorms are cozy yet spacious. They are lovely workspaces for smaller projects, and a great place to come home to after a long studio class. 

The dorms include kitchen areas, which, although small, pretty much provide everything you need (a fridge, a stovetop oven, a sink, counters, and shelves). Bedrooms are lovely, closets are spacious, and bathrooms are clean. The dorms are really easy to maintain and your RAs will help you with anything you need pertaining to plumbing, cleaning, or even moving out within the school year."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors here are great and very knowledgeable. Our classes consist of fun and learning experiences for the students. I am very satisfied here and never once felt that I was left out of anything because they send everything, such as notice and events through email all the time and if you don't have an appointment with a faculty or professor, you can go in and if they are not busy they are more than happy to help you out."
College Sophomore,4,"The drug stuff and drinking or alcohol isn't very big at all. Of course we have smokers but no one does any bad drug at school. So far, there haven't been any that I've seen or heard of. Plus everyone here at MCAD are very nice and most of us know common sense and we won't try to say ignorant stuff. Although there may be some fools but majority of us are not like that at all so rest assure we can be your best of friends!!!"
College Sophomore,4,Everything works as it should and since everyone has their own laptop people are able to work anywhere they want in their own designed workspace.
College Sophomore,4,It's Minneapolis! There's great food everywhere. There are a variety of options near campus to explore but the further afield you explore the more there is to find.
College Sophomore,4,"At Minneapolis College of Art and Design, I never noticed any drug scene, but it could depend on who people hang out with, then it could vary. And if anything, the only drug scene are some smokers, but they go outside and there's no peer pressure."
College Freshman,4,"Well, I am an art major, and art isn't exactly the most practical major to have. However, my skills have already improved immensely, and the school teaches you not just your major but how to have practical skills in many artistic areas so that you can fulfill any artistic job. I plan to make webcomics, and for a living do any art that comes my way. I love this school, and despite the risks I would definitely take this same path. The school's support of alumni is very good, and graduates have access to the art jobs they post on their website forever."
College Sophomore,4,"I've only spent a fall in Minneapolis, but I don't think it rained the anytime that I was trying to go somewhere. It is rather chilly and windy during the winter, but nothing that you can't handle with the proper clothes. Remember to bring long underwear (even though it may seem icky) and layer up."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone is very unique and different in their own way and no one cares what you look like. We're in an art school so yea you get all kinds of people here o campus. I'm sure if you're looking for a specific type, they're lurking around somewhere. It's not my place to say who's hot or not because to each is own right? You'll just have to see for yourself. But i think everyone is pretty good looking for the most part so good luck out there for whoever you're looking for."
College Senior,2,"Campus crime happens every so often and usually involves people from off campus or people who do not go to MCAD because MCAD has an open campus. Personal safety for everyone is always a potential issue, there are no special security measures. Police and safety services are available but not very effective. Most often I do not ever feel safe walking around on campus outside because anyone can walk through campus, especially when I am by myself I always feel slightly nervous."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have any sports teams, just clubs that offer to play sports. The workout room is pathetic"
College Junior,2,"Try Hard, Try Harder, Try Hardest – Process is fairly easy, but aside from getting good grades it's fairly hard to get extra scholarships from the school.  Once that seem to come with are distance grant, talent (grades), and they tend to increase as you progress.  It's still extremely hard to get enough to attend.
There is a Merit Scholarship competition, and that's about it."
College Junior,2,"Parking permits are allowed for parking lot C, but cards are not available to dorm students (although they can be bought by friends/family members wanting to visit)

The Art Institute of Minneapolis that shares the block with MCAD campus has blocked there lot from MCAD use, so it can be hard to find parking especially with Minneapolis' winter parking restrictions.  It is possible, though generally advised not to bring your car if living in the dorms."
College Junior,2,"Minneapolis No Bueno – I've lived in Minnesota all my life but my first years in Minneapolis were unlike any others.  Lots of crime, homelessness, theft, shady characters, and I even heard my first handgun shot."
College Junior,2,"A Typical Art Student – When one hears the term ""Art Student"", you typically think of a Hispter dork wearing a Fedora and some thick rimmed glasses.  Semi-right.  I am so disappointed in what art students are transitioning into.  It almost feels like your ""supposed to"" dress like that, in order to be respected as a ""real"" artist.  Half the girls I see in school dress like a hobo and it's supposed to be cool! There is an alarming amount of retro looks back as well.  Not even cute retro looks, just weird..weird clothes.  

I however, do not dress this way, and dress the way I feel comfortable.  Jeans and a T-shirt! That way I can concentrate on the art, and not the people.  

Oh yes.  90% of school smokes cigarettes.  Disgusting."
College Student,2,Discovering Your Identity – the school is about you discovering yourself as an artist and to teach skills learned through history.
Alum,1,"Great facilities. Everything else was lacking. I experienced little or no guidance when selecting a major or finding a career. Really disappointed with the instruction & curriculums, it’s hard to get the classes you want. I had a laptop stolen, was almost run over in the parking lot by a drunk driver, security did nothing both times."
Niche User,1,"Move in day was very difficult, very rude parents and little to no directions of where to go. Very disappointed"
College Freshman,1,"Well there is no meal plan on campus. There is a cafe, but it's like any other cafe--not sustainable as an everyday meal. It's a quite nice cafe, with lots of (extremely healthy) options, but the school just doesn't feed their students. They do, however, drive students to the grocery store on weekends, and there is a full kitchen in the dorms."
College Sophomore,1,I don't think there is any greek life. 99.99% sure.

College Junior,1,"I Sure LOVE Having My Car Stolen! I USED to live on campus at my school in Minneapolis.  Never. Again. Will I ever think about living in stupid Minneapolis ever again.

The Minneapolis Art Institute decided they didn't like our 30,000$ a year lease for their parking lot ( Which is never used besides the school ) and kicked us out and made the students park on the street with no designated school parking.  Of course, construction on the school's own lot commenced, but until then, you needed to park on the street. 

I lived on campus, I figured, ""no problem!"".  Boy was I wrong.  I walked out to my car one Friday morning and lo and behold I see nothing.  I look around, and look down, and there in the sunlight is a million glass shards gleaming in the light.  My car had been stolen.

Oh yeah, ON camera, ON campus, and when the parking lot was finished for my school, I wasn't allowed to park in the lot because I lived on campus! ARGH!"

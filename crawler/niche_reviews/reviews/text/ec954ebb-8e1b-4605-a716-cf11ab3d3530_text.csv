Alum,5,"Not applicable. I did not take any courses online during my time at University of California, Santa Barbara therefore cannot accurately attest to the quality of online education at this institution."
Sophomore,5,Being a student at UCSB has been the best experience of my life. Our professors are well-prepared and extremely versed on their academic subjects and engage their students in both in-person and online teaching. Students are generally very happy and enjoy life at UCSB. The party scene and academic excellence at UCSB create a perfect balance for students.
Sophomore,5,"I took all my spring classes online, and even with short notice, the professors did an amazing job and I was still able to receive good grades and increase my hunger to learn."
Junior,5,Online courses super easy and professors were very willing to help adjust to the issues pertaining to the virus
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online through UC Santa Barbara I did enjoy the in person classes, however."
Alum,5,"I loved the UCSB community and the connections I made while there. I was able to find mentors and lifelong friends who support me and my goals. UCSB is unique because of how united the community is. When visiting, strangers are very likely to help visitors, and the students, staff and faculty all work together to make sure the campus climate is safe for all."
Alum,5,"I only took courses online during one of the wildfire seasons where we were forced to evacuate campus, and I have no complaints.  I cannot speak to post-pandemic online courses but from what I've seen professors are more lenient and are finding creative ways to continue to teach materials."
Alum,5,"UCSB is an excellent school, the campus is beautiful and I had great professors available in my program.  You really get the best of both worlds, the student community of Isla Vista is extremely sociable and active, and the academics are challenging and insightful.  Your courses will often be difficult and challenging but through your peers, TAs and professors, and the resources available such as C.L.A.S., you can definitely succeed. Upon graduating numerous opportunities reach out to recruit you as well.  It doesn't hurt to be able to walk to the beach from your apartment or dorm either."
Sophomore,5,"Happiest UC, best college town. Had a great first year present (on campus) before COVID19 hit. If you like the outdoors and the California weather you will love this school. The beach is the backyard, mountains are nearby, and downtown isn't too far. Isla Vista is the perfect little college town, party hard but study harder."
Sophomore,5,"UCSB is obtains one of the most beautiful campuses in California, located right on the beach. It is an excellent research school. There are many research opportunities to get involved with, physically and virtually. Although their science and math departments are very competitive, UCSB portays many amazing resources to help students succeed. Professors are extremely helpful and give you every source you need to succeed in their lectures. UCSB obtains kind and helpful counselors, tutors, TA's etc. One thing is that the campus is very diverse."
Sophomore,5,"The online learning experience is a great way to get students engaged academically from home. UCSB offers many online classes, and most importantly many resources. Gauchospace, which is an online portfolio to view and manage your classes helps students to stay in contact with professors and teacher assistants. It also provides students with an easier access to submit their work and take exams or quizzes as well as having professors upload their lectures. UCSB makes the online learning experience very easy and accessible."
Alum,5,"Only took 1 class online, it was good. Everything you'd expect from an online class. Apart of the certificate program which is an extension of UCSB so I think it was geared more toward part-time students, didn't require much effort or time."
Alum,5,Lots of opportunities to get involved. Transferred to UCSB junior year & still felt like I had the full 4 year experience.
Freshman,5,"I just completed my first year at UC Santa Barbara and I have had such an amazing experience so far. I immediately got involved by becoming a President of my hall council and member of the Residential Housing Association. I got really involved on campus and worked with great people. I loved RHA so much that I ran and became the Finance Vice President. RHA has been a huge part in making my experience at UCSB great. The campus itself is beautiful as it has its own beach and lagoon. All of my professors and teaching assistants have been approachable and understanding. I've learned so much in just a year of attending UCSB. The school is not very diverse, however I feel the campus life and organizations definitely provide a sense of community for everyone especially including minorities. The on-campus housing is comfortable and each Resident Hall has its own sense of community. The dining halls also have multiple food options including vegan and vegetarian."
Freshman,5,"I've already made amazing friends, and school hasn't even started yet. 
There's a wide range of classes available to all students, and everyone is willing to help. They make going into college not so terrifying."
Freshman,5,"I've only had orientation online, and I was the first session but it was still amazing. It was very engaging and to an extent, I preferred it over one that would be in person."
Junior,5,"UCSB has such a welcoming, co-operative environment, where students see their peers as teammates and friends, not as rivals. The beaches, sunsets, and party scene cannot be matched anywhere else. But even though UCSB is known for its social life and beaches, the school also has excellent academics and research opportunities for all of its students. There's nothing quite like the thought of studying on the beach to make you want to go back after a long time away."
Senior,5,"The online learning experience is good for me. My instructors tried their best to make a great remote learning environment for students. And some of the instructors reduce a few tests or essays, because they're nice, kind and totally understand students' hardship."
Alum,5,"It was a good time. I would love to see more majors being offered, there are a lack of majors to choose from."
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman and I have already fallen in love with my school. The location is beautiful, right next to the beach and many awesome places to visit. Go Gauchos !"
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman and I have already fallen in love with my school. The location is beautiful, right next to the beach and many awesome places to visit. Go Gauchos !"
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online classes at UCSB but from what I heard, my friends had good experiences with them. I'm not sure about them now since I graduated in 2019 before Covid-19."
Alum,5,"UCSB, while having incredible weather right by the beach in beautiful and diverse Santa Barbara, is also an incredible research university that has endless opportunities. You will find you passion and your people there and get world class education that is inclusive to all people."
Sophomore,5,"All of my professors were understanding of the struggles that students may have been facing during this difficult time and were open to working with students for the benefit of a successful education. Though it was a learning curve for both students and professors, all of my professors did what they found to be effective in their teaching techniques. Most lectures were recorded in order for students to be able to watch them on their ideal times. We would meet with TAs for section once a week which ensured clarity of work and class lessons. There were also many resources for contacting teachers such as email, zoom meetings and class chats."
Sophomore,5,"UC Santa Barbara has an extremely welcoming community with endless possibilities to make friends and enjoy your time there. Classes are mostly very competitive and ensure students are learning in efficient ways. One of my favorite parts is being right next to the beach! Being stressed with school work then looking over at the peaceful ocean leaves you with a sense of ease. The entire campus is beautiful and has lots of nature and always good weather.  I am very grateful and happy to be attending the University of California, Santa Barbara."
Sophomore,5,UCSB is more amazing than I expected! The academics are rigorous but interesting. This school's social life is fun and exciting. The campus is beautiful and the professors and faculty are amazing.
Senior,5,"I have not taken any online courses, however due to the COVID crisis we had to move online. The teaching staff and administration made this transition very fluid for the entire campus and allowed for an easy transition. UCSB showed they have the best intentions for their students success."
Senior,5,"Our academics here at UCSB rank among the top in the entire nation. You will not be disappointed with the quality of education you will get.

We are among the most diverse campuses in the local area. Everyone on campus is involved and welcoming to every type of student. You will find someone just like you here. 

Our athletics are amazing! Our basketball team made it to the sweet 16 and our sports scene is very vibrant. GO TO THE SOCCER GAMES. You wont regret it. 

The professors here are some of the top researchers in their fields. 

Plenty of dorms and undergraduate housing near or on campus. Including the local college community of Isla Vista. 

We have a college police force as well as an Isla Vista police force that establish safety for the students. 

UCSB will not disappoint you. Just come and check out the campus, or check it out while you are on vacation! We all know you will probably come to Santa Barbara for your next vacation! Even if you’re a local ;) Good luck!"
Graduate Student,5,"I loved UCSB as an undergraduate. There was always something happening that it was impossible to be bored which also meant more potential distractions from academics. However, the environment UCSB touts allowed me to develop a balance between my academics, health, and activities. It really was the best place to meet new people, learn as much as possible, and further my personal growth. For example, like many of my colleagues, I wished there weren't as many General Education courses to take to graduate. But reflecting back as a graduate student, I realized there was something I took away from each of those classes that made me feel more academically rounded as an individual. Every experience I had at UCSB was inherently unique (the LGBTQ+ community, the parties, even the coursework!) and I wouldn't trade them for anything else."
Alum,5,"I came into UC Santa Barbara as a Sociology major. I transferred from a two year community college. I had an amazing experience. I met international students, students coming from high school, and other transfer students like me. You have to check out the nearby cities and beaches. The beach near Santa Barbara City College is beautiful. It helped that I am naturally a social person. I joined and interacted with different clubs and activities. My best advice is to explore the sites and beauty of Santa Barbara."
Alum,5,"I loved the campus life, friends I made, and career opportunities. I liked that the campus was located right next to the beach."
Freshman,5,"This school is amazing despite the stereotype of it being a party school. If you want to be successful, you will in this school. yes"
Senior,5,"Overall, my experience at UCSB has been life-changing. There are many resources to help ease your transition from high school to college. One of the hardest things for me was adjusting to the quarter system (10 weeks per quarter). It is VERY fast-paced and can be overwhelming. However, it does teach you to stay on your A-game and you have the opportunity to take more classes. The best part of UCSB is the beach. The campus is right on the beach and student housing is a short walk or bike ride from the beach!"
Junior,5,UCSB provides a diverse and inclusive environment that has resources for all. I have especially liked the legal resources provided. I had a roommate dispute and UCSB provided me with an attorney to help me get through my conflict. I also like the easy access Student Health Center that is conveniently located and easy to navigate. These resource make being away from home easy and comfortable. What I have disliked it the transition to online classes due to the current pandemic. It was rough navigating this new online world with professors that have not been trained with online learning.
Sophomore,5,"I truly believe that UCSB is the best place in the whole world. The academics, people, culture, and location are all the best you could find. I have never experienced such an accepting, excited, and ambitious community of students and faculty, and would not change my college experience so far one bit. And plus, where else are you going to see a top-tier school just steps away from the beach?"
Alum,5,"UCSB is a dream school if you serious about your studies and having a good time. It is located right on the beach, has the perfect weather, is extremely social, always has activities going on, is overall a very active and social scene. The classes and professors are great, I met some lifelong friends, and I overall had the time of my life in that little bubble called Isla Vista."
Alum,5,"To start, I am BEYOND proud to be a Gaucho. I absolutely fell in love with this school because of all the great opportunities and resources this diverse campus had to offer. UC Santa Barbara was my home away from home. My experience as a student exceeded my expectations due to being taught by brilliant and helpful professors, having numerous resources available for all students, safe housing options, delicious campus food, its friendly environment and of course, an absolute stunning campus. One thing I would like to see change at UC Santa Barbara is for the library to expand. I regularly studied in the library, but during certain times of the day, it was difficult to find a space to study. I would often spend a great deal of time checking each floor for an open seating. Secondly, it would be beneficial to students who commute on bike to not have to struggle to find an available bike spot. In summary, I rate UC Santa Barbara with a 5+ stars!"
Freshman,5,"Excellent location. It truly is the ""Campus by the Sea."" Very strong sense of community. Met a lot of great people and made friends for life."
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful opportunity to get involved, explore courses of study, and work closely with professors!"
Freshman,5,its good its very good i like this school its  a very good school yes very nice school yes i like the school in very nice area come on is this 100 characters yet why doesnt it let me submit
Freshman,5,"UCSB is not only in a beautiful location,  but it also offers the best education you could ask for. I feel like I am already smarter and I only have attended one quarter of classes. There are so many resources available to get you to success. Apply!"
Freshman,5,Love the campus. It is beautiful here every day but seriously lacking in diversity. everyone if very friendly.
Sophomore,5,"The environment and interesting people really increase the quality of life at UCSB. The professors are very cool and show you that they are just normal adults like us, with a little more knowledge than us though. It is easy to be happy with your courses here because the classes are fun and engaging and you can literally study on the beach if you wanted. The views and weather always put people in a good mood, and there is such a large population of active students, whether it be in clubs or physical activities like surfing."
Niche User,5,Overall my review of UCSB is nothing but a stellar campus with an almost amazing campus life to go along side it
Freshman,5,I love the campus community. I wish the dining halls were more accessible with regards to hours of operation.
Senior,5,"It’s a beautiful campus near the beach with many clubs to chose from, when going to visit they have a very nice soccer stadium, and art decor. Usually went for rallies."
Senior,5,I love the location and diversity of guest speakers/lecturers that are invited to the school. There are a ton of resources for students and interesting classes.
Freshman,5,"UCSB is a gorgeous school, with a large but easy-to-navigate campus. Academics are a definite priority, but there are plenty of opportunities to get involved in sports, clubs, support groups, fraternities and sororities, etc."
Junior,5,"I love UCSB - the faculty is extremely qualified and knowledgeable, but are still extremely approachable and kind. The investment in undergraduate research is what I appreciate most about UCSB. The graduate program is very small in order to give younger students the opportunity to participate in research as assistants in graduate students' and professors' labs. You can even apply for grants to do and publish your own research. In addition to stellar academics, the campus in located in probably the most ideal location, there are mountains to the east of you and the ocean to the west. The campus offers many opportunities to stay active and healthy. At UCSB, they truly advocate for your learning and wellbeing every step of the way."
Sophomore,5,"I am really enjoying my time at UCSB. Not only are the professor motivating and friendly, the students are so welcoming and supportive of each other. It really creates a wonderful environment to learn, meet new people, and try new things at UCSB."
Niche User,5,The parties are crazy but can be better. A lot of diversity. The safety is good in the day but in the night not good.
Freshman,5,I'm having an amazing time here at the University of California - Santa Barbara. There's always something to do for everyone here.
Junior,5,"I love this place. People are both down to earth and passionately engaged in their academic or artistic pursuits. It's an astoundingly beautiful campus and location, and I'm still impressed by how scholarly the faculty and many students are, as well has how high quality the performances from the music and theatre departments are. It's an all around awesome place."
Senior,5,The environment was very relaxing and made it easier to take a break when school felt like alot of pressure. I also like the fact that all my classes were easy to get to. Never had an issue of getting lost.
Alum,5,"Best college experience EVER! Perfect mixture of academics, research, professional development, and social life to jump start your skills in and out of the classroom."
Sophomore,5,The environment is super friendly and there's a lot of diversity. Plus it's right next to the beach for all sun lovers.
Niche User,5,"Excellent school,Excellent schoolExcellent school love the location,ove the locatioove the locatio provides amazing quality educationprovides amazing quality educationprovides amazing quality education and super good professors.very goodsuper good professors.very goodsuper good professors.very goodsuper good professors.very goodsuper good professors.very good"
Niche User,5,"I like that UCSB is one of the few college campuses in the US that actually owns beach property, and plenty of students regularly enjoy the beautiful beachfront. Also, students in UCSB was friendly. I had a campus tour and the guide was really kind, and she told us a lot of things about college stuff. Also, I liked that some of the major like psychology, sociology, and international/global studies is popular in UCSB."
Junior,5,"Beautiful campus, excellent academics and vivid student life! UCSB is your place to go if you want to live right by the beach and experience college at its fullest!"
Senior,5,"UCSB has been a wonderful experience. The students, teachers, atmosphere and location all adds to it. I have never complained about anything here. I would recommend this school to anyone. They are accepting of anyone and everyone that wishes to attend."
Junior,4,People are really respectful of each other and the learning atmosphere is great because everyone is supportive. Professors are really open to talk to students and are willing to make adjustments to classes when needed.
Junior,4,"There have been a lot of assignments in the period of online learning. However, professors are willing to make necessary changes to the syllabus when requested (and are reasonable) in order to motivate students to learn"
Junior,4,It’s hard to find your place on such a big campus. Quarter systems are hard to adjust to if you’re not used to them and classes are tough.
Junior,4,"Switching to online was a transition for everyone but the pros and cons each had lists. Adjusting to anything new is hard. When your quarters are short, transitioning is more difficult"
Senior,4,"The cost of living is very expensive, but I love the school and the location. It is definitely one of the best UCs."
Sophomore,4,"The professors I have had for online learning have been incredibly understanding. However, I have mainly learned either on my own or through homework. There was a lack of fruitful lectures and the connection would be harder to attain for those who need strong guidance."
Sophomore,4,"Unfortunately, I have spent much of my college experience stuck quarantining, but when I was there it was some of the most fun I have ever had. A completely new experience from high school. The vibe between the people was welcoming and encouraging."
Alum,4,"A nice school with a focus on academics and social life, conveniently located next to the beach. An all-around ideal college experience! Would definitely recommend to students looking for a well-rounded college experience."
Junior,4,Overall the counselors were very helpful and super easy to contact. It made the entire process of transferring super easy
Sophomore,4,"Adjusting but doing the best they can given the situation. Can be challenging managing the online schedule, and some professors are much more prepared than others."
Sophomore,4,"Many professors have been more lenient because of the sudden shift to online learning. Many have made great adjustments and are very flexible. I prefer having synchronous lectures and discussions, but only a few students ever participate in class."
Sophomore,4,A beautiful location and inviting campus. Most classes are excellent and faculty is hard to beat. My only complaint is that the campus feels a bit isolated.
Junior,4,"There was difficulty at the end of winter quarter, since the shelter in place orders were still up in the air finals week leading to a lot of stress for students trying to study while worrying about getting home. If the university had been a little more proactive and declared remote finals earlier, some of this could have been avoided so professors would have had time to plan instead of hurrying to adapt to online problems.
I had no difficulty with the transition to online schooling spring quarter, since all of my professors understood the software and difficulties of remote learning and accommodate for them by the end of spring break. Zoom lectures became attendance optional and recorded with powerpoints and notes provided so all students had equal access regardless of time zone or home obligations. The biggest change was that most of my classes used project based learning structures than the exam-oriented style most of my classes used in the past. My TAs were incredibly helpful."
Senior,4,"UCSB is an excellent research school with a beautiful environment. Most of the courses have to be self-study but there are a lot of friendly instructors. Some of the departments are very competitive and those employees are icy-colds, such as Economic, Math and Biology. The College of Engineering is very popular. The mood of this school is not as relax as others described. Definitely a party school, there are so many parties and bars around the campus. Study hard, Play hard. UC Santa Barbara has rich natural resources. If you're learning Geography, Environmental Studies, or Earth Sciences, you'll own many learning opportunities. Security is good. Campus Point is a super nice place, you need to visit there!"
Senior,4,"Overall I would say it's a really good UC, especially since over the years it's only improved to be better and better. Campus is really pretty and it's right by the beach so beach day literally any day! And the social life/party scene pretty chill too, most people eventually end up making good friendship groups since the students are so so so so friendly. 

I do have to say the diversity is very lacking (student body mostly consists of those from one type of racial, socioeconomic background, I'll let you guess which it is) so the school needs to do a better job about that area."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy UCSB. The social life is definitely worth it but some professors give you a hard time. Others are great but in general, academic life needs to be kept separate from personal life."
Sophomore,4,"The coronavirus pandemic affected our school very quickly. Many student, like myself, who could return home were encouraged to do so. I think that the switch to remote instruction was preformed as smoothly as possible given the circumstances and the time frame. The online classes were not as engaging as in person classes but i believed them to be of very high quality."
Alum,4,I didn't have any online classes. I did dabble with technological resources. It was pretty up to speed when I went there.
Alum,4,I loved the location and supportive atmosphere at UCSB. Students are committed to helping each other. I would love to see a better focus on retention of  minority students and financial support.
Junior,4,"It's an unprecedented situation- most of my professors have been understanding and working well with students, but others haven't at all, which is frustrating for students."
Junior,4,"Big culture shock at first, but caring staff and very active/involved community has made it a great place to be."
Junior,4,"UCSB is a very welcoming and inclusive school. Students are very open minded and not too competitive when it comes to sharing notes or creating study groups. People like to hang out and help each other a lot. I love the UCSB community and how there is a high environmental awareness on any activity the campus does. 

There is not much I would like to see change at UCSB, but now I am hoping that all staff, professors, students and families are staying safe and that after the COVID-19 pandemic calms down that the down to earth community in Santa Barbara continues to grow."
Sophomore,4,"This school is very academically rigorous (especially in STEM fields), but the teachers are available for help."
Senior,4,"The campus is beautiful. The community is very open and welcoming. The academics are challenging, but there are resources available to help students. While these resources are there, they are not equally available to everyone all of the time. Mental health resources usually get taken up quickly and students find themselves waiting weeks or even a couple of months to talk to a licensed psychologist. Professors are not always understanding of students' unique circumstances, but that is probably what it is like at most colleges. Everyone says how important your mental health is, yet I don't think that there is enough patience or care given to those who are struggling with mental health issues. It is a good school overall, I just wish that the resources didn't feel so limited at times. Outside of academics, there are a lot of beautiful places and things to explore and discover, which can make the years spent here really fun and worthwhile."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed the campus atmosphere and the opportunities presented by the campus. I do wish there was more diversity on campus.
Freshman,4,"UCSB is rated as one of the best universities in the nation due to its location, research, and education. Living in Isla Vista is one of the big upsides of going to school at UCSB. You will find an amazing college atmosphere in our little town along with an environment that many consider a paradise. The classes are difficult as expected from a UC, but you will find that many of the professors are very passionate which is very motivational."
Sophomore,4,"UCSB still has a party reputation, but don't let this scare you off because it is a highly ranked academic college. Students at this school develop great time management skills as they manage a quick paced quarter system full of rigorous courses while still maintaining a vibrant social life. Professors, more often than not, are there to support you in office hours even if they seem intimidating. Overall this college is a great choice for people seeking a worthwhile education but also appreciate the breathtaking views of the ocean that can be seen from the library."
Senior,4,"I am a first generation student and although these institutions pride on being a Hispanic Serving Institute it hurts to say that it is not always that way. Most students have to demand certain changes/help when these individuals should be the first ones lending out a hand to the minority students. The scenery at UCSB is beautiful, the students here stand in solidarity with each other for the most part, the non-profit organizations do amazing jobs being a resource the community. UCSB is by the beach, the professors are usually understanding and we get to learn a lot from them. #COLAFOREVERYONE"
Alum,4,As a first gen person of color there was definitely a lot of having to reach out for extra assistance which I thought was very much available. Work opportunities however were difficult to come by on campus.
Freshman,4,UC Santa Barbara gives the students a proper feeling of freedom and independence without allowing the student to go through their college experience without proper resources. The physics program is also very extensive making it good for those who are interested. The teachers of course vary and social life is also very good considering how close the campus is to Isla Vista
Sophomore,4,The location of the campus is beautiful. It is relaxing and there are many great spots to study outside your dorm or apartment. The classes are engaging and professors do a great job teaching.
Freshman,4,"UCSB has this aura surrounding it that makes it enchanted. The skies are usually clear and the weather is splendid to the point that some people could get sick of the sunny weather, but not many do! Many professors express enthusiasm for their subject; however that does not include the math department. Those professors in humanities have passions for social justice primarily, but everyone on campus believes in improvement, hence the organized demonstrations that occur quarterly. We are a united, diverse campus that voices concerns in regard to any social reform. Just recently, we joined UCSC by standing in solidarity with the graduate students fighting for COLA. This campus may have difficult courses, but the resources available to its students has made it manageable to keep up with course material. The CLAS program is especially useful in my case for chemistry and math. The extra practice and one-on-one attention keeps me motivated and productive."
Freshman,4,"I love the people/community, location, resources, and just overall vibe of this campus. I feel honored to be able to pursue my dreams in one of the best schools overall in CA."
Alum,4,"I had a few incredible professors that I will never forget. Other professors seemed too involved in their research or too comfortable because of tenure to put in effort to teach well. I made some amazing memories and life-long friends along the way, but I wish that I would have been warned that my major does not lead to many good jobs. I just picked what I enjoyed studying without knowing where it would take me after I was done with college."
Junior,4,"I truly enjoy the learning experience at University of Santa Barbara.  Excellent faculty and teacher's assistants, help clarify any concerns I have regarding a course.  I especially enjoy the resources available to us including the transfer center, career services, and counseling/psychological services.  Additionally, academic advisors made transferring a much easier experience, providing assistance on my course planning as well as any other issues that arise."
Senior,4,"Some professors are difficult but the location is beautiful. The campus is very beachy, and there is a huge party scene. The professor and academics can vary based on the major and the dorms are close to dining halls. The dorms are average to poor and local area has more Asian food. It can be dangerous during night time in Isla Vista for a girl."
Niche User,4,I don't attend this school but hopefully I will. I have been to the campus twice and I felt like I was at home. The environment is calm and casual and beachy if you like that then this college will feel right at home.
Niche User,4,"I loved the area. The town of Isla Vista is a great college town, right on the beach. There is nothing that I would change about my experience at UCSB."
Freshman,4,"My experience as a first year at this school is fairly positive I enjoy the campus and diversity the school has. I enjoy going to class due to the interesting classes and professors. One thing I would like to see change is maybe the campus dining hours as sometimes the interfere with class hours and I believe that there are other schools that don’t have Dinning halls close. Another thing I find difficult is the fact that semiconductor years can’t live in school apartments until there third year, it can be expensive to live in dorms for 2 years. Overall the school is great and very considerate to students needs"
Freshman,4,"I think that UCSB is a pleasant enough school. It is not too hard to find a group of friends or get into activities such as student clubs, project teams, sports, etc. Professors are not too bad, but bad ones still exist. I would not recommend going off campus because IV is ugly and loud and downtown is far off."
Freshman,4,"University of California Santa Barbara has a beautiful campus and offers many opportunities for involvement. Many of the professors are engaging and passionate about the subjects that they teach. The university, however, should look to clean up the beaches nearby as they are constantly covered in oil and tar."
Freshman,4,"I love being literally right next to the beach every day and, since I don't drive, being able to take the bus into town for free whenever I'd like. There are also over 500 clubs on campus to get involved in. If you are interested in the performing arts, all of the plays that the Theater & Dance department offers hold auditions for anyone interested, regardless of major. While there is a definite party scene at UCSB, it is not as intense as it used to be and is easily avoidable if partying isn't your thing. For the most part, everyone on campus, both students and staff, are very friendly and approachable. There are also really good services that UCSB offers such as CAPS and CARE and many offices for different ethnicities, cultures, and sexual/gender preferences that anyone can visit anytime. They are also great places to meet new people with similar backgrounds and interests too."
Freshman,4,"My first six weeks there, I met so may inspiring people.  The school is very active, and people are open minded.  I also love going to surf or just walking on the beach after class to reduce some stress."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and there really is a place for everyone. There are many clubs, and things to do to meet new people. Everyone looks out for each other and the community is absolutely great."
Sophomore,4,The professors here know their stuff pretty well. Just that some are better at teaching the material to students and some aren't as good. It's a smaller campus if that's what you are looking for. You can bike from one side of campus to the other in 5 minutes.
Freshman,4,"It is a great school. Great weather, welcoming culture. The party scene can be wild, but do not let that deter you. Many students do not partake in partying, and focus on academics. The academics are world-class, with amazing professors."
Sophomore,4,"The student life is great and the campus has so much to offer.  There is so much to do in Isla Vista, very close to campus.  There is a beach within walking distance or enjoy the ocean on warm days.  Surfing or bike on nearby trails. Enjoy excellent food at local restaurants in Isla Vista, Goleta or take a drive down to Santa Barara which is just 15 minutes away.  The campus is small enough to bike everywhere and large enough to explore. It's a safe campus and there is a diversity of students and activities for everyone.  Great place."
Senior,4,"UCSB is a great school, I came in as a transfer and they have a lot of programs, and even apartments to make the transition smooth. Some parts of the campus are a bit run down, but overall the campus is very beautiful and less than a mile away from the beach. It is a pretty big party school, but there are many other ways for students to enjoy themselves such as student organizations, and places to road trip near by such as Big Sur or Solvang. I do think more can be done with sexual assault as with any campus, but I think there should definitely be more programs focused on that matter. With the school being a party school, I believe sexual assault is more likely to occur."
Junior,4,"UC Santa Barbara offers a wide range of academic and professional opportunities. However, a large of students are not aware of the resources available to them."
Senior,4,"UCSB is a wonderful sanctuary for students to express themselves and to expand their minds on issues in another perspective. While there is culture shock coming to campus as a person of color, there are student facilities that cater to the marginalized students on campus. I wish to see bigger facilities, more participation, and more funding to these great organizations. Santa 
Barbara is an expensive place to live, but it definitely is a beautiful place to live."
Senior,4,"In terms of appearance, the campus looks nice, as it is located near a beach. 

The social life, from what I have observed, is not too bad. There seems to be a lot of amiable and approachable people.

The academic life is typical. Even though UCSB is stereotyped as a party school, a lot of students devote most of their efforts into studying. The thing about UCSB is that people do not tend to be very cutthroat when it comes to achieving their best academically.

In terms of the scientific research, there are a lot of opportunities at UCSB. I don't really know much about the research outside of my field, but I do know that UCSB is well known for its marine biology research and research in materials science. It would be better if UCSB has more medical research, but I can understand why it does not because it does not have a medical school. Nonetheless, there are a few medical research taking place there."
Alum,4,I had a really great college experience at UCSB. I only wish that I had participate more in clubs and other extra-curricular activities besides my Major/Minor focus. The teachers are great and the campus is beautiful. It is always nice to walk around and see smiling faces in town.
Sophomore,4,"UC Santa Barbara is a wonderful institution that provides great opportunities and truly cares about its students. No other university spends so much time and resources to ensure that their students get involved in research early on. The professors are generally good and interested in their students success, but not all. Most students live off campus in Isla Vista, a community made up almost completely with students, as it is more affordable. The student community is very friendly and easy going. Just be careful if you aren't a self-motivated individual, it is easy to get caught up in the fun and distracted from your studies. Classes are hard, but you get a lot out of them. UCSB is on the quarter system, which means you take more classes but they're very fast paced."
Sophomore,4,"UCSB is what you make of it. The campus is beautiful. Yes, there is a big social scene, but only if you choose to partake in it. Classes can be challenging, but professors and TA's are mostly good. Political Science department can be frustrating, but it sometimes feels the university underfunds humanities departments in favor of STEM departments."
Sophomore,4,One of the best UCs for STEM majors and it's got some pretty great professors. Great atmosphere too!
Freshman,4,I have met amazing people and the classes are very interesting. The reason I did give it five stars is because of the obvious gap between the privileged and those who are not as privileged. Also because it is not the safest school to attend.
Junior,4,"UCSB is overall a great environment. With the academics increasing in depth every year and the social scene vibrant with beach life, it can often feel like this school has it all. Sometimes UCSB can feel clique-y, and it lacks the diversity of big city schools."
Sophomore,4,"This is an awesome school, with great classes and professors and a beautiful campus. Living in the Santa Catalina dorm, while it was further from campus, was great, as was the food at most of the dining halls. It's a super social campus which has its pros and cons."
Sophomore,4,"This university is a canvas of innovation and possibility, and I am proud to be attending this university."
Sophomore,4,"Some majors are extremely weak at UCSB, such as computer science engineering... However, the environment here at UCSB is a very work hard play hard vibe, where you have time to hang out with friends but when its time for finals all students will buckle down and get to work. Of course everyone says we are a party school, but that's because we throw the best parties because of our amazing location. Face it, you can find parties at every single university, it just so happens that SB's parties are better."
Senior,2,"Online learning is a scam at the moment. Although nobody can help the current situation, the college is not offering any leeway in terms of tuition costs."
Freshman,2,It is very over promised and under delivered. The lack of school spirit here compared to other schools is atrocious
Junior,2,"I had a wonderful time my first semester at Santa Barbara, but that is because it took time for problems to accumulate. The school works very hard at flooding optimism your way- beware of orientation which makes you pay $84 per person for a week before registration. It is useless. In outside apartments, you have room to experiment with music, recreational activities like pool, frisbee, surfing, and friends because of their plethora of rules and regulations. What hurts the school is its lack of dedication to academia. The film department is very lacking in professors who actually care about incorporating method and practice. More, they obsess over appearances and reputation. If you don't have the name or the look they’re looking for you are taken major advantage of. The easiest way to tell if a professor cares is if they have 1 TA. If  they have more they are not grading your work and do not care. Getting the scoop for classes and professor involves lots and lots of eavesdropping."
College Freshman,2,Triples is being enforced for freshmen this year and it's very expensive for a crammed little room of three. Not enough closet space either.
College Sophomore,2,Chile I hope I get a job after this...
College Sophomore,2,We don't even have a football team.
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you don't for sure want to go into research, don't go to this school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The professors here are here to do research, not to teach, and it shows. They teach in lecture halls of up to 800 students in an inherently disengaging manner. Students end up cramming and regurgitating information for tests every few weeks.

My interest in mathematics was seriously curbed when I came to this school because I simply did not learn the way it was taught. I'm not alone in this viewpoint.

The classes are as difficult as the professor feels like making them, rather than as difficult as the subject inherently is.

I have not grown in any academic disciplines whatsoever since I have been at UCSB. In several disciplines, I have regressed considerably."
Recent Alumnus,2,They keep letting in more and more freshmen so rooms intended as already small doubles are now triples with 3 people sharing two closets. Alcohol and drug policies are overreaching and ruthlessly enforced. Even the farthest dorm is only a mile from campus; the others are within walking distance of class. Social atmosphere in the dorms was great. I'm still good friends with a lot of the people I met three years ago.
Recent Alumnus,2,Wouldn't choose this school again if I had it to do over. Not the right environment for me at all.
College Sophomore,2,Crime is common in IV and cops seem more focussed on ticketing people for sitting on curbs than curbing sexual assault.
College Sophomore,2,Athletics are not very important to UCSB. We get our kicks elsewhere.
College Sophomore,2,no variety of courses at school some classes can also be very big
College Sophomore,2,not worth what we pay
College Freshman,2,Lots of the groups have bad reputations.
College Freshman,2,"I like to be alone and I like quiet, but I ended up in the two tower dorms with 10 floors each.  My floormates (who I do not call friends) have never socialized with me, and rarely do I even get a smile from them as a hello.  Also, they don't respect quiet hours and although I brought this up to the RA, I still wonder if the RA ever said anything to them.  The room is spacious compared to other dorms, but still cramped feeling.  Being off campus is a bit of a struggle, but having to bike to class makes you not get that Freshman 15."
College Freshman,2,"UCSB has been known for its partying and there are visible signs of that. However, there are also a great deal of students who choose not to participate and peer pressure is very minimal."
College Junior,2,"Honestly, I go to a small school, an art school none-the-less, we don't have a gym, but we have studios to work in 20 hours out of the day, and our faculty usually have a fitness awareness day, or a 'relaxation' day for the students to enjoy several times every month"
College Freshman,2,"Drug and alcohol easily visible to students, used by others daily, peer pressure is moderate, policies enforced if students health is in danger."
College Junior,2,"Living and trying to attend UCSB for low income students is almost close to impossible especially for first generation students. The environment is friendly for long boarders, a bicyclist. It is a party school and the community college students tend to always party without regards for the UCSB students."
College Junior,2,"The only reason to join Greek life is the party lifestyle, and you can find better parties outside of the Greek system."
College Junior,2,Expensive and terrible landlords. Noise isn't regulated very well.
College Sophomore,2,There is not much financial assistance or support and many people are struggling
College Junior,2,"If we're solely grading Isla Vista, then its bad. Goleta has a few options as well as the downtown area. Honestly, its about getting lucky and being smart"
College Sophomore,2,The rent is really high and the housing quality is low.
College Freshman,2,"Isla Vista is the main place for off-campus housing. It's a very nice community, full of restaurants but it's very unsafe."
College Freshman,2,"Cheap/low-quality housing albeit numerous. While it's nice to live in the atmosphere of Isla Vista, you'll find yourself missing the amenities of home."
College Senior,2,"Greeks love being Greek and enjoy their lifestyle, but often are seen as cliquey."
College Junior,2,"I got decent financial aid but the process is grueling. Too many additional documents need to be sent which is fine for the purpose of checking, but needs to be faster. I was having problems when the quarter already started and fees were due"
College Sophomore,2,very huge competition -- limited majors making it harder competition
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not very prevalent on campus at all, however Frats throw great parties for any girls. If you go Greek, that's good for you. If you're a GDI, that's even better."
College Sophomore,2,Didn't have a great experience personally.  Receiving all loans
College Sophomore,2,I recieved aid last year but they took forever to distribute it thati was charged late fee and was almost dropped out of my classes.
College Sophomore,2,I got a $2000 scholarship for performance but only got $666 of it. When I changed my major to Ethnomusicology I lost all of the rest of it.
College Sophomore,2,"The social atmosphere is great, but the facilities are pretty terrible depending on which housing you live in. The meal plans are less than good as well."
College Freshman,2,It's very loose. there is a new large amount of found freedom here.
College Freshman,2,It's popular but it is not mandatory to be a part of.
College Senior,2,"Financial aid has been difficult at this school. Once I think I have all forms in, I'll be notified to turn in more. The whole process is a bit confusing, and it's pretty much left up to the student to figure things out. This is definitely an area of this school that needs major work."
College Sophomore,2,"Some professors are great, but it seems like the majority are some of the worst imaginable. Registration can also be a pain and it's likely that you won't get a class you need."
College Sophomore,2,"It's increasingly scary in IV in light of recent events, but I know that there is a lot being done to increase the safety. Jst don;t walk alone, girls especially."
College Sophomore,2,"It's pretty tricky to find parking in IV, and it can be hard to find parking by Campbell hall."
College Junior,2,All the restaurants are expensive and close way too early for a college town.
College Junior,2,The facilities is worse than the 24 hour fitness
College Junior,2,It's not that great so I rarely use it.
College Freshman,2,"Expensive, unsafe, and parking is an absolute nightmare."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much diversity. There aren't a lot of minority students and the school consists of mostly white students.
College Freshman,2,"I have only lived off-campus in Isla Vista. 

Pro: walking/biking distance to both school and the beach.

Con: far from everything else. Loud. Dangerous at times. Landlords seem generally helpless against noise.

Cost: 600-800 per month for a shared space. Often close to the beach.

Parking: cars are frequently (every night) vandalized by drunk partiers. Mirrors, glass and antennas often smashed. Also, you cannot drive to school before 5 pm if you live in Isla Vista.

Safety: there is a number to call to be walked home at night by another student if you feel unsafe. Otherwise, Isla Vista has growing to do in this area. Residents seem pretty apathetic to lack of safety in exchange for the party climate, and it's not rare for music to be blasting past the 11 pm cut off. Multiple brutal crimes by outside people have occurred in past months."
College Freshman,2,It is so difficult to get financial aid here.  I am still struggling to find any.
College Sophomore,2,They don't enforce the rules which can be dangerous
College Junior,2,I haven't been able to apply to any kind of finnancial aid
College Freshman,2,I am a personal student who encountered some racist remarks
College Junior,2,"Coming from a big city, I found that the dining experience here was a little disappointing. I may be grading this too harshly though. The restaurants are on the expensive side and student discounts don't cover much. There is however a lot of variety, especially downtown. There's French, American, Vietnamese, Indian, etc. There's plenty, I just wouldn't say they're amazing, but it's nice every once in a while if you have the money. I prefer to cook."
College Freshman,2,"Scholarships are fine, but it's hard for someone within my demographic to receive any sort of help from FAFSA, other than an invitation to take out loans."
College Freshman,2,The airport is too expensive to get much use pout of and the train stations are hard to access without a car.
College Freshman,2,"We do not have a business, education, or physical therapy majors. We seem to not have quite a few majors."
College Freshman,2,The rent is very high at many of the nicer places and parking is a huge issue. It seems as if the rent pre ices go up every year.
College Freshman,2,There is little to no parking on the streets of Isla Vista.
College Freshman,2,"I would never bring my car up there, too expensive and I wouldn't use it all that much."
College Junior,2,There are two bars right next to campus other than that then we have to go downtown. 
College Junior,2,It's very high pricing and not that much of variety. 
Freshman,1,Online learning is a joke in any school. No motivation at all. Its hopeless since I can't concentrate and there are so many other problems.
Freshman,1,"Do not come to this school. The university always finds a way to scam students Want to take a lab? $36. Someone throw up in your residence hall and didn't claim it? $100. Worse yet? Zero financial aid is offered for out-of state students. Contrarily, in-state minority students that pass by a slim margin are rewarded heavily with cheaper tuition, better opportunities for on-campus employment/scheduling. The professors have such a blatant lack of care for the subject matter they teach and the students they are teaching. If the teacher arrives late and doesn't finish lecturing-too bad! Expect to see it on the exam without even addressing the subject matter in class. Moreover, the school loves to tot around the idea of ""resources"" which don't pan out.  Lastly, want to take classes that actually apply to your major? Good luck! Everything is already filled up."
College Sophomore,1,you never see this happening on campus
College Sophomore,1,we have bad representatives and very shady people leading and allowing who gets in or not
College Junior,1,I never received any financial aid and my family is struggling.
College Junior,1,Isla Vista culture condones sexual assault and abuse. I stay away from it.
College Junior,1,I have never received any financial aid. My education is being paid for out of pocket.
College Freshman,1,I had to prove citizenship
College Sophomore,1,Way too middle class for financial aid
College Sophomore,1,Hazing is dumb and it's bad
College Sophomore,1,I personally got no scholarships... then again I'm a white middle class female with no disabilities with a 4.1 coming from high school.... don't have much going for me.
College Freshman,1,The landlords are terrible. no sub-leasing
College Freshman,1,I do not qualify for any aid.
College Freshman,1,"depends on where. on campus seems nicer but the large off campus freshman dorms is horrible. elevators break, food is beyond inedible. and it feels very far away from campus, especially at night"
College Freshman,1,"slumlords, with super high prices not worth the money. especially on DP"
College Freshman,1,IV is just like the rumors
College Freshman,1,"tooo crazy! and disgusting, the party scene is not fun at all just gross."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus lacks good art. Most of the buildings on campus are really short and lack the sort of awe that most people would expect college campuses to inspire. The lagoon is kinda cute when you catch it reflecting the sun at the right angle. There really isn't any glorious art piece or building on campus that would remind you that you're at an important educational institution (which UCSB actually is). The library is being renovated. It's not very aesthetically pleasing. From the 8th floor you can see the beach a little bit, which is cool. Overall architecture of the school is just bad. There are no giant shady trees to sit under: most of the trees really look like bare babies. There are a good amount of chairs in the student center."
College Freshman,1,Parking is outrageously expensive and unreasonable. Don't bring a car unless you are rich.
College Senior,1,"The parking is ok, there's no problem finding parking on campus... it's the price and the fines that suck. Along with time restriction. For example most lots you can't park until 5:00pm and the fines are getting out of control. The permits have gone up in price since I've been here."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The most important criteria was just the IGETC. I'm a Communcations major, so it was probably the easiest program to get into. We all start as Pre-Communications, due to the courses needed to become a full on Communications major. Nothing abnormal, I literally applied for it and was awared Pre-Comm immeadiately."
College Sophomore,1,"I give this a horrible grade because why party when all you do is get drunk? You don't remember anything the day after, so how could that have been fun. Plus, many girls get taken advantage of."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is way too expensive. It is on campus and extremely close to the dorms and classes but not worth the permit which only lasts a quarter. A car is not really needed, unless you are too lazy to walk to Isla Vista."
College Sophomore,1,"Students don't drive to school, but the parking in Isla Vista is terrible. If you do find a spot make sure to fold in your mirrors because they will get smashed."
College Freshman,1,"While it is possible to find an abstinent crowd of people, it is by all means not easy. Especially in the college's neighboring town, Isla Vista, where most college students live, there are huge parties with lots of drug and alcohol use every weekend. Most people partake in drug use, though on varying levels. The self-proclaimed motto for UCSB is definitely fitting:  Work hard, party hard."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare. You can only park on campus if you live in a dorm and the cost is outrageous and you have to park a long way away from where you actually live. Otherwise you have to park in Isla Vista, where the only parking is parallel street parking which is packed. Often times when I drive home from work I have to park 3 or so blocks away from my apartment. You really don't need a car, my parents were very persistent about me taking mine and though I now use it because I work downtown, it is a huge hassle."
College Sophomore,1,"There is barely any parking in the town of Isla Vista. I have had to drive around for almost one hour to find a spot, and most times, I have to walk to my house from a spot far away. On campus, the parking passes each day are 4 dollars, so it gets pricey."
Recent Alumnus,1,parking cars is ridiculous in and out of the school. ride your bike or bus.
College Sophomore,1,"Not many black people. Many ignorant white people who talk about how minorities ""have it better"" because of benefits or whatever (of course never to your face -- if you're a minority) as if there aren't downsides to being a minority in a white washed America, sorry for my political incorrectness but let's keep it real."
College Sophomore,1,"Lately there have been many cases of assault and attempted kidnappings. There are also many cases of theft, mostly minor but there was a break in at FT last year where some kids lost their laptops. Mostly you have to not be an idiot: lock your door, lock your bike correctly, don't let strangers into your building/dorm. Also, if you feel unsafe, call CSO to escort you, you're paying them with your tuition, might as well use  the service."
College Sophomore,1,"Most students live in I.V. Although very close to campus I do not want to live here. Most apartments are very expensive ($500-700/month), small and are very old. Landlords generally don't care if anything breaks so you're on your own. Fires and theft, although don't happen often, happen enough that I fear for my own place. Tropicana housing is trustworthy because you are not liable if your roommates don't pay but it is very expensive for a small place that you have to share with several others."
College Freshman,1,"If you are night person who likes to go out then you will probably enjoy it here. I am not a person who likes to go out so I don't like going out. People act really crazy and stupid. And if you are not careful, things can happen to you. At night, people get robbed, gunned down. We recently had a arson. It gets scary and crazy over here."
College Junior,1,"All of the Above – Drinking is more popular within Isla Vista, however, there is quite a drug problem. There are too many students per police officers so it is nearly impossible to know everything so many things slip under the cracks."
College Junior,1,"Unavailable Funds – I have never received any scholarships, grants or subsidized loans here. I have had to take out private loans which rack up a ton of interest and paying them back will be challenging."
College Sophomore,1,Lots of Sexual Activity – People are having sexual intercourse on campus at all times
College Sophomore,1,If You Don't Have a Permit - Don't Park! Parking on campus is so expensive! it costs a minimum of three dollars. even if i just need to run in and drop off a paper i still have to pay for parking. this is because the school thrives on taking money from students without parking passes. $45 dollar parking tickets if you're even one minute over the time limit.
College Sophomore,1,Santa Catalina – This dorm is three miles off of campus. Students have to bike these three miles or wait for the bus. The bike ride encounters three hills and is thus a trek for those who aren't professional athletes. The bus schedule is one of the most confusing things to understand - that coming from a UC student. Although the facilities are nice the lack of connection to a campus makes this form undesirable.
College Freshman,1,"IV Is Disgusting – Isla vista is disgusting, low quality and rent is excruciatingly expensive for bad housing."
College Sophomore,1,"This school has very little school spirit. While it's united, it's not through school sports or campus activities. The lack of football team is NOT replaced by the soccer team."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking your car on campus is definitely your safest bet, although incredibly expensive. Depending on where you live, how many people you live with, and whether you live in a house or a car, parking can either not be a problem at all, or it can be a huge pain. Most apartments in the town right off of campus where most students live offer 1 parking space per unit. The parking space is usually around $200 for the year. Otherwise you have to park on the street, which is extremely crowded and often times you will spend half an hour searching for a spot."
Recent Alumnus,1,"UCSB has a huge alcohol abuse program. It's students are known for drinking to the point of blacking out Thursday-Saturday night. While not all students take part in this party scene, a large amount of students do. The study drugs come out mostly during midterms and finals weeks. Quite a few students go on these drugs while at the library, but peer pressure doesn't seem high."
College Sophomore,1,Kicked Mirrors – if you park in iv. your rear view mirrors will be kicked off.  make sure youd find some place safe. all u need is a bike.
College Junior,1,"Horrible Halloween – During the famous Halloween season at UCSB, it has become known throughout that we know how to throw the best parties therefore having the most fun during this holiday in particular. However, in the last couple years, due to the amount of people visiting, the police force completely outnumbers even the amounts of visitors attending. It is ridiculous, they are everywhere, making it impossible to even park in your own driveway when the streets get closed down for the big event."
Recent Alumnus,1,I find it difficult to affiliate with various other races. Clicks among races and economic backgrounds are prevalent on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life dominates the campus, and most people are heavily into partying and drinking. Our student government is dominated by them, and they often have scandals involving underage drinking. Most non-Greeks dislike the Greeks. There are a lot of Greek houses, especially on Del Playa, the big party street. They seem to exist solely as an excuse for partying."
College Sophomore,1,"Isla Vista – I do not have enough time to discuss the way I feel about Isla Vista, the community adjacent to UCSB that is the main area for off campus housing. It is crawling with people who just care about partying and not scholastic issues. It is over crowded and over expensive for what you get. It is pathetic."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Tickets Everywhere! It is almost impossible to know when or where you can park, while parking tickets seem to be extremely generous and easy to come by. On top of that, parking is pretty expensive."
College Junior,1,Bros and Hos – the greeks at santa barbara are dismally looked upon. they roofie girls and fail out of school.
College Sophomore,1,"Not Applicable – Our school is experiencing a renovation.  Due to budget cuts, we no longer have a functional cafeteria.  We have buses (yes, that's right food buses) that carry food to order.  It is a ridiculous sight; college kids eating in the park on benches like construction workers.  It's quite droll yet a dreary sight."
College Junior,1,"Heavy Traffic Congestion Ahead – The local town, Isla Vista is one that allows people to walk from one side of town to the next as many times as they'd like to in one day. It offers free bus transportation to students, which is great but it takes a longer while. The best way to travel is by bike, it is ridiculous how much one bike can do for a student here. It can be compared to the need for survivor in The Bicycle Thief. During traffic time, however, biking is the most dangerous, with biking accidents occurring daily. Each student has at least one story involving a bike accident (either on, around, in front or next to a bike). This, however, causes a high rate for traffic on the streets and cars are forced to yield for all pedestrians and bicyclists. Inside the school, the rules are different and instead, a pedestrian must yield the right away to a bicyclist. At the same time, Isla Vista has few selections and for all other stores, a car or bus is required to travel to downtown Santa Barbara"
College Senior,1,The financial aid process was like a wild goose chase. They make you go to various places to take care of business and you feel like its a longer process than it needs to be. I do not use financial aid so i have no direct experience but i have seen my roommate struggle with getting everything cleared and waiting in long lines to talk to people.
College Freshman,1,I Hate It Here! I hate this school and i know a lot of people who feel the same way. Im trying to transfer out and so are some of my friends and even random people ive met in class .
College Freshman,1,"None for Me – Although I agree that financial aid should be awarded to those who have parents that have a low income, I believe that everyone should have a fair shot at getting some. My parents have two kids in college (both at UCSB) and neither of us receive financial aid. This is just not fair to those families who make more than others, but don't have 60,000 + dollars a year to pay for school."
College Junior,1,"Ucs Have No Money for Students – In my stay, I've never received a cent from the school towards tuition and its truly depends on the amount of need. But I feel like they should consider circumstantial situations of each student that apply for financial aid."
College Sophomore,1,"Always Keep an Extra Copy – Might have been bad luck on my part, but so far financial aid has been a painful process. Things have been lost so much that I always keep an extra copy on hand. Plus processing always takes quite a long time."
College Sophomore,1,I am not need based but I received no financial aid when I could DEFINITELY use some. Prices are rising nearly every quarter now and I can barely afford it anymore.
College Junior,1,Not much parking on campus and can be dangerous to leave your car on DP.
College Junior,1,"I think most Greek girls and boys are stuck up. Only SEEM to be friendly. Don't really care much about them, and I try to stay away from them."
College Sophomore,1,Not enough spaces and too expensive if you do park. Be ready to bike everywhere b/c parking is way too much of a hassle.
College Junior,1,"I have gotten 3 tickets, which are $45. I could not bike to campus because I had broken a bone, so I drove, and I tried to appeal it, and they said I should have let them know. The thing is, it had happened the night before, how could I have let them know?? Nowhere on the website is there a section for contacting University Parking to tell them why we could not bike. There are a lot of parking structures, and they are always empty. What a waste."

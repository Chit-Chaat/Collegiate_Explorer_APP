Alum,5,"I cannot say enough good things about this college and their nursing programs.  I completed my associates and bachelors here and recommend it to everyone.  It is great if you want to earn your degree quickly, are not interested in the party scene, and love hands on/on site learning. Since it is small, all professors know you by name and getting help is so easy. I truly feel like this college prepared me more than most of my colleagues who attended other programs for my nursing career."
Freshman,5,I'm just about done with my first semester and so far I love the school. Class size is small. The professors are wonderful. I had no problems or issues what so ever.
College Junior,5,"GSC is a small, close knit atmosphere, different from most schools. GSC also has the top NCLEX pass rate in the tristate area. The teachers are approachable and easily accessible. "
College Junior,5,The student body at GSC is constantly changing. It is a very welcoming atmosphere.
College Junior,5,"I love the close knit feeling of GSC. All the students and faculty get to know one another very well and it becomes a home away from home. I would pick Good Sam 1,000 times over!"
College Junior,5,Nursing is the main focus at Good Samaritan College. I enjoy being able to relate with all the students and teachers regarding my major.
College Junior,5,The small size of my school is excellent and provides for 1 on 1 attention from professors. I am completely satisfied with my experience here so far.
Sophomore,4,"I like the faculty and the small learning environment. I like that this is a Private, Hospital based Nursing School that is located on the Hospital Campus."
College Junior,4,I think GSC is a great school and I am willing to pay the current tuition because my education is valuable to me.
College Junior,4,"Nursing classes in general are great at Good Sam, however, some of the prerequisite classes are less than enjoyable.I was lucky enough to have 2 awesome teachers for Chemistry and Microbiology so I have no complaints!  "
College Junior,4,"Career Service/Inservice – As far as I know so far, They have people that set up booths and talk to students about career options and thats including PCA work while in nursing school."
College Junior,4,"A Student's Tuition – Good Sam's financial aid one stop center is amazing. The staff helps find the most money you can receive to help pay for your tuition and books. These include loans, grant money, and scholarships to apply for. The only downfall to Good Sam is the expensive credit hour price of $580. The education received is definitively worth this price but for the average student, it can be difficult to make ends meet."
College Junior,4,"There is only one time the classes are offered, not convenient for commuting students, and there is a lot of down time. 
The classes are very expensive. The majority of the teachers are very good, others are not open to trying new ways of teaching"
College Junior,4,Bad Schedule but the Same at Other Nursing Schools – The scheduling for classes is not very convenient. Most likely will have same issues at other Nursing schools however there is a gap between morning and afternoon where there are no classes scheduled to allow for classmate bonding but it just makes you wait around the school all day.
College Junior,2,Technology is not Good Sam's strong point. The wifi connection is poor and the computers move very slow. The printer only works half of the time and causes for unneeded stress.
College Junior,2,I was given two grants in two different semesters where they took it away when I was at least 6 weeks into the semester.

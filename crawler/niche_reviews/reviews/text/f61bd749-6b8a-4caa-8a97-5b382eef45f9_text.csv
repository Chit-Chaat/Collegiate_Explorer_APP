Freshman,5,"Just like my peer stated in the other review, this school is rich in culture but has a weird high school like atmosphere that is nothing short of a distraction to academic goals. Can you ignore the party atmosphere? the women dressed in barely anything at all and having regular twerk contests all over campus after 6pm? the night club like atmosphere by the phase 1 dorms after 6? I have seen good people come to this school and become something akin to a member of the bad girls club. the only thing that this school wants you to do is become greek. there is no leadership here that stays or stays passionate about the change. students are aggressive and major distractions in the classroom. your fellow students will not pay attention and then ask you for the answers or just curse the teacher out in class for assigning things. the student leadership is mostly just there to pad out a resume and get photographed doing anything positive to anyone but themselves."
Freshman,5,My experience at Bethune was like no other this was my first time going to a university and I am the first in my family to go to an actual university and everything went well. Right now I’m doing good in school I have a good GPA and good grades and I will like to continue my college experience here. I bought a lot of college gear to represent my school and I am glad that I am attending an HBCU because this is something my parents dreamed about doing when they were younger and I just think i am extremely blessed. I love everything here the food is amazing everything is local so if I ever run out of food I could walk and re stock on a lot of things I need to survive while I’m here and my job is really close. The professors are really nice and genuine and that make me happy because that makes me want to tell my friends about my college experience and try to convince them to come and join me
Alum,5,I love how the professors will help you but that is only if you want the help. The professors can not help you if you do not want help. My overall experience at Bethune-Cookman University was amazing.
Alum,5,"I had multiple online classes, it was always a great experience. This University uses blackboard. The professors were easy to get into contact with and most of them had open door policies for their offices."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Bethune-Cookman University from 2012 to 2017 with a bachelors degree in nursing. They live by their slogan enter to learn, depart to serve. The instructors are passionate about what they do and emphasize excellence. I met so many great people at this school and in the surrounding community. Daytona beach, in which BCU is located is beautiful. There are multiple sunny beaches, and it has a small beach town feel. The campus is a 20 min walk from the beach, convenient for studying or relaxing."
Sophomore,5,My online learning experience was great. It felt like I was still in a face to face setting. The only difference was everyone was in there pajamas. I loved it. We were still provided you tutoring virtually from our teachers as well as from tutors. The online experience was wonderful and if it continued to be like that I wouldn’t be upset.
Sophomore,5,Bethune Cookman University has made me a Better person. I struggled with not having a family or family support to get me through college I had to do it all on my own. When I came to BCU I came with nothing but faith and hope to get into college. Now I won’t say it was easy but it was worth because I had to go through the hardships to get to my destiny. I ended up have the max aid and two grants granted to me. This school gave me a great push because with everything I as going through I was to a point where I wanted to commit suicide.  I Had been through so much because my mom had passed and everybody that I liked to for help turned there backs on me and I had nobody. Going to college saved my life and I thank god everyday for how far he’s brought me. I have friends now I feel like I have a family now. I wouldn’t trade my HBCU for nothing because they always continue to push me when I’m down.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Bethune cookman University have changed me into an better person of understanding what is my purpose in the world and how my dreams and talents being shown within its self. Though at times I would be home sick at times, but would remember my purpose of why I picked cookman in the first place."
Freshman,5,"I would like to say that Bethune Cookman University provides its inhabitants with an experience unlike any other. Being started by an African American woman it holds a legacy that remains unmatched. Strong, resilient and proud Wildcats continue to roar! I will say that; although the surrounding areas are deemed undesirable the community finds B-CU to be the glue that brings everyone together. I will be coming in as a freshman during the fall of 2020 session and I've made friends that not only can relate on a cultural level but also share the same pride and passion for achieving their goals. Thank you!"
Freshman,5,This University is a great private HBCU that brings minorities together in Daytona Beach FL. This schools education is great and is much needed

Freshman,5,I like that it is a hbcu that is close to my family. i feel as though there should  be a change with the contact betwenn the offices and students.

Freshman,5,My overall experience with Bethune Cookman University was very good. They are very willing to help you succeeded in your career and are  very helpful when it comes to the resources they give out to the students.

Freshman,5,my time at bethune cookman is amazing as my first year.If you choose to come to bethune cookman then you have made a good choices
Sophomore,5,Bethune-cookman University is a very diverse school with so much culture and background from people in different states and countries. The professors and advisors are helpful and are very driven to motivate us students in different parts of our lives. One thing to change about Bethune-cookman is that it is not activate on campus and the menu is very dull and doesn’t change throughout the weeks.
Junior,5,"Bethune-Cookman University is not only an HBCU, but it is family, it is love and it is a place where you can enrich your knowledge."
Freshman,5,"The one thing i like about Bethune is that everyone is there for a reason, and that's to pursue a dream. The school has a great academic and athletic program."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience at Bethune is going good so far . I am a first generation college student in my family . I liked that they gave us freshman's a welcome week , because they wanted us to feel welcomed now that we'll be away from our families . My classes are great I thought they'll be to big and I would struggle learning but they aren't . They are just the right size and my professors are hands on with every student and gives every one a chance and wants us all to achieve . Its either we pass or fail and failing is not something I would want to be apart of or my peers ."
Freshman,5,Everything about the university is unique in its own and the background history of the HBCU is exceptional so its worth looking into.
Sophomore,5,My experience with Bethune-Cookman has been great. The HBCU experience is a great experience and something I would love for all young African Americans to experience. I like the hospitality and the people are like family they make it like home. What I feel needs to be changed is the money problems. Many schools such as Bethune Cookman University are in debt and expect students to come up with thousands of dollars up front JUST so that they can attend the first day. They create balances with students accounts and constantly steal money and wonder why many students are not being successful.
Alum,5,I got involved in clubs and activists on campus. Meeting new people was easy on this family oriented campus!
Freshman,5,I love the fact that even though Bethune Cookman is a HBCU(Historically Black College/University) it has a lot of different races. Bethune also isnt a boring Monday - Friday university. The staff takes time to connect with the students and what they do after school. Ms Bethune was a family friend long ago and ever since my aunts told me about her 7 years ago and I did my research at the age of 10 I already had my mind set on B-CU. Ive been a few times and theres nothing I would change.
Sophomore,5,"My First experience at Bethune Cookman was AMAZING! When I first got there I was kind of shy but the Orientation Leaders , Professors , Resident Assistants (RA's) helped me to stand out. There is a lot of school spirit at Cookman , which I love to see and be apart of. There is a lot of history in that school. #HailWildCats"
Freshman,5,"II rreally enjoyed visiting the university.  I was very impressed.  The Nursing Department's presentation was very informative.  As we toured the campus, the Director of Admissions provided information obtaining Scholarships.  My parents were very grateful to know that there were options available to acquire additiddfdfdffonal monies.  We were there throughout the day.  We also were grateful for a delicious meal provided by Bethune-Cookman.  I am looking forward to the"
Sophomore,5,"At first, I was afraid of attending a college out of state because I was going to be away from my family and I didn't know if I was going to fit in. When I got to Bethune Cookman University, automatically, I felt like I was at home. The campus is very inviting and the faculty makes you feel right at home from the teachers to the café workers."
Freshman,5,I love the diversity as well as the student life. Professors are very amazing and I wouldn’t have chose any other school.
Junior,5,"There’s always someone there to help you. We all want to see each other succeed and grow. I like how there’s always someone to talk to such as a counselor, teacher, or advisor. You will never feel out of place."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Bethune Cookman University was a bit kind of challenging due to being on my own for the first time. Having to depend on myself to do everything.
Sophomore,5,"I Love my HBCU! This school is phenomenal! Not only the professors, but faculty and staff are there for you to help you through. Especially with me being miles away from home I feel like this is my second home. The surrounding areas are pretty rough but the campus is as if I’m in my own learning world. I like that I can relate and see my dreams are possible which is why I push myself to excel. Despite my shortcomings of being a miracle baby weighing only 1 pound 10 oz and being told I will never do this and that and will not live past 3. I’m here and doing what they said wasn’t possible and for that reason I’m great full to be a student a Bethune Cookman University."
Sophomore,5,I started off in the summer bridge coming up there without knowing anybody but I knew my friends was going to return in the fall. I met new people and I love it because it’s very family Oriented. It’s a great school it taught me new things but one thing that stood out to me was networking.
Freshman,5,"College is the first milestone in life and it's about getting out on your own for the first time, exploring new things, and meeting new people. Things that I loved most about my college is I met people I thought I would never encounter with. You can easily find your passion and purpose on the campus. Also, you are surrounded by like minded people."
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the information that have been provided by Bethune-Cookman University. They were really nice when assisting me through applying.
Niche User,5,It’s a really great school and it’s a really nice experience for those wanting to be a part of a diverse culture.
Freshman,5,My experience here at Bethune-Cookman was great so far as a freshman. The professors here really care about your education and will do whatever it takes to make sure you understand the curriculum and  they'll spend one on one time with you before and after class. I like how the have several resources and outside tutors to help you pass and understand the curriculum outside of class. Something I would like to see change would definitely have to be the dorms. I would like to see some of the older building tore down or redone because at this point they're not even in the condition for people to live in.
Niche User,5,"bethune is a very clean school, great students attend and the environment is great! my friends attend Bethune Cookman University, and they want to me to attend the school, which i am because i got accepted on site. i also gave the university a tour which i loved the dorms are big enough. food is great the school itself is great. fun fact is Bethune–Cookman University, formerly Bethune–Cookman College, is a private, co-ed, historically black university"
Freshman,5,"My experience with Bethune-Cookman University as a Freshman was
awesome.  The staff is very knowledgeable, helpful and professional.  The campus is clean and safe.
     
     I plan to join the band and pledge to a sorority, finish in 2022 with a degree
in  Computer Engineering."
Junior,5,"I love the Great Bethune-Cookman University. This school has truly been a blessing because I didn't know how to navigate anything or make the right schedule for graduation. Cookman has small class sizes, Professor and faculty that care, the best growth and internship opportunities, and much more. I could go on and on about my University but I would like to point out that we need a knew board of trustees. The ones we have now are not so trustworthy and stole a lot of money with the previous president. That will all over soon and this will be the best University !"
Senior,5,"There different clubs and activities to participate in. When attending, please be aware of what you want to do once you’re done with college."
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about Bethune-Cookman University, the one thing I would love to see changed about Bethune is the food selection the food now is not the best but can be much better. Overall the school is very much one of the top HBCU schools around."
Junior,5,"As a current undergraduate student at The Great Bethune-Cookman University my experience has been wonderful.  I have made relationships that will last a lifetime already.  I have connected with people at college that I never would have thought I would have anything in common with.  At Bethune-Cookman University it is truly a family environment.  The professors are willing to help students understand the material that is being taught to them.  Professors don't just want their students to come to class, receive a lecture and leave confused.  Since class sizes are relatively small our professors are able to answer questions in class and clear up any confusion their may be during a lecture."
Sophomore,5,Bethune gave me endless opportunities within only my freshman year. and I.T  is a very family oriented school.
Sophomore,5,So far it has been a great experience to attend the great Bethune-Cookman University. I am now a sophomore there and I am thrilled to see what my year will turn out to be because my freshman year was a great one. I maintained a 3.2 GPA and I only intend to get better.
Sophomore,5,"The overall atmosphere of this school is amazing, everyone is so friendly as ready to help. although the financial aid office is a little slow with getting things done, they always made sure that I was situated and taken care of."
Sophomore,5,"I love my HBCU, because the teachers here actually care. My founder turned a city. dump into a beautiful institution."
Sophomore,5,I love how Bethune Cookman is a big happy family. They teach you a lot about yourself and how you can improve in anything you put your mind to.
Niche User,5,I visited the campus for an avid field trip with my high school and i had a great experience. I got to see the history behind the school and what truly makes Bethune-Cookman such a great university. With its great staff and kind students that showed us around and made is feel very welcomed compared to other schools who view high-schoolers as children compared to those at the students at the university.
Junior,5,I love the school kind people very helpful staff dorms are clean and atmosphere is awesome. Easy to learn very great experience from the day i started..Teachers explain and break down the education of learning. I have learned a lot in being in college on my own being studying very hard to succeed in my major.
Sophomore,5,Cookman is an amazing school. Every one who goes there love it. There is a a lot of stuff to do and a lot of people are friendly.
Sophomore,5,Greatest school of all time!!!! Culture religion everything a student could ask for  thank you to the great Bethune-Cookman
Freshman,5,"I love that I can be myself. At Bethune-Cookman I don't feel like a minority. Everyone is very positive and cool. There hasn't been once that I've had an issue or altercation with another student. I love the environment, and the weather."
Junior,5,Bethune-Cookman University has grown me tremendously in almost every way has presented many opportunities to me since my enrollment at the University. BCU has given me a job on campus since my Sophomore year and has taught me how to manage time with being a full time student and still have a job responsibility. My professors always challenged me to do my best and exelle continuously. I've also made various visits to other Universities courtesy of the school about the next step for graduate school after I graduate from Bethune-Cookman University. Its truly a university I've gotten so attached to.
Freshman,5,"I'm currently going to be a freshman at Bethune Cookman University in the fall but I have been active and been visiting Bethune Cookman college since I was nine Years. Although I am not a student there yet, I know that my experience there will be great simply from past experience when I was visiting."
Freshman,5,"I love this school.  It is small enough to know people, but big enough to have all the opportunities you need."
Freshman,5,"I just don’t like my university but adore every nick and cranny of my HBCU. Other than being an HBCU my experience at Bethune Cookman University was personal knowing my dad attended the university. The greatest asset BCU provides is the connection between everyone. We are definitely a family! From our café having an expanded menu, our love for musicality, school spirit, great hospitality from our RA’s, exceptional professors, accessible clubs and organizations, and the importance of serving others has not only made my experience remarkable but confirmed my decision on being a part of wildcat nation."
Freshman,5,the school has a very good community. there were a lot of different ways to get plugged into the school. They had Mary Mcleod grave site and where she used to live which was very interesting to me.
Niche User,5,I like the overall campus and the academics that Bethune -Cookman provide. when i went for a tour it was wonderful and everybody so nice. the rooms were nice and they have real good classes.
Alum,4,"I did take one class online. It was great. I recommend having a planner to write down your assignment dates. Have a planner not only for online courses but all of your courses as well.  Some people think online courses will be easy but it is easy to forget about when your assignments are due. Usually, online courses due dates will be at 11:55 pm and whatever day it is due. I advise you to get a planner and write down all of your assignment due dates for every class. Some people like online courses and some don't. If you apply yourself to the course you will do great."
Freshman,4,Easy to operate and they keep you updated on what needs to get done for daily assignments you might have.
Freshman,4,"Bethune is probably one of the most well rounded school I've ever been to, they never seem to lack on the food they have, its always good and hits the spot when you have a desire for food. Honestly I would tell all my friends about this school and recommend them that they should go."
Niche User,4,"My experience attending BCU was extremely enlightening and taught me so much about myself. The campus is developing every day to keep up with the demands of the growing population and their needs associated with that. The campus gives you a feeling of what an extended family would feel like in your ""home away from home"", despite being quite small comparably. My only issue is the choice of majors is not as extensive as other schools. If your intended major is not one of the ones they offer, consider a different school or switching majors."
Junior,4,I love the music department. I feel like everything I learn in there I can  take to the mountaintop of a successful career. The campus is amazing. The atmosphere of the school Is so loving and family oriented. I do wish they would focus a  bit more on fixing up the dorms as well as having healthier food in the cafe. I also would appreciate it if the administrators of the school could communicate with the students  with more respect.

Junior,4,It is founded by a very remarkable African-American woman who paved the way for women like myself to be in a position to get an education at the higher level. I am convinced that her spirit still thrives today.

Sophomore,4,My experience at Bethune Cookman University was wonderful. I had fun and my made sure my work was turned in on time . I would like for Bethune Cookman University to change the way they go about there balances .
Sophomore,4,"Though it does come with its challenges (as does any university), overall it is a good school. The major reason that it is great is because of the people there. Students are talented (we are nationally known for our amazing band), creative, intelligent, and decent. Teachers are dedicated, knowledgable, and care about their students. Though, there are odd complaints about communication between the school and students, money issues, and so forth. All in all, it is a good university with a lot of spirit."
Junior,4,I really love B-CU. Some professors really want the best for their students and want them to be prepared for their career path. Despite everything going on with this university we are still prevailing and we're a big family. I recommend this school to any and everybody!
Alum,4,"I am currently a high school senior and BCU is top of my list! This school is apart of my family history and I plan to continue with family tradition and plan to attend in Fall of 2020. I attended the homecoming in October 2019, and love the atmosphere and history that goes along with this school."
Alum,4,The atmosphere of the school and the community is what pushes you to continue your education and graduate.
Sophomore,4,Bethune-Cookman University is a very astounding school. I am currently a sophomore at the school and I've learned so much being there during my freshman year alone. I've had a lot of great experiences and the academic system is stellar!
Freshman,4,"Bethune cook-man is an extremely incredible school. They ensure your scholastics is dependably put first regardless of what . Likewise the athletic division is wonderful we have some incredible games that will drive you to a success! In general everything is extraordinary other than educational cost which is absurdly high, which is for what reason I'm applying for this grant."
Alum,4,"It's a great school. However, a lot of improvements can be made, especially the nursing program. As a alumni I hope it gets better"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Bethune Cookman was great, it’s very religious. However, the financial issues that affects the students should change."

Sophomore,4,Bethune Cookman University is known for their amazing band but to me the environment is more amazing. Most of the students and staff are welcoming. What I would change about the university is the food and money problems.
Freshman,4,I loved the campus and all of the opportunities they provided for their students. They make to where you won't have to struggle and there will be help if you need it.
Freshman,4,"The College Experience There is a certain lack of approval or confidence in a person who doesn’t have a college education or hold a particular degree to their names in the day and age. It is this lack of enthusiasm that people especially young adults in our society are urged to get a college education. If you look around you, you will see the evidence of this trend. The highest paying jobs goes to the ones with the highest level of education. People who have doctorate degrees."
Senior,4,"My experience here at an HBCU has been beyond amazing. The academics are excellent , and there is a lot of diversity."
Junior,4,I enjoy the people that I have met they come from a variety of backgrounds and cultures.  They are willing to learn from others and not take life so seriously and just enjoy their surroundings.  I feel that we will get a exceptional learning experience while attending BCU.
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see better food in the cafeteria, also a better staff to communicate about fasfa and other school opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"I would like to say that Bethune Cookman University provides its inhabitants with an experience unlike any other. Being started by an African American woman it holds a legacy that remains unmatched. Strong, resilient and proud Wildcats continue to roar!

Alum,4,"Bethune-Cookman University had become my home away from home, and I wouldn't trade my four years of experience. Of course there where pros and cons but it was mostly pros for me. I was very active on campus, and I met life long friends. My professors were amazing and they taught me so much. I was over 1000 miles away from home yet I still had family to turn to when I needed them. This school is a family, and you will only get what you put in."
Sophomore,4,What I loke most about bethune cookman was the friendships I made meeting people from alm different places and being able to put myself out there and make friend
Sophomore,4,It's a pretty small campus but that gives you a chance to feel more connected with professors and peers.

For the past two years housing has been phenomenal, I had nothing but sweet roommates and no problems RA's.The professors are unexplained. They want to succeed and be great and they are willing to help you accomplish your goal as a long as you want it as bad as they want it for you. If your looking for an HBCU that welcomes you open arms and take care of you Bethune Cookman University is the school."

It is a pretty small yet, beautiful campus filled with history and talented students. It's a comfortable home away from home. Students continue to strive to help each other succeed in life and elevate the  University."
Freshman,4,"Here at Bethune-Cookman University,  I like the school a lot so far. My class schedule is pretty good, no complaints. The food here is really good to me, the staff And faulty are really nice and helpful. However, it's not always a party scene here. Some days are more duller then others. The admissions and financial aid office is very disorganized and slow. So far overall out of 10, I give Bethune Cookman University an 8!"
Sophomore,4,"Moving from Miami to Daytona Beach was a big transition for me, however, it was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.

Freshman,4,I'm enrolled as a freshman at Bethune I haven't yet to experience the college life there but orientation was a great  experience. I will be starting at cookman on Aug 6 .
Freshman,4,What i like about Bethune Cookman University is the diversity that it has. Anywhere you go there is always someone that is different from you and the good part about that is everyone is treated equally.
Freshman,4,Bethune is a terrific school if you ever feel like you won't make it Bethune is there to pick you up and help your prepare to be the best person you can achieve .
Sophomore,4,"Bethune Cookman gives me a comfortable, eventful experience. Everyone is polite and well mannered, and I adore the spirits present. The music program at the school is an excellent one and we have excellent professors present."
Sophomore,4,"I like that the faculty and staff really do truly care about the students when it comes to the classwork. The professors try to make sure they make the class comfortable for all students and can reach everyone at the level they are academically. I want the options in the dining facility to change up, we are served almost the same things every other week, and they need more healthier options for students as well."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Bethune-Cookman has been amazing and unforgettable.I enjoy the friendly environment, the teachers and the relationships that I have developed and even joining a sorority Sigma Gamma Rho sorority incorporated. If I could change anything it would only be lowering the tuition for the simple fact my first semester I lost my first friend to a balance she had."
Alum,4,"Made lifetime friendships. The professors are great in the Criminal Justice field. They provide resources that you need , but it is up to an individual to use those resources provided."
Junior,4,The school has a great friendly atmosphere. Most of the professor  s created a bond with their students.
Niche User,4,I love the students and the campus. The surroundings of the campus makes it much more enjoyable to go to.
Freshman,4,Great school overall. All of the campus is pretty easy to get to and the dorms are beautiful. Tuition could definitely change.
Freshman,4,l experience at Bethune Cookman University has been marvelous. I've grown as a young man and have been on the verge of discovering who I was made to be. I'm still getting fully accustomed to the college atmosphere so I haven't been at my best but Cookman has definitely done it's best to help me.
Sophomore,2,"Honestly, Bethune is an OK school but they charge way too much in tuition when it's not even worth as much. The dorms are subpar and the above average dorms fill up soo fast that upperclassmen have to still be placed in freshman dorms. None of the dorms (besides the scholarship house which is reserved for a select few students) have living rooms or kitchens. Most of the workers half do  their jobs and some of the dorms look old and dilapidated, giving the school a run down look. Student accounts/ financial aid is very unorganized because its only 3 people working. The only really good thing about the school is that the classes are easy to pass and it helps raise your GPA."
Senior,2,"I cannot express enough how much I regret attending this university! Faculty and staff are almost ALWAYS unorganized. This university is private so transferring will turn into a complete start over with barely any credits to follow you, so in reality it’s a trap on top of being super expensive. 85% of the buildings including dorm halls are in poor condition if not also containing mold growth on walls. The goal of this university is to enroll as many students in hopes of taking care of massive it’s debt in addition to probably having it’s credentials revoke.... let’s just say I will highly suggest someone NOT to attend this university"
Senior,2,I had a subpar experience at this university which is why I am here now scrambling for scholarship money with just two semesters remaining until possible graduation.
Freshman,2,Bethune cookman is very diorganized and is very ran down. The quality of the education is poor and should not cost as much as it does.
Niche User,2,It wasn't the best school but it wasn't the worst.  It could be a lot of changes made to the school. tuition was to high to offered so little
Freshman,2,"I felt uncomfortable at first it was hard transitioning and adjusting to a four-student dorm room, very little access to transportation, and not many food options nearby. On the other hand, professors were very knowledgeable  and helpful."
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus, your going to need a lot of prayer . Make sure you lock your stuff up if you do not know your roomate . Deepending on your doorm you shouldnt have bathroom issuse but just know everyone is not clean. Socia atmospher people will look you down just to know who you are. just try to come off nice"
College Senior,2,Smoking is one of the major things at my school. Almost everyone smokes or smoked before.
College Senior,2,They are known for not doin much on campus.
College Freshman,2,The area around the school is not safe and there needs to be more on campus security measures to prevent certain incidents from happening.
College Freshman,2,Eh eh not bad at all...................................
College Sophomore,2,"I say if you are a party person be careful where you go and always be alert, Never accept a drink from anyone."
College Sophomore,2,"My experience with the Financial aid at my school is an ongoing hassle where you don't get the money you need and even if you do get aid, its money you still have to pay out. I would say to have your financial aid done properly and effectively would be to start the process early and turn in all paperwork early. The office can become really cluttered and the loss of papers are common."
College Freshman,2,"Its pretty much just fast food restaurants, and the healthy choices require quite a bit of distance to get to."
College Freshman,2,Of campus dining is horrible we only have four in walking distance and only two is open late night and aren't anywhere near healthy
College Freshman,2,"The food in the cafe makes me depressed, i almost want to cry every time i have to walk in there! Ugh"
College Junior,2,"Our of campus housing is only if there is no room on campus, our school isn't like a lot of other campuses that offer a lot of different complexes and the convenience of helping you find a roommate or a place to stay just while at school. Other off campus housing are just regular complexes that you would have to research on your own."
College Junior,2,There is only one dorm which are allowed to have the opposite sex in there room which is unfair and makes it seem like they get priority over  a lot of things. The school is all about money so when it comes to parking they will be quick to put a ticket on your car even if you were only gone for a couple of minutes. They are always talking about violations but when it is noisy after midnight they do nothing about it so people think its okay.
College Junior,2,They are never really willing to help you all they always say is that they don't have money and don't even bother looking to try and help you with your situation. It's a headache and is overwhelming every semester.
College Junior,2,"The dining hall is too small for all the people there are on campus, there are barely any options to choose from ans half of it is not even good. Many things are under cooked and then some over cooked. You have to pay to get in the cafe even if you don't end up eating anything at all."
College Freshman,2,The off-campus dining options are fairly poor because there is not enough options for students that have to walk.
College Senior,2,We dont have enough options
College Freshman,2,"It is very boring here in daytona beach. If the school doesn't throw an event or one of the students, we dont do anything."
College Freshman,2,"This school is considered a private university and it is very expensive. I do not believe I received enough financial aid considering the fact that my parents income is low and they are not able to work right now. Only tip I have is to make sure you prepare yourself financially within the last two years of high school, if not earlier."
College Freshman,2,The atmosphere is very rural and boring.
College Freshman,2,Financial Aid is very unorganized.
College Freshman,2,Lack of cleanliness and very noisy during studying.
College Freshman,2,The prices of off campus dining are unaffordable.
College Freshman,2,"Financial Aid equals death. It is one of the main struggles many of us go through at Bethune. The lines are usually long but it isn't bad compared to what you learn once you're ahead of the line. They take a lot of your money and do not provide comprehensive reports. I for instance don't know where my money is coming or going and they consistently say I have a balance of $7000 is due. You should definitely apply for as many scholarships as possible and apply for a job starting sophomore year. Never make a deal with private student loans because that is the worst way to go. You'll fall into a deep hole that will be hard to get out of. So just stick with endlessly applying for scholarships and grants. Definitely grants. Always check for any work-study opportunities. I would advise you to start paying off your student debt and tuition now so that you won't have such a great unexpected deal of debt when you get out of college. Also, try not to rely on family for financial assistance because anything can happen and you have to start being financially independent. If you have a talent such as doing nails or hair or you feel as though you'd be a helpful tutor or mentor, start a side hustle to add extra income. Start a yoga class or diet plan for students. Babysit or housesit. Do whatever you can. Never have idle time. Balance your budget. Pay off that inevitable debt!!"
College Sophomore,2,there are barely any options for food after 9 and thats sad
College Freshman,2,small dirty rooms. rather live off campus. Roach - free
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of scholarships or financial assistance is available.
College Freshman,2,Having unpredictable weather makes it difficult to have rush week and different activities
College Freshman,2,"The rain in Daytona Florida is quite extreme and unpredictable. I have been caught in the rain various time while traveling on campus. I have found a raincoat, rain boots and an umbrella is essential for campus living."
College Sophomore,2,"The transportation provided on campus is mostly on the weekends early in the morning when the students are in bed asleep, and I think they should have shuttles during the weekday available during the day this would be an advantage dor the students that dont have vehicles to get around"
College Sophomore,2,Local atmosphere is bad there is nothing to do off campus
College Sophomore,2,There aren't enough late night options near the campus convenient for the students without vehicles
College Junior,2,"There isn't any off campus housing available for full time students, only part time students."
College Junior,2,I hope for change in all the categories listed above.
College Junior,2,"Here at Bethune Cookman University we do not have any Greek housing. Greek life is considered very hard to get into. On  a social level the Greeks are weak and only advertise events when scouting for new members, which is very seldom. Non Greeks see them as important but not active on campus or the community."
College Freshman,2,"Make sure you always are up to date on your financial aid. If you have any questions about aid talk to your financial aid counselor ASAP! The longer you wait, the less likely they will help you."
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't enough dorms on campus. The dorms are very dirty and small. Some dorms put three people in one room, the air breaks, the rooms are full of mold and roaches, and no coed visitation beside one dorm which is the ONLY coed dorm on campus. Every dorm is different but everyone pays the same for housing which is interesting; some of the dorms have A/C's in each room while some dorms you cant control your air. Some have bathrooms, some have communal bathrooms. Some have Three to a room, some don't. Interesting that everyone has to pay the same price for housing though besides the people in the coed dorm. The social life inside the halls are ok, nobody really gathers in the lobbies that much. If they're in the dorm, they're in the room!"
College Sophomore,2,"The school stresses drugs and alcohol. However, students are able to get them very easy. Being that the stores card you, weed is more around than alcohol unless you have and upperclassmen connection."
College Sophomore,2,"Parties associated with the students are usually at the clubs beachside but usually one club. Not too many parties to choose from on the weekends. Also those parties are wack, they hold the lines forever and only females in free but somehow its always more dudes than girls. Inside the parties are not worth the money, nobody dances, everybody just vibes to the music. There are a lot of other clubs in Daytona but those are not usually associated with Cookman. They're regular clubs and attract the older living crown in the city; a lot of couples, 21+ non-college students(graduates). At BCU the house parties are better, they're free, with free liquor, and no line. Also people tend to party better there. The downside though is that the houses are real small and they get very hot which causes people to stand outside the house instead of inside. The parties don't last either that much, most of the times the parties are either shut down or a fight breaks out which sometimes result in gunshots being fired. Basically this is not a college town and to have fun its very difficult. If you want to really have fun, get a group of friends, get a place, buy liquor and turn up in your own privacy. If your a heavy turn up type of person DO NOT COME TO THIS SCHOOL."
College Sophomore,2,The labs are small and the fact that only half of the computers in there work it limits the space for students to get a good working computer.
College Sophomore,2,If you're not from florida the only aid you can count on is Federal grants and loans. The lucky residents of florida gets states grants.
College Freshman,2,If you dont have a car then you are basically stranded unless you are willing to walk 30 or 40 minutes to the beachside. The school shuttle only runs once a week and that is very inconvenient. Pierre's Shuttle is the most convenient option; he is affordable and easily accessible.
College Junior,2,"Our financial Aid dpt is a MESS! sometimes money is given away that the school doesnt even have, the process is a giant run around, it is very difficult. "
College Junior,2,The school is very small so of the parking that is there over half are reserved for professors and people who work foor the school.
College Junior,2,they have had mold problems and ive seen as much as an entire floor collapse in my time being here
College Sophomore,2,There are no campus shuttles and only one shuttle that runs on the weekend to Walmart. But the campus is small enough that walking from one end to another should take no more than 15-20 minutes.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't have a scholarship, trying to get one"
College Junior,2,I feel sometimes like I'm in jail
College Freshman,2,At B-CU they have a zero tolerance policy for so many things.
College Sophomore,2,Parking on campus is hard. Spots are taken quickly and early. The security is also a hassel. They give fines and tickets daily without warning.
College Sophomore,2,"When the weather begins to get cooler, people including myself, become sick due to allergies. Overall, the weather is nice throughout the school year."
College Freshman,2,"The computers labs at Bethune Cookman are usually crowded at times ,especially midterms,final exams.Although the computers lab at my school is crowded we have free printing in the library and the WiFi is so kinda of good .But There's other places where you can use the computer especially in the success center."
College Freshman,2,Its hard to receive scholarships unless you are a Sophomore or higher or in the band
College Sophomore,2,My financial aid was a long process it took me all day to get everything done.
College Senior,2,Too open to the general population. No blue light system and campus security is ok at best. There are lots of cameras in the dorms .
Freshman,1,"Im a first semester freshman here at bethune and so far iv’e witnessed fights, heard gun shots outside of my building amd the people are just not my type of crowd"
Freshman,1,"if you are from the northern area DO NOT GO TO BETHUNE! you will not see where your money is going. run down buildings, terrible food, overall bad school in general. the party scene is wack all of the parties are in Orlando so if you don't have a car your out of luck. rethink your options before going to this school. my opinion and majority of others this school is trash."
Niche User,1,I am a parent and my daughter is a second semester freshman. I am pulling her out to go to another college next year. My daughter lives in a dilapidated dorm. Her showers are full of mold. The cleaning crew never cleans the bathroom I call and complain the school cleans it up and it goes back to the way it was. The food in the cafe is awful so my kid doesn't go to the cafe half the time. I find the information that my daughter is being given from the administration is full of half truths. Now the biggest complaint is the billing it is always wrong I have to email or call. It took them a month to remove double charges on my bill. The school is very disorganized.
College Freshman,1,You barely see campus security walking around campus.
College Freshman,1,I didn't receive any scholarships for my first semester. It really could have helped em.
College Sophomore,1,"Most of the time the food is not cooked properly. They don't clean the dishes, silverware, and cups thoroughly. The food has no taste."
College Sophomore,1,"Living on campus is very annoying. The food is horrible, the dorms are old and some have mold, they don't keep them clean, and your roommate could be anyone. The school has no roommate questionnaire like most schools. The rooms are very small as well."
College Sophomore,1,daytona is a boring college town. they should be disappointed.
College Sophomore,1,they are never available when i need them. they never answer the phones
College Sophomore,1,we have the worst parties only frat parties are fun
College Sophomore,1,"its messy, no privacy, and there is nothing to eat"
College Junior,1,I wish I had a full ride.
College Sophomore,1,"Bethune Cookman offers a great selection of academic programs depending on

uyour individual area of study."
College Junior,1,"The cost of off campus dining is what the average middle class family would pay at any fast food restaurant. The convenience is really poor. There is not any restaurant in the area, which offers student discounts and we don't have a variety to choose from. It's nothing healthy. Just all fats and oily foods."
College Freshman,1,They only care about their self.
College Sophomore,1,It seems so hard to get a scholarship and i dont recieve Financial Aid as well.
College Freshman,1,Hard to get around town.
College Sophomore,1,Dorms on campus are horrible. The living environment is not clean and kept up with. The sanitation is bad and the smell is continously foul.
College Senior,1,"Parking decals are suppose to guarantee you on campus, however parking fills up quickly. Students, parking decal or not, are forced to park on the side of the street where it is hazardous because of the visibility of on-coming traffic."
College Freshman,1,"I Stay in the oldest building it is mildew in the girls room ,females dont really know how to clean up after their self. Even though we have  mades we all are adults here.:It's expensive i never thought living on this dorm would change my mind about going to live off campus ."
College Sophomore,1,"If alcohol was consumed, it would most likely be inside the dorms."
College Junior,1,"The nightlife at Bethune - Cookman is not at all what it may be advertised to be. There are plenty of parties thrown by student but the transportion shuttles are iffy. Also, the people hosting theparty are scam artists. On the flier it said EVERYONE free all night but after 11pm they started charging."
College Sophomore,1,My campus only has transportation for certain events like foot ball games or going to the store every couple of months but its free when they do have them
College Sophomore,1,There are not enough computers at bethune-cookman university. Most of the time they are always occupied by another person. Also the printers never have paper in them. So it's a  hassle when you type something and want to print it but you can't.
College Freshman,1,Meigs Hall had plenty of Mold in rooms
College Freshman,1,People still come and go on this campus as they please
College Freshman,1,FAMU is a much better school than BCU and for folks
College Freshman,1,ADMINISTRATION AT bCU IS A REAL JOKE FAMU WOULD BE
College Freshman,1,RA in Meigs Hall is a real joke don't do anything A
College Freshman,1,Plenty of that going on campus daily for sure every
College Freshman,1,Security is a complete joke around BCU check FAMU s
College Freshman,1,Fights breaks out all the time some are reported s
College Freshman,1,"Mold in Meigs Hall, mold damage my things,mold is."
College Junior,1,Bethune-Cookman University doesn't offer transportation you have to pay for a cab if you plan on traveling.
College Freshman,1,I really havent been able to explore the night scene at Bethune-Cookman Universuty because freshman have curfew.
College Junior,1,We are in a neighborhood that is unsafe. Locals walk the campus and people come and go as they please. Majority of the reasons ar becasue it is such an open campus.
College Freshman,1,"Don't go here, it sucks."
College Senior,1,The parking is terrible. We have to pay $20.00 for a parking permit and most of the parking on campus is reserved. There really is not enough parking for students on campus. Especially to charge $20.00 for the permit. The fine is $30.00 for parking without a permit. You only need a car if you live on campus really.
College Senior,1,"Could Hardly Call It a Drug Scene – The faculty and staff of Bethune-Cookman University show no mercy for those who partake in drugs or alcohol of any sort. Any contact of an illegal substance on campus is grounds for an automatic expulsion. The reason I give it a D is because some people suceed in getting away with it, but that is at a very low percentage. If students are participating in drugs or alcohol it is not on the ground of Bethune-Cookman University's campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Srict – Bethune-Cookman is a private school with very strict rules. Alcohol, tobacco, and drugs are not allowed on campus or in your room. I foyu are caught with these things thats immedite expolsion. There is also a no visitation rule, meaning that the opposite sex is not allowed in each others' room. If you are caught you will have to pay a fine of $1,000 and until that fine is paid you cannot take your finials or registar for classes."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Library and Dinning Hall – Library-Can be very noisy, which doesn't allow students to get much work done because they are distracted by others. The Library also needs to update computers. Half of them don't work and the other computers are so slow. Reminds me of Dial-up

Dinning Area- Food is not tasteful. Preparation should be taking up a notch, so that students will be satisfied and enjoy coming to the dinning hall. We would like to eat the same way you would feed your own family. Stop making mystery meal from left over from three and four days ago."
College Junior,1,Security Grade – There are many incidents where campus theft occurs and it seems as if it isn't taken serious enough.
College Sophomore,1,"They Treat Us Like Kids – Cookman doesn't allow opposite sex visitation inside dorm rooms. They can chill in the lobby, but that's about it. There's also curfew for freshmen smh !! They treat us like we're kids, we're suppose to be grown though ."
College Sophomore,1,"While there is more than enough parking for faculty at the school, there is not nearly enough parking for students AT ALL. We are sometimes forced to park outside the university and have to walk a long distance through the university just to get to class."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Non Existant – The parking is the worst and fairly non-existant. You have to fight faculty for spaces and they will tow your car with the quickness. Freshmans DO NOT bring a car, if you do don't try to park on campus. You must show up at least an hour before your class in an effor to get at least a decent spot."
College Freshman,1,"Costs,Convenience and Safety – Costs is reasonable I can affird to live off capmus rather than living on campus. Safety is an issue it's off capmus housing makes it harder to trust people and having to lock doors shut windows is a hastle. Convenience is good but I will have to take the bus every morning to attend classes."
College Sophomore,1,Public Transportaion – The transportation is poor almost all the time except when a party or football game is involved
College Senior,1,FINANCIAL AID IS PROBABLY LIKE ANY OTHER SCHOOL TERRIBLE!!!!
Recent Alumnus,1,"Horrible School – Overall, this is a terrible university.  Most of the professor's are incompetent along with staff that work throughout the school, with the minor exception of a few.  The only thing you will learn comes out of the book.  As for the conditions of the buildings, not that great, they don't offer much for you as a student.  Cafeteria is old, food is terrible and meal plans are ridiculously over priced.  

Athletic teams are ok, but the gym is a joke!  I have seen better high school gyms.

There isn't much reason to go to this school unless you have an academic or athletics scholarship.  Don't waste your time and money."
College Freshman,1,Shuttle and other transportation uses are costly. $6 per person just to get to where you need to go and the same price back is rediculous.
College Sophomore,1,"On Campus Cuisine – I think that they could do a better job with the food they serve.  I don't eat pork or beef and that does not leave a lot of choice for me.  The food is often cold, or doesn't look safe to eat.  The athletes food look, smell and its lots better that what they serve the regular students.  I often find that I have to go off campus to eat or just prepare something in my room."
College Sophomore,1,Permit Cost – in my opinion we are already paying alot so it should be free
College Junior,1,There is no availiable off campus housing. If you want(or are forced) to live off campus then you have to sign a lease with and rent an apartment.
College Junior,1,"The Cafe – There is only one place availiable on campus to eat and sometimes I feel like my options are limited and unsafe. I have experienced food posioning from dining at this facility we call if the ""cafe"" around campus."
College Freshman,1,Tired of This? Cafetria is so nasty. Not everybody a vegetarian why we have to eat vegetarian food.
College Sophomore,1,School Comparison – I'm not sure what stands out on this campus compared to others. I feel like the most of the things at this school is way below what you find at other schools.
College Freshman,1,For starters freshmen aren't sllowed to have cars on campus unless they have an documented excuse to why they need their car. This requires us to depend on friends or Pierre Shuttle which isn't free and is only inexpensive if your traveling with a group of people.
College Freshman,1,"There are few clubs around for students at BCU. For all areas surrounding Bethune Cookman students get no discounts on food, drinks, clothes, shoes, etc."
College Senior,1,"The office of financial aid at Bethune Cookman is somewhat unorganized. I believe this is due to the staff members , who tend to lose and or misplace documents. I belive that there is alot of stress and pressure for them to make sure they have all the documents from every student that needs aid by a certain time. Sometimes during the summer it is a hassle to get the needeed paperwork submitted and processed because they fail to anwer the phones like they should. The only tip I can give to a student dealing with financial aid at bethune cookman is to start early and to keep calling until they pick up the phone for assistance."
Recent Alumnus,1,"In Need of New Security – We recently got an organized campus security, and they are too relaxed."

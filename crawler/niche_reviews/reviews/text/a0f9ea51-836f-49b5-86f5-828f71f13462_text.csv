Freshman,5,"Since we are in the middle of a pandemic, most classes have been moved online. The teachers make sure everyone gets the materials they need for that class. The professors are really good about grading, tests, etc."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Angelo State University, and I have to say that i absolutely love it here! At first I was not really sure if I was going to like it or not because it is quite smaller compared to other universities. I realise now that I love it because it is a smaller campus. It is easier to connect with your professors in a small classroom. The staff here is really helpful and super nice! Go Rams!!"
Freshman,5,"What I honestly love about Angelo state University is how beautiful the campus is, it's a luscious green and full of life which is amazing for the San Angelo Area. I also love how interactive groups and professors are as a whole."
Freshman,5,"I am currently taking one class online, which is a Human Biology Lab -- But the professor makes sure to make me feel like I am apart of a class by explaining things or answering any questions I have on the subject matter."
Junior,5,"Professors are available to help students whenever needed, must stay on top of work to succeed. Overall a good experience."
Junior,5,"I transferred to ASU in the fall of 2019. From the beginning I felt welcomed, my professors pushed me and helped me when I felt stuck. My peers as well. The staff helps so much, not just the professors, but the people in admissions, the president and the landscape people. I know I chose the right college finally. And I can say I am happy with my choice, go Rams!"
Junior,5,The only time I had taken online classes was due to Covid. My professors were so understanding with the circumstances and helped us in anyway possible. I never felt behind or stressed because I knew I could email them and hear back within the hour about anything that’s a head scratcher. I’m thankful due to this.
Junior,5,"I love Angelo State, its affordable with great programs. Life at ASU is awesome. I wouldn't change a thing about ASU."
Junior,5,I like the pace of the online classes offered at Angelo State. I can pass these classes very well and they're not too difficult but not too easy either.
Junior,5,"I very much enjoyed the online classes, they were quick yet informative and made learning at my own pace a very interesting experience rather than it being dull as I expected it would be."
Junior,5,"The professors were all wonderful and were always there to help out any student who would ask. I recall that my first semester I was very nervous and somewhat sad most of the time, and so I went to the University's health clinic and they helped me move on with my college experience."
Freshman,5,"Angelo State University is an amazing university that provides its student with tremendous amounts of resources and support. The atmosphere at the university is very diverse and brings an extraordinary experience to get to know others from different cultures, locations and beliefs."
Alum,5,"I would highly recommend Angelo State. From an academic perspective, the professors loved teaching. They truly cared about their students and were readily available to explain course material, write letters of recommendation and serve as mentors for research projects. These professors, paired with the small class sizes, pave the way for an excellent education. Angelo is also ideal for students who are interested in studying abroad. Not only do these opportunities exist, but students can also experience other cultures while still on campus due to the large exchange student population. All of this comes at a reasonable cost. Not only are tuition and fees relatively low, but Angelo offers incredible scholarship opportunities. The Carr Scholarship program, which automatically qualifies students for scholarships based on their SAT/ACT scores, helps to make Angelo State an affordable option for students. From an academic, cultural and financial perspective Angelo is an excellent choice."
Junior,5,"Being an online student isn't always easy, you have to come up with a method that works for you to make sure you keep track of assignments and due dates. However, the professors are approachable and will try to work with you. Taking classes online is different, but I do prefer having a firm set of due dates to rely on."
Sophomore,5,"Angelo State did an excellent job in providing the online tools I needed to complete my course work.  I,  however enjoy being on campus and learning in a classroom setting."
Sophomore,5,I love Angelo State it is my home away from home.  The professors and students on campus make you feel like you are part of a big family.  I am excited to return in August.
Freshman,5,"As soon as I walked on campus, it immediately felt like home. The campus is beautiful and their programs are very advanced."
Freshman,5,"I did not take any classes online, however from what I’ve heard they were great at continuing the rest of the semester through online work."
Freshman,5,"My first experience at Angelo State University was one that I was dreading, however that quickly changed. The professors are willing to help you out."
Freshman,5,"Although classes moved online for the last half of the spring semester, I was able to still communicate with my professors and they were able to continue to nourish my learning. I was happy with my experience but still prefer face to face teaching since I did have a couple of classes that are content heavy and the work was cut down."
Sophomore,5,The students are all so friendly and outgoing and so are the professors! The staff is always supportive of your degree plan and will help you with anything you ask them. The campus is large and clean with plenty of areas to rest or eat if you get tired or hungry. The campus also has a free gym for the students with lots of equipment and a large rock wall. The dorms are super clean and very nice for the students to feel safe while they are living there. There is constant police officers driving around to keep the campus and students safe. The faculty is very good about sending out weather alerts to it's students to keep them safe.
Sophomore,5,My online experience was great. The professors are super nice and worked with me through everything.
Alum,5,Great smaller college that had good real world preparation. The business school professors were very personable and easy to relate to.
Freshman,5,I love how much Angelo cares about the success of their students. Their classes are small and it feels like family !
Freshman,5,The school is quite big and so beautiful. It has people from different places and with different cultures which makes interactions really fun. The staff is also really helpful and will walk you through every step to make sure your stay is super comfortable.
Niche User,5,I love the environment of the campus and the friendliness of all of the people there. The class sizes are not that big and the dorm rooms are very cozy and clean for students!
Freshman,5,It very open and friendly. The professors are amazing. The campus is gorgeous and always have things going on. It’s in a small quiet town
Niche User,5,I really appreciate the congenial atmosphere of ASU and all the students and administrators that I cross paths with from there.
Senior,5,"Angelo State University is an incredibly affordable university. Through their Carr scholarship almost all students are guaranteed some sort of financial aid. With loving faculty, professors are willing to make sure you are successful given you put in time and effort. Angelo State University also has great athletics, nearly every sport wins their conference or is competing for a title every year."
Niche User,5,"I’ve toured Angelo State and it was excellent. The living arrangements or dorms were very spacious and comfortable. The building are all rather new and the academics are exquisite. They have an very large ranch specific to agriculture classes, some meats served at the school are raised and slaughtered on the ranch for classes and teaching. The nursing program is by far my favorite with great lab experience and training."
Freshman,5,I love friendly the campus is and the people that are here. With all the help I had the people here have really made me feel welcome into this campus.
Freshman,5,"Angelo State University is such a beautiful community. The campus is beautiful and peaceful. The Professors are kind and so willing to assist students with assignments and understanding the material. The size is pretty much perfect! It's not too big to where no one knows you, but it's too small to where everyone knows all your business. Angelo State University was really a home away from home!"
Freshman,5,"I like how involved the faculty and students are among one another, and how festive the entire campus Is when it comes too cheering on the school. I wouldn't change a thing on this campus, other than parking."
Junior,5,"Angelo State University is a great college because you have the opportunity to personally know your professors. They are also very nice and understanding and are willing to give chances for the betterment of our education. Learning is a great experience and I am always excited to come back the following semester. The community and all the groups in Angelo State are friendly and inviting too. Great people looking for great experiences to share with others. Security here is super quick and seems like they never lack, which makes everyone feel safe. If there were one thing that I would change about Angelo State, it would be to spread out the word even more. Here at Angelo State you get an excellent education for a great price and they offer you aid to help you out financially. It is a great college and I would definitely recommend it to all of my friends."
Niche User,5,I loved the class sizes and student to teacher ratios.  The campus itself is also very nice with a great workout facility and a variety of nice dorms.  I found Angelo State affordable and a good quality education.
Alum,5,"The best thing about Angelo State University is its overall affordability. They are an elite higher education establishment that is available to anyone willing to apply. The university goes above and beyond by offering the CARR scholarship to any student who takes an ACT or SAT, and based on their reported score they'll be offered a scholarship. That alone is enough to make any student contemplating a public university to at least apply. The location in San Angelo, TX is great as well. It is a historic metro-area in beautiful West Texas with plenty of activities to keep any college student busy during the week and on weekends. Angelo State is growing as well they have recently broke 10,000 students enrolled which is a major accomplishment for any NCAA Division II school. Overall, I can't recommend Angelo State University to anyone and everyone because they make everyone feel like someone!"
Sophomore,5,"Angelo State University is an amazing university to attend. Not only do they offer amazing scholarships, but they're overall tuition isn't expensive to begin with! Tuition range from $10,000-$15,000, way less than other competitive colleges. The university's acceptance rate is 75%."
Freshman,5,Angelo State has been overall a very welcoming college to me during my time. They were very helpful during orientation and throughout the entire process of me having to figure out what to do once i was accepted.
Freshman,5,Angelo is a great school and I love it. If you wanna have a great opportunity to get a full one on one education with your teachers Angelo is the place it’s a small town where you’ll get to know a lot of people.
Alum,5,Classes were small and professors were very helpful—there doors were always open. The park-like atmosphere of the campus made it easy to make friends and stay active.
Sophomore,5,"Angelo State University is an awesome school. Here at ASU, we attend classes in state of the art facilities. The professors I've had so far have been phenomenal teachers. I give ASU a 10/10 rating!"
Freshman,5,I believe it is a great university. The staff is very welcoming and will always be there for you. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved and succeed.
Niche User,5,I have been to ASU numerous times and have been fascinated by what I saw. I can't wait to go to college there because I know that I will have a lot of fun and that I will make a lot of new friends. I want to make sure that I get the experience of a lifetime.

Tota sapientem principes vix in, sit fierent insolens assentior id. Pro legendos voluptatum ea, qui cibo ridens possit eu, postulant evertitur nec cu."
Senior,5,"I think Angelo State University is a great institution to complete your degree. They have great scholarship programs, and some amazing teachers that make learning more than just sitting in the classroom listening to an hour long lecture."
Freshman,5,I've heard that Angelo is just breathtaking. Their are so many clubs and organizations to pick from or even be apart of. They offer the programs you are interested in. The campus life is great. There are plenty of food joints to choose from in about a good 5 minute walk radius. It is in a friendly neighborhood and the students/faculty are very welcoming and helpful.
Freshman,5,"It is a family friendly university, I am from Lubbock texas so I am decently pretty far from home, the staff and professors here on campus truly cre about you and look out for you, just recently I was diagnosed with mono and I had to let all of my professors aware of my current situation. Every single one of them went out of their way to make sure I didn't fall behind in class. I truly love it here in San Angelo , Texas."
Sophomore,5,All of my professors have been very attentive and helpful. They've always been quick to answer any questions I have and help me when I need it.
Niche User,5,The campus gets their student involved with a lot of thing and also get out to their students very well.
Sophomore,5,Angelo state university is a learning community that is located in West Texas .    The college has a strong sound value system incorporating a general education that enables us to become well rounded creative thinking individuals . Within my leadership roles I have learned the social responsibility is so important in our changing society .  My vision is to continue being that leader in preparing myself in the health and human services profession . ASU offers a specialized education  and skills required in the field of kinesiology.  Developing a strong relationship between our campus and community is extremely important to me.   Through Angelo State University I will graduate and will feel confident that I will be able to carry out the universities mission to enrich the quality of lives for the individuals who are underserved and vulnerable  through community projects .
Niche User,5,When I visited Angelo State University I felt right at home. This university goes out of its way to make you feel welcome and like you are meant to be there. Angelo State university to me is my second home.
Sophomore,5,"I love the school, town, and people! If you come from a smaller town and want to keep the small town feel then I highly recommend ASU! It has the great perks of a big school, yet it makes you feel such at home.  The town is definitely older and somewhat rundown but nothing that will ruin your experience. ASU ALWAYS has stuff going on and things to do. The education here is amazing. Most of your classes will be on the small side of the number of people, for a college campus. You get to know your professor pretty well, as long as you make an effort to get to know them.  All-n-all it is a great school and a great place for you to start your own life. RAM EM'"
Junior,5,Angelo State University has a great ratio of students to professors. They are able to learn your name and help you one on one. ASU has a beautiful campus that is safe and always moving forward. With numerous organizations on campus there is always a place to fit into and belong. ASU is a second home for many.
Sophomore,5,My experience at Angelo State has been amazing. Students and staff have been nothing but kind and sweet towards everyone they encounter with on a daily basis.
Freshman,5,Really great college and friendly environment. The campus is alright and the dorms are also decent. I have made some good friends and also I have become friends with almost all my professors.
Alum,5,"Angelo State has a big campus feel even though it isn't huge. It's in a decent size city that has everything I need, but it isn't so big that it's overwhelming. It's safe and fun at the same time. I liked my professors and felt like they cared about my success."
Sophomore,5,I love Angelo State University. The professors truly care about their students. There are various resources that are helpful for students.
Niche User,5,"REALLY WANT TO GO HAVE HEARD GREAT THINGS FROM STUDENTS WHO GO THERE AND FROM FAMILY MEMBERS, GREAT BAND AND FOOTBALL TEAM ENJOYED THE SMALL CLASSES, and enjoy hopefully being able to go to enjoy new things and new experiences with others and other people"
Freshman,5,"Angelo State University has a very diverse array of clubs and organizations, where anyone can find their niche."
Junior,5,"I love that even before I was officially a tident at Angelo State, the students and faculty had already made me feel like I belonged there. When I was touring the campus as a highschool student, students and professors alike offered their guidance to help me find a certain building and after they finished, said “welcome to ASU!”. I have never had an experience like that at any other college or university. I have never had a class larger than 150 students, so it was very easy finding my fit in my university. I am now a junior here at ASU, and since I am starting to take more classes specifically related to my degree, I have become fond of visiting my professors during their office hours, whether it be for advising, tutoring, or just talking. I love how even from senior year of highschool to now, three years into the university, the faculty and students have not changed in their welcoming, friendly ways, and I hope to be same when it comes to the times of frequent campus visits."
Junior,4,"Great School at a great price, great programs,  great services, great student activities, great campus, food is questionable at times. The dorms are also great, with no community bathrooms."
Freshman,4,"I cannot speak from experience of taking online courses at Angelo State University, However I believe that the university would be able to provide exceptional resources and support to their online student community."
Junior,4,"As a military spouse, Angelo State University has worked towards making sure I am able to continue my education and they have been very helpful to other students during the pandemic. The administrative staff and financial aid staff have been very helpful during my journey as a college student."
Senior,4,"In my opinion all online classes, no matter where you take them, have a tendency to be hit or miss for their actual conduciveness to being an online class. With the pandemic and classes being moved online 3/4 of my classes was a seamless transition to an online format and the fourth class was an english class, which are always more difficult to move online. Other semesters where I have taken online through Angelo State, the professors have always stayed true to their syllabus, but keep in mind that they still maintain normal work hours and most will not respond to late night emails until at least 8am the next morning. Overall online classes here have a tendency to be completely doable even woth a busy schedule and working around in person classes."
Senior,4,"Most professors I have come across are super willing to help out students and encourage office hours. If you put in the work, most professors will work with you to help you better your standing in their class, or help you to better understand the material. Finding organizations to get involved in can sometimes be tricky, but if you search for them, you will find them. The dorms are pretty good for a public university, and the have always been really chill and helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently an enrolled student completing my first year of college. What I really like about ASU is the size. Angelo State is not too big to where it is overwhelming, it feels the perfect size. Also this university has a lot of school spirit and you can definitely see this through traditional events like RamJams, homecoming bonfires and football games."
Senior,4,"Angelo State University is a wonderful campus. It's a 10 or 15 minute walk from one end of campus to the other making it suitable for exercise routes around the campus, as well as making it very easy to make it to classes from any dorm on time without having to get up hours ahead for a commute or busy walking paths. For the number of students on campus, the classroom size remains on average a ratio of 25 - 30 students per professor, making it much easier to interact closely with the faculty and build professional relationships to help launching into a career path to reach each student's ultimate goal. Upper class students tend to be very helpful to incoming students, having once been in the same position. It is easy to learn the way about the campus relatively quickly. There are also plenty of clubs and opportunities to become involved in and on campus."
Sophomore,4,Angelo State University is a college where students can develop their capacities to a professional level. Classes and professors get the best of their students and make accommodations and give them the attention needed. You won't get something better for a reasonable price.
Sophomore,4,"Angelo State University is a nice place to attend and a warm environment to be a part of. I have made many new friends and created countless new memories to look back on. As well, the professors really know how to teach their students and scholars and get them closer to their goals."
Freshman,4,"So far here at Angelo State University i have enjoyed my experience. This is my first year and I was nervous, I went to my first class and it wasn't bad my professor was very nice and made sure that we understood what we were going to be doing for the semester. All my other professors were the same way, they are very nice and make sure that you have and understand everything. I am now comfortable here at ASU, all the staff are friendly. The students are friendly and I love that you can go to centers like the writing center or the math lab and you can go and check you work or if you are having trouble the people there will help you better understand how to work the problem out. I love coming to ASU because i know that if I need help I can always go to my professors or to the writing center to get help, and that I will always be safe here on campus."
Freshman,4,The environment is very warming there is nice individuals everywhere. The staff helps greatly with all issues.
Junior,4,Angelo State University has a terrific way of preparing its students for the real world. The class sizes are not too large but big enough to provide great opportunity to meet people with similar goals.
Freshman,4,What I love about ASU  is that the campus isn't to close from home but its far enough away for me to have the best fresh start to pursue my career
Sophomore,4,There are challenging and unchallenging classes but more classes are challenging than not. The dorms are nice and modern. There are a lot of help with financial hardship. The thing that you should know is that you pay for a lot of services so make sure you make use of them!
Graduate Student,4,"The university is beautiful! It has a strong sense of community to where you never have to feel like you are alone or left out. Even if you like to be on your own more, you will always have someone to lean on whether it be you r classmates or the faculty and staff. The city is amazing as well. It is not too big or too small. It has just the right amount of entertainment that a college student might like to do. While west Texas climate might not be all that great, San Angelo is located in a great part of the state to where you are not too far from anything!"
Freshman,4,Angelo State University is a very good university. The size of the classes is perfect for anyone who wants to be in a smaller environment. The teachers most likely know you by name if you are in a small enough class.
Graduate Student,4,"It is a great school in a small town that is full of friendly people. Professors and community members are very invested with the students in the school. The only  potential disadvantage is that the school is relatively small in size as a result, the amount of networking one could do is limited."
Senior,4,I love this university and I'm proud to be a part of the Ram Fam. This school has professors that are very friendly and the care about your success here. The Ram Fam is like nothing else. It is made up of people from all different backgrounds that share a common identity - Angelo State Ram.
Junior,4,It is a great environment with many opportunities academically and socially. A very open and fun experience for a small town college!
Freshman,4,"I really liked that Angelo State was small enough to go from class to class, but the town was too small. There were no new things to try, but the school itself was enjoyable."
Sophomore,4,"Angelo State is a pretty great place to be. Its small-school feel is often overshadowed by the amount of big city opportunities provided to the students. Many people complain about the food choices in San Angelo but there are so many all over the city that are easy to get to. One thing I do not recommend to others is coming here and joining a fraternity. They're mediocre at best but their egos reflect that of a top tier organization. It's quite cringey and the same goes for the sororities. Overall, ASU is a pretty great school"
Niche User,4,I am duel credit student with Angelo State and they have treated me in a very professional way. All the students that are attending Angelo State only give me positive feedback about the atmosphere and people.
Sophomore,4,"As a former Angelo State University student, I really enjoy the experience on campus. There are many activities that help influence a more social outcome. As a math student, I want to get more involved in the mathematics tutor center where I can help people who are struggling with numbers and statistics. Angelo State is one of the best schools in the country!"
Junior,4,"Coming from a city girl, arriving to San Angelo seemed out of my range and it seemed as if nothing was out here, but once I stepped into Angelo State University grounds I knew I was meant to be here. It felt at home! The population at ASU is growing, but always count on 1-on-1 interaction with your professors!"
Sophomore,4,"I had just finished my first year at Angelo State University. I had fun being on my own, getting to learn in my field of study and meeting new people. This school has given me confidence to go out and be myself as well made me  a better person."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is super friendly & the classes are a decent size! The professors take their job very seriously. There could be more events that were more inclusive of everyone, but overall there is lots of activities to do! There is also a ton of job opportunities on campus, which will work with your school schedule."
Freshman,4,"I visited Angelo State University a couple months ago and I fell in love with it. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming when I stepped on campus. I enjoyed the vibe and the tours that they took us around. The CAF food was pretty good too tbh, considering the price you pay to eat anything you want."
Junior,4,"Angelo State University has provided me with the ability to meet people of different backgrounds and ethnicities. Before coming to Angelo State University, I lived in a town that was not very diverse. However, after enrolling into Angelo State University, I made friends whom I would have never spoken to in High school. At any rate, Angelo State University encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone and to meet great people."
Freshman,4,"Angelo State University is a great school for students looking to benefit themselves, and receive the best education possible."
Sophomore,4,"My time at Angelo State University has been filled with great teachers, good friends, and hard work. What I like about ASU includes my professors & the minimal proximity of the campus, making keeping in touch with my friends, simple."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy how everyone cares about you here. Almost every single professor wants to see you succeed. I do wish that they make more parking spots though.
Junior,4,"It is a great, small, university that is growing rapidly. I enjoy the diversity that has been increasing over the years and I don't mind the seven hour drive to get there at all. It's a very calm, lazy college town that gives you a break from school when you need it."
Freshman,4,"Great people and professors, decent campus and place to live, excited to spend my time here getting my degree."
Junior,4,I love angelo state. The staff and professors care about you and your grades. Would not change a thing.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Angelo State for the environment, everyone on campus is so friendly. There is never a dull moment, there is always something going on. One of the best experiences of my life."
Sophomore,4,"I love that there are 2 coffee shops on site. The majority of my professors are very helpful and willing to spend time with students if they ask. There are many activities to be a part of. The parking is still satisfactory, but that may change as the school grows."
Junior,4,Angelo State has teachers who try to build a culture of student oriented teaching.  They will always meet with you and help you when you need it.
Freshman,4,"Angelo State is an amazing place to study. The professors are very helpful and know how to do their job well. There are a ton of different student activities to get involved in as well as clubs, intramural sports, etc. The tuition at ASU is fairly cheap to most universities. The housing on campus isn't your typical dorm life, its so much better!"
Sophomore,4,"Very diverse campus, you will meet many different people. Has a nice atmosphere and decent class sizes (you will not be overwhelmed if you come from a small high school or town)."
Sophomore,4,Angelo State University is a nice 4 year university where you meet many people that can turn into lifelong friendships.

Freshman,4,I like Angelo State University because its campus size is not too big and it’s not too small. I think Angelo State has a great size campus. The professors are so nice and helpful as well as fellow students. Overall everyone is so helpful. I chose ASU because my goal is to become a nurse and ASU offers a great nursing program. Angelo is not too far away from home and I like that I can go back to visit whenever I can. Although Angelo is not my home I consider it a second home to me. The dorms are very nice and comfortable.
Junior,4,"What I like about Angelo Stateis how close everything on campus is! Coming from a small town I was super nervous about the transition but, ASU was the best choice for me! I love it here and the professors are so helpful!"
Junior,4,"I chose Angelo State because of the close knit community, great academics, and beautiful campus! I am due to graduate in December and will he sad to leave, but proud to be a Ram!"
Sophomore,4,"ASU is a fun campus that has some great professors. There are all types of people, and if you look long and hard enough, you'll be able to find people that you connect with,"
Junior,4,"I transferred from California to Texas blind. Meaning I did not come visit Texas or Angelo State before I made the choice to come here. However, it has been one of the best decisions I have made. From my dorm, meal plan, food, classes, and the people here. You get an unlimited meal plan for the same price or close to the same price as any other meal plan at another school. The options of food are endless and delicious and change everyday. The dorms are awesome and have enough space with a private bathroom. The facilities here are my favorite. The CHP is our gym and has every possible machine plus any thing else needed to workout (also an indoor running track). My classes are awesome and when you get to you major there are literally 12 people in your class and sometimes less! The teachers have been amazing so far along with the people here. They are so nice and inviting."
Sophomore,4,ASU is a small university and thats what I like about it. The class sizes are small and the professors are very easy to talk to. I am glad that I picked ASU for my first year of college.
Freshman,4,"About to start my second semester of college at ASU and I couldn't be more excited! In the first semester I was a little nervous about College since I had never been before.Angelo State University made me feel at home.All of the professors were nice and they encouraged you to go to their office hours to talk to them about your homework. They have a math lab if you struggle in Math there are tutors to help you.They also have a writing center to help you write better by suggesting what to write and how to fix your paper to your professors liking.We have Chick Fil A, Subway, Starbucks, A barbecue place that is the bomb, a wrap and soup place and a place called Revolution Noodle.Not to mention we also have a place called On The Go where you can pick up a snack if you are in a hurry to get to class and we have the Cafe for more dining.Overall Angelo State University is a great school,plus it is cheap! I would highly recommend coming here!"
Junior,4,Angelo State University is considered as a medium sized university surrounded by a great community. I like this school in particular because there is so much diversity and school spirit.

College Freshman,2,There's very few Greeks here so no one really bothers to care about them.
College Sophomore,2,"It's a small school, you DONT need Greek life to be involved and have friends"
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life here isn't that great. I have visited other schools and they are so much better there. There are so many more to chose from. I never hear anything about the sororities here. I only hear about Fraternities because of their parties. I wanted to be in a sorority, but the sororities don't seem worth it here."
College Freshman,2,"I really think all of the best parties are the parties hosted by those in the theatre department. However, the Pike theme parties are not fun nor are they safe. The last time a group of my friend's went to a Pike party one of them got roofied. Not to mention that the parties are just all around lame and I would say you should try bringing as many guys as you can to feel safe, but sometimes they won't let guys in. So I don't think that the party scene has a positive influence. Maybe if we get the Pikes out of here that'll change things."
College Freshman,2,"there's is pretty much nothing to do here. only one mall with little stores not very much to shop, everything is so far away. etc"
College Freshman,2,its really hard to say since most places you go to around here are pretty far to the point you need a car and I don't have a car so I don't get much off campus food besides pizza
College Freshman,2,"no one really knows where the parties are at , the only ones known are the pikes but they have a bad reputation on what they do . I really haven't gone to any this year"
Recent Alumnus,2,Most people transfer schools because the town doesn't have a variety of activities to offer. The nightlife is sub par and not many attractions are present either.
College Freshman,2,The town has one country dance hall. And otherwise its house parties with the SAME people every weekend.
College Freshman,2,"Girls cant have sorority houses because of some old town rule. And the one frat house there is only houses 2 people, its more of a party house."
College Freshman,2,"I don't drive, but depending on what others have told me, the worst times are at the beginning of each semester."
College Freshman,2,NOTHING much for those under the age of 21!!
College Freshman,2,"More of a retirement town rather than a college town. Not much night life for those of us who are under the age of 21. Really only Midnight Rodeo, movie theater, bowling alley, and a very sketchy club called Club 81. Need to incorporate more activities for those who like to do things at night on the weekends besides the same thing all the time"
College Freshman,2,"The wifi mostly only works best in the dorms and in classrooms by the exterior of the building and it has the possibility of disapearing for a bit at certain times when needed most. Need to improve on that. The printing on campus is OK, they give you about 800 pages free a semester which is a decent amount."
College Freshman,2,Not very much variety besides the common McDonald's or Sonic. The nicer ones we have are Red Lobster and Chili's but that is about it.
College Freshman,2,"I have a ""B"" parking pass and it is the worst to try to find a parking space. This next year I am going to switch to a reserved parking to see if it is any better."
College Junior,2,Bring your own laptop and wireless router
College Junior,2,"Bars are very sub par, and nobody seems to know how to throw a good party"
College Junior,2,"The clinic is good if you can cure any disease with an allergy pill. 

Campus security is only there to collect ticket revenue."
College Junior,2,Greek life is over rated. I am in a sorority that is not part of the Greek system or Panhellinic society and we are often looked down upon because we are bigger than the other sororities. Just get involved in something that tests your comfort zones in a positive way and makes you enjoy your college experience.
College Junior,2,"Housing is extremely expensive! Definitely live off campus with a good roommate if you can. I met a lot of amazing friends in the dorm and had a very good experience, but as a whole, they are very expensive and living off campus is a better choice after your first year."
College Freshman,2,"Greek Life is not super popular on campus. Most of the sororities are seen as lame, and the fraternities are only known for the parties they throw. Honestly, I do not think it is worth the money to join Greek Life. There's plenty of other social gatherings available."
College Junior,2,There's very little parking and I think to help the situation would be to not allow the on campus living students to park in the parking lots. 
College Junior,2,Parking is expensive and had to find a parking spot even if you pay for parking. They make the professors pay for parking in which I think is outrageous.  
College Freshman,2,The first year wasn't to bad but the second year was horrible.  That's because my mother had to raid her retirement fund which boosted her income.  Which made it very difficult for me to get aid
College Sophomore,2,The weather is extremely unpredictable. One day it may be sunny and the next day it may be cold.  When it rains it is the worst because the sidewalks become flooded making it an unpleasent experience to get to class.
College Junior,2,THE ATMOSPHERE ISNT TOO GREAT. THE COMMUNITY DOESNT HAVE PRIDE AND NEITHER DO THE STUDENTS
College Junior,2,I have not lived off campus so my opinion is less than relavent. but I do hear alot of friends admitting that living off campus saves much more money so i am very interested to try something new
College Senior,2,"Teachers are AMAZING. If you can cut through the standard ""conservative"" white people of West Texas, there are some really cool people to be found. Don't let the unsavory characters bother you. Price is right, too, and the town may be small but it's good."
College Junior,2,"The number of spots is too limited, and the different ""Lot"" options don't make sense.  Parking enforcement has rules that seem geared toward simply making money for the university, instead of preventing people without passes from parking on campus"
College Freshman,2,The freshman have better housing options than returning students. Returning students kind of get the lesser dorms.
College Freshman,2,Greek Life at Angelo is really good for sister and brotherhood. They arent reallly known for there parties but more for sister/brotherhood. They are great when it comes to team sports and getting involved but segregate by looks.
College Junior,2,It can be very hectic and stressful in finding a parking spot.
College Sophomore,2,"The Greek life at ASU is mostly known for parties.  I know they do charity events, and occasionally there are field-day type events where they compete but they aren't a huge active part of the school.

If you're not in a fraternity or sorority it's not a big deal, and if you are most people only know if you're wearing the T-shirt."
College Freshman,2,"The campus RA's and officials can be pretty strict, especially if you get caught doing something illegal. They do not allow students in certain halls and students under the age of 21 to hold alcoholic beverages in their rooms and if you are seen intoxicated while entering the dorm building, a series of consequences will follow. My best advice is that you refrain from doing anything that is against the law as well as school policies, or choose to accept the consequences if you do decide to participate in risky business."
Recent Alumnus,2,"You Have to Stay on Top of What You Need – ASU as a whole has problems being practive and contacting students about information needed or even adding information to students' accounts.  It took ASU about 2 and a half years to add my major onto my account after I requested it multiple times.  The last time I was assured it would be added, I received an email 6 months later letting me know my major had been added onto my account."
College Senior,2,"Processing takes time, even when paperwork is early"
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much to do. If you have an older friend with an apartment or something you can party at, feel free to. Besides Midnight Rodeo (which is lame) there isn't any fun places for underage people."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot happens on campus and off campus is only bars.  All the bars are for 21 and older, except some country bars."
College Sophomore,2,"I have never eaten on campus.  I have not heard any good things so I would rather eat off campus, but the college is located in the center of town so there are more options off campus anyway."
College Sophomore,2,"This town does not have much to offer.  It is primarily college students and retirees.  If you want to raise children this town has the benefit of low crime, but not a lot to offer."
College Senior,2,"Angelo State has two locations for dining. One is in the university center, they have a variety food such as Chick Fela, to the grill and chinese food back to pizza. The second place is the cafateria, I do not eat there because I do not have a meal plan and it is a little pricey at both venues to eat and the quality is not that good."
College Sophomore,2,Dry and Hot – San Angelo weather is very dry most of the year. Most of the year the weather is quiet warm.
College Sophomore,2,Not Very Diverse – To be honest until recent years the campus has not been very racially diverse. The campus is mostly caucasian and hispanic.For the most part though the campus is very tolerant to people of all races.
College Junior,2,"There are not enough computers accessible to students. Students usually have to wait to use one and they may only need it for a few minutes. Also, the internet is frequently down, making it difficult to check e-mail or complete work."
College Sophomore,2,Not Enough Space – there really needs to be a multi-level parking structre.
College Senior,2,The public transportation options on campus are that great. I  usually get around by bike.
College Sophomore,2,Need More Parking – I hear finding parking spots before classes can be a real pain. You have to arrive at just the right time or you'll end up parking down the street and walking to school.
Recent Alumnus,2,No Work – This town and school offers practically nothing in the way of post education employment.
College Junior,2,"It is very bland, more book work than anything. I transfered from a school tha there was much more hands on experience in the field."
College Student,2,"There are a number of nightclubs around campus, but I usually go for house parties as they are more convenient and cheaper.There is a fee at these nightclubs and usually restricted to students who are over 21.I personally do not party a lot, just once in a while"
College Sophomore,2,Some parking lots have narrow roads making it harder to maneuver around other cars. A lot of students do not place the required parking stickers on the rear decal of their vehicle.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are people who get into the elevator that smell like they just got done smoking marijuana. It is disgusting. There are not many programs to promote ""Don't Do Drugs"" either."
Recent Alumnus,2,Not Very Much – They do hold event but don't support them very well. Hardly anyone ever participates. They hold many parties. The Greeks are known as well as others probably are at other schools.
College Freshman,2,"The Perfect Moment – The weather here in Angelo at times can be perfect, but all of a sudden it can mess up these perfect moment and just be outrageously cold. The weather never really effects classes for all of our classes here at ASU are really close to our dorms which is perfect."
College Freshman,2,"The Land of Homos – I've grown up with my best friend for almost 11 years and he told me his senior year the he was a homosexual. I was confused, but he was my best friend so I excepted him for who he is today. I really did not feel comfortable with him, but after coming to college I have notice that there is a high percentage of homosexual people here at ASU. There is nothing wrong with homosexual for they are people too and everybody on campus is real chill with everybody. Thats why I love ASU nobody is a bully here at ASU and I know that my best friend is save from being harass at ASU."
College Junior,2,"Food Choices – On our campus here in West Texas, we find a limited about of food choices. Of course, Friday is always fish, but on the other days, its a variety of pizza, burgers, and hot dogs. There is not too many choices. We are very limited compared to other universities in Texas. Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner all cost about $5 each. There are no student discounts, and provide very little customer service. If there was a best place to eat on campus would be the buffet that is located at the cafeteria."
College Sophomore,2,"Same 'Ol – All the parties have the same theme and same type of music, with the same faces."
College Sophomore,2,"Greeks Don't Dominate the Scene – Here at Angelo, Greek life is very low-key and it doesn't matter whether you are in a fraternity or sorority because no one notices anyway.  There are not any Greek houses on campus or near campus; therefore, whether you are a Greek or not, it doesn't make you at this school."
Freshman,1,"I have not been impressed with Angelo State University. I have been attending during the COVID pandemic and my professors still count attendance, despite me having a chronic disability that leaves me incapable of attending classes at times. I could now possibly fail a class because my professor, who knows about my health conditions, is going to fail me for attendance."
Junior,1,I have taken online classes for 2 semesters and to sum it up they are awful. The professors do not post lecture recording or any form of teaching. They expect you to read the whole textbook and teach yourself.
Junior,1,Angelo State University has a terrible on campus housing program. The roommate matching service is a joke. I like to keep the room cold and my roommate likes it hot. It’s one simple request that I wanted a roommate who likes it cold. Another problem I had was during the COVID pandemic I stayed on for summer housing and instead of keeping students safe and allowing them to have one or 2 people per room they cram them to full capacity. They do not care about you they only want your money.
Sophomore,1,"Classes got moved online when covid 19 hit and it was absolutely awful to try and keep up with my classes. I ended up dropping all but one class because I was so overwhelmed. I took an 8 week course and the instructor was just downright unbearable and kind of rude. She also did not notify about any changes, and took forever to post grades"
Freshman,1,"Online experience with angelo state was not any good. Their website is hard to navigate, and when it comes time for homework, my assignments for each class were everywhere. I had to search for.my assignments in order to complete them all."
Sophomore,1,"its an american college, most of the students are stressed beyond help, high or super Christians that will CONVERT YOU >:) the courses are barely acceptable, the food and community love to blow vape smoke everywhere they go. if you want to enjoy a stay, go somewhere else ;) scholarships are scarce and degrees besides medical and computer science are just a waste. dorms are the embodiment of the park restrooms, people hookup constantly in the dorm public restrooms. construction and vehicles drive through the walk space constantly and clubs are 90% charity and church meetups. oh and avoid the game club. trust me."
Alum,1,"Boring boring boring. The only thing worth my time was Rambelle Rugby. Classes were decent professors were alright. I can’t really say anything bad about the academics themselves that was alright but living on campus in San Angelo is like living in a box. There’s nothing to do and nowhere to go. I’m from San Antonio so if small town boring nothing to do is your scene than go ahead. Couldn’t even throw a party without cops getting called at 11pm for noise complaint. Wasn’t even loud. Parties were lame. Extra curriculars were lame. Student life was lame. Cafeteria food was lame. Better plan on buying food at Chick-fil-A on campus. Not diverse at all. Lots of southern ignorance if you catch my drift. All in all rugby was cool, the most expensive dorms were nice. That’s it. Not exactly a bang for your buck."
College Junior,1,"It is very expensive to live off campus, like crazy expensive"
College Freshman,1,the experience i had with financial aid was terrible because each day i went to talk about the money i needed for tuition they would keep delaying and then each day it was a different person so it was even more difficult
College Freshman,1,It was such a hassle I had went through considering the school asked for so much in so little time.
College Junior,1,I don't qualify for any kind of scholarships or grants
College Sophomore,1,"The Greek Life here is really nothing special. They don't do a whole lot for the community except maybe like three things a year. The sororities here are just looked at as ""wanna-be's"" and the frats are just mediocre."
College Sophomore,1,I have to get to school about 30 minutes before class in order to get a parking spot. ASU needs better parking.
College Junior,1,"If you have ever lived in a city with a population over 100,000 don't come to this terrible place"
College Junior,1,Never if you can help it eat there
College Junior,1,"Never come to San Angelo, off campus food is bearable, and on campus food will leave you on the toilet for hours"
College Junior,1,Pretty much not there at all
College Junior,1,The weather here is crazy! It is warm one day and then freezing the next. Classes often get cancelled for the freezing temperatures.
College Junior,1,"Seriously, financial aid sucks. I feel like I do not get any assistance because I do not have any extreme circumstances and am often not chosen for scholarships or any type of aid through the office. They do not really help and send you 398324792 different directions so that they do not have to deal with you. They are somewhat helpful for Study Abroad though"
College Junior,1,We have no transit options except city buses or cabs.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Let's be blunt: we have one of the worst IT dept. I have seen ever. The computers aren't kept up to date, so sometimes when I need to use a sofware that a professor assigned me to use it won't work, etc. Best just to use your own on the WiFi."
College Freshman,1,"San Angelo is a small town and not much to do. Not many bigger cities nearby, closest one is 1 hour away. They have one movie theater, bowling alley, and laser tag place. Tiny mall; but the several stores make up for it."
College Sophomore,1,"only 3 clubs and if u cant do the two step then u only have 2 options. they r called.... 1) fuego, 2) Club 84, 3) Midnight Rodeo"
College Sophomore,1,no transportation options available if u dont bugg ur friends for rides
College Freshman,1,"The cafe food is terrible, at least for me. I don't like the food and would rather eat nothing or barely anything. The food at the UC is a little better."
College Senior,1,"Greeks Don't Dominate – There are a few Greek parties here and there, but if you don't know anyone in the Fraternity or Sorority, good luck finding out about it.
Rarely through events on campus.
Special Interest Organizations Dominate on and off campus"
College Senior,1,"Permit Costs are ridiculously high. More permits are sold than there are student parking spaces.
Parking lots are divided in confusing sections (A-D) making it easy to get a ticket even if you're 2 spots away from your correct section.
Better off coming early and parking down the street."
College Senior,1,There are insufficient parking spaces for the number of students that drive from off-campus locations.  You have to be atleast 20-30 minutes early to have a good chance to find a spot.  Midday? Goodluck.
College Senior,1,We only have two greek life groups for both male and female.  When compared to other schools they can not compete.
College Freshman,1,it's ok. but better on the weekends. not going to lie we all get bored of staying on campus. i wish they would offer more things during the weekend.
College Freshman,1,"Campus Police – we have campus police, that are extremely stupid. They give you tickets for anything and everything they can think of but they don't actually do anything useful."
College Senior,1,"Intramurals are alright, but some of the clubs like Ram's and Belle's Rugby could use some more involvement. I'd like to see students in sports like fencing, martial arts, archery, lacrosse, etc."
College Senior,1,"Housing? If It's Off-Campus, You're Dead. Then again, on campus housing isn't so great either. It's a lose-lose situation."
College Senior,1,"Not many places are relatively close for students who don't have vehicles or their own transportation. Plus, it would be nice to see many more sidewalks available around campus."
College Freshman,1,"Tech on Campus. Everything on campus computer and everything tech wise is good. Except a few things. We are limited to 800 print credits. I know that may sound like a lot but it really isn't. I need to print papers, notes, slides for all classes, and even personal things. We need more. And also, the school has so many different wifi internet possibilities. Why so many? I think we only need one. If you don't belong to the school then you can't have access to our internet. We pay thousands of dollars, so our internet should be fast and reliable."
College Senior,1,"Only Major Worth Getting – The only Major worth getting at angelo state is the nursing major, if your in anything else, be ready to be unemployed and moving home, or delivering pizza for you post-grad work."
Recent Alumnus,1,"For reals, worst parking situation ever, no parking, many tickets."
Recent Alumnus,1,"On what you are majoring in everything outside of the technical fields at this school is easy (ie. think for profit school easy like ""devry"",etc).  Ironically, this is not the case with the technical fields which have much higher flunk out rates."
Recent Alumnus,1,"From your future family and friends. 
""Angelo State...uh um where's that at? ...its close to texas tech...but not actually tech...oh (nervously). "
Recent Alumnus,1,"Diversity & classroom lectures – Lots of closed minded conservatives, even worse closed minded liberals.

One of the WORST things about this school is the graduation rate...MANY of the students here are taking 5 years or more to graduate...why? availability of classes.  One of the things about going to a small school is that some professors have too much power and if you have to take a class required for graduation you are stuck with a professors who fails half the class->not good.  At larger schools you have more choice if you know your futuere professor will not be good or if you are at risk of damaging your gpa.

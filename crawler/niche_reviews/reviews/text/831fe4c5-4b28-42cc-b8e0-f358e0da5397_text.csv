Sophomore,5,"Coming into Penn State Berks in the fall of 2019, I was very nervous about going to a local school. With a new chapter of my life beginning Berks really welcomed me with opened arms. The professor have provided my great information with my courses, teaching me life lesson, meeting new students from all over, and being able be myself was the biggest thing that I was able to accomplish. Before, I had to keep the internal me in a shell from the outside because of this established ego and personality the outside makes you for years. Now, I'm in control of my own path, decisions, and how I want achieve goals that I have set."
Sophomore,5,The professors at Penn State Berks always showed concerns about their students and giving them extra time to complete the assignments.
Sophomore,5,"For the most part class was exactly the same but just online the work was still submitted through our portals, so not much changed except having to not be distracted by things in your room."
Sophomore,5,"Penn State Berks is a branch campus of Penn State located in Wyomissing, Berks County, PA. The campus is small and cozy with lots of grass, trees, and multiple forms of art structures around. Within 5 minutes outside of the campus there are multiple shopping centers around with fast food restaurants, Target, Dick's Sporting Goods, and a full mall with many retail stores. Overall, the campus is perfect for someone looking for something not too big. It takes about 7 minutes to walk from end of the campus to the other."
Freshman,5,"I love this campus. Everyone is so friendly, and they genuinely care about the faculty, staff, and students. Everyone is so outgoing, and they know how to have fun. There are so many activities to do on campus, and they have a lot of fun events."
Freshman,5,Penn state berks campus is a fairly good campus that focuses on mostly student life and academics. There are if any no parties at all that helps with the academic studies during the week/weekend.
Alum,5,"Penn State Berks consists of a well-knit campus community. The faculty and staff are truly passionate for what they do and are there to help students succeed in college and in the future. Being a highly-involved student in academics, research, and student organizations, I can attest that the quality of the school is high. I can also say that Penn State Berks has helped me acquire a job post-graduation and accomplish my dream of being accepted into dental school."
Freshman,5,"Ever since I stepped onto Berks Campus, I knew it was my forever home. I've never felt anywhere new feel some much like home. And I knew I needed a home for my endless adventure of college. Maybe it was because my dad graduated there as well; maybe it was the fact it was only 30 minutes away from home; maybe even it was the smallness of the campus. It didn't matter, it quickly became my home. From faculty to students to professors, everyone you encounter is super friendly and supportive."
Senior,5,"I love the way they make it feel like a family. Being a family at berks I got to experience wonderful professors, that love to go out they way to make you feel like you’re at home. Also, I got to meet my wonderful mentor Ms. Alexa Hodge she’s very good at her job and love the students from the aspire program. She cares so much and amazing at what she do. If there was more people like her at berks, berks would be a wonderful place to live at!"
Sophomore,5,The small class sizes and campus creates a tighter bond within the community. All of my professors know my name and I can easily get one on one help when needed!
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus, very helpful staff, great professors. I do wish Tullys had more if a variety of food though."

Freshman,5,It's a great community and I look forward to spending the rest of my college experience years here. I have met a lot of different and varied people from the state and beyond. They have a big community and there are many more campuses to choose from in the Penn state area all connected by weekly events and clubs.
Freshman,5,"Penn State Berks is an amazing and diverse place to get started on your college education. Since the campus is more smaller, the teachers always go out of their way to help their students. Education is a main priority in this campus. Not to mention everyone is friendly and the campus is very aware of keeping the area a safe and comfortable environment for their students."
Freshman,5,I like how welcoming Penn State is and how helpful they are. I like the amount of money offered to me. I like the community and the campus.
Freshman,5,I loved the landscaping and welcoming staff. The campus is close to a highway but you hear nothing. It is also close to stores and a shopping mall.  Berks offers many clubs that are really fun to partake in. The professors are really nice and helpful. They interacting with their students.
Sophomore,5,"Great small campused school that allows for close connections to be made. There are so many ways to be involved, whether it be the speakers brought to campus on a weekly basis, sports teams, hundreds of clubs, or just through the many hang out spots available to students to be able to connect with other students and staff. Penn State Berks is passionate about inclusion as well, with many events putting a spotlight on different genders, races, and other social groups, such as the LGBTQ+ community."
Freshman,5,"After visiting Penn State Berks, I absolutely fell in love with it. The cozy campus feel, the close proximity of surrounding towns, and the over comfort I felt, as if I were meant to be there!"
Sophomore,5,"Coming into Penn State Berks, I was in the worst state of mind. My mental health was at an all-time low due to a multitude of reasons ranging from a break up with someone who I still adore to dealing with the rocky relationship I have with my father. I held not only my responsibility but my families and many friends as well. I was not able to focus on myself and what I enjoyed doing because I was so focused on everyone else. I was completely clueless and I lost myself all within a year prior to going to college. Somehow, Penn State Berks allowed me to find that time for finding myself and take advantage of it. I know this all sounds cliche as hell, but I can promise you that with all of the available resources and close-knit community that permeates this campus, I found myself and even though I was far from home, I found a new home within myself."
Niche User,5,I took a tour at Penn State Berks and I loved it. Everyone was so nice and answered all my questions. I even got help with my financial aid. I ended up committing to Penn State Berks and I'm excited to start this new journey.
Alum,5,"I transferred to Penn State Berks my sophomore year and as soon as I arrived on campus for a tour, I knew I belonged there. the campus is beautiful and the perfect size. Not too big and not too small. There are so many opportunities since it is a Penn State school."
Freshman,5,"Excellent School, Great Staff.I am attending this school as part of a 2+2 program..two years here and two years at University Park..The reason why I picked this option is because my ability to be closer to home my freshman year was a plus for me..I am now entering my sophomore year and I am ready to move on the main campus At University Park..I am excited.But I loved my experience here at Penn State Berks..Everyone is helpful and friendly and I feel safe here..I have met a lot of life long friends by coming to Penn State Berks and I would not trade this experience for anything."
Niche User,5,I plan on attending Penn State Berks campus during the fall of 2019. The beautiful campus and overall engaging environment was one of the many first appealing qualities to catch my eye. The office and administration involved in helping new students was inc edible helpful and the teachers I have met so far all seem helpful and kind. It is my first choice of colleges and I’m more than enthused to attend.
Senior,5,What I like about Penn State Berks is that it's a campus that welcomes every student and does whatever possible for that student to feel welcome. The professors are amazing and always help you in any way they can.
Alum,5,"My experience at PSU Berks was very pleasant. Great campus, awesome faculty, and many activities on and off campus!"
Junior,5,"I’ve only been at Berks one semester, and I wish I had been there my first two years of college. The campus is beautiful and well kept. The teachers are so involved and helpful when needed. I spent a lot of time in the library, using some of the many amazing resources they offer to students."
Junior,5,I like this campus because the classes are small and it is great because I struggle to be in a large classroom. I also enjoy the professor there because they give you the one on one help when asked. The students at Penn state berks are all nice and kind. There are many clubs for everyone to enjoy at this small campus. while I live on campus it was great. The resident assistants makes it feel good while living there. they organinze many events so you dont have stay coupe in your dorm all day.
Sophomore,5,It is a small diverse campus. The academic program are generally good. Student support program is the best. There are a lot of activities every day for students. It really makes me feel warm and safe.
Freshman,5,I enjoy going to Penn State Berks. The thing I like the most about Penn State Berks is how small of a campus it is. Class rooms sizes are small so you have much more interaction with your class mates and professor. Another thing I like about how small the campus is is that its much easier to make friends. Since you see the same people around campus you become much closer to them. Another great thing about this is every builds a strong relationship with their professors. When ever I need help i can just go to their office hours and they are happy to help me with what ever I need. Another thing I like about the campus is its location. I like how it is in the country but close to many stores and other things to do. Overall I have really enjoyed my experience at college.
Freshman,5,I am a freshman adult student at Penn State Berks.  I absolutely love it so far.  It is abundantly clear to me that the staff and professors are ready and willing to help in any way they possibly can.  It's a beautiful campus with many social and career opportunities.  If I were to find something negative about it so far it would be this: I wish the students were more engaged and involved during the lectures from the speakers.  Often times I am the only one answering questions or responding with comments and I feel it is unfair to the speaker.
Freshman,5,I love the campus. Its beautiful and kept well clean. The place feels completely safe to me when i first stepped on campus. The people are so kind and full of the Penn State spirit! We Are Penn State!
Sophomore,5,"Going into Berks I was extremely nervous. The name itself is intimidating. Upon arrival at Berks there were so many welcoming students to help unload my belongings. The entire weekend they were extremely helpful. With Berks being a small branch campus, its easier for students to get to know their professors, vice versa. Teachers are always willing to help, and stay longer with students, Any financial issues the student aid office helps in every way they can. I truly wouldn't want to change anything at Penn State Berks."
Freshman,5,"Penn State Berks is a very fun filled school. It offers many majors and the professors are very good. There are a lot of fun events that go on at Berks. Although it is a small campus, it is open to meeting new people everyday. The campus is beautiful and everybody is so nice here. There are many sports teams at Berks who do very well and there is a gym on campus and there is a lot of equipment inside of it. It is free to all students. We have a dining hall called Tullys that has a lot of good food in it."
Junior,5,"What I Like about Penn State Berks is that people will go out of their way to help someone, this campus is small. However, they are a lot of good resources on this campus. What’s great about Penn State Berks is the student life. There are a bunch of great activities and clubs for students to be involved such as Thon, Lion Ambassadors, Latin Unity Club, Step team, and attending home games. Where the school is located it is not a bad area, there is a shopping center down the road where the students can go shop. What I would like to see change is adding more sports on the campus."
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Penn State Berks is going great there have been no complaints, the staff at the school have been very helpful with my first year and I have grown very good friendships with the people there. If I could change something at Penn State berks I would change nothing because every thing at that school is great. The campus overall is quite, peaceful and full of joy which I enjoy."
Freshman,5,"As a student going into Penn State Berks I felt very welcomed. It is a smaller school, yet there is enough diversity in the students and staff that everyone has a place for them to fit in. The campus is located near Blue Marsh Trail where you can go and relax or go study."
Alum,5,"I loved Penn State Berks, I dreaded graduating because I didn't want the experience to end. Anything I say falls short of the amazing experiences I've had there and all the wonderful professors and staff that I have developed close relationships with as well as the great quality of education. The only thing I would recommend changing is the on campus food, however, there are plenty of place within walking distance of the campus that more than make up for it. I would highly recommend going to this College!"
Junior,5,"I liked Penn State Berks because of the convenient location. There is a lot of stores and restaurants nearby. The professors were great and the classrooms were small, so it was easy to get help."
Senior,5,"Penn State Berks is a great campus. Small class sizes. Get to know your professors well. Opportunities for research, clubs and internships"
Freshman,5,"Penn State Berks is a wonderful campus. On this Campus there’s so many places to go such as Tully’s, Perkins, Gaige, etc. Every location on this campus has a wonderful meaning to it. My least favorite location on campus would be Tully’s because that’s where everybody goes after class. My favorite location on this campus would be the library because I can focus and study."
Freshman,5,This school is a very safe enviorment . The profferesors care about you and will help you with whatever trouble you are having. I reccomend anyone to apply.
Senior,5,"I transferred three times and Penn State Berks has by far been the best one. The credits transferred nicely the professors and advisors are attentive, reliable, and helpful. The campus and classrooms are nice and conducive to learning. The use of technology is at a very good level; not too much or too little."
Senior,5,"I love the professors in my major!! I also love the campus life, it is so inviting! However, I believe that they should be a little more commuter friendly. Also, when a bunch of students voices that they have a problem with a certain professor, get rid of them!! I can't tell you how irritated I am with some of the professors work ethic out of my major. I pay their salary, I pay for them to teach me and if they aren't going to take the time out to help me succeed, then they can leave my university! "
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe on campus. Police are usually everywhere, and there are many emergency contact/phone stations around campus and along sketchy paths like the one that goes through the woods from Luerssen to the far commuter parking lot. That forest is sketchy at night but I always feel protected."
College Freshman,5,Penn State Berks is a very small school and even we have our own police department. Our officers carry real weapons and are constantly seen on campus. There are blue lights everywhere. I have never felt scared or threatened on campus
College Junior,5,"Even though this is a branch campus, all students are receiving a degree from The Pennsylvania State University. This degree will be internationally recognized and held at a high value for any potential future workplace. The career services are excellent and can be utilized even after graduation. They do a great job at supporting student's occupational endeavors."
College Junior,5,This campus does a lot to make students feel safe on campus. Campus police are always around either outside or inside the buildings. There are emergency call phones all around campus as well. There are very few to no incidents of any kind in a normal year.
College Freshman,5,The safety on campus is great. We have campus police on hand if needed. Also if you have late classes at night and don't feel comfortable walking alone there are students who job is to help make sure we're safe.
College Freshman,5,"I love campus housing, Its helpful when your a first time student and still gives you the feel of living on your own. Your room can be arranged anyway you ant it and its just enough for two."
College Junior,5,Teachers are very passionate about what they do. Class sizes are small and it is easy to get into contact  with other students and professors.
College Junior,5,Internships are easy to get here. Possible jobs from these internships are on the rise.
College Freshman,5,"The police are easy to find, the teachers are also there to help if needed, and there are posts with lamps all around where you can push a button and a campus police will come help if you nee it."
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe and comfortable at Penn State Berks. I commute to school and there is so many opportunities for me to stay involved with the school. Also all of my professors are willing to work with me if I have to meet with them about a homework assignment. My adviser is very helpful with choosing classes and also giving me advise about future classes I have to take.
College Senior,5,My first semester at Berks was fantastic! Classes were great and just the right amount of challenging. My professors were attentive and very helpful. Absolutely loved the atmosphere of the campus and the students are all friendly.
College Senior,5,"In my major particularly, we have a lot of options for internships and study abroad programs. We have great access that students can look at to better put themselves out their and prepare for life after college"
College Senior,5,There are lots of areas that are attentive to students
College Senior,5,"I absolutely love my school! It's not Parks, but our population isn't extremely small either. However, even with all the students I still feel like I can connect on a personal level with my professor and that I feel cared about. It's amazing!"
College Freshman,5,I love being apart of Penn State. It's such a great experience with all the Penn State pride everyone has. I also play softball at Penn State Berks and it has been an amazing experience so far. I'm apart of a student athletic club which helps a lot with fundraising for sports teams and we do some volunteer work as well. The school isn't big but it's not too small either. It's the perfect size for me and not too far from home. All of my teachers are very helpful and I do not have any complaints so far!
College Sophomore,5,"Penn State Berks is an amazing place call a home away from home. Some of my closest friends are the students who gave me my first tour here as a high school student! I am in love with the close-knit campus community and the large university connections and resources. The faculty, staff, and fellow students are open-minded, inclusive, and always willing to share a smile or lend a helping hand. I will miss Penn State Berks when I move to University Park next fall!"
College Student,5,The school I attend is a smaller commonwealth campus of Penn State. I am a dual Enrollment student and the treat me like a college student which is what I wanted. My class is almost 4 hours long every Wednesday and the teacher is fun and modern he jokes around and also is very serious its the best class I have ever take.
Sophomore,4,"Professors adjusted quickly to the new learning enviroment which was nice. However, I do think I missed out on crucial material."
Sophomore,4,My online experience at Berks has been a good experience so far. Professor email me back at a fast pace whenever I have questions or need assistance. They provide remote learning classrooms for student to work on homework or join a zoom call.
Sophomore,4,"The community at Penn State Berks to be peaceful and welcoming. As someone who refer to work in quieter places, I found this place to be the best option.  The professors are helpful and kind. They always available if you need help."
Sophomore,4,"I am incoming sophomore at Penn state berks. i really enjoy how small the community is because that means that you get to interact with a  larger group of people and become much more closer. as well as the teachers and advisors have plenty of time to help you on your way through college. However, in terms of student life there is not much to do on campus so you usually have to go off campus to have an enjoyable time. However that does not mean that it is bad in anyway just that there is an aspect that feels like its missing."
Junior,4,So far i have had a great experience at Berks. Staff and professors are very knowledgeable and well educated. The campus overall is very nice and clean and diverse.
Junior,4,Everything was a somewhat smooth transition to online learning during Covid-19. All of the online courses i have taken are very easy.
Sophomore,4,"I think it is a great campus. The staff (for the most part) is caring and willing to help and they are good instructors. The campus activites are fun. The campus itself is beautful. It is easy to navigate. The food however is average. But overall, it  is a great campus with great faculty, staff, events, lots of ways to get involved, great resources, location and support staff."
Senior,4,"I love the Penn State Berks campus. Student life here is very fulfilling and enjoyable. There are many clubs to join on campus and many activities to get involved in off campus. The location is great, with the Grings Mill recreation trails right next to campus for those that enjoy hiking and biking. For those that enjoy shopping the Berkshire mall is only 5 minutes away and many other shops are local as well. The only thing I would criticize the campus on is that certain offices are low staffed and dealing with admissions and financial aid can be a hassle. I live on campus and the dorms are the best that I've seen from all the campuses that I've toured. The residence halls are kept very clean and the housing staff is very polite and quick to address any issues. I would highly recommend this campus."
Senior,4,I have not taken a class that was fully online before but I have taken hybrid classes and online classes after the switch to remote learning took place due to  Covid-19. The professors were quick to adjust and there was an easy transition to online learning. Penn State Berks uses Canvas as their online portal where professors upload all the necessary materials for the students. Canvas is very organized and easy to navigate and has been very helpful in reminding me when my assignments are due.
Freshman,4,Very nice and quiet. People are very friendly. The dorms are clean and very nice. I made a lot of fiends and would recommend it.
Junior,4,"I love the professors and staff. As well as the student body and the amazing people I have met from going to school here. Overall, I love this college and would recomend it to anyone who is looking for a local college with the name of a big school for a cheap price."
Junior,4,Some of the professors at berks campus cannot teach online classes. others did very well teaching online classes.
Freshman,4,Penn State berks is a great place. There are always things going on for the students. The campus is very clean and always is being work on to keep it that way. The buildings are clean and the people that work in the buildings are always nice and willing to help.
Freshman,4,"So far, it is very welcoming. As an out of state resident, I feel very at home with the people I go to school with. The staff is amazingly kind and always tries their best to make sure you succeed."
Freshman,4,"I live close to campus so I just commuted from home, and it was really nice to be able to get a quality education while still being about to sleep in my own bed at night. There are also shopping centers, movie theaters and other fun places around Berks that there is always something to do. The CAB club also provides dozens of activities that are on campus weekly so there is practically no excuse to be bored."
Freshman,4,This college is very diverse. It has small classes which means more one on one time with the teachers. All the class buildings are within walking distance. I live on campus and I enjoy it much. I do have a rowdy roommate which bothers me some and makes it hard to study and get work done. This campus offers a bunch of clubs and activities including an on campus gym.
Freshman,4,"All the staff memebers are very friendly and are always more than happy to help with anything needed. Something I wish was different about the campus is the food. There is not a lot of variety, which makes it tough on students who do not have the opportunity to eat off campus."
Junior,4,"What I like about Penn State Berks is its location.  Penn State Berks is located in an area of Reading, Pennsylvania that's very quiet and that's a good thing.  Quietness means that you'll have better focus on your assignments.  Furthermore, there are very few things I would like to see change.  Penn State Berks is fine the way it is."
Senior,4,"Penn state Berks has great class sizes because of the intimate student to teacher ratio.  This makes it easier to build connections with your classmates and professors, and making you feel your voice heard in class. Berks also offers a lot help if you are struggling with any classes. They have a room dedicated to tutoring for all sorts of classes. This all makes learning and growing on your education easier. 
Socially, the campus offers a lot of game nights, movie nights, and performances to keep you entertained outside of your studies. The campus will even have carnival-like events a few times a year. 
The campus is very small, along with the population. This can cause you feeling like you aren't living a typical college experience because of the calmness and vacancy of people. This also could be because the majority of the students commute."
Senior,4,"I have been a student at Penn State Berks for 4 years now.  For me, my experience was quite different than the original ""college experience.""  I am a commuter, therefore I am only on campus for events and class.  I chose to be in multiple clubs and events to make sure that I was involved.  Which brings me to what I like most about Penn State Berks, the involvement.  They try very hard to keep all students involved, whether you are a commuter or an on-campus student.  The campus goes above and beyond in their efforts.  Something I would like to see change would have to be the commuters access to the campus.  The parking spaces are very limited.  For example, if you aren't arriving to campus before 9 AM, you will have a very difficult time finding any parking.  Penn State is an awesome school and I am very fortunate to be apart of it."
Sophomore,4,Penn State Berks is a very diverse campus. Very small and the classes have no more than 60 students each. A lot of career and internship opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"I love this campus, and the professors at the school are very committed to each student's success. I feel secure about my academic and professional goals due to attending such a prestiguous university."
Freshman,4,Teachers are amazing and will do whatever you need in order for you to succeed. Resources are amazing and it's easy to make friends. Culture is very diverse and it's a great starting campus to go to.
Freshman,4,"I am not much for athletics, but I am glad the school does not make a big deal over sports besides the football games at Penn State Main. Some teachers are very good and take time to teach students one on one if they have to while some are not so great expecting too much from students. For example, there is a teacher who gives a 5 question test and his class average is usually in the 50. He does not do anything to improve his teachings or grades for students."
Alum,4,I like the small town atmosphere. It is really easy to get to know people especially since most of my classes were with 30 or less people.
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Berks is a great common wealth campus of the Pennsylvania State University, however, it just wasn't the right fit for me in that I changed my major and my major is not offered here.  It is a great place to start college at and for those who's full majors are offered here it is absolutely a great place to get an education.  There is so much to be involved in on campus and there are lots of great professors and people on campus."
Sophomore,4,"The small campus means that students can build close relationships with faculty and other students. Most of the campus commutes, which means that student life and on campus activities are minimal, but there is a lot of opportunity in the surrounding area."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman here at Penn State Berks, when I first got here I wasn't sure if I would like it but now I am here for my second semester I realized that this is a great school. It is small, but it's really nice. They have many clubs and activities to join."
Sophomore,4,"As my fourth semester at Penn State Berks begins, I have come to realize that the quality of academics and faculty here are second to none. A large majority of my professors have proven to be diligent and well educated in what they teach. Some of my general education courses even try to make their content relevant to the wide majority of business and engineering students that attend the campus. I look forward to expanding my skill sets and knowledge for the next five semesters I have at Penn State Berks."
Junior,4,What I like about Penn State Berks is that the dorms are structured very well. What I would like to see change is the way homecoming is set up. Homecoming here is really different than any other schools.
Sophomore,4,"The classes and professors are good, and it's a small campus so it's easy to get to know people and the professors. However, there isn't much to do in the area."
Freshman,4,"The campus isn't that big so everything is close by. The walk to the academic buildings from the dorms isn't a long walk at all. The campus is very nice and diverse. Everyone is friendly. Since the campus isn't so big, a lot of people know each other will have the same group of friends. The campus is comfortable and the café hours are very convenient being that it stays open until 11pm during the week. The professors I had were very nice and caring. They really showed interest in helping the students in need whether it be a question during office hours or trying to help a student get back on track with the work for that class. I felt very safe on campus. The school has a lot of campus activities such as the talent show, magic shows, movie nights at the nearby movie theatre, etc. The only thing I didn't like, which the school can't change is the number of activities there are to do off campus and in the area."
Junior,4,The best part about this campus is that it is much smaller then main campus. There is more interaction between professors and students.
Freshman,4,My time at Penn State Berks have been great and many wonderful experinces have come along the way. The atmosphere is lively and there is a geniune compassion between the students and teachers. I feel safe and welcome everywhere I am at and Penn State Berks is a great school to recieve your education at.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman in Penn State Berks, and so far, it has been amazing! From day one, you feel so welcomed by the OLs (they have the best OL program in all of Penn State). The campus is not too big and the location is convenient, with the numerous shops that surrounds the campus. The students here are very welcoming and it seems like every one is friends with each other!"
Freshman,4,"Coming here as a freshman I was nervous what to expect, but I was happy to know I fit right in. They have endless academic opportunities for the students and the diverse amount of students allows a welcoming community and to have the chance to become culturally aware of others. The athletics team are not high names but the teams are close-knit. The campus is dry, but with multiple other campuses around it is not difficult to find something to do on the weekends. With the size of the campus being small, the professors have plenty of time to sit down and talk with their students. The dorms stay clean and are more or less newly built, the campus food is not fantastic but many restaurants are walking distance."
Junior,4,"I like that class are small it makes it easier for the professors to get to know all their students. I also like the friendliness of the staff, they really help you if you need it. The school does need more parking, there are a lot of students that cumute there."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors make the classes fairly easy to learn, and the workload is probably average if you keep up with your work. The library becomes packed from 10am-1pm."
College Sophomore,4,"Majority of students are white, but there are still a very wide range of races on campus. Everyone seems to get along, and I haven't seen any conflicts or negative divides between students."
College Sophomore,4,"No one is pressured to do anything, it's completely up to each individual whether they do anything. Most people don't even do anything, to be honest."
College Sophomore,4,"If your degree didn't say ""The Pennsylvania State University"", I don't think degrees from this school would be worth that much. But it does, so that's a great perk. You get pretty much all the perks of the Penn State alumni network and being a Penn State student. Local job and internship opportunities are pretty good here, but big company or corporate opportunities are probably better at University Park."
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are small, professors are helpful and get to know you personally. I've had a lot of professors that are good at teaching, but are also fun and make class entertaining. Some professors (especially in the math or science-based classes) are hard to understand, grade very tough, and are sometimes rude and don't seem to care."
College Sophomore,4,I don't live on campus but I often hang out in my friend's dorm and they're not too bad. Apparently the Woods is better than the Village. I don't know
Sophomore,4,PENN STATE BERKS IS A VERY GOOD SCHOOL. THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT PEOPLE HERE TO HELP YOU AND PEOPLE THAT REALLY CARE. PENN STATE BERKS HAVE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENT TO PARTICIPATE IN AND STUDENT LIFE IS GREAT. 
College Freshman,4,"The lottery process freshman year is quite simple and almost everyone gets exactly what they want. Due to the limited amount of dorms, most sophomores live off campus (in 7 Oaks). The dorms are very spacious, especially in The Woods. The Woods offers both double and single suites, while the Village offers double suites. All suites share a bathroom with 6 to 8 other students."
College Sophomore,4,"The value of degree from this school is very important because career services will want to help you find a job or an internship. Also, by going to Penn. State, there is a vast connection of Penn State alumni that are willing to network with people who go or went to Penn. State."
College Sophomore,4,The class size is small and makes it easier for professor and student interaction. Professors will get to know you better due to the class size and are easily accessible if help is needed.
College Sophomore,4,The safety and security on the campus is always helpful and supportive to the students and help ensure that students are kept safe from harm.
College Sophomore,4,"My personal experience for living on campus was memorable, since the people I met were kind and the dorms were very spacious and convenient for going to the campus diner or even classes. I would recommend living in ""The Village"" housing since you are more likely to make friends than living in ""The Woods"", which is more secluded and quiet."
College Sophomore,4,"What makes Penn. State Berks great is the community from the faculty and students. Also, everyone is welcoming and friendly. The campus is not very big compared to the main campus, but is convenient when needing to get to classes faster."
Recent Alumnus,4,PSU football is a large part of student life as well as the local community.
Recent Alumnus,4,"So far, the administration has been helpful and attentive whenever I have a question."
College Junior,4,"A variety of diverse classes are offered here. Professors are very well educated in their fields and the classes are small, so you get to know your teacher the way they get to know you. Course quality is excellent and they have a lot to offer to all majors. It is important to be involved during class and get to know your professor's teaching style because this campus is very diverse in all ways."
College Junior,4,There are a variety of dorm options. Penn State always offers very nice and spacious housing and more private bathrooms instead of communal bathrooms. The residential and social life with on campus housing is great. You will get to know a lot of your neighbors and suite mates.
College Junior,4,"Penn State Berks is a collective family of diverse students. There is something here for everyone. It is not the biggest school with the best of everything, but classes are intimately sized and teachers will get to know you. It is located in a great area with many things to do with the lifelong friends you will make here."
College Freshman,4,"I think Penn State's athletic department is very good, a lot of friends I made came here for the sports and were giving generous scholarships."
College Freshman,4,"Penn state berks is known for their beautiful campus, and academics. I enjoy this school a lot because its just right for me. Its not too big so I can become more familiar and comfortable with my professors, and thats the main thing that I love. They have a good number of activities and sports for everyone and its a very friendly and comfortable environment.  Their resources are also very helpful. The library is full of useful things, from mac books to use, free printing, and textbooks to reserve."
College Junior,4,Good system in place to alert students of incidents on campus and what to be aware of.
College Junior,4,Great that bathrooms are not whole floor bathrooms. 4 people to a bathroom connecting the rooms. Good study rooms and lounge areas. It's a hassle to only have the stairs on the third floor.
College Junior,4,Here you are treated like you were a student at main campus. Just because you're not at the bigger campus doesn't mean you aren't part of the whole family.
Freshman,2,Just took online due to the Corona virus. I prefer campus learning. The first week was challenging but I adjusted afterwards. I hope we go back  to campus this fall and continue campus learning. I miss my friends and professors. Online learning is not the same
Freshman,2,The food is awful there is no variety. There is nothing to do in the surrounding area or at the school itself. If you have any wish to go to a party it will not happen here. The RAs and other management are overbearing and seams to be relentless to find small issues with every student. I believe they are only disappointed in themselves that they aren't good enough to go to University Park. I have had such a bad experience here I am looking to transfer to a different university. If I had to do it all over again I would never consider Penn State BERKS. I feel as if this university has more similarities to a community collage then a penn state campus. I would highly advise you not to attend here.
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do here or in the Wyomissing area. As a traditional student, I am a minority here. Most students are veterans or adult students."
College Freshman,2,No one attends and the school spirit here sucks
College Freshman,2,"There are no parties on campus, and off-campus parties are usually only on Thursday nights."
College Freshman,2,"I have never gotten in any real trouble on campus but I have had plenty of friends that have gotten in a lot of uneccessary trouble because of either RA's or Cops switching the story around. And on thursday's the cops wait in the parking lot and usually pull over random cars and do random searches and breathalizing. If you ask me, thats harassing and annoying. The cops make it seem like they don't just wait until there's an actual problem. They go and look for trouble.I literally got stopped for no reason when coming into the parking lot on a thursday night and breathalized and all I did was go to Wawa."
College Freshman,2,Extremely strict people work here! They have zero flexibility and there is zero tolerance. Do not expect to do anything party related on campus. They dont even let you play pong with water cups. Simply having music going in your dorm can get your written up. The RAs are also quite rude and will not hesitate to barge in your room. The administration is possibly the worst thing here and they need to fix it asap!
College Freshman,2,"Depends on the day and who made it. Some of the food is really gross and you get the runs from it, other times its okay. Honestly though, they really need other dining options. Alot of the times, they have almost no food options available and if theres only two options you dont like, you're forced to starve!"
College Freshman,2,i didn't have a single drink in college. #SUCKSSSSSS
College Freshman,2,i am one of 20% of all of the Penn State system to receive any scholarships. I only received $1500
College Freshman,2,"No social events, cell phone service, elevator services, or kitchens for dorming students. I didn't eat a single home-cooked meal all semester! Cafeteria made every single student sick on a daily basis"
College Freshman,2,I commute so I've never really been a part of the party scene on campus.
College Freshman,2,"I live in the area af the campus. I usually don't have money to buy food so i mostly eat at home. There are many restaurants in Wyomissng however. student go out to eat many different kind of foods, we have the majority of the major fast food restaurants in Wyomissing. There are many local restaurants including many different  international cuisines."
College Freshman,2,"Winters are really cold and snowy while summers are always sweltering; the campus, however, does its best to keep paths safe."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the students are commuters, so everyone has a car; despite this, parking is always a difficulty unless you arrive before 9 AM. Public transportation is available, but school-supplied shuttles are not."
College Sophomore,2,"They  only have academic scholarships for incoming freshman! Pretty much nothing else, you have to look to outside sources!"
College Senior,2,"While many like the idea of a small school, it has its drawbacks. Some professors have favorites, and those who live in the dorms tend to stick together, causing the commuters to feel left out even though it is mostly a commuter campus. Myself and most people I know just go to and from class and then go home. There is not really a college feel. It is good for getting a good education but that is about it."
College Freshman,2,"At Penn State Berks I feel like I have to jump through hoops to find out information about finical aid. The information is there, but it takes many days of emailing and phone calls to many people."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on campus is not entirely bad. I've never gotten a ticket or fine so I'm not sure of the fees associated with those. A permit is free and most students are commuters and/or need to have a car on campus to get places outside the campus. Avaliability of good parking spots is often a hit or miss situation. If you get they're early you're more likely to get a spot closer to the building you desire, if not, you can still get a spot but it is often much further away."
College Sophomore,2,Tough to Get Without an Inside Track. I recieves a little amount of finacial aid but it was only because I went into the office multiple times begging for help. The proccess could be a lot more organized and student friendly.
Niche User,1,"Honestly, the school is not worth your money or time. If you are coming from the city, you will be disappointed. Judicial Affairs is also crooked as well. I high recommend going to a different school or go to University Park. I only recommend coming here if you plan on attending Penn State UP and you want to spend two years here for cheap."
College Sophomore,1,"There are only two off-campus party locations. One is in inner-city Reading is usually pretty sketchy. I've gone there twice and both times there was some sort of fight, it was busted by cops, and there were tons of underages given out. The other slightly less sketchy location is right across from campus and the cop scene seems to be pretty heavy there too. Parties only happen on Thursdays and social life is completely nonexistent on the weekends because everyone leaves for just that reason. In order to go to parties you need to know someone or have some sort of connection to someone who lives there, otherwise you're kinda in the dark."
College Freshman,1,"Go somewhere else. If you want to be apart of the Penn State cult, transfer into University Park. DO NOT go here, for the sake of education, money, and entertainment. There are so many better options."
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life! I wish they had this too!
College Freshman,1,makes everybody sick on a daily basis. I had diarrhea after every single meal
College Senior,1,If you don't have a car you are pretty much out of luck.
College Freshman,1,"As far as I know we do not have any frats/sorties. I never see any banners, parties, or people talking about frats/sorties. Penn State Berks only allows clubs."
College Senior,1,"There is no ""Greek Life"" at Penn State Berks that I know of. I believe this is because it is a satellite campus."
College Sophomore,1,You need your own transportation. There is one bus that comes around every so often but that is about it. Penn state berks is at a convenient location with target walmart movie theater grocery stores and mall around but you just need to drive. It is however in walking distance from target and barnes and noble and many other stores.
College Freshman,1,"Usually cold all day so bring a coat. Also, it rains maybe twice a week out Berks so prepare for that too."
College Freshman,1,penn state berks is a dry campus and police services are constantly roaming the campus for any foul play so their is basically no nightlife on campus unless you live off campus where mainly all of the parties are.
College Sophomore,1,Are You Sure You're Poor Enough – Lets just say they're very lacking you have to be below the poverty line to even be considered. Funding is lacking and is going down thanks to politics and the price of tuition just keeps going up. If you want a scholarship you already have your tuition paid for now you get free room and board while other students have to drop out because they can't afford college. FREE COLLEGE
College Freshman,1,Financial aid is horrible unless you are below the poverty level. Don't expect to recieve anything!
College Junior,1,"There are no ""greeks"" to speak of, but there are a few people who use the frat name around campus, its a small thing so it can be hard to find."

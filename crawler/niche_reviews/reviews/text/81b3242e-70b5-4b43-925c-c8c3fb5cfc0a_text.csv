Freshman,5,I’ve been loving Doane. The teachers are helpful and it’s easy to make a connection with them. I’ve also felt like I’ve made great friends and this place feels like a new home
Sophomore,5,I love this school with my whole heart and never want to leave it. It is a beautiful campus and allows students to become involved while getting a great education.
Graduate Student,5,My experience during undergrad on the Crete campus was fabulous.  Everything from campus life and courses were excellent.  The faculty at Doane strive to make personal connections and build relationships with all students.  It truly is a family when you are a tiger!
Freshman,5,"Doane is a place where you will find your career and future! This is a play where you will find your best friends, colleagues, and  relationships. It’s a smaller school but that means more personal. The professors care so much about you that one professor I know jump started a good friend of mines car on the side of a road for him. The campus is very beautiful with the best nature in the fall and spring. The Greek life on campus is different but also very nice. We are not a national Greek school meaning you don’t have to pay thousands of dollars, and there’s no stress. The people you meet here will change your life and bring you so much joy."
Sophomore,5,"Coming from a bigger school to a smaller school like Doane, was a big change for me. It was a lot to get used to. For a while, I did not know if I wanted to go there because I was not used to being alone. But looking back now, after meeting all of the people that I did, I am so glad that I stayed. I met some of my best friends that I will remember forever. I will miss Doane when I graduate."
Niche User,5,I was very impressed with their coaches and football team.  They made me feel right at home.  I could see myself going to Doane as it is rural and that is what I am used to.
Freshman,5,"I just started at Doane and i have loved the school ever since stopping at their table at the SCC College fair. They have amazing staff who are all so kind and helpful. The upperclassmen have been very welcoming, kind and helpful as well."
Sophomore,5,The teachers at Doane are amazing! the programs they have are very beneficial to the students and campus life is unbelievable. The environment there is homey and the students are always welcoming.
Junior,5,"Im taking the online health pre-recs. They have been super accommodating with me being stationed overseas. Classes are fast paced but you learn a lot. Would take more classes with them, highly recommend that you apply. Slightly high tuition rate but you gwt your moneys worth."
Freshman,5,"Doane is a small liberal arts university that is truly a home away from home. Everyday is a bright day at Doane. They're professors truly care about everyone's success, which also means the class sizes are very small which allows students to have a great student professor ratio."
Senior,5,"If I could give six stars, I would.  I cannot say enough good things about Doane.  The professors are amazing.  The campus is stunningly beautiful all year round.  The facilities and dorms are both clean and up to date.  The athletic and performing arts opportunities are unmatched.  Scholarships are generous and it feels like everyone at Doane is rooting for you to succeed.  I hope this does not sound cliche or oversold, but I mean every word I say.  Thanks to Doane I am able to graduate with minimum student loans and stand prepared for both graduate school and the work place."
Sophomore,5,I knew I was going to Doane when I first stepped on campus and it was the best decision I’ve ever made! I love the atmosphere and the people here! It’s my second home away from home.
Senior,5,Doane is a beautiful campus and has a great academic rating. They have many activities to get involved in. All students are very nice and outgoing.
Freshman,5,"Doane University is an amazing school that allows students to connect with their professors. It is so easy to meet up with professors ahead of time if one cannot attend class to stay on top of class material. Everyone is so helpful! It is a friendly environment. If I ever have a question about something, people are always willing to help me with what I need. There are also many academic resources available."
Niche User,5,Would be an incoming freshmen.  Enjoyed my campus tour and very excited to possible make this my school.
Sophomore,5,"Doane is a small campus which means that everyone knows everyone. We are all one big family, which I love. Everyone supports everyone. All of the athletes come to the choir and band concerts and art students go to all of the sporting events on campus. There are so many ways to get involved on campus and everyone is usually involved in those activities. There is so much pride in being a Doane Tiger and I think everyone should be able to experience that."
Senior,5,"I love being at Doane. It feels like one whole family, and everyone on campus is so friendly. The professors actually care about the students and want them to succeed."
Freshman,5,Doane University is a great school as far I can see. The School is really small and that translates to the classrooms. Most of the class sizes are small. That means that you'll get more time with the teachers. The town its in is a little small but its still located close to Lincoln so there still things to do.
Niche User,5,"Doane is an amazing campus and everyone I met there was very friendly and helpful. I love how close everything is, you can walk to all your classes anytime easily and the dorms are also close. I also love how the architecture is, everything about this campus makes me feel a home."
Sophomore,5,"Professors really challenge you to learn and get your moneys worth in the class, and are very willing to help students succeed.  I would like to see more parking to adequately accommodate the on campus student body."
Graduate Student,5,"I like how I am able to complete my master's program online. In the future, I would like to see more graduate  programs be available online."
Freshman,5,I love Doane and I could not have picked a better school for me. I was choosing between a few different schools and Doane was my second choice for a little while. My admissions counselor (Thad Dodd) is probably the main reason I am here.
Junior,5,I love the campus here at Doane university! the amazing trees and grass all around makes me  The class size is also really great the most i've ever seen is thirty to a class. This allows the professors to really get to know students on a personal level and it also makes the professors more approachable. I would like to see the campus food options and the town of Crete's food options increase but they are working on it. Overall Doane is a fantastic place to live and i wouldn't change the four years i'm going to spend here for anything.
Niche User,5,"Well, I am only a senior in high school, but I plan on attending Doane next fall. Their campus is very well kept. There are always people there to help answer your questions if you don't know where you are. There are a lot of new things that you can experience on their campus. This is perfect for people who are trying to put themselves out in the world. Doane is known for their education program which is the number one reason I want to attend their college next fall. If you are questioning your college choice, if I were you, I would go on ahead and check out Doane University. ​"
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my time at Doane. My education was top notch, and I also gained great experiences & friendships!!"

College Sophomore,5,This campus is friendly and is a beautiful campus.
College Sophomore,5,This campus is very safe and has active security at night.
College Sophomore,5,Campus housing has a social atmosphere with friendly people.
College Sophomore,5,Almost every student is involved in a sport on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"This school is unique because it is a small campus, therefore, I am able to make friends."
College Junior,5,Doane has the best theatre program in the region! I want to be an actor and a working one at that.
College Junior,5,I feel very safe there!
College Freshman,5,I know I will have a job after I get out of school.
College Freshman,5,It's a very friendly school.
College Freshman,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus and have not heard of any incidents.
College Freshman,5,The class sizes are nice because all of my professors know each student's name. The variety of courses offered are pretty nice as well.
College Freshman,5,I love living on campus. The only thing that sucks is the cost.
College Freshman,5,My experience at Doane has been great! It's a great school with great people and I'm glad that I chose to come here.
College Freshman,5,There are many services and counsellors on campus to help with personal safety and concerns.
College Freshman,5,"As long as you put forth an effort, the professors will give you a lot of their time to ensure success."
College Freshman,5,Doane feels like home and is very welcoming.
College Junior,5,"The Crete community loves Doane Students, the amount of discounts we get around town, not just at restaurants is better than any college town I know of."
College Freshman,5,Its nice because you feel safe but you don't feel like you can't do anything
College Junior,5,One of the best theater departments in the region. We do stuff the people wish they could do in grad school. For example. We  were the first theater in America to premier Jerusalem. (it's still in London (2014))
College Junior,5,Doane was very easy to complete the application.
College Junior,5,Doane has a wide variety of majors and minors.  It was easy to take classes here and there to really figure out what I wanted to do.
College Junior,5,"My major is mathematics.  I came into Doane not being the best at Math in high school, but the Math professors helped me find my passion for math which pushed me to do my best in every class."
College Junior,5,I am studying to become a teacher.  Doane has one of the best Teaching degrees in the state.  They have prepared me as much as they possibly could which I am extremely grateful for.  Doane has helped me realize why teaching is my passion.
College Junior,5,I love the teaching education program at Doane. I would not change a thing.
College Sophomore,5,i love my professors. they are so much fun to be around
College Junior,5,Doane is the best education program in the state if you ask me! They really make sure you are prepared. The enrollment application is very simple and easy to access. We have a great science and math building that includes labs and a greenhouse. Doane is also famous for our plays and choir teams.
College Junior,5,I am Greek and I love it! Best decision I made. It helped me meet new people and it also put me with like minded students who help me with school work and encourage me to be a leader.
College Sophomore,5,Doane gives plenty of opportunities to receive scholarships and they are willing to help out whenever.
College Sophomore,5,"Main street is right next to campus and it takes you straight to the fast food venues, and a Wal-Mart is right down the road about a 1/4 of a mile."
College Freshman,5,"It seems so far from what I have seen that the drugs are not an issue at Doane. This school is a small community school with 80% of the population being athletes, so there is the concern of keeping the body clean and in tiptop condition in order to keep on their athletic game."
College Sophomore,5,The security office is great with keeping things in control on campus. The students normally stay with alcohol as their drug of choice.
Freshman,4,I have hybrid classes which means they’re online and in person. When we are doing an online class they’re just as helpful and engaging as the in person classes.
Sophomore,4,Doane may not be the biggest school but the people you're going to meet there are going to change your life forever!
Freshman,4,"My experience at Doane has been very delightful! I've met new people, great staff ,and professors. I like how everything on campus is nearby and convenient. I like how there is smaller classes and people from all over come to this university. The food is delicious and everyone is friendly."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful first off. The professors are all great and love to work one-on-one with students who ask for help. The teachers want you to succeed, not just pass the class to help them look good. Everyone who works there is super friendly, along with your classmates. They are very helpful about getting you help whether it is counseling, tutoring, financial aid, etc. The housing could be updated, they need to be cleaned more and need more washer and dryers. Some of the kitchens do not have all the needed appliances that students cannot bring from home and I believe that if you tell students they cannot bring something then it should be provided in the common areas. Overall I love this campus and the education is wonderful."
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful and you get to know your teachers because it is such a small school and it makes it for more of a personal experience.
Niche User,4,Campus is beautiful. The whole area is what you would expect a college grounds to look like. The athletics area is new and large. I took a tour and loved the school.  Town is small and doesn't seem like there is a lot to do.
Junior,4,Doane has an amazing atmosphere and really makes you feel at home when you're on campus. My first year at Doane has been an amazing one and being a part of athletics makes it even more enjoyable to be there. I really wish that it was more affordable for me to go there as it can be and is a struggle to pay for it.
Sophomore,4,"So far my freshman year has been amazing! It s a small school so everyone knows everyone. And because it is so small, the class size averages about only 13 students per class, so the professors know you by name. There are many ways to get involved on campus! The only thing about campus the I wish would change is the quality if the food served at the cafeteria. Other than that I love it here and I can't wait to see what my sophomore year has in store for me!"
Niche User,4,I loved the professors and the coaches. They  were all super nice and very informative. The campus is beautiful! It just felt like home.
Sophomore,4,"I come from a small school and wasn't looking to make the leap into a college like UNL. Doane is much larger than my high school, but I still get that small town feel, like I matter. Although I do not know everyone on campus, it is small enough that I don't feel like an outsider. Also, I can usually recognize most people on campus even if I have never said a word to them. This helps me know if they should be on campus or not."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is very important on campus. A lot of students are Greek.
College Junior,4,Everyone is welcoming and the campus beautiful!
College Junior,4,I am confident I will find a job after graduation.
College Junior,4,"I love the campus, athletic program and curriculum."
College Junior,4,Excellent facilities and very big part of campus life.
College Junior,4,Very fun and engaging. A liberal arts school that allows its students to learn and grow.
College Freshman,4,It's a small school. It's easy to keep safe.
College Freshman,4,There is a wide variety of courses.
College Freshman,4,You are very close to your classes.
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy the classes and professors are excellent.  Sometimes I struggle to understand material, but every professor is willing to help.  Class sizes are small, which makes the experience even better."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy living in the dorms, and they matched me with a great roommate."
College Freshman,4,"I love being a member of Cross Country and track.  The coaches are fantastic, and Doane has been National Champions consistently.  The coaches have been there for a long time, and the facilities are fantastic."
College Freshman,4,"Doane is a great school with incredible supports.  The only complaints I have are that the food is not good at all and they do not accommodate vegetarian needs much, and that there is no WiFi access in the dorm rooms.  One benefit, however, is that the library is open 24/7, so there is always technology access, and you don't need to bring a computer."
College Junior,4,I've heard administration from schools around that Doane grads go straight to the top of all the resumes.
College Junior,4,The Greeks throw great parties and offer many opportunities for students to meet and hangout without parties. Unfortunately only a couple groups appear to thrive in this environment.
College Junior,4,Most of campus participates in athletics. There are very few students who attend home games. It's unfortunate based on how well our teams do and how hard theyou practice.
College Freshman,4,I think the safety and security on campus is pretty good. There isn't much crime and they are always out and about making sure nothing suspicious is going on around campus.
College Freshman,4,It's good but I think the recruiting for employers could be better.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is big here at Doane. Our Fraternities and Sororities get along well with everyone on campus. Housing is a nice piece of Greek life because we have the option to live with other people in our Greek groups.
College Freshman,4,The facilities here are great and about to get even better. New construction will take place soon. Our sports team are relatively good and there are lots of fans that come out to support us.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms here are great. I live in Sheldon which was recently remodeled and, in my opinion, has pretty good sized rooms for a dorm. Our floor has a lounge with a TV as well as a balcony which we use for homework or just hanging out at the end of the night. The main floor has a large lounge area, a balcony, a small lab with two computers and a printer, and a full kitchen. It also has a patio facing Doane lake with a fireplace, tables, and hammocks closer to the water. The dorms are all in great shape and comfortable to live in."
College Freshman,4,"Even though the campus scenery is awesome, that is just the start. The professors are there to help, as long as you put forth the effort, and care about each student. It is nice being a smaller campus as well for reasons such as getting to know people quickly and always knowing someone wherever you are. It is a great start for new college students!"
College Senior,4,"I haven't ever experienced any issues with safety and security on campus. Overall, I feel safe on campus."
College Senior,4,I feel like the College to Career Center has been very helpful in helping me prepare for graduate school and helping me create the best application/resume that I can.
College Senior,4,I really like the class sizes and how the professors are excited about the subjects they are teaching.
College Senior,4,"I love the building I live in but my individual room is very tiny. I am lucky to have a suite where I share a bathroom and a lounge area with my suite mates and not the whole floor (however there are other dorms on campus that have this option). The only bad part about the building is that when the furnace is on, my room is 78-80 degrees and there is nothing we can do to lower the temp."
College Senior,4,The community is extremely supportive of all our college sports and the student section is often filled with school spirit. Football is everyone's favorite and sees the most spirit. It would be awesome if we could get that much spirit in all of our sports though.
College Senior,4,"The campus is beautiful and the ideal size that I was looking for. The professors are passionate about their fields and are more than happy to help students in any way they can. However, I feel their partnership with Sodexo could be better."
College Junior,4,The school is pretty diverse and people are very accepting
College Junior,4,The academics at school are great there are plenty of study areas and tutors are free
College Junior,4,The student career center is very helpful and even has an website to help out too
College Junior,4,I've really enjoyed my experience at my current school
College Junior,4,The small school community makes it easy make friends and to get to know your professors better.
College Senior,4,"I love the overall experience; however, the price is not really in my range and I am going to be paying for it the rest of my life most likely without parental help. Loans are scary and I've had to get two parent plus loans plus the regular subsidized and subsidized. I am hoping in the end it it worth it. I love the teachers that are always helpful and things are hands on. Some of the classes required are more difficult than my major classes!"
College Senior,4,I really love the environment of Doane college.  Everyone knows who you are and actually cares about you as a person.
College Junior,4,"Considering what happened a few years ago with a student dying from drunk driving, the Doane Safety office does exactly what it needs to, so every student is safe."
College Junior,4,"It really depends on who is at the party, I've always had good luck with sorority parties, and APE parties in the Moon."
College Junior,4,"My mom dealt with a lot of the financial aid, I got the scholarships."
College Junior,4,"It's great living on campus. I've had the opportunity to live in almost every type of housing, in Sheldon it was nice amenity wise, big windows but not the biggest rooms. Frees has nice big rooms, but then also little tiny rooms it just depends on what you get as a freshman, but Frees does have a theater in the basement with 25 theater style seating with a 60 inch projection screen television. The Quads are fun, and a great way to get to know a lot of people. Smith is a very standard living situation, it does have the newest remodel. Hansen is nice suite style living, where it is a better environment for getting to know a select few people very well."
College Junior,4,Athletics are key at Doane and it shows
College Junior,4,"The suite style dorm rooms are great because it provides more of a ""home"" feeling than just going back to a dorm room."
College Freshman,4,"There are many options, some I have not even discovered yet. A lot stay open late but not all night. There is fast food, a bar and grill, Mexican, Chinese, Shopko, Walmart, and a bunch of stuff"
College Junior,4,My personal situation is a headache every year but not because of the school. They can only do so much on their side we have to get our side done first its kind of a pain. The people in the financial aid office are very understanding and work with me to get things figured out.
College Junior,4,They try a little too hard to catch people in the act of doing things. off campus parties are they way to go.
College Junior,4,Everyone fits in no matter what. No major problems
College Junior,4,"I have had no problems with teachers, or classes. Everything is to my liking, and and i enjoy going to classes."
College Junior,4,"I am in a fraternity at Doane, and i absolutely love it. We are some of the proudest people on campus, and are really caring about grades, and can enjoy a party or too. Not everyone is Greek, and you don't have to be Greek to hang out with them. We are all one big melting pot."
College Junior,4,"Everyone here is very nice, and respectful. being such a small school, it is hard not to see your friends everyday."
College Junior,4,"Lincoln is only fifteen minutes away if you're picky, or want something specific. the area around Crete has some nice family run food joints."
College Junior,4,"There are awesome places to hang inside and outside on the campus. Plenty of lawn, and indoor lounging to accommodate for all students. The athletic buildings were just renovated, and everything looks great. everyone is very involved, and it is very easy to meet friends."
Sophomore,2,The students and faculty are great until you get to higher admin where they seem to care more about their own salaries than professors jobs. The students aren't the priority here.
College Junior,2,"I do not party, so what I see is not exactly appealing"
College Sophomore,2,"there is not much diversity, but they are trying to increase diversity and the campus is very accepting of diversity"
College Sophomore,2,"tornadoes, snow and rain 200 days a year. you tell me"
College Junior,2,I struggle every year on whether or not I can attend Doane. Doane has limited scholarships and sometimes there are not a lot online either. I know several students who cannot attend Doane the following year because they can't find the financial aid.
College Junior,2,Most of the students that come to Doane are from small towns in Nebraska. Nebraska as whole is not very diverse so naturally little Doane college is not as well. I do try to surround myself with as many diverse students as I can.
College Freshman,2,Almost all of the off-campus housing is filled. And it's REALLY hard to get the chance to do it anyway. Campus works extremely hard to keep students living in the dorms. It's pretty ridiculous.
College Freshman,2,"Doane doesn't have very good parking. People get tickets all the time, usually not knowing why. Usually no parking near your dorm, and if you do find a spot you generally have to be an upperclassman."
Recent Alumnus,2,Everything is fast food and the few options make everything very repetitive.
College Senior,2,There is only one bar in Crete that allows minors in.  Eagle's Club bar has a great college night on Thursdays with great deals on drinks and fun!
College Freshman,2,"Greek is basically just there for people who want to party, If your not into that sort of thing then don't join"
College Junior,2,"There could be more diversity at Doane College. The city of Crete has more ethnicity than the college does. Students attending the college are mostly from small cities throughout Nebraska. Doane is a small school, but expanding."
College Sophomore,2,"Could Be Better – There aren't a lot of healthy options, there is not a lot of protein. Sometimes the only food options are grain types of food, and fruit is not emphasized. While a balanced diet can sometimes be provided, it does not always seem encouraged. Sometimes the food is undercooked or overcooked. When you first see the campus food options, you get the impression that there is more variety and options than there really is. Satisfactory, but could use some major improvement."
College Sophomore,1,"you have to have a car, because there is no other way to travel and city is in middle of nowheresville nebraska.  Need for some sort of transportation.  At least to walmart and back"
College Junior,1,it isn't really noticable but is still there and known.
College Junior,1,Parking on our campus is a pain.  There aren't enough spots around the buildings or even close to the dorms and you have to walk forever to get to your class.  Freshmen definitely get the bad end of the deal however.
College Junior,1,"Becoming Stricter as the Years Progress – Doane security has become very strict in the last few years.  Rooms must have all occupants 21 or older to be alcohol tolerant.  We've had quite a bit of alcohol poisoning nonetheless.  Doane is a wet campus so there is underage drinking.  There's also quite a bit of drug use, perhaps from the ""small-town mentality.""  Security is constantly busting parties that are too loud and students must answer to a peer board when found with alcohol (if underage) and drugs."
College Freshman,1,Many students do not use their cars very often. When there is snow on the ground it is hard to see the parking lines. The parking administration takes advantage of this and passes out as many tickets as possible.
College Freshman,1,"Can't Live Off Campus – I believe that availablility and cost is fairly good. However, it is very difficult to live off campus. Doane made a new rule stating that you have to be 21 years old to live off campus. This can only be changed if there is financial hardship, but even then it is virtually impossible. Very frustrating!"

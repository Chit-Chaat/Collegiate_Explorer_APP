Senior,5,My experience at Loma Linda has been wonderful. I have received a lot of support from my professors and have met many wonderful individuals in my class.
Graduate Student,5,Loma Linda University admission process is user friendly. The staff is always available to provide assistance.
Junior,5,"The best school for me, everyone here truly cares for students to succeed. They want the best for is, and that is why they are willing to go above and beyond for us. It is rather expensive, but it is better than waiting around for a year or two before getting into a public school."
Junior,5,Loma Linda University is an extremely professional school. The administrators in the school of nursing were sweet and very helpful during my application process and were very clear on deadlines and things that needed to be completed
Junior,5,"Loma Linda University is a faith based educational institution that offers various programs such as medicine, dentistry, religion, and many more. The campus has a very diverse group of students from different backgrounds and ethnicities. In the program that I am currently, which is Clinical Laboratory Sciences, it is a very vigorous course with many hours of instruction and tons of hands on application and practice. My program is also followed by an entire year of clinical experience to apply all the things we have learned in our previous year of theory. I have found that the lectures are very informative and contain all the information you need in order to be successful in this field."
Junior,5,At LLU it has an excellent class and clinic experience!! Horrible tuition assistance in regards to scholarship opportunities and percent interest for students are high mine was 11% for a loan.
Junior,5,I really enjoy attending Loma Linda University. Loma Linda University has a history of being a great school and hospital. They have earned their reputation of being a great factor of making Loma Linda one of the blue circles where people live up to or past 100 years in age. They have a great community of staff and students.
Senior,5,The school cares about you as a real person versus just another statistic. They help to create a network which you can build on for your career.
Senior,5,"My experience at Loma Linda University has been an eye opener. The students, staff, and people there are all welcoming. I never felt like an outsider, they treated me like family even though I was not raised in a Seventh Day Adventist religion. I feel that the only issue at Loma Linda University is parking, parking for students are inconvenient and should be changed."
Sophomore,5,"I love the focus of Loma Linda on the whole person. The academics are rigorous and challenging; I feel that I am getting a solid foundation to start my career. All of my professors have been helpful when concepts are difficult to grasp. All the students seem to be serious about their education, so it’s an environment that facilitates learning."
Alum,5,"This is a phenomenal university that really cares and strives for your success.  Not only in the classes or programs, but also in all aspects of life."
Freshman,5,so far I love it. I'm trying to get into their phlebotomy program. I also am about to begin volunteering for them. also I want to join their nursing program. loma linda is a really good hospital and helped me out a lot when I had a near death experienced. I would be honored to attend their school and eventually work for them
Junior,5,I love Loma Linda! The school is amazing and the people here are very nice! They hold you to a high standard but that is why they have such a good reputation.
Junior,5,I appreciate the 1:1 learning ratio and how the professors actually care for their student's well being.
Junior,5,"I love Loma Linda University! Such a beautiful campus and everyone I have encountered, administration, teachers, students, have all been so friendly, welcoming and helpful!"
Graduate Student,5,"I took A & P at Loma LInda 2 years ago and I loved the school and classes I took, therefore I pursed to get a masters degree there.  I the facility itself is incredible because there are so many resources considering that it specialized in the medical field.  The staff was also amazing. They are genuine, caring, and thoughtful people who really focus on nurturing your education."
Recent Alumnus,5,Drugs and alcohol are strictly prohibited and pretty much no one partakes.
Recent Alumnus,5,Education is amazing at this school
Recent Alumnus,5,There are no drugs or alcohol allowed on campus
Recent Alumnus,5,After graduation job offers are highly anticipated
Recent Alumnus,5,They really care about you doing well and helping you when you need it. They emphasize the importance of helping others.
College Junior,5,Very safe.  No drugs and alcohol.
College Junior,5,I have absolutely loved my school and my experiences here it has opened my eyes to all the educational possibilities that still lie ahead in my future and have pushed me to think on a larger scale about life.
Recent Alumnus,5,Best faculty and student body in California
College Sophomore,5,"This is a faith based school, however, they do not force their faith on nonbelievers. They are accepting of all faiths and will respect it. Their emphasis on professionalism helps to train students for their future work environments."
College Junior,5,"To begin, the school that I have been accepted to, Loma Linda University, has strong emotional ties with myself. From this, I was born in the medical center, and seen many of my family members healed there. Most significantly, I have seen my father healed from a twelve day stay in the Intensive Care Unit at the Loma Linda medical center. From this, I knew that the Loma Linda method was not to simply preach good health, but to live in good health with the strong desire to keep a healthy, vegan diet, regular exercise, and be in good spiritual health as well. I would definitely choose this school again if needed to, as this school was my first choice from its strong sense of servicing the community with the highest standards."
College Senior,5,"Loma Linda University was never any part of my top choices of colleges until my sister had chosen to go to this school as well. I only live about less than 7 minutes away from campus, so I love its convenience. Most of all, I love how it incorporates my SDA faith into my academics. I was always indifference about going to church, but the mandatory Wednesday chapel made me more interested in attending. I also met many people who were as goal-oriented as I am and also willing to accompany me to church. I am extremely happy and blessed that I chose this school as my final college."
College Junior,5,"Loma Linda has very strict polices related to substance use, dress code as well as many others as they reflect the professionalism of the school."
College Junior,5,The Financial Aid department is very helpful and the application process was self explanatory as it is an online application with written out instructions.
College Senior,5,"There are many ways to get involved in what you enjoy, lots of networking occurs as a result of being an Adventist school."
College Senior,5,"We are required to have a professional attire at LL which is great! It really improves the professional atmosphere of the school, and it is really easy to make friends, since everyone is pretty friendly. There are many bible studies going on during the week,and it is a great way to make new friends"
College Senior,5,"It is a very intense program, but the teachers are there and willing to help with anything."
College Senior,5,"Great professors in the PTA program, I really enjoy the program. The registration process is a little tricky, but it is do able. Popular study areas are the study rooms in the dorm, and the library"
College Senior,5,The parties that are the non alcholic ones are the best. I don't party where alcohol/drugs is involved. Non-Alcholic parties are a great way to network and find new friends
College Senior,5,"There is a lot of diversity on campus, and it is pretty easy to make friends, and find people that are like you"
College Senior,5,"Living in the dorm is great, pretty quiet so far because I've been here all summer, so far it's good!"
College Junior,5,Financial Aid office helped me apply for aid and the application went smoothly
College Junior,5,Sports are recommended for social life and helps interact with students to form a family
College Junior,5,Many low cost restaurants near by
College Junior,5,Very Professional and Respectful Students
College Junior,5,"The School of Nursing, established in 1905, was the first in a group of schools that in 1961 became Loma Linda University. In 1949 the School of Nursing became a college-based program granting the baccalaureate degree. The first master's degrees in nursing were granted in 1957. The mission of the School of Nursing, in addition to the mission of Loma Linda University, is the education of professional nurses who are dedicated to excellence in nursing science."
College Senior,5,"I didn't encounter much difficulty except when I was applying I was in eastern time zone which made things a little complicated when trying to get a hold of them. The staff in admissions was happy to help, but the website is a little confusing and takes a while to figure out where to go on the website."
College Senior,5,"I love it. The teachers are great! They are friendly, willing to take time to talk out problems with the students. They have a relationship with God, which really shows in how they interact with students from different backgrounds. It's a very intense program, lots of studying and quizzes, but the teachers make learning fun and always encourage us."
College Senior,5,"Campus safety does the best job they can in keeping the campus and their students safe. If needed we can call campus safety to walk us back to our dorm or car if we do not feel safe. They are frequently driving around campus, checking out buildings, and having small talk with people. They are pretty friendly!"
College Senior,5,"The head of our department does her best in choosing the right teachers for us, and so far we have had amazing teachers that are entertaining, caring, and make sure we are doing the best that we can. Everyone in the department is willing to help us in any way they can."
College Senior,5,"Loma Linda is more lenient on a few rules like with dorms and overnight leaves, and stricter on others like attending chapel compared to the last school I was at. All the rules are reasonable and make sense so I like their system of doing things."
College Senior,5,Loma Linda University is a very prestigious school. It's viewed very highly by doctors and they hire LLU students first over other graduates. We get really good learning and hands on experience here.
College Senior,5,Class size ranges from 24-30 students per teacher and a few teacher aides. We also get assistance from dental students and doctors who volunteer to work during the clinicals.
College Senior,5,"Everyone is sober on campus, so it's rare that any crimes are ever seen. The security guards are on duty during school hours. It's very safe."
College Senior,5,"It's a christian university with a  chapel on campus. Most students are seventh day adventist, however, christianity and other religions are existent. Drugs and alcohol are prohibited. The campus is very friendly and everyone is easily accepted regardless of their ethnic or economical background."
College Senior,5,"I love the Dental Hygiene program. Mon-Fri 8 am - 5 pm, all studying done during those times. Lots of opportunities, especially to get involved wight the chapel on campus."
College Freshman,5,I got a full scholarship to medical school. Apply early and do well in Undergraduate and on the MCAT.
College Freshman,5,im not really around the school so much to notice
College Freshman,5,im doing a couple of general education classes right now so i do alot at home
College Freshman,5,im not around sports soits hard to tell
College Freshman,5,Its hard to tell i dont see any actions of it going on
College Student,5,Not too sure about Loma Linda but at Oakwood it was strenuous but doable.
College Student,5,We dress modestly at both schools.
College Student,5,Both of my schools had good options
College Student,5,they have pretty good technological equipment
Niche User,4,no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Niche User,4,nono no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Senior,4,"Due to COVID-19 our classes were online. The professors worked very hard in making sure the content was still relevant and that we were able to learn everything we needed to, and feel as best prepared we could for upcoming quarter material."
Junior,4,"Classes online are good. It depends on the course you are taking. The religion courses are pretty simple. With the pandemic hitting, the professors were able to transition smoothly to online classes and they did well."
Junior,4,"Loma Linda so far has been a great school. Classes are small. Thus, you are able to form a relationship with your professors and also wiht your classmates. The only negative I can think of is that it is an expensive school."
Graduate Student,4,"Loma Linda is a private educational institution that is Seventh Day Adventist. Church is required for all students but it is not a place of discouragement. The teachers, administrators, etc all have one goal which is focused on patient care and their motto ""To Make Man Whole."" The food is decent, it is vegetarian so it limits the types of food allowed. Loma Linda University is in the heart of the Blue Zone and encourages health employees and students."
Junior,4,"Loma Linda is an amazing school for learning your chosen medical trade, with great invested teachers that implement multiple methods for different types of learning styles. However, you must be very organized and on top of everything because administration can be disorganized at times."
Senior,4,Very comfortable surroundings. The campus is well situated for a great college and academic experience.
Graduate Student,4,"It is a Seventh Adventist school and so they are very religious. But everyone is very nice. You are required to go to chapel once a week but if you have a job or a practicum during that time you will be excused. The campus is quite pretty but small. This school has an undergraduate program but it is very small. Most of the students on campus are graduate students. The school focus on health and encourage the vegetarian diet, no caffeine,  and no alcohol."
Senior,4,I wish LLU had a better gym. the weight room is so small. I feel like they do not maximize their space. It gets very crowded  since there's only 1 machine for  a certain type of workout.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I would estimate that at least half of the student body is either a minority or an international student which is excellent for diversity at this school. While most people identify as Christian they are still accepting of other Judeo-Christian beliefs and respect others' regardless of their sexual orientation, socio-economic background, or preference for eating meat."
Recent Alumnus,4,They're many different at this school
Recent Alumnus,4,"Campus security is constantly patrolling the area, but could be more at night and near the dorms at night."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus
College Freshman,4,I believe that Loma Linda properly prepares its students for their future career and employers recognize that.
College Freshman,4,I am not involved in athletics
College Freshman,4,pride themselves on wholistic learning and health
College Junior,4,I have never felt unsafe at LLU. Campus security is EVERYWHERE and you always feel like there are people around looking out for you. I also think being a medical institution it is less desirable of a place for someone to try to attack another person. There are medical personnel walking around 24/7 due to various hours of shifts at the hospital so I think it would be much harder for someone to get away with sexual assault or other crimes on this campus.
College Junior,4,"The value of a degree from this school is high, especially in the medical community. I know that LLU is world-renowned for their healthcare and I am proud to be a part of that. There are many job opportunities within my nursing program and they are always contacting us about volunteer opportunities! The advisors and teachers really seek to make us prepared for a career in nursing by placing high demands on us and seeing if we can deliver. Even though it has been a challenging academic experience, I truly believe that my time spent at LLU is invaluable and will help me to become the best nurse I can possibly be."
College Junior,4,"While LLU doesn't endorse sports like a university football team, they provide many opportunities for health and wellness improvement! The state-of-the-art gym, The Drayson Center, is provided to students for FREE with their tuition. It has olympic sized swimming pools, plenty of weight lifting and cardio equipment, group classes, and nutritionists and trainers on stand-by. It really is a great aspect of this university!"
College Senior,4,"Enthusiastic professors, students from around the globe, and a peaceful learning environment make Loma Linda great."
College Sophomore,4,The gym and fields are great!
College Sophomore,4,Loma Linda is great school for anyone interested in the healthcare field.
College Junior,4,"Attend this college if you are disciplined and ready to begin your career. It is crucial to be on time and representing yourself well, the colleges reputation will precede you and will make finding work easier after college if you play your cards right."
College Sophomore,4,"For the past 2 years of my college experience, I've attended a California State University school and several community colleges. My experiences in all of these schools have been great. Of course, I've learned so many subjects, but the experiences and skills that I've learned in these schools, have taught me a lot about life. I've learned how to manage my time better, how to prioritize what is important, and I've finally realized that procrastination is not the route I prefer- in school and life in general. The most valuable thing that I've experienced though, is finding myself maturing and becoming more independent. I understand now that college isn't just about receiving a diploma, it's also about being prepared for the real world and using what is learned in school to enhance the community and, quite possibly the world"
College Junior,4,I have a really supportive group of people
College Junior,4,The application  process was easy. The entry interview  was professional and relevant. Before applying look into financial aid options. I applied late and missed any opportunities  for addition aid outside  of loans.
College Senior,4,"There are many places to eat, but if you don't have a car you need to find friends that have cars. You can bike to the restaurants but I don't like biking on the roads. There is a lot of variety so it can be a little difficult to find a place if you don't care what you want to eat"
Recent Alumnus,4,"The alumni network is excellent at Loma Linda. The internship programs often lead to future employment opportunities also, I am told."
Recent Alumnus,4,I have had very few problems with financial aid. I received the aid I needed to attend school and then some. Any glitches have been resolved with an email or call.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Most of the students I interact with are working adults in the masters program, so our interests are similar."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My initial experience with admissions was pretty simple. However, this summer I switched from a certificate program to the MSW program and had some technical issues with admissions. These issues eventually got resolved but only after several calls to several different people. The initial interview process and application went very smoothly however. I felt valued and acknowledged throughout the process."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Since Loma Linda University is so close to San Bernardino, there are plenty of restaurants and activities nearby. Some parts of San Bernardino are not the safest though. However, with that said, if you are aware of your surroundings, you should be fine and have plenty of opportunities for fun."
College Junior,4,The city is still growing with a lot of new vendors still under construction. This city is very well known to the Seventh-Day Adventist community. Above all every one here is welcoming and friendly.
College Senior,4,"If you are an outdoorsy person and love the mountains and camping, the mountains aren't that far away. It is easy to find groups of people that also love the outdoors so the weekends are always fun. Bible studies at people's houses are great opportunities to get to know people outside of your major and outside of the University."
College Senior,4,Your roommate gets chosen by a staff based on your application and who fits best. They are really good at matching you up and you become friends with the roommate.
College Senior,4,"I love being in my program. The staff are really helpful and most workload is done during school hours, which is Monday through Friday 8 am to 5 pm. Dental Hygiene is become more in demand than it used to be, so there are more job opportunities for new graduates."
College Senior,4,"I like to study in the library, it's very nice and quiet. As far as registration process, it's all on the student portal. It will tell you what steps need to be taken beforehand."
College Senior,4,It's a christian university so drugs and alcohol are prohibited.
College Senior,4,The commute is very reasonable to dining areas. Lots of fast food and grocery stores.
College Senior,4,"Sports are very well respected, but students who are majoring in other fields tend to focus solely on that."
College Senior,4,"LLU is a diverse school in areas such as ethnic backgrounds, religion, etc. Everyone is respectful of one another and very friendly. Greek students are treated very well."
College Junior,4,security is very good and I feel safe
College Freshman,4,School of Medicine is great! Wonderful professors who care.
College Freshman,4,"Medical school is going to be hard wherever you go. So the coursework is a lot, but doable."
College Freshman,4,I'm a vegetarian and can find a plethora of tasty options.
College Freshman,4,Feel very safe. Still prefer to walk with a friend at night though.
College Freshman,4,Very nice and tropical. School has lots of things happening. Shopping centers close by.
College Senior,4,"I feel safe when on campus, but its always smart to walk with someone if parked far away"
College Senior,4,"Only difficult thing is that there are a lot of applicants, but they try to work with you as much as they can"
College Senior,4,"My program, is very busy and hard. I love everything i am learning, especially seeing patients!"
College Senior,4,"I have a very small class, and get one on one help from my instructors all the time. its a great learning experience for me!"
College Senior,4,"There is a great gym, and plenty of open green space to sit down and study!"
College Senior,4,The Spiritual aspect and small classes is what Make LOMA LINDA unique!
College Student,4,Everything at around Loma Linda. There are some thing to do around Oakwood but not everything.
College Student,4,"Student involvement and spirit is great, but the facilities need some work. The facilities are great at Loma Linda University."
College Student,4,there are not many greeks on campu
College Student,4,It has a great medical center
College Sophomore,4,There are many different places to choose from.
College Sophomore,4,"I hear it is great, close to school and convenient."
Recent Alumnus,2,The whole city is super Christian so it's difficult to find good bars/clubs nearby.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most people here are very conservative so even when there are parties, they are VERY lame."
College Sophomore,2,Some of the rotations students go through have preceptors that are mean to the student interns.
College Sophomore,2,Lectures were often time boring and it was vague as to what material we were going to see on the tests.
College Sophomore,2,During a terrorist attack nearby in San Bernardino we didn't even have the means to lock doors to the building we were in.
College Sophomore,2,"It's about like a jail cell, except you don't have the toilet in your room.  Terrible lighting."
College Junior,2,"Students are not a priority, sorry to say."
College Junior,2,"If you're thinking of going here for grad school, don't.  It is super expensive, I will be oweing over $100,000 in loans when I graduate.  I don't feel support from my committee members.  It's been very challenging."
College Junior,2,its not a sports school
College Sophomore,2,"Do not look to counselors or financial aid department for help! When trying to figure out scholarships to help pay for college neither had lists or knew where to find them. They are not allowed to help you with loans, basically just there to paper push. If you are trying to get financial advice or help, then go to another school, such as community colleges."
College Junior,2,We don't have sports teams here except for intramurals.
College Junior,2,Summers are 10000 degrees! Spring and fall are nice.
College Senior,2,The campus life of Loma Linda University is somewhat non existent. The school is very demanding of time when it comes to classes and study so many times students are forced to put a lot of their campus life aside and devout time to themselves. The student center consists of a cafeteria and a lot of Chairs to sit talk and study with your friends.
College Junior,2,All the food on campus is vegetarian but there are different flavors.
College Sophomore,2,"pretty good at this end of the campus, but other areas can be pretty tight."
College Sophomore,2,"Places in nearby redlands and san bernardino are good. loma linda itself has few eating places and it is all vegitarian. so, i am giving them a C grade."
College Junior,2,Vegetarian options only. No meal plan available for on campus students.
College Junior,2,"Loma Linda itself does not have a lot of events or shopping areas. Surrounding towns (less than 5 miles) have a plethora of shopping choices and activities to do during the day and good night life. If you do not plan to have your own transportation or a friend who does, this may not be the best option."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Good – Parking is free with permit.  I've never received a ticket, but I know they do not mess around with people who shirk the rules.  There is a single parking structure reserved for physicians.  The campus is not so large to necessitate having a car however it is far enough away you must really manage your time if you dorm.  If you do have a car there is very little parking. There is one main parking lot with is, though slightly, downhill from classrooms. There is a shuttle system that runs all day but the van/mini-buses do not hold many students.  You will need a car to complete your clinical assignments as many clinical locations are not on the main campus."
College Sophomore,2,"LLU is a Seventh Day Adventist school. I'm not Adventist, so I was not familiar with the fact that most are vegetarian and many are caffeine-free. This means that all food served on campus (And in the entire town, really....its highly concentrated with Adventists) is vegetarian. This also means that there are no coffee shops. In fact, they do not sell any drinks with caffeine in them, including regular coke products. They only sell baked chips (not regular), and very few other alternative snacks to the meals offered. I ate 4 or 5 times on campus and really tried to give it a try, but the food that's served isn't the cheapest (meals about $7), and honestly, I just couldn't get used to the taste or texture of veggie and fake-cheese ""burgers."" Thankfully, there is a new shopping complex about a mile and half away from campus that has a Panera Bread, Chipotle, Starbucks,  IN n Out, and a few other places to grab lunch. Unfortunately for me, it requires driving off campus and paying for a lunch out."
Recent Alumnus,1,There's no party life at school. You have to go off campus to party.
Recent Alumnus,1,There's a strict no partying policy on campus
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life.  Go somewhere else if you want it.
College Senior,1,"Parking is free at Loma Linda, which keeps it from getting a D in my book.  What good is free parking when you can't find anywhere to park!  There are 2 main parking places for students: the parking structure (which I think is reserved for Med Students, hospital personnel, etc...), and then Lot X.  Lot X would be just fine (even though it can be a BIG HIKE to get to classes for many students), but Loma Linda uses this parking spot for event parking too!  Whenever there is a conference or anything like that, Lot X is where they direct the traffic, which means there is hardly any parking at all for students.  Furthermore, it seems like they're ALWAYS hosting some sort of event which translates to NO PARKING!  In summary, the parking situation is bad.  I have had driven for 2 HOURS straight to find a parking spot.  This meant I was horribly late for class.... It's just bad...."
College Senior,1,Parking is ridiculous. Not enough parking for students and employees. Have to get there really early to make sure a spot is available.
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is a nightmare. If you do not get there before 7:30am you will have to park in the furthest parking lot.
College Junior,1,"I came from a Big 10 school where athletics were a big deal and most students were involved in intramurals and spectating if they were not student athletes themselves. At Loma Linda, the focus is Health Sciences, education and faith. Athletics are not a high priority. If this is something you value, you won't be satisfied with LLU. As far as workout facilities are concerned, the Drayson Center has a ton of equipment, different classes, tracks, soccer fields, indoor/outdoor pools, sauna, racketball and more. For personal fitness, I couldn't ask for more resources."
College Junior,1,The area is an environment conscious zone and this means that a person may have to travel out of the area in order to attend worldly activities.
College Sophomore,1,"Very unhelpful.  Very expensive school.  School offered me a 250$/quarter scholarship...tuition is 30,000$/year.  My financial aid officer is unfriendly."
College Sophomore,1,"Pretty Strict – In the dorms, or really in the majority of the student community, there is NO drinking. Adventists are, for the most part, a relatively conservative bunch. No drugs, alcohol, or members of the opposite sex allowed in the dorms. For the most part, students and teachers dresses modestly and acts modestly as well. Since dorms are not co-ed, each has a little lobby in which the other gender is allowed, but other than that, no admittance. There are RA's at most entrances who enforce this. Also, meat is not allowed in the dorms at all, since the school wants to respect vegetarians. You are not allowed to bring in or prepare meat in the dorms, and if you do bring something in that smells like meat (ie, a burger), you'll be written up. They take it pretty seriously, so enjoy your meat outdoors : )"
College Sophomore,1,"Time Machine – The facilities for my department (Allied Health) are sooo outdated. It was actually a little bit shocking to me when I walked in on my first day. The Centennial Complex where I had my anatomy course was amazing- new, clean, functional. However, the place where I now take classes for my department is totally a different story. Its a bit like walking through a time machine, Loma Linda itself is a touch 1970s themed, but my building is pretty bad. Its old, dingy, and has really horrible classroom layouts and acoustics. I have 55 students in my cohort, and we all cram into the same room for every class, which is so long and narrow that there are about 12 rows of students since only 5 fit across each row. If you're not in one of the front 5 rows, it makes it almost impossible to see the board and very difficult to hear. I spent my last class freezing to death because its the school's policy to use the heat only when the temperature drops below 50 degrees, so I spent three hours shivering with my classmates in a room that 52 degrees. Also, LLU does not have wireless internet....which really surprised me. Even in the dorms and libraries, you have to use the old school wire hook-ups to get internet, and at best its average speed. Dorms are alright, the kitchens don't have operating appliances so its pretty much impossible to cook, and its just your average cinder block interior. The exterior aesthetics of the school are great, lots of nice looking buildings with beautiful landscapes. But its the inside that is pretty bad. Its actually a little funny, but also depressing when you have to go there almost every day : ("
College Junior,1,"As far as I can tell, there is none. If you're Christian, you're bound to find a group that meets for bible study or for fellowship, but very few parties exist unless you create one."

Alum,5,"Awesome teachers who really took the time to work with me and who were very available and involved! And walking up that hill every day was a workout, haha. I had some of my most fascinating English classes here."
Sophomore,5,"Framingham State University has such beautiful campus and is easy to find your way around. the learning environment in the classrooms is very interactive, the professors makes sure you are understanding the material they are teaching. 
They want the  best outcome for you."
Junior,5,"Framingham State University was the best choice i could have ever made! I remembering touring the campus and immediately feeling like this was the right fit for me. The resources and tools to succeed are numerous, iâ€™m so grateful for all the support that i have gotten from my professors and the university itself. Definitely consider it"
Niche User,5,"Very incredible staff and vibe, people are amazing great school overall in all aspects truly an amazing school, party scene is A+"
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Framingham State University was outstanding! I was traveling all the way across the country from Arizona, and everyone made me feel at home. All of the advisors are extremely helpful, while majority of the professors are amazing. The community as a whole is always upbeat and working on campus activities. Sports games are always fun to attend. Lastly, the only thing I would truly change is to have some more options for food. Overall, I am extremely happy with the decision I made for college!!"
Sophomore,5,"I love how my college is so inclusive and there are so many opportunities to be involved there. My college has so many opportunities to make friends, to get help in classes, and to be like a second home for me. This university has amazing classes that will help me to further my intended career."
Junior,5,I love Framingham State because of the academics and the professors. The professors really care about providing you with experience in your major and preparing you for the work force.
Graduate Student,5,I really enjoy being a part of the Framingham State University Community. The Professors are engaging and love to help students to help them succeed in anyway they can. The school is easy to maneuver.
Senior,5,Framingham State is a welcoming inclusive college for all students. They have many amazing resources to help students be ready to enter the work force once graduated.
Sophomore,5,"Great school, but the food from the dining hall is not that great. Its good for coffee and breakfast but lunch and dinner are genuinely not that great. All around its an average school, but the friend you will make and the education you will receive will be unmatched. Sincerely, a 2nd year student."
Alum,5,"Framingham State University was the best educational decision I have made. Framingham State has small class sizes and faculty that work very hard to help their students succeed. Framingham State is a dry and smoke-free campus, which I like. The library is open late year-round to allow students to have a quiet place to work. The only issue that I had with Framingham State, was the Career Center. I once went to the Career Center to get help with my resume and finding a job. They were very unhelpful and only provided me with sites where I MIGHT be able to find a job. I learned that Framingham State focuses mainly on Business and Teaching jobs and is not well versed in Wildlife Biology/Ecology jobs. I think that the Career Center should help every student find a job. I highly recommend Framingham State for anyone looking for a State school that will help prepare you for the ""real world."""
Freshman,5,"I love how small the campus is, and the welcoming environment. I would not particularly change anything."
Niche User,5,Framingham State University is a great school where I felt very comfortable. The environment is good and is is in an amazing location. What stood out to me most is the education program. I comes with many opportunities.
Sophomore,5,Framingham State University is a great school the teachers are absolutely helpful and they are a lot of resources to help with your education
Senior,5,"As a commuter student, FSU has everything I could want. It's close to my home and has a vibrant community of residents and commuters. The campus is small and friendly, and has all the amenities we would require. There are many opportunities for extracurriculars and it's easy to fit right in here."
Freshman,5,The welcoming community that they have makes you feel like it isn't  first year at Framingham. At orientation you spend the whole day with other students learning about the campus and getting a feel about what it will be like your first year.
Freshman,5,I am a new student that just transferred here from Massasoit Community College. Overall my experience here has been great. My professors are amazing and they care. They want you to succeed and I am one that is all about education. I am happy I got accepted into this school. This school is great :)
Senior,5,I have really enjoyed my experience at Framingham State University thus far. I transferred from a larger university and could not be happier with my decision. The class sizes are great and the professor's really make an effort to get to know all their students and help them succeed.
Freshman,5,"Framingham State University  is an all-inclusive, diverse community. I personally have had nothing but positive experiences there. They accepted my transfer credits and dealt quickly with my decision to become a resident student instead of a commuter student. The classes are small, the environment is clean, and the people are always willing to help."
College Freshman,5,"Its is very good, the school is also small which is another good thing"
College Sophomore,5,"At Framingham State, the professors are friendly, and always willing to help you with subjects you don't understand, registration is easy, and though the workload is hard, the Center for Academic Success and Achievement is always there to help you."
College Sophomore,5,"At Framingham State, you can find students from every background imaginable, and there is little, if any, strife to be found."
College Sophomore,5,"In my first year at Framingham State, I never saw a single instance of drug/alcohol use."
College Freshman,5,Framingham State University has to be one of the safest colleges in the state of Massachusetts.
College Sophomore,5,"The career center is extremely active on campus, alerting students with information in jobs, careers, and work study."
College Sophomore,5,"There is a level of community that cannot be matched by commuting, although some resident have issues amongst themselves there is still a level of profound respect."
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are very safe, we have SDA's and you have to sign people in who don't live in the building. Since I've been here I've only heard of one incident of sexual assault, and  it was at a party at a sports house off campus. The first thing they have you do at orientation is put campus police in your phone. IT's a very safe campus."
College Sophomore,5,"on route nine lots of restaurants ,grocery stores, and fast food"
College Junior,5,i  have gotten help with paper work!
College Freshman,5,"The area around my school is awesome. There are malls, stores, attractions, nature things, shops, and fun activities."
College Junior,5,To be accepted into the Studio Art program I had to undergo a Portfolio review that consisted of a 3 hour still life and then a conversation with professors in the department about my work with examples of my work. The Art department is a small department and they expect a lot from the small amount of students they do have. Practice a lot and have a portfolio with varied examples of work.
College Junior,5,"not taught by ta's, you have real professors. professors are helpful. biology department is very difficult on you, but really great."
College Sophomore,5,There is so much to do off campus.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are extremely down to earth
College Sophomore,5,Lots of girls.  stuck up but nice to look at
College Student,5,does not affect the campus
College Student,5,Very spirited and pride is a big part of the school
College Sophomore,5,"Framingham State is very diverse, allowing everyone to feel safe and comfortable in the classrooms, the dorms, the eating areas and every other are in this campus. I have never felt isolated or alone in this college."
College Sophomore,5,"The psychology department is incredible. I enjoy all of the prerequisites that are needed to be completed before graduation and the professors are intelligent beyond belief, quick-witted and show that they honestly care for their students. The workload is intense but because of their organized lesson plans that help everyone stay together and never fall behind, it is not impossible."
College Sophomore,5,SO many places off campus to eat
Sophomore,4,"Online learning last semester was understandably difficult for the teachers to adjust to. Overall, I think they did a good job, although some teachers adjusted better than others."
Sophomore,4,I like the small campus and the friendly people. I would like to see the price of parking change and see more flexibility in the dining hall's hours
Graduate Student,4,"I did not do clubs or sports here, since I was an older undergrad who commuted. I enjoyed most of my classes, except for some required core courses I felt were pointless and a waste of money. I graduated here in May and it took over 2 months for my degree to come in the mail."
Graduate Student,4,"I took classes online for undergrad in the winter and spring. It took a lot of time and effort to access the remote learning after corona hit. School was delayed for a week, which also put off graduation."
Sophomore,4,"Great professors, great resources, and great education when taken seriously. On the other hand, there is not much to do around campus in the local area, and it is not very big."
Sophomore,4,Framingham State university is a very good and diverse school. The enviroment is very good. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming especially to  freshman who are just coming in and trying to make new friends. The classes are very intense but the proffesors o make it where it is very possible to get help in every possible way to be able to pass their classes.
Junior,4,"The education at FSU is pretty good. You get what you paid for, and there's a big library so if you want to learn more you can. I spend most of my days in the library researching new things. Student life is alright, there is not a lot of shops around besides Natick Mall."
Freshman,4,"I will be incoming this year as a freshman. To date I have had a few questions and all were helpful.
I look forward tp the Fall !"
Alum,4,They have a very good support system especially like a student like me that will be majoring in Biology.
Sophomore,4,"I wish there was more student life on campus during the weekends. But since its a small school, classes are smaller in size, so you can build great connections with other students and professors."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy how small the campus is.  It feels like a typical college campus.  The building are nice but, the older ones could use some updating."
Senior,4,"Great location. Frandly stuff. Some professors are great, but not all. Great biology- chemistry department. Variety of clubs available to participate in."
Junior,4,"Framingham State is a great place that offers an array of activities, clubs, sports, and many more opportunities for engaging with students and teachers. After my first semester, I can say that I truly feel apart of our Framily which is what we are called here at FSU. It is very diverse and everyone accepts each other for who they are. The professors are caring and helpful and truly want us to succeed, if you ask for help they will do whatever they can. FSU has an awesome disability center and great tutors. One thing I would like to see changed at FSU would be the class selections and availability."
Sophomore,4,The diversity here is incredible. There are also so many opportunities to be involved on campus. Finding a group of friends was hard but once you find one you are guaranteed to have some fun.
Senior,4,The campus is small which is great because you can get to your buildings quickly. The cafeteria offers great fokd at a good price. The staff are mostly cool and understanding. If you dont live on campus it can be a commute and on campus jobs residential students gave priority which i think it should be ooen to the best candidates.
Sophomore,4,"FSU provides an engaging, yet quaint environment. An extremely diverse campus provides connections with people from all different backgrounds. The campus's small size limits its ability to host large events, but it still manages to fit in a surprising amount of gatherings in just one semester. The campus food really depends on the day, Sodexo can be a coin flip!"
Sophomore,4,"The school is pretty affordable. Does its job as an institution, providing what is needed. However its a bit dry and small."
Senior,4,I like how engaging the teachers are with their students. They really do care about our education and our future. One thing that I would like to see change is the availability of more summer classes. Thery are sometimes limited and I would like a wider selection.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the small classes and getting to know my professors. CASA is very helpful for those students who are struggling with their courses. 

In the science department I do wish there had been more hands on opportunities to work in the laboratory and doing outside class projects. Volunteer opportunities through the school is only once a month on a Saturday- tough for a working student. Commuters are not as informed about school events, but I do believe it has gotten better since I was there."
Sophomore,4,"It is a small campus, with not a lot of diversity, but it is in a great area. The teachers, for the most part, are good. There are new dorms, which are very nice. It's nice to be able to get to all  of your classes quickly."
Junior,4,I like that Framingham state university provides many inclusive opportunities. The academics are handled well with great staff.
Junior,4,As a transfer student I found Framingham State University to be a welcoming place that always allows for open communication between the students and faculty.
Freshman,4,"Framingham State University has a very welcoming and beautiful campus. I couldn't ask for more. Despite the recent events on campus regarding race, they have gone above and beyond to meet the needs of students and listen to their thoughts on the incidents. It is a diverse campus and we accept the diversity with open arms."
Sophomore,4,I like the size of it itâ€™s not too big everything is close but the food could be better and the parties
Sophomore,4,"I like Framingham State University. It's a small school, so you see familiar faces every day, the class sizes are small, and the campus is nice. The classes are interesting and most of the teachers are nice. It's a great school."
Senior,4,"Framingham State University is situated on Route 9 in Framingham with convenient access to both the major expressway from Worcester, and the mass-pike, Interstate 90. The school itself is diverse and the campus is beautiful. The faculty and administration actually take the time to reach out to you if you put in the effort. Hard work does not go unrecognized, and the different department heads bring their own concepts to the table, bringing a more intimate knowledge to the subject making the classroom less formal and more realistic."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great university. It's close to supermarkets, convenience stores, shopping malls, and only 30 mins from Boston. The classes are great, but I do wish their were more options for class hours."
Junior,4,"Framingham has been a great experience so far.  It truly has the cutest campus community, where you really feel at home.  At the same time, the weekends are extremely quiet because of the large commuter population."
Freshman,4,"First of all, being a freshman, I do not know all there is to know about FSU, but so far, I know I made the right choice to take my education to FSU. It has been a great experience so far. The professors, overall, seem dedicated to the students, pushing them to succeed. One of my favorite things about school is the fitness classes that are offered; they are exciting and different all the while calorie burning. The food is also great at school, there is a great variety of options that are healthy and tasty. The only thing I can think that could improve the school, would be a food or snack bar in each dorm, if a student does not have time to eat at the dining hall, if the dining hall is closed, or the weather is difficult to walk in."
Junior,4,"I like Framingham State University. This school is a small school with mostly commuters. I like the transportation systems from the parking lots to the school, it is very convenient. I also like the professors at this university, they are all very accommodating and they really try their best so you can succeed. The campus is all relatively close together too, the farthest walk you have is five minutes, which isn't bad. The dining hall also accommodates for a lot of different health choices."
Sophomore,4,"My college experience so far has been one of self discovery, long night of hard work, classes that have required all of my skills and boggled my mind, and truly wonderful people that I will never forget."
Senior,4,"As a science student I can not speak highly enough about the professors. Each professor I have had in the Chemistry and Food Science department is outstanding. They all have your best interest in mind, and will do all that they can to see you succeed. Because the campus is small, you are not a number. Each professor gets to know who you are and how to help you. 
Framingham State University is continually growing. One thing I would like to see is more classes and more resources for the Food Science Students."
Junior,4,I like that it is a small college which is easy to make friends and community there. people are really friendly. three classes to be full student so it is pretty easy. I wish if there are more diversity though.
College Senior,4,"I always feel very safe on campus, I know without a doubt that the campus police are there to protect and assure our safety God forbid anything may happen. I have never had an issue the security on campus."
College Senior,4,"We do appreciate our sports at FSU. I myself was one of a four leaders in a marketing campaign sponsored by my school to provide awareness of sports of our choosing that we believed could rally a bigger audience. Our campaign was also supported by local business and bigger organizations such as Google, Inc who provided many helpful tips on how to successfully run our campaign. All in all we were quite successful in bringing students as well as the public to come and enjoy our teams who try so hard to do the best they can for our school!"
College Junior,4,Campus police and health services help a lot with these problems.
College Junior,4,I have always lived in a residence hall. I think they are good for what you are paying for.
College Freshman,4,"My experience at Framingham State University so far was fun, informative, exhausting, and totally unforgettable."
College Freshman,4,"Although I've got a long way to go before I can actually start looking for a job in my major, I feel that my career prospects are extremely positive, and a degree from FSU will prove to be extremely valuable."
College Freshman,4,"Housing at Framingham State University is affordable, comfortable, and is full of friendly neighbors and roommates."
College Freshman,4,"At Framingham State University, athletics comprise a large part of campus life, and there are facilities geared toward both athletes and conventional students alike."
College Freshman,4,"As the first man in my family to attend college, I don't have a given standard to compare my college experience thus far to. Having said that, I feel that my experience so far at Framingham State University was very positive, even if the class were slightly more challenging than I would have liked."
College Freshman,4,"Little to no campus crime, I feel very safe on campus"
College Freshman,4,"Courses are easy, professors are fine, class sizes are small"
College Freshman,4,"It's not Harvard, but a degree's a degree"
College Freshman,4,Good teams. Good facilities. #GoRams
College Sophomore,4,"Campus police are all around, if you ever feel unsafe you can call a police escort to take you wher you need to be. Campus is littered with emergency call buttons and is generally well lit at night."
College Sophomore,4,I have made an ubundance of new friends as well as challenged my intellect.
College Freshman,4,Framingham being a small campus I do feel it is very safe. Campus are always around at night outside and you never feel unsafe. That is a positive thing about this campus.
College Freshman,4,Everyone's pretty accepting and it's not very noticeable people just do what they do
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe here on campus. The campus police are always around and the people who go here don't really commit any crime
College Freshman,4,There are many oppritunites for internships on campus and the career services are great.
College Freshman,4,The professors here are very intelligent and care greatly about the success of their student. The classes are smaller so students really are able to develope relationships with professors and have one on one time if needed. There is a heat variety of courses to take and they are all very interesting as well.
College Freshman,4,"Framingham state has a very great environment, it feels like home. The people are kind, food is great, and the education is top notch!"
College Sophomore,4,Its pretty safe on campus. Campus police monitoremost things and make sure its safe for us
College Sophomore,4,I really like my classes and the way they are taught because it helps me learn better.
College Sophomore,4,The career service is great and helps students a lot.
College Sophomore,4,It has a really good fashion program
College Freshman,4,"I've had pretty good luck with my courses and professors. The classes are relatively small, and professors are flexible."
College Freshman,4,"The rooms are fairly big, as are the closets. Unless you luck out and get AC they are VERY hot in the summer months. The RA's are great, they run programs every month to get people involved. People are friendly. No dorm is more than a 10 minute walk to anything else on campus."
Freshman,2,"You either get a teacher willing to learn, or a teacher without the desire to  figure out zoom meetings, and they just end up posting assignments"
Freshman,2,The administration clearly does not care about how the students feel and what they need to thrive on campus. All they care about is making money however many students do not return. There is also not a wide variety of majors on a very small campus. I would not be surprised if the school were to run out of money and have to close. Many students go home on weekends so it can become very boring. The food is subpar to say the least and the on campus restaurants are overpriced for small portions of food. I am transferring after my first year and feel like I wasted both my time and money
Senior,2,"If you plan to major in psychology, this place will not challenge you or give you decent professors. You will often get the kind of professors who read directly from the textbook chapter you were assigned to read for homework after the previous class. However, the biology, nutrition,  and creative arts courses I took were fairly fulfilling and taught by competent, engaging professors. In terms of its psychology program, this university does not challenge you or prepare you for any kind of graduate school or doctoral program. That being said, based on the courses I've taken in Biology and Nutrition, and from friends who have majored in these fields at Framingham State, the Biology and Nutrition departments deliver a fairly solid education for the the reasonable price the school charges per course."
College Freshman,2,The halls have mandatory bag checks all day everyday. The RAs were try hards.
College Freshman,2,This school seemed aesthetically beautiful when I first went on the tour. If only I had known that it would be only aesthetically pleasing without any content within it. Although my opinion may be biased as I just transferred out due to dissatisfaction with the campus. The social/party scene is overwhelmingly depressing with any sports house party being shut down within a hour and half of it beginning. The vast majority of students leave on the weekend to go back to their houses as many are from Boston or eastern mass. The school food is very repetitive as expected and there are many days were you will find yourself resorting to eating a salad to stop the onslaught of grubby food. Half of the school is commuters and will make parking awful for any residents. Athletics are fun to go to but do not expect them to be rowdy or fun. The school does have some good points such as close relationships with professors and a brand new Hemingway Annex hall that is very beautiful. I would not return to this school.
College Freshman,2,I have not received a degree yet bur if i had to guess getting a job with a Framingham degree is no where nearly as good as a school like Umass Amherst.
College Freshman,2,Overall my experience has not been so great. Most professors are helpful but others are not so much. I really think this school needs to focus more on their undeclared students when it comes to advising because my experience was not helpful at all. Basically if you do not come into this school with a major you are going to have a tough time graduating within in four years. That is why most students make it a joke saying this is a 5 or 6 year plan school. It is even tough to graduate on time with your intended major as a freshmen. Academically I am not satisfied.
College Freshman,2,Our school is good at the sports they play but there is no school spirit and barely anyone attends the games.
College Freshman,2,it could be a whole lot more convenient for students
Recent Alumnus,2,It's mostly federal aid as loans that you will receive when you apply for financial aid.
Recent Alumnus,2,"This is primarily a commuter school, therefore on the weekends, there is a lack of party life."
College Junior,2,i heard is hard to find an internshipâ€¦
College Junior,2,i have no idea where  to go for a party oe meet someone!!
College Freshman,2,"My school is in Framingham so around our school is not the best kinds of housing, because its scary and sketchy."
College Freshman,2,The area surrounding the school is pretty boring. There is a popular shopping mall and many places to shop but that's only if you have the money to do so. There are some nice restaurants but having money also applies. Route 9 is busy and a lot of traffic some of the time. Boston is about a half an hour away but only accessible with a car. There is really nothing else to do besides if there is a house party off campus.
College Junior,2,sometimes it feels like financial aid doesn't even want to help you.
College Junior,2,"Because it is New England, the snow storms make it hard to get around campus since it is very hilly and gets slippery"
College Student,2,More fast food then anything else
College Sophomore,2,The campus police spend too much time giving out tickets rather then protecting college students from rape and other issues.
College Sophomore,2,"it is a hilly campus, so whenever there is snow or ice, walking and driving are very difficult."
College Junior,2,Really shitty neighborhoods. Not really anywhere within safe walking distance. The college is essentially situated right on the highway.
College Senior,2,The computers run extremely slow and not really reliable when you are in a rush. The printers sometimes either do not work in some places or also run slowly. The printers in residence halls do not work or there isn't one to begin with. The wifi is slow a lot & I've been kicked offline many times.
College Sophomore,2,The off-campus houses tend to be dirty and somewhat rundown and still expensive. 
College Junior,2,"It's not really FSU's fault, but I can't get the financial aid that I need because I cannot file the FAFSA as an independent even though I AM independent. It makes it very difficult to afford school, obviously."
College Junior,2,"It is VERY difficult to find a spot in the morning, even if you show up extra early."
College Freshman,2,i do not like the local atmosphere
College Freshman,2,parking on campus if okay
College Freshman,2,off campus living can be hard to find
College Freshman,2,the athletics are not that important
College Freshman,2,"Many people are commuters, and therefore go home at night and on the weekends. For those who dorm at FSU, I hear there are several house parties on or around campus on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. "
College Freshman,2,"Student life on campus is average. Not many people stay on the weekends but there are places offered to those who do stay. They offer a game room, student center, library and student lounge. "
College Freshman,2,Framingham State is a dry campus and the rules if caught drinking are very strict and enforced. Framingham State wants its students to be focused on school work more than drinking and drugs.
College Freshman,2,"Framingham State is a dry campus, even for those who are over 21. It is also a tobacco free campus. Obviously the students want to have to fun time in college and are going to drink no matter what, I don't see peer pressure from others. I do see people smoking but not on campus grounds and alcohol is limited in visibility as well. The policy of no alcohol on campus is very strict and the consequences can be harsh and applied as policy states."
College Freshman,2,"As a student I am undeclared right now, taking some of the general core classes. "
College Freshman,2,"Framingham State has many fields of majors to chose from. All the professors I have heard about were very friendly with a few not so friendly ones. The professors are generally all very flexible, easy to talk to and understanding and want to have a connection with each of their students. The registration process can be chaotic but other than that its ok so far."
College Freshman,2,"Weather affects campus liveliness. The colder weather many people  tend to stay inside as much as possible. In the warmer weather lots of people are outside walking around, enjoying the nice weather, reading looks in the grass, soaking up the sun before class."
College Freshman,2,"The computers at Framingham State are used by almost every student. The school requires students to have one and they offer a special type that you can buy from the school that has all the programs you will need for your time there already downloaded on the computer for you and they also guarantee a 4 year warrantee. The network reliability is great, some places it is fast than others but overall you can get a connection where ever you are on campus which is very convenient. The printing can be fixed up a bit by offering more printers to be printed too instead of having to wait around to print at times"
College Freshman,2,Framingham State is in a rather odd location. It is very close to route 9 and the Natick mall which appeals to most people looking at the school. While on campus I don't see that many activities going on as I had planned to see. The campus police are around 24/7 so I feel very safe there. 
College Freshman,2,Athletics at Framingham State play a part in the school but they don't seem to be that big of  a deal. It doesn't seem like people are interested to much in them and their school spirit for sports is rather dull. I know of a few students who are involved in sports and they love it. The athletic teams play with all their heart in every game and they are great to watch with some friends.
College Freshman,2,"Off campus dining at Framingham is easily accessible because the school is right on route 9 and is 5 minutes from the Natick Mall. The cost depends on the place you go to, but overall the price is average. The food places are very convenient and some places offer student discounts. I would recommend trying California Pizza. "
College Junior,2,Very inconvenient with students sometimes having to park off campus down the side of rt nine
College Sophomore,2,"From what i know, the small size of the campus does not allow for much greek life. I don't even know if there are any greeks on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Typical New England weather, when it snows...it snows, really hard. It gets a little dangerous walking back and forth to class and to the dorms, because everything are basically located on hills. And once the weather starts getting nice,everybody hangs out outside."
College Freshman,2,"My most vivid experience with FSU scholarships is a rather backwards policy regarding the Honors Scholarship. If your grades dip-- even if it is your first semester with no time to redeem yourself-- you lose the scholarship, even if you remain in the program but are put on probation, and you can never get the scholarship back. This makes no sense. Wouldn't the chance to regain a substantial scholarship be a massive incentive for improved performance? FSU needs to reevaluate."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is phenomenal at first, there is variety but after maybe the 3rd weed you'd had everything already. Ordering out is VERY popular theres Dominoes, Wings Over Framingham, Joy Luck, wonderful places to eat out."
College Freshman,2,"You have your city people, and western MA people. Not so diverse."
College Sophomore,2,You need a laptop. IT doesn't know much about Macs. There are not many computer labs and you can only print 350 pages a semester. The wireless is HORRIBLE. You're better living off campus or using the internet elsewhere. If you live on campus make sure to bring an Ethernet cord!
College Freshman,2,"At Framingham they are football boys, basketball boys, hockey boys, and well the other non athletes. My main focus is mainly towards the football boys because they're quite attractive. The girls are mainly sweet, pretty American girls. There is not that much diversity at FSU, but everyone is pretty nice towards each other."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much to do off campus. This school is more of a commuter school. I like it here because my kind of fun is just hanging with freinds. However those who are in too huge partys or fun things to do there isn't much here except for a mall.
College Sophomore,2,"There is parking, but its very expensive. I believe for commuter students it is terrible to find parking. I think they need to reduce the price for resident students and make more spaces available for commuter students."
College Sophomore,2,"There are 3 parking lots on campus. One for the commuters that is down a hill from the main buildings. One for residents that is far down the street and you can either walk 10 minutes to get there or wait forever for the shuttle to take you there. And the last one is in the middle of Framingham, far away from campus, and the only way to get ther is to wait for the shuttle. The last is just for residents but everyone hates to park there because it is so far away and it takes forever to get there. Also for visitors of residents they have to park in either the commuter lot down the hill or the far lot down the street. It is a long walk uphill or a really long walk from way down the street."
College Sophomore,2,At FSU we don't have any sororities and I guess the sports houses could be consitered frats but we do not refer to them as that. Thats where parties happen on weekends but its not a huge deal if you do or do not go to them.
College Junior,2,"There are some cool guys at Framingham but it's been hard to find them. A lot of them are idiots. Since there are so many more girls than guys at FSU, the guys have their pick. They are immature boys."
College Freshman,2,"I Knew All the Black Kids by the 2Nd Week â€“ Theres a very small percentage of African American students in our school. By the 2nd week I had seen and met all of them. There are alot of white kids in the school but I dont mind them ALOT of them are really nice and really welcoming, while others aren't so much. They either feel threatened by us or are just plain rude to us. its really sad."
College Freshman,2,"There Are Options â€“ There are shuttles that go to the different parking lots. They just recently added a shuttle that will bring you to the local shopping plaza and the Natick Mall. They have kinda weird hours but at least they finally got one. Also there is a public bus that comes through campus, and i have heard its cheap. Theres also a few cab companies."
College Freshman,2,All Depends â€“ There is a lot of marijuana. Since its a dry campus a lot of people sneak booze in and get away with it. There are a lot of dorm parties and smoking in the room. But for the most part its just a typical college. A lot of people will just walk off campus and go smoke. Plus theres a good amount of party houses nearby so people will walk to those and just come back pretty drunk. All really depends on what your into. Theres a little bit of everything.
College Sophomore,2,There are a few scholarships are available. but most of them are very specific to majors.
College Freshman,2,"The only time I have a problem with the weather is when it's raining or snowing. The reason being that from where I have to park to campus it's a long walk. Even though they have a shuttle, they don't run as often as I would like them too."
College Freshman,2,Kinda Sucks â€“ You have to pay to get a computer form the school it has warranty for anything including breaking it or water damage anything BUT if you plan to get work done get an internet cord or wait till 2am when everyone starts to fall asleep cause the wireless gets pretty crappy.
College Junior,2,"Plan on Walking â€“ if you commute, you will be walking a good distance to get anywhere from the parking lots"
Alum,1,"I did not take classes online, I was a full time on campus student. And they still treated me horribly."
Alum,1,"NEVER come to FSU if you are using VA benefits. They messed up my accounts so bad, resulting in my credit being affected for 7 YEARS. They refuse to take any responsibility - they are the absolute worst at customer service and communication. I am so disappointed that any university would treat someone like this. Please save yourself the hassle and go anywhere else. I went on to receive a graduate degree at another University and will never donate to FSU or recommend the institution."
Senior,1,"Worst school ever , they are all about money money money and when they need to give your money they take their sweet time I have been waiting for my refund money for months now and the semester is over and they still haven't given me my money. If you are physically disable don't go here way to many hills and no accommodations. This college is a rip off and very unorganized.  Way to experience for a university they really don't help you at all and they are cold hearted. I asked the Dean and the financial aid about a scholarship and they act like they never heard of the scholarship and its on their website DONT ATTEND THIS COLLEGE TAKE ALL THESE REVIEWS AS A WARNING TO RUN THE OTHER WAY"
Niche User,1,"Bad things you understand on last year of graduation....when you transfer from other college and spend 2 years of getting GPA more than 3, move to FSU, you didn't know start with GPA =0 or start like a freshman...
Finally on the tirth years you think I will be graduate and come to the big surprise ---your grade is below 2, why, because all transferred courses from MASSbAY Community  college  are just TR, without grade's. This cost you -16000 $ and spend another 2 years to pay again 20k for make your GPA raise to 3...Only Chemistry I and II left to finish and because of that You must have C or A, B (D is not counted) . Non matriculated student for one year (mean you are bad student with low GPA). But reason to have that is Because they do not transfer your good GPA from the college before. Add the professors which do not qualified enough to be successful student finish the bachelor degree for 3 years. The staff working in registrar are also low qualified."
Freshman,1,"Everyone leaves on weekends, making student life boring, and the prices for the dorms are WAY too expensive, along with everything else. Financial Aid gave me less than $2,000, and lost my parents 1040 forms. Thanks to their poor office, I went into debt collection for not being able to pay $8,000 out of pocket. If you have financial troubles, don't even come here, they don't even help and are cold and rude."
Freshman,1,"Framingham State is a very racist school. There has been several racist incidents in the past month, and no action has been taking regarding this. There has been complaints of african American students having racist writing on their dorm door, and also had pictures to prove. Framingham has done nothing! And they do not care about their students. In addition, this school is a rip off. You pay too much money and they barely give you money for Financial aid. Overall this school sucks, and itâ€™s honestly a waste of money and time. Donâ€™t go here."
Sophomore,1,"To be completely honest if I could give this school 0 stars I would. It is a joke, you think you're at college....HA, this school is a place that weird people can all get together and hate their lives as a group. The professors are maybe the one positive thing about the school other than the baseball team I play on. The campus is small, the people are so weird, no one wants to party. Actually let me say this, there are no parties. every party we have is shut down within the hour of its start. I partied more when I was 15. If you want to go to a school that will make you hate your life and make you want to go to an actual college, than apply right now. If you actually want to experience college, you have a better chance of drinking a beer in your basement and inviting a girl over. Please for the love of partying and being young, do not come to this school!!!!!"
College Junior,1,We do not have any Greek life.
College Freshman,1,Framingham state is a commuter school that is topped off with an overwhelming amount of suitcase students. Maybe if everyone stayed this school could actually feel like a community.
College Freshman,1,We don't have it but we should. It would bring a lot of people together but then again could tear people apart too
College Freshman,1,i really could use it and i am still not getting it
College Freshman,1,We don't have a Greek like at Framingham State University
College Freshman,1,"i hate the school that i go too, i would not go here again"
College Freshman,1,student life is awful because everyone always leaves
College Freshman,1,they did not give me any scholarships 
College Freshman,1,the guys on campus are not good
College Freshman,1,nightlife on campus if awful
College Freshman,1,"I don't really see Greek Life on campus as an issue. No one on campus gets treated differently because of their origin. There is no special housing for Greeks and non Greeks, everyone is treated equally."
College Freshman,1,"The guys and girls at my school are all very much average. Everyone has their own style and do not care what others think about how they dress. We have our far share of cute guys and pretty girls. The typical student looks are either jeans or sweats with a sweater a back pack, books and coffee in hand. Many students wear Framingham State school attire. "
College Freshman,1,Parking at school can be a hassle at times. Being a commuter trying to find a parking spot in the lot you are assigned to can be hard mostly during the hours from 10;30-1;20. The spaces fill rapidly and some times you may have to park further away in the athletic field. Campus police love to give out tickets and pay very close attention to the times for certain parking. Having a car on campus is available to any student who wants to pay an extra 500 dollars for a parking pass.
College Freshman,1,I don't know that much about the transportation options at my school. I do know they offer a shuttle for the commuters that pick you up at the parking lot which comes in handy on cold days and when it starts to snow. They also have the ram tram that will pick you right up at the school over by admissions and will take you to places in Framingham.
College Freshman,1,"I don't know what it is like living on campus because I am a commuter. But I have heard from many people that it is ok, not much to do on the weekends because lots of people go home. "
College Freshman,1,"Framingham State is a close knit school, which is one of the reasons I applied there. I didn't know too much about the school when I decided to go there. But now that I go there I wish I didn't. The school just doesn't feel like the right fit for me. The students and staff are very welcoming and friendly but it just doesn't feel like me. "
College Freshman,1,"I don't live on campus so I don't really eat the food, but when I did for orientation it was pretty good. I wouldn't mind eating there on a daily, there are lots of options."
College Junior,1,"Now a smoke free campus, and a dry campus makes this school feel like a high school."
College Freshman,1,"In general, I don't think that FSU is an extremely strict campus, However, it recently announced that it will soon become a tobacco free campus. Though I am not a smoker and this new policy does not directly affect me, I do not think it is right to tell smokers that they can't take a quick smoke outside. It will be difficult to enforce and I think there will be a lot of push back."
College Sophomore,1,"I've received less than 2,000 for aid from Framingham State, this year they increased the cost of schools and cut aid. My mom kills herself working 2 jobs to pay for school and save while my dad sits back and watches but unfortunately financial aid never see's hears, or understand what really goes on in the lives of students...it sucks."
College Freshman,1,"Parking at Framingham is quite terrible especially in the morning. The distance of the parking lots to the campus and dorms is somewhat of a travel. I know exercise is good, but a 15- 20 minute walk up a hill can get really aggravating once it's repeated everyday. Sadly, the freshmen have the worst parking."
College Sophomore,1,They are not helpful at all. It took them three weeks to get back to me and it is terrible. I think they need to be more on top of things and communicate more with the students. I found fancial aid to be unhelpful unless you physically go to them and ask them questions. They don't respond well over phone/emails. I hate going to financail aid for help because I feel like I am pulling their teeth just to get simple answers.
College Junior,1,Parking is horrible at the school. If you don't arrive bright early in the morning it's impossible to find a parking in the nearest parking lot.
College Sophomore,1,Campus Is Prison â€“ Living on this campus is similar to living in a prison..you feel like your every move is being watched by campus police men who take their jobs way too seriously. You get more freedom in high school.
College Junior,1,"Not Much â€“ as a graduate student, there is practically nothing offered in the way of scholarships."
College Senior,1,"It's a GRAND Hot Mess!!!!! Parking is horrible on campus!  Even though I don't have a car, I can boldly say that because residents have to pay $500 per year to park like 1 mile from the school, riding inky dinky shuttles that are very unreliable.  I've rode with friends so I know.  Plus, commuters have to park down the hill and I saw it was a pain for them.  Even faculty complains about the inconvenience of parking."
College Junior,1,"Bad Parking â€“ it costs $250 per semester to keep your car on campus, i don't know the price for commuters. Lots are faraway (besides the commuter lots which only commuters can park in) so you have to catch the shuttle back to campus. Shuttle only runs till certain times so you have to call campus police to give you a ride back to your dorm...which is always awkward."
College Junior,1,Unqualified Professors and Lack of Options â€“ Many professors are unqualified and lack the knowledge to teach. teachers are uncaring of education and future when I've asked for assistance. There are very little options for classes to choose from - often they are offered at random times and fill up quickly; there is usually only one professor teaching a class which several majors need to take so if you'd prefer a professor with a different teaching style (like someone who just reads off slides through the class and tells you to read the book when you ask them to explain something) then your screwed.
College Sophomore,1,"If you want absolutely nothing to do for your four years here, then this is the place to be. The Campus organizes ZERO fun events, and it's tough to not get caught drinking, and all of the sports houses where everyone goes to get wasted are far away, which is not very convenient. A lot of the good looking girls are ridiculously stupid and it won't be hard to get a one night stand or knock them up. You can make it fun and see how many of them you can have sex with...you'll be surprised at how many you will be able to do it with. STAY AWAY FROM THIS SCHOOL, IT IS HORRIBLE!!!"
College Sophomore,1,See Campus Strictness. Parking is god awful.
College Sophomore,1,"Very Strict â€“ Alcohol is prohibited and if caught YOU WILL be written up, leading to a suspension or even expulsion. Parking is awful, they'll assign you the smallest lot with 10 spots when you're looking for a parking pass, despite the big lots being half full, and when you get to the small lot every spot is filled (obviously...big shocker) which will force you to have to park in the other lots. Campo will ticket you and possibly tow your car despite it being the fault of the idiots who assign you the lots.

Visiting is very strict, you can only have 3 people at one time visit, and it gets really annoying having to scan your card 3 times just to enter a building and go up to your room. Don't get me wrong, it's a safe campus but very annoying."
College Sophomore,1,"One Word: ZERO â€“ There is no nightlife what so ever. Drinking is prohibited (dry campus) and when people do sneak alcohol into the dorms they usually get caught (RA's are very strict about this and are quick to write people up). The sports houses are very far away off campus and can be expensive when taking a cab. There is no Greek life. People usually just stay in their rooms and do nothing but play video games with only about 2 other people. The Campus does a TERRIBLE job of organizing activities that are actually fun (if you think I'm very pessimistic, come here and see for yourself!), leading to nothing to do. 

Look at it this way, the most my roommate has ever done in regards to ""night life"" is going to a radio show for 2 hours with 4 other people...boy he's really living it up. 

If a night life/very social scene is important to you, DO NOT COME HERE!!! STAY AWAY!!! YOU WILL BE BORED ALL THE TIME!!! Thank goodness I'm transferring out of here after the semester ends."
College Sophomore,1,There are hardly any minorities here.

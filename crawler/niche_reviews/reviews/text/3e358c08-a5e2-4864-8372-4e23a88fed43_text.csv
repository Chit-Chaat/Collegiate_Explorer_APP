Freshman,5,"The end of my semester was online.  All of my professors were very understanding and handled classes very well.  They made it easy to continue my learning, although it wasn't in person, it still felt like I had the professor with me."
Freshman,5,"I went to MacMurray for my first year of college.  I was a little over 6 hours away from my hometown.  MacMurray created a friendly environment that I will never forget, I created friendships that I will have for the rest of my life.  Unfortunately they shut down due to lack of funds and I have transferred to another college.  I will never forget the impact this place has had on me and I will truly miss it.  I would have spent all four years here.  The professors were great, I especially loved the professors who were a part of my major.  I couldn't of had better teachers.  I wish them all luck wherever they go next."
Niche User,5,"MacMurray college is for someone who enjoys the small town/small campus lifestyle. It is very simple to find your way around campus which makes things more comfortable for the incoming students. Athletic programs at MacMurray are very popular as over 65% of people are student athletes. The only complaint I have is my cell phone does not have good service on campus and the buildings are a little outdated, but will hopefully be remodeled soon!"
Freshman,5,I loved the home atmosphere and the way I was treated by all students and staff. I also felt that they were always looking for my best interest and  were truly involved in my academics and athletics.
Freshman,5,"The admission staff are very nice and welcoming. The campus is very nice and has a nice home-life feel to it. The nursing instructors are very nice and all have different but amazing personalities. My admission process was very smooth thanks to the staff. I was explained every situation and given alternatives to so many financial issues, if they arise."

Sophomore,5,"I really love being a student at Mac!  The professors are all very helpful and sincere with wanting to help you understand the material.  The students are great!

I really enjoy the whole experience and positive surroundings which I know all contribute to my current GPA of 4.0.  I am beyond happy."
Sophomore,5,"I like the college a lot the only complaints I have are actually about the dorms, they are old and very outdated. The instructors are awesome and care about the students and there are lots of programs to help students do well in class."
Freshman,5,My grandparents taught here and I felt so welcome when I went off. I chose this school because the campus was small enough to one could know anyone and everyone. This school is perfect!
College Freshman,5,Sports are the reason that Mac is still a college.  Most of the students are athletes and we are all a big family.

There are computers in almost every building for student use. The network is very reliable and the speed is fairly good. They have wireless internet all over the campus and you can use your own personal computer with it."
Sophomore,4,"MacMurray is small university located in Jacksonville, Illinois. Professors are outstanding! I must confess regardless of coming from a great high school with some of the best teachers anyone could ask for. Dr. Eric Berg is my favorite professor at MacMurray. If you are given the opportunity to be apart of his class I highly recommend you to do so. Athletics at MacMurray has become a big part of the school tradition as over 65% of students are athletes. All teams welcome walk-on players with college-level talent. My only problem is that I am from out-of-state and come from a low-income household yet I spend much money on tuition.

 The school as a whole is average but if you are looking for a school with small classes with great teaching staff MacMurray is this place for you."
Niche User,4,"The staff is personal and kind. The professors are easy to get to know. The older students are helpful to the newer ones. It is easy to make good friend groups. The campus is small and welcoming. Finding supplies and books for classes is a simple one step process. The community around campus is inviting and it is easy to get involved in church and community activities. The campus is located near the town square where there is a movie theater, book store, coffee shop, and several restaurants."
College Freshman,4,The baseball team and other teams are on the rise and I highly recommend going there to play!
College Freshman,4,"Mac is just like a family, everyone cares about eachother and I love it!"

College Freshman,4,"They are very nice and interactive. The class sizes are small, which makes it easier for students to seek help."
College Freshman,4,It's fun and the coaches are very enthusiastic
College Freshman,4,I like how the teachers really help us out
College Freshman,4,The professors at Mac are amazing.  They care about grades and how well we students do in their classes.  There are a lot of courses offered to take and the class sizes are great for one on one time with the professor.  It is not an overwhelming place.
College Freshman,4,"Internships are required to graduate, unless you are a nursing major because you go to clinicals.  The alumni give back to the school a lot and are often at school functions."
College Freshman,4,living on campus is like living with a large family.  we all know each other and visit each other in different rooms.  our lounge is super nice and there is a full kitchen that we can use.

College Freshman,4,"I am in one of the sororities on campus. It is pretty easy to get in as long as you get along with most of the existing girls. I am very glad that I pledged and have enjoyed my time with my sorority sisters. There is no sorority housing because Jacksonville does not allow it, however we are trying to get our meeting room back so we will have some space of our own."
College Sophomore,4,"Its been very stressful, very expensive but the workers are very great,"
College Freshman,4,they get the job done and there are plenty of people to help you out as well.
College Freshman,4,the up-campus houses are the best. They are suit-style and very comfortable. The two down-campus dorms are community-style and are sub par.
College Freshman,4,The counselors are great at helping you decide what you want to do with your life. I decided before I got here. The instructors give your the true life of what your occupation will give you.
College Freshman,4,The school is easy to work with. They will help those who need the help
College Freshman,4,"There is a lot of free time at college. Way more than High School. The people you spend that free time with will make or break your experience. At MacMurray College, you will find awesome people to spend your time with."
College Student,4,like the program and teachers are involved
College Student,4,plenty of parking and not many problems
College Junior,4,The campus is so small that you're never that far from where you need to be. The worst part is definatly the snow though because the campus workers seem to have trouble getting out and clearly the sidewalks. The whole town is a little slow about it though.
College Junior,4,"I like the atmosphere here because I like the small town vibe. The town doesn't really offer that many choices for eating, shopping, or doing things but that's ok. There are several parks in town that are very nice. There's a town square that includes several restaurants, the movie theater, and there's a farmers market there in the summer/fall. Springfield is close enough if you have to get something that isn't available locally but far enough that it's not worth the drive all the time."
College Junior,4,"The off campus dining options is great because you have different ethnics and vegan, too!"
College Junior,4,I attend a private college so there's not a whole lot of drug and alcohol abuse at my school!
College Junior,4,"The campus is small so in bad weather you don't have too far to go. My dorm is located near the center of campus, but the freshman dorms are a little farther away."
College Freshman,4,"There are many sports to choose from- Basketball (men and womens), soccer (men and womens), golf (men and womens), football, baseball, softball, and volleyball. Our teams are not neccesarily the best but it is fun to watch and they have a lot of support."
College Freshman,4,"There are many different restaraunts around Jacksonville, ranging from fast food to pizza to finer dining. Prices are reasonable and the food is good at most places."
College Freshman,4,The school offers several diffrenet programs with most of them being the most popular one's at most school and one's that are considered to be the basic one's at most colleges.
College Freshman,4,I am currently undecided until i apply to the nursing program. The head of the nursing program took the time to meet with me and discuss the courses i need to take this upcoming semester so that i can stay on the four year program once I switch to nursing. They are all very helpful and are more than happy to sit and talk with you about your plans.
College Freshman,4,"Most of the guys on campus wear sweats often, most are athletic, and they are friendly. The girls on campus vary. Some dress to impress almost every day while others go in sweats or even pajamas to class."
College Sophomore,2,There is a lot of underage drinking going on it disturbs the peace
College Freshman,2,the officers do not take their job seriously
College Student,2,Not much to do when not doing school work
College Sophomore,2,The options are hidden and if you don't know the right people you can't get in.
College Freshman,2,"The weather is so weird. There will be days that will be 70 degree and next day being 15 degrees. I have to check my weather everyday because i never know what it happening. I am from the area where the weather is more stable. However, on the nice days, i would go outside and just enjoy the sunshine."
College Freshman,2,"I am majoring in education, i haven't felt satisfied with the program. i don't have any classes that related to my major while i know others at same level as i am and major exactly same thing have those classes. However, I loved how the small classes are, it gives more indiviualized attention, however, lately, i am feeling pressure from my teachers who are trying to get into my personal problems. Meanwhile, the class load isn't that hard. Just keep with it up and you will get great grade."
College Sophomore,2,There aren't any fun parties at Mac. All the good parties are across town at IC or at the bars. I waited to party until I was 21 so I don't really know what there is to do for people under 21
College Junior,2,Its a 30 plus minute drive to the train/bus station and not many options to get there. I usually look for a friend on campus who has a car to get me there. The bus service locally is slow. I usually walk or get a ride to go to the store.
College Sophomore,2,"Mediocre at Best. Don't expect a lot of supermodels in small town jville. The grass is always greener they say, but even IC has a bunch of the average."
College Sophomore,2,Few and Far Between – It's a small town without a whole lot to do. for a good nightlife you'd need to drive to springfield and that's always a hassle.
College Freshman,1,I know nothing about these
College Sophomore,1,it is very boring.a small city with not many options.barely any parties.bars are boring and have to be 21 to get in. no clubs
College Freshman,1,"The buildings are very old and the dorm isn't exactly very comfortable place in that fact that there are rust almost everywhere, and it is even worst in bathroom. They need a lot of repairs. Especially with heaters, ugh, there are days that the heater broke and it was 15 degrees and everyone was freezing and if there are 60 degrees outside, the room get too hot because they didn't turn the heater off. Don't expect for a social life, it is almost non-exist. Everyone seem go home every weekend. However, the staffs are very friendly and helpful and they wanted you to be successful."
College Freshman,1,The public transportation is non-exist. You need to ask the people for the ride and it is huge hassle.
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms are falling apart. I've had to put so many work orders in. As much as I pay to go there, I expect the dorms to be up to par. As for the buildings, the only nice building on campus is Putnam/Springer. I would advise living off campus if Mac is really the school for you!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"General Campus Aesthtics – The facilities are poor. Minus the new buildings and few remodels due to a recent flood, the school is in need of an upgrade."

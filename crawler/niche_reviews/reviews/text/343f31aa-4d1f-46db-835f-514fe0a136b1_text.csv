Sophomore,5,"Online learning at UChicago has of course been challenging, but I am grateful because my friends and I have definitely bonded even thousands of miles away. I think there is just that certain aspect of academic life here that draws people closer. 

Professors have very accommodating, learning has transitioned well, and Zoom lectures still keep me engaged. One thing to note is that I think the difficulty has remained constant, which may be good or bad depending on your prospective."
Sophomore,5,"I think the best thing that comes to my mind is the people at the school. There is always an opportunity to strike up a conversation, and it's amazing to meet people from all over the world from Day 1!

For prospective students, I would definitely like to clarify some concerns that even I had when I was applying.  Campus life I can say is DEFINITELY improving. The new dorms and buildings are just beautiful, the food I feel like has been of consistent quality (pretty great in my opinion), and the party scene is there (not huge of course) if you want it. I think the response from students is driving these changes, especially in regard to mental health services and sustainability. The hype around academics is true...it is hard! But also incredibly rewarding!!

One score that puzzled me was campus safety. For me, I have never felt ""unsafe"" on campus,  including late at night. There are guards on nearly every block and even more blue lights. I feel the concerns via safety are undeserved."
Freshman,5,"My favorite part of UChicago is definitely its academics -- students are constantly encouraged to debate, rethink, and most importantly, listen. I was able to take a graduate student course as a first-year, and was amazed by the level of respectful and intellectual discussion that was possible! Students and professors alike are motivated, caring, and inclusive, and there's a strong sense of community everywhere you go, from the UCPD officer on the street corner to the dining hall staff. There's truly something for everyone, from Student Action to University Theater to Circus Club to Greek life. Regardless of extracurricular interests, however, there's an undeniable bond in the love of learning and open-mindedness that ties everyone in UChicago together."
Freshman,5,"Despite the abrupt shift to online learning, my professors adapted their courses to a remote format seamlessly, making use of recorded lectures and Zoom breakout rooms to facilitate learning. By far the most important thing was that staff and professors were all aware that for a lot of us, school was the last thing on our mind with all that was going on in our communities and world. My professors, across the Biology, Art History, and Spanish departments, were all incredibly understanding and accommodating and went out of their way to ensure that students were doing okay beyond academics."
Freshman,5,"The College is a great place to expand your knowledge, however it is a bit polarizing. Depending on your major and your engagement with the Housing system you may find that you're lonely or surrounded by pirhanas for classmates. However, I have not found the college this way. I've loved every *very hard* moment there and I strongly wish I was there right now and not noticing a terrifying spider on my wall. Thanks Corona.

- Final Note: Financial Aid is very generous, everyone whose families earn under 125K/year get full tuition and below 90k gives you a host of benefits and half your room/board covered. So don't be scared off by the price!"
Alum,5,"Wonderful teachers, students, and facilities. An intellectual environment second to none. A jewel amongst American universities."
Freshman,5,Attending UChicago is like falling down a tree except instead of hitting branches you hit knowledge.
Alum,5,"I loved the commitment to intellectual rigor and how the school allowed students to prioritize theory.  The location in Chicago is not the best because the university acts like an (white, affluent) enclave in the middle of  majority black and brown neighborhoods. I do think that the prioritization of theory can have some downsides, especially for those who graduated in the humanities and social sciences."
Freshman,5,"U of C has a huge library, tasty coffee shops and amazing professors. People like to say that UChicago is where fun comes to die, but the student life and fun is found in things like Moda fashion shows and other super interesting student groups. There actually are parties here because of Greek life. The campus is beautiful and nice to walk around."
Freshman,5,"Love the diversity of thought and the freedom to express them. The core really focuses on interdisciplinary learning, and I recommend it to anyone who would want to experience learning about various disciplines (or to anyone who is undecided about their major!)"
Niche User,5,University of Chicago is an excellent university. It has an international accredited study abroad program and amazing research opportunities.
Freshman,5,"A challenging academic environment, but with a lot of helpful professors and teaching assistants. The campus is beautiful, and accessible to the city, and there's always a lot to do around the school. Dorms are a bit old fashioned, but very cozy, and the house culture at Snell-Hitchcock is amazing. There is also a lot of support from career and academic advising, as well as a lot of resources to help students."
Niche User,5,"The University of Chicago is the forefront of innovation, sparking creative/curious thought processes within students."
Freshman,5,"This is the place for the intellectually curious, for the smartest nerds in the world to solve problems together, and the place for the quirky geeks that want to head into academia or wall street."
Alum,5,"I loved every single thing about this place! Excellent academics, great student body, a nice neighborhood that is close to the city. I wouldn't change a thing except developing the surrounding area more."
Alum,5,"I could not be happier with my Chicago education. I have found that the dividends and rewards only increase with time; it left me with the ability to think critically - to separate truth from fiction, to understand others' reasoning, to contemplate ways to separate and attack problems - a skill that is proving invaluable in my career. I'm a recent graduate, and I found that the academics were unparalleled and that I met amazing amazing people at the school - my closest friends are all fellow Chicago alums who are now around the globe pursuing their interests and passions to the highest level."
Sophomore,5,"Pretty expensive but overall a good environment for people who want a challenge in college. Not just for one type of person, and you can definitely find your fit."
Sophomore,5,"There are only two downsides of my UChicago experience so far: the weather and the cost of attendance. Otherwise, it's a fantastic school. There's so many opportunities available to students and every person I've met has had something interesting about them. Of course, there's a heavy workload but it makes you grow so much intellectually. I've learned and absorbed more in the past year than in the ten before it."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Chicago has an incredibly welcoming and yet challenging atmosphere that is unlike any other. The Core Curriculum introduces truly applicable frameworks for critical thinking that can the applied in a diverse curriculum.  At UChicago you can attend your Physics lecture in the morning, work on your film project until you participate in a religious discussion in the afternoon and rehearse with your traditional African music group in the evening. In spite of the lack of affordability, UChicago does offer various ways of financing, including generous financial aid and merit-based scholarships. However, Uchicago is not need bling to international applicants, which is likely to discourage low-income international students to apply."
Graduate Student,5,"The University of Chicago prepares you to be successful. You are taught by world recognized researchers, and connected to the city of Chicago. It has a long history of excellence"
Sophomore,5,"Love it here, just surround yourself with positive people.
It is very important to find clubs and activities that get you out of the books and into the world."
Graduate Student,5,"Situated at Hyde Park, an already openly diverse neighborhood, the University of Chicago provides a unique environment which consists of a diverse community of students, faculty, and staff. The University offers an array of programs and activities for various subjects and fields. The architectural work on each campus is breathtakingly beautiful. Everyone is welcoming and respectful of each other. Enrolling at The University of Chicago will give you the best experience ever and you will find yourself craving for more."
Junior,5,"The University of Chicago is an incredibly difficult place to attend school. You will be pushed to your limit in almost every way. However, after 2 years I have become a firm believer that this kind of pressure is absolutely necessary to reach the next level. UChicago heavily emphasizes the need to think critically and independently, and for this reason graduates are successful everywhere they go. If you have a burning passion to improve yourself as a person, UofC is absolutely the place to be."
Junior,5,"A great experience!  Definitely rigorous and not for the faint of heart.  Academically excellent, fantastic research opportunities, diverse, professors are amazing.  I participate in varsity sports and it's a great community.   The surrounding City is amazing...tons to do."
Graduate Student,5,"I love the University of Chicago for it's intense curriculum that is focused on excellence and critical thinking.  However, the University could do a better job of providing graduate student housing."
Freshman,5,"All around great school, definitely don't come here unless you're willing to put in the work. Not the best social scene/athletics, but the professors and peers are unmatched."
Sophomore,5,"Excellent  teaching and intellectual community. However, high stress and academic demand. You can feel it in the community."
Niche User,5,"So many research opportunities and career paths the school offers and Chicago State has a good faculty, staff and choices for food."
Freshman,5,"I really liked how supportive the community was. I also like how everything in the city feels accessible, and I am also getting a quality education."
Niche User,5,I loved the way everyone on campus is because they are so nice and helpful. I had an overnight stay on the campus and it was so beautiful and the students helped each other with work. I also liked this because I can get help from other students.
Freshman,5,Food's good. Don't even go here. I only go here because my great grandfather donated what would be $30 million to this college back in the 60s.
Freshman,5,"I love this university, truly, but the financial aid can be pretty terrible for middle class families. I'm making it work this year, but last summer I worked three jobs, about 55+ hours a week, and both of my parents had to take on extra work, while my Mum was still in graduate school. Not only this, but I had to take out a loan--something the university is supposedly very against.

That being said, while I am upset with the administration of the school, there is no better place for me, and while I've had to work myself to death to get here, I believe it is worth it. The classes I take are incredibly interesting, rigorous, and well taught. I love my professors, and my peers. My house is very much like a family, and I love the kind of discussions we can have."
Freshman,5,University of Chicago is an excellent choice. Upon first visiting I knew this is the place I wanted to go to school and I have no regrets about apply ED. Everyone here is so friendly and nice. Professors always encourage you to go to tutoring or office hours if you are struggling and classes (at least the ones I have taken thus far) are small enough that they get to know you on a personal level. Classes are challenging yet still engaging. Peers love to engage in intellectual discussions. Dining hall is pretty good and housing is excellent. I got placed into Burton-Judson and am in Vincent house (best house). We have very fun house traditions and we have all become very close with one another. I highly recommend applying. :)
Niche User,5,The University of Chicago is a great academic environment that provides a good return on investment.
Freshman,5,"It’s been an amazing experience. I feel home since day one. I love that we have houses, so every weekend we get together with our house, it is like a family. There is a lot of diversity and academically is outstanding."
Niche User,5,"AMAZING architecture, school looks like right out of a movie. Great people too! All semi rich, and too smart for their own well being, but they'll make great additions to this world, and i'm very proud to have applied here."
Niche User,5,"When I took a college tour of the University of Chicago, it was amazing! The campus is beautiful and has a very welcoming atmosphere. Everything  about the university makes you want to apply!"
Graduate Student,5,It’s just the best place in the whole world. The architecture the teaching staff the students the food everything is amazing. And breathtaking. I wander around every day and wonder how I came o be so lucky.
Freshman,5,The University of Chicago is literally the greatest school of all time I love it so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Alum,5,"Challenged every day and applied analytical skills to lively class discussions as well as written work. Professors are always available and the students are of varied backgrounds, both of which keep students engaged. Love my school!"
Junior,5,I came to the University of Chicago to learn and be surrounded by people who had a vast appreciation for knowledge. I can say with great confidence that this expectation has been met. Every day at UChicago I am surrounded by people who cherish learning and encourage others to as well. I have never heard a boring conversation while walking the campus. People at UChicago help one another thrive and learn. It has created a community where individualism is appreciated and encouraged. The experience that you get at UChicago will depend entirely on what you put into it and the possibilities in that sense are endless.
Freshman,5,"The University of Chicago is an inviting and academically-oriented community. People here, both students and professors, are ready to take on any conversation from most viewpoints. I really enjoyed my first year here, from taking classes with small sizes and engaged professors to lounging in all of the libraries on campus."
Niche User,5,"My experience with University Of Chicago was amazing, all aspects of student life, academics, along with the amazing Campus provides a true college experience. The area of Hyde park is somewhat safe but some aspects of safety could be improved such as more lights on the campus."
Junior,5,"The way the University approaches teaching and learning is remarkable. At UChicago, the aim is to teach the students how to think instead of what to think. The academics as well as students and student life are beyond excellent."
Alum,5,"I loved everything about it. It's what you make of it; however beware, if you are not interested in learning for the sake of learning, you will likely not be happy in this environment. The shortened school motto is 'life of the mind,' my friends and I like to joke that if we had wanted a job, we would have gone to Harvard, but we wanted to learn, so we went to UChicago. However there were almost always parties at night, and the winter is not so bad. It's one of the last higher education bastions of free speech left."
Freshman,5,"Love this school! Great experience! The academics are invigorating and the professors are demanding, but I learned so much."
Freshman,5,"There's no place else in the world where learning is cherished in the same fashion than it is at the University of Chicago. The tagline ""the life of the mind"" can often be found on marketing materials for the university, but it truly does ring true on campus. Academics and intellectual rigor at UChicago are unrivaled."
Alum,5,"I graduated from the UofC in 1975. I have had an amazing career since then; it has been full of adventure, challenge, economic rewards, diversity, travel and fun. My dreams have been 95% fulfilled.  I have no doubt that I owe it all to the doors that the UofC have opened for me.  My kids have studied at Yale, Harvard Law, Georgetown, LSE and Harvard Ed School. Seeing how my kids have enjoyed to each of these schools, it is clear to me that only Yale measures up."
Alum,5,Great experience! Rigorous yet tangible education that prepared me very well for a career in economics. Might great friends and had great experiences
Niche User,5,"This is an amazing university beside an amazing city, which I’m sure many are aware of. There is a very diverse and nice community here and I’ve had a great experience so far."
Sophomore,5,"Just over a year ago, I came to UChicago expecting to live the life of the mind--and I have been engrossed in that life ever since. I have learned so much academically, taking classes including Advanced Computational Modeling for Biology, Organic Chemistry, Introduction to Language Development, and Introduction to World Music. I have learned to think, to take risks, to consider questions I wouldn't have otherwise explored. Being at UChicago has also allowed me to immerse myself in the South Side community as my House's Civic Engagement Representative."
Sophomore,5,"Ive had an amazing experience at UChicago. While here though I found the school difficult the lack of competition is truly amazing. Furthermore, the ability to learn from noteworthy faculty, and do research with them, still amazes me."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus . They are always friendly to visitors . They also keep everything clean and they make sure you know what you want . the students are always happy to talk to you and or answer your questions. I love the diversity and the acceptance for people who are different.
Freshman,5,First I would like to start by saying the staff is so important to any organization because those are the first people you see before you really start classes. They are very helpful to my needs and as well as to others needs they really take the time out to answer any questions that I need answer to and very understanding I recommend anyone going to college to go to this school if you would love customer service and friendly environment this is the place to be.
Niche User,5,"What I liked about the University of Chicago was its challenging curriculum known as ""Core"". It's a very pretentious school with outstanding standards based on academia. The University of Chicago is probably the best school, based on academics, all the whole Midwest region."
Sophomore,5,"So far I have greatly enjoyed my experience at UChicago. The activities,  people, and culture of the school is incredible. I have found myself transformed since starting school back in September. I am more engaged, excited, and optimistic about my future endeavors than ever before!"
Sophomore,5,"The University of Chicago has so far provided me with an incredible undergraduate experience. While extremely difficult, my course load has been fulfilling and valuable. It certainly is not for everyone, but UChicago is an amazing institution."
Niche User,5,A really prestigious institution. The education provided here is one of the best in the world and really prepares the students to succeed in life.
Sophomore,5,"U of C, with its competitive environment has pushed me to become a better student. Reaching out for help has never been an issue, and everyone here, faculty, staff, and students, is very friendly and welcoming."
Niche User,5,This is an amazing school. Be warned academics are taking very seriously so don't expect to coast. Really good return on investment since there are plenty of internship opportunities.
Freshman,4,"I like the university's focus on rigorous academics, the resources it provides for career and academic advancement, and the variety of student organizations available on campus."
Freshman,4,"For the majority of the courses, I have been online, with lecture zoom meetings that are recorded and posted for future references. The TAs and professors have additionally been very adaptive to the online environment."
Sophomore,4,"I love UChicago in everyway except in terms of financial aid. I love the campus, the faculty, the RSOs, the career opportunities, but if you are middle/ upper middle class financial aid can be very difficult to navigate."
Alum,4,"I had online classes during the pandemic. Professors were dedicated to making things work, and overall, my mostly discussion-based classes went surprisingly well online. However, UChicago normally does not offer online classes."
Alum,4,"UChicago is a very unique and rigorous place. It is for people who love learning for the sake of learning and think of everything theoretically. Therefore, it has this very unique, cerebral culture, and that means student life looks different here. The best thing about this place is that everyone is passionate about something, usually many things, and that shows in the many different student groups that exist. Professors are usually also full of passion for  their subject. Also, with UChicago being internationally known, it draws students, professors, and guests from around the country and world, meaning your opportunities to meet people and to be at the forefront of many conversations are almost unparalleled. However, you have to deal with an obscenely high price tag and an administration that is uncommunicative, uncaring, and makes life very difficult for students. In my opinion, going to UChicago was incredibly valuable, but it came with many frustrations."
Freshman,4,"Of course there was going to be a dip, and many professors are unforgiving about the circumstances. However, as this should reflect my experience I will note that my professors have been overwhelmingly accomodating and for that I am very grateful."
Sophomore,4,"I've really enjoyed my time so far at UChicago! It's a great school overall, and the academics and people I've met are my favorite part. This school is perfect for students who love learning. I think there could be more of a focus on student mental health services."
Freshman,4,"The community that the dorm system forms is unbeatable, especially coming in as a first year not knowing anyone else at UChicago."
Niche User,4,"They support students with less opportunities than others. I appreciate how they help families with immigrants and families that earn less money that is necessary to pay for a expensive 4 -year university. I think that because they provide opportunities to students that come from more difficult backgrounds, it will be very helpful and make college seem more realistic for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"Liked: the school is not focused on athletics at all, which is great because I've heard that some schools are centered around their teams; not a huge party school but there are parties hosted by frats on the weekends (good if you're not interested in the party scene)
Disliked: there's not a lot to do in the local area (there's just MSI, a bowling alley, a small theater, pathetically small Target, a couple of restaurants), so you're gonna have to go into the city; dining hall food will decline over the course of the year"
Freshman,4,I’m about to start my first year but just from visiting the campus back in April I could envision myself attending the school. Uchicago is the epitome of socioeconomic and ethnic diversity. The academia is one of the best in the country and the school provides amazing financial aid!
Graduate Student,4,"The academics here are incredible. You are able to have access to some great educators and resources because of the wealth and connections at the school. However, the social life here is lacking. There is also a weird culture because of how many privileged people attend this school - everyone is always networking."
Alum,4,University of Chicago allowed me to grow as a student and figure out my interests. Being a liberal arts school I didn't feel ready for work after graduating.
Sophomore,4,The University of Chicago is a very rigorous school and it can be hard for some people. Sometimes it's really nice and other times it's not.
Alum,4,"It's nice to see that the University has increased campus diversity of financial aid resources for families that will make the campus more diverse in terms of student backgrounds. I enjoyed my time in college housing a lot! Get involved with your house - go on house trips, play intramural sports, take on a leadership position. If you need something - speak up and ask for it! You really can have a say in your university. Don't be shy to speak up and ask questions. The University can only continue to improve with that kind of input."
Freshman,4,"UChicago is an amazing place to be, with so many opportunities and spectacular people to meet and interact with.It is very demanding on students but that's expected of such an institution."
Sophomore,4,"My time at UChi so far has been great. The academics here are unparalleled, and I've grown exponentially as a writer and critical thinker. The faculty are all so invested in their teaching, and it is reflected in the amount of availability there is outside of class to meet and discuss assignments or concepts from class. Career services is also really helpful in prepping for interviews and touching up resumes, so if you engage with their office, you have a leg up in any job search. Playing sports here is an interesting pursuit, as I play on the basketball team, and although it is an awesome experience, there is little student support. On-Campus living is best in Max P, but North Dorm is also really nice having lived there for my first year. Overall, I really enjoy UChicago."
Sophomore,4,"Love Chicago, great dorm life/house culture, career services are helpful, and professors are helpful & experienced, wish the science core was less intensive"
Works Here,4,I work at the University of Chicago. The students and facility are nice and caring. You get to meet a lot of people from all over the world.
Sophomore,4,"University of Chicago gives you a wholesome educational experience due to the core curriculum. However, enrolling in classes is not an enjoyable experience."
Niche User,4,I took part in HSF's Leadership Institute at the University of Chicago. I stayed in a single dorm that was neat and well kept. The campus was easy to navigate around and the food was particularly good. I ate at Cathy every day!
Alum,4,"The University of Chicago is a very rigorous school, and not all people make it through the intensity. But it is very rewarding and it is possible to have a lot of fun like I did."
Sophomore,4,UChicago is highly challenging but can be really fun if you're down to take all the core classes (which will for sure include a class or two you weren't initially interested in) and won't be set back by the fact that you're gonna learn hardcore theory and will have to figure out the practical aspects on your own. People are usually a lot more weird than in other schools so if you're kinda crazy you can fit in properly if not you'll have to figure out how to live with the mad.
College Sophomore,4,"UChicago is a beautiful school with incredibly driven students. Everyone is incredibly impressive- it can be intomidsting at times, but it also pushes you to be your best. The University is extremely rigorous but prepares you well for the future."
College Sophomore,4,"College Housing has been a joy so far! The Housing system has proved to be really fun and has provided a lot of opportunities to meet people and make friends. The rooms in South Campus are a nice size, and are pretty modern. It is also easy to get to class, and the dorm is right next to the dining hall, which is awesome, especially in the winter!"
College Sophomore,4,"I have really, really enjoyed the University of Chicago so far! There are so many interesting classes, and the professors are without a doubt passionate and experienced in their fields. My school is centered on the idea of ""the life of the mind,"" and encourages students to explore and develop a passion for learning, which is exactly what I love. For example, last year I decided to take Modern Yucatec Maya as a language, just for kicks, and it ended up not only being my favorite class, but also introduced me to a whole new world of opportunities. I actually got to use Maya with native Maya speakers while vacationing in Yucatán this past summer. UChicago is great for so many reasons, but mostly because it creates the perfect environment for students that are curious and eager to learn about anything and everything."
College Junior,4,"The academics are good, but very time consuming"
College Junior,4,"It is helpful, but can be easy to overlook"
College Junior,4,The housing system is beneficial in general
College Junior,4,It's a lot of work and is easy to forget about fun
Sophomore,4,"One of my favorite things about the school is how important the pursuit of knowledge is to the students. Most of the students are there to push themselves and learn, which creates an academic environment that is hard to find at other schools. Although it is extremely rigorous, there are many resources around campus. One downside is that the difficulty of the school, combined with the dreary winters makes depression and other mental health issues common, and although the school has resources to help, the resources aren't the best. Also the school isn't located in an extremely safe area, so you have to be really careful. "
College Junior,4,"I've had the opportunity to build strong social networks, pursue my career aspirations early on, and learn from brilliant, passionate professors. Some professors aren't wonderful at teaching, but most are good. There's also a wide variety of interesting classes to choose from, and most of them are fairly small."
College Junior,4,"Everyone I know has been able to land internships and part-time jobs in their areas of interest, and most go on to jobs that they love after graduation."
College Junior,4,"The student body is incredibly diverse, and the exposure to a wealth of ideas and life experiences allows for enormous personal growth. For the most part, though, the student body is very liberal (however, there are many conservative students). The professors are passionate about their fields and most genuinely care about the success of their students, though some (and it depends on the department how many) are not the most engaging or understandable instructors."
College Sophomore,4,"All of my professors have been very passionate about what they are teaching.  They all love helping students succeed, too."
College Sophomore,4,The dorms were a great way to meet people that you might not have met through other activities. They provide a network of older and younger people that want to help you.
College Sophomore,4,"As a softball player, the division 3 varsity athletics are ideal for me.  It is a great way to stay active and involved with the sport you are passionate about, while also having enough time to focus on academics, too."
College Sophomore,4,One of the best Universities in the world
College Sophomore,4,Lots of options for students who need help
College Sophomore,4,I love Greek life and think it's a great thing to join if you're looking for a bigger social life.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I made the right choice."
College Sophomore,4,I am a member and I love it. Great sense of community.
College Sophomore,4,"Big fan, it's been a great experience so far!"
College Sophomore,4,I very much enjoy being a spectator at sporting events! Great social events!
College Freshman,4,Greek life is very big to those in Greek life and not important to those outside of it.
College Freshman,4,"The only thing lacking is student support, probably because people are stuck studying all the time."
College Freshman,4,"Considering it's south side Chicago, I generally feel pretty safe walking around even late at night"
College Freshman,4,"Mostly good. When you get a good professor, life is great (as long as the curve is kind)."
College Freshman,4,I am a first year undecided major. No useful comment.
College Freshman,4,"House community can easily become the nexus of your social circle, most are pretty tight knit (though some notably more than others)"
College Freshman,4,"Love it and hate it. The ""where fun comes to die"" slogan is not the case if you put in the effort to find opportunities. That being said, the academics are intense and the study-till-you-die mentality can be pervasive."
Recent Alumnus,4,Lots of great options within and outside of majors.
College Freshman,4,Not a lot of drugs. People are generally pretty sane.
College Freshman,4,UChicago takes great measures to make sure students are safe. At night there are guards around many corners.
College Freshman,4,Courses are very hard and the professors are very knowledgable. You will learn a lot of stuff here.
College Student,4,"The fun thing about school it's that many people are helping you white your education , wile you are wanting to learn more every day the teachers help you"
College Sophomore,4,The security measures are a little too much. The unis policing policies are not good.
College Sophomore,4,They are nice. Not super huge. The source of most scandals tbh.
College Sophomore,4,"It's okay. Most of the profs I've had have been good, but the university as an administration is doing a bad job."
College Freshman,4,"Generally, there are no issues with alcohol or drugs."
Sophomore,2,"It was difficult, personally, because I had to start my Economics major the first quarter we went online. Some professors were not accommodating, at all, to our circumstances and expected quality work that would be difficult to produce in an online environment, especially considering the situation with the pandemic."
Junior,2,"I did not like how emotionally cold the environment was. They make light of the fact that their students never have any fun, which in my mind just means they think the huge mental health problem that the school has is a joke."
College Freshman,2,"Not involved and, from what I have heard existing on the periphery, I am better off for it"
College Freshman,2,"The campus itself is very safe, but the surrounding neighborhood can be troubling sometimes. Anything south or west of the university is crime-ridden. North or east is generally fine, but there are still occasionally instances of robberies. Anytime a crime is committed in the Hyde Park neighborhood, students are notified by email."
College Senior,2,The party scene doesn't play much of a role in social life.
College Senior,2,"There aren't many bars around campus, but most people don't really care."
College Senior,2,Greek life isn't that important to most students here.
College Freshman,2,"They don't really give out aid. I didn't get any, and a lot of my friends couldn't come here because they couldn't get aid either."
College Freshman,2,"Doesn't taste good, never have plates or silverware, too salty, no good vegetarian protein options."
College Junior,2,"Cafes are god, but in general the dining halls are bad. Aramark is understaffed, underserviced, food is bad, bugs show up in food sometimes. Utensils are often dirty and missing."
College Freshman,2,Varsity sports are mostly ignored. Some houses get very into intramural sports.
College Sophomore,2,"Parties really are not our specialty, but there is usually a place to go on the weekends to have a good time."
College Freshman,2,"So it gets really cold and snows a lot, but it's doable. I actually found myself enjoying the cool spring and fall."
College Freshman,2,"It can be pretty sketchy at times. I haven't felt personally threatened. If you use common sense, you'll probably be fine, but sometimes things happen, even if you're being smart. It can be a bit scary, but if you really utilize the police presence, you will probably be fine."
College Freshman,2,"It varies. The 2013-2014 winter was  really brutal. We experienced a few polar vortexes and it was well  below zero pretty frequently. Apparently this was an exceptionally bad year, but it was pretty miserable. A lot of us from warmer climates adjusted better than expected, so it's definitely doable, but I would prefer to be somewhere where it was generally warmer."
College Freshman,2,"There really isn't much of a following here, but our teams aren't bad and if you're involved, your friends will definitely care enough to come out. But again, it's not a huge deal."
College Freshman,2,"No one really cares about athletics and athletes, to the point where we don't know anything about them."
College Freshman,2,"There are parties available, but they're not a priority and not everyone is interested."
College Freshman,2,"Weather is definitely bad, and it has been a struggle, but I'm alive and fine."
Niche User,2,"It's frigid. It dips below 10 degrees Fahrenheit, and it feels worse with the windchill.  "
College Senior,2,"There are gang member walking around my school area and I fell unsafe, especially at night."
College Senior,2,There are very limited food options in cafeteria. 
College Freshman,2,"The athletic facilities and (free!) classes offered are great, but varsity athletics are not a big part of student life here at all. Each house participates in intramurals and club sports are common, so finding people to work out with/play sports with isn't a problem. It's just that there isn't school spirit revolving around varsity athletics."
College Junior,2,Waiting for buses can take quite a while and can be confusing. Some city buses don't show up.
College Junior,2,"Livable, relatively cheap, but lots of crummy apartments/landlords who scam deposits."
College Junior,2,"Very quiet. People are largely indifferent about them. If you're not involved in Greek life, most don't really care."
College Junior,2,"There are two parking garages for hospital and employee use. Most students who have cars live off campus and park in the alley ways by their building; parking on the main streets of campus is difficult, especially on the weekdays."
College Senior,2,"parking is tough and tickets are imminent, get a bike"
Recent Alumnus,2,"I haven't had any greek experience but there certainly is a scene if that's what you're looking for.  Not as big as some other schools, that's for certain.  But there are frats that have parties regularly."
Recent Alumnus,2,Everyone is really nerdy and socially awkward. The number of normal people is rising but we're still the minority.
College Senior,2,"Public transportation (CTA) is the easiest way to get around, however it can become costly ($2.25 a trip, no transfers). The options to get downtown are also very limited, as the bus and train stops are far and in very bad neighborhoods."
College Senior,2,"I have often felt unsafe at UChicago, primarily because there is a relatively high rate of crime in the close surrounding area and I have at least four acquaintances who have been victims of crime throughout my years as a students here."
College Freshman,2,"The Wifi is okay, but it's worse this year than last. It's nice to have your own computer, especially during midterms/finals."
College Sophomore,2,"Acceptable, if barely.

It is not infrequent to find that a majority of washing machines in the dorm basement are not working at some given time, that standard gym equipment is broken, missing, or never there to begin with, that one cannot find appointments with student care for another 3 weeks, and I could go on.

Conditions are livable, but EXTREMELY frustrating.

"
College Sophomore,2,"Student Health Services are abysmal. They are never available for walk-in, and it can take up to two weeks to get an appointment. 
Also, the sexual health amenities offered by the University (condoms etc.) are of laughable quality.

If you have street-smarts and awareness, you can keep yourself safe. Also, UChi has a massive private police force. That said, Hyde Park is not terribly nice on the whole, and the areas ringing the neighborhood and the University (especially to the South and East) can be dangerous. Muggings and theft are infrequent, but do happen, and RARELY more severe crimes take place. I myself have been subject to having my bike wheel stolen and twice, and occasionally have felt uncomfortable or unsafe in some of the areas off campus. "
College Freshman,2,"It's f****** cold winter quarter, but beyond that the weather doesn't make too much of a difference."
College Sophomore,2,"For internation students, it is hard to get a decent financial aid."
College Junior,2,"Our athletics are not our strong suit. During WWII the Manhattan project was below our football stadium, and our sports have not really recovered since then (although all of the radiation has been scrubbed)."
College Sophomore,2,"There's Some Hot Men.... If You Know Where to Look – Let me start: I've met a lot of nice, fun, and overall, interesting people at the school. They aren't necessarily attractive though. I think the girls get put down for their looks: there are lots of fit, fun, and sporty girls at Chicago. With guys though, they are either socially awkward, boys in football frats, or unattractive guys who think they have chances with good looking girls (my best friend is a great example). It takes a lot of effort to find someone attractive, smart, and interesting here."
College Freshman,2,"Northwestern's rowing coaches have been heard saying, ""Don't worry guys. All we have to do this time, is beat UChicago."" 
Athletics at UChicago are not very good. If you're looking for competitive, active, well-attended varsity sports, don't come here. If you're looking for an academically focused school that HAS varsity sports, sure."
College Senior,2,"Unsafe, Kind of Expensive – While UChicago itself is an amazing institution, the surrounding areas are not very safe, unfortunately. I think 3 out of 10 students have either been robbed or had their apartments broken into (I get emails almost weekly warning of a new incident), so that is a factor to consider. Apartments run from $600-$800 per person, per month, on average. 

Dorm life is bearable, but that also depends on your personality. We have a housing system wherein students are divided into ""houses"" (much like in Harry Potter), and if you do not fit in with the house in which you are placed, you will have trouble making friends outside of it for at least the first few moths of school."
College Sophomore,2,"The Frats Are Small and the Music Sucks. The music sucks at the frat parties, and the frat houses are extremely small and usually overcrowded. To go downtown into the city takes a while."
College Senior,2,"Just Don't Bring a Car – Parking near campus any time after 8am or before 6pm is generally a nightmare.  Most students, therefore, choose to walk or bike instead of driving.  Students who do own cars mostly use them to explore the rest of Chicago, as Hyde Park is very pedestrian-friendly.  In general, though, Chicago has great public transit, so a car is really superfluous."
College Sophomore,2,"Straight and simple, this is not a place of raging parties. Most are content with sitting in the library discussing Marx, and maybe enjoying a drink they have smuggled in. Either that or they study in the library, go to bar night for an hour, and then come back."
College Freshman,2,"Popular, but Not Over-Bearing – The Greek life is present on campus, often hosting parties on the weekends, but not that many people are involved in the actual frats. It is not at all a big deal if you are not in a frat, and there are many options besides going to frat parties"
College Senior,2,"Can't Opt Out! It's expensive, annoying, not open late at night and the staff can be rude.  But the worst thing is, you're forced to take a meal plan if you're a first year!  After that, I would definitely opt out."
College Senior,2,The athletic scene is just barely starting to creep up.
College Senior,2,"The surrounding neighborhood has very few fast food places, which can be a bother sometimes when trying  to eat for cheap. All of the other places are reasonably priced but all too similar. There is very little variety."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's Always Tricky – Financial aid is always a headache, but I don't think it's really specific to this school.  I will say that I was on multiple occasions told something about financial aid or promised something by one person, and then another person in the university would contradict what I had been told earlier.  I think this goes for ANY school you apply to: EVERY SINGLE TIME you talk to ANYONE about financial aid, write down their name, the date, and a quick summary of what they say.  Then say it back to them and ask them if this is correct.  That way you keep a record of what you're told or promised."
College Senior,2,"Go Downtown for Good Food – Not very good for the cost, especially compared to downtown options."
College Junior,2,"Dining Halls – Bartlett Dining hall-Good food sometimes, but mostly not.
Pierce Dining hall-Great breakfast food
South Campus Dining Hall-fresh veggies and fruits"
College Junior,2,DON'T GET a CAR – There is no need for a car because public transit is so good in Chicago and parking everywhere is so expensive.  I live downtown and commute to school and work everyday and the stress of parking and paying sometimes 40$ for parking would make my life miserable.  Just take the train or the bus.
College Junior,2,Sports Exist – We are a division three school so low turnout at sports events comes with the territory.   We do our best to tailgate and have a good time but its always going to be pretty lackluster.
College Junior,2,Printing on Campus – Printing costs at least 10 cents and always takes tons of time.
College Junior,2,"The city of Chicago is great, but the winters are cold and dark! It starts cooling off around the end of November and stays cold through April. It snows a lot, but the campus actually does a very good job with the shoveling and salting of sidewalks.  Even in the blizzard of 2011, the sidewalks were clear enough to walk on."
College Junior,2,Frats and Apartment Parties – Not much going on in Hyde Park outside of students places and Greek life. No underage places besides these. Sigma Chi Usually throws some good parties.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Mac Monopoly – Off-Campus housing is dominated by Mac. From what I hear, they are awful. I was fortunate enough with housing to avoid them, but as far as apartments go, there is really no other choice."
College Senior,2,"Crime is out of hand on the UChicago campus. Not only do we get security alerts about muggings and assaults quite often, but the students all know that they aren't even reporting them all. I feel unsafe most everywhere after 9 pm."
College Junior,2,"Don't Bother – From a female perspective, the guys at U of C are extremely cocky for being not very good looking. There are a couple attractive ones, but generally their personalities outweigh anything positive about their appearance. There are certainly exceptions, and as friends the guys are typically hilarious. Additionally, I'm sure the guys would also say terrible things about the girls. I don't see a lot of dating; plenty of hooking up. There's a lot of awkwardness and it's amusing."
College Senior,2,"Chicago is very bipolar, burning hot in the summer freezing cold in the winter.  Rainy in the spring, windy in the fall.  If you can survive the weather here you can survive it anywhere.  There's nothing like summer in the city though."
Senior,1,"Quarter system is making it difficult to get a job. I feel ashamed every day to be a part of a community that hires its own police force to police and harass the residents  of the south side. No real diversity on campus, and black people on campus are often harassed and arrested by the UCPD in their attempt to seal campus off from the rest of Chicago. I've spent the last week unable to get basic healthcare on my University insurance, and begging various job opportunities to accept me even though I graduate in June and am on the quarter system. There are definitely some smart people here, and I enjoy a lot of my classes, but this place is a hotbed of depression, suicide, racism, and elitist morons. The only reason I would come here is if you are interested in academic research, know you want to go straight to PhD, and got a full ride.  If I could do it again I would have gone to UMASS."
College Senior,1,"No one cares about athletics on this campus, but the facilities are actually quite nice."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Expensive, low quality food. You must buy a plan to live in housing, artificially inflating the cost of housing as well."
College Sophomore,1,I thought the Northeast had bad weather until I came to Chicago.  Nuff said.
College Freshman,1,"The Greeks throw mediocre parties full of sad and resentful people. No one likes or appreciates them otherwise. If they were to suddenly vanish, some underground student organization would definitely step up to continue Wednesday Bar Night."
College Freshman,1,"So this is VERY qualified: the students generally love intramural sports, there's huge participation, there's great spirit and competition in them, etc. BUT there is absolutely no spirit or appreciation for varsity sports. No one cares. There is a similar level of involvement. Likewise, there is no school spirit as regards sports or athletic ability. I don't even know how good our teams are."
College Sophomore,1,"I'm sure it's fun to be on a varsity team but nobody on campus pays attention to varsity sports and there's no spirit. I wish there were more of a sports culture on campus. It would be nice to dress up in maroon and get some beer and popcorn at a game, but it just doesn't happen."
College Senior,1,"I don't like to travel on winter because it takes so long to wait for the bus,especially when snow covers everywhere."
College Sophomore,1,"It's very expensive and a nightmare. There is free parking, but you're very lucky if you can find it."
College Sophomore,1,"Applying for financial aid was simple and I got a good amount my first year. However, financial aid for my second year my largely worse. In fact, I have the feeling that they offer generous financial aid to bait in new students, then significantly reduce that aid the second year so students are forced to either pay more or leave. Be very wary of the University of Chicago's financial aid."
College Student,1,"I was estimated to receive $22,000 in aid, and ended up with absolutely nothing. Financial aid is stingy, and its not uncommon to have to fight for some money. With the $60,000+ price tag, really think about if it's worth it. You will have a great education, but the stress, social environment, and cost may not be worth it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Bus or the elevated trains.  Both slow and cumbersome options.  They do run regularly, but for getting around campus, not very useful.  Walking or some personal transportation device like a bike is the best way.  Would be nice to have a car, but I am not sure how convenient it is to have one.  I didn't have one, but the parking seemed limited when I was there."
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you think you want to be pre-med, go somewhere else. There's no encouragement at UChicago."
College Senior,1,"Not only are you not allowed to have cars your first year, but even if you get one, there's no parking. Public transportation is gross and takes too long."
College Sophomore,1,"University of Chicago South Campus Dining Hall just failed its 4th health inspection this year. Nuff said.

University of Chicago: where food goes to die."
College Senior,1,ITS COLD. A lot. And dreary and rainy and windy. Bring rain boots and warm warm clothes
College Freshman,1,"Not at all what I expected. Classes themselves are actually very good, but unless you came from a private high school of a great public one, you'll find it extremely difficult to keep up with peers. I graduated top of my class, took every advanced class I could at my rural public high school, but at UChicago peers treat me like an idiot. After my first quarter I'm so discouraged in discussion classes that I don't dare voice any opinions because they are almost always ignored by the other students. This is definitely a rich kids' school, and if that's not you, be prepared to feel like a second class citizen. Hyde Park has little to offer as far as dining and housing, and practically every surrounding neighborhood should be avoided for one's safety. The only redeeming factor as far as location is Chicago itself. The city is really the only positive of my experience here."
College Senior,1,"People do drugs here and the school is not good about getting help for people who need to be helped. The ""protocol"" just makes it hard to help people and there isn't much if any information about drug safety."
College Senior,1,"Parking is an absolute nightmare as the University also has a huge number of graduate students and employees who use up most of the parking. There are a number of pay lots, but parking passes are not available for all of them and are quite expensive. Public transportation is a better option for daily use, and parking is found most easily between 7 and 8AM, 12PM-1PM, and after 6PM on weekdays."
College Sophomore,1,Not Worth It – Don't bring your car.  There's almost nowhere to park and you don't need it.

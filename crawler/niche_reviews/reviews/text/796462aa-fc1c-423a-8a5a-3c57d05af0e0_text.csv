Freshman,5,"I have both online and hybrid classes currently. Salve Regina University has installed within each room very high-qualifying technology to make online learning much easier, even though it will never be completely similar to in-person learning. The wifi has also advanced."
Freshman,5,Salve is right on the water. The community in Newport is amazing and so welcoming to college students. Lots of opportunities. Salve in itself is a tight-knit community; everyone knows everyone. Professors are very enthusiastic and excited for us
Niche User,5,"To me, Salve Regina University felt like the perfect fit for me. The location, the people, the climate, everything about it was perfect to me. I fell in love with the campus and it's program."
Senior,5,"Salve was a great place to attend for 4 years! It is full of great people, professors, fun and so much more. I've made so many memories and met so many great people. There are so many opportunities to make connections with the surrounding neighborhood and find a great job after graduation. Salve will always be a massive part in shaping who I am as a person and I wouldn't have chosen another college to call my home."
Sophomore,5,"As a rising junior, I cannot put into words how happy I am at Salve! I've met some of the most amazing people that are not only my friends but my mentors. One of my favorite things about Salve is that everyone wants you to succeed. What I mean about that is regardless of what your major is, everyone from admissions to faculty to staff wants you to become the best version of yourself. Salve has allowed me to realize what I am passionate about and become a leader on campus. One of the things I like the most is that the administration wants to hear the student's voices and how we can improve the campus. Dr. Armstrong (the president) has dinners with current students and is so involved with the student body! As students, we are encouraged to take the initiative on things our campus is lacking. For example, if there isn't a club on campus, you can create a new one!"
Senior,5,"Salve has been nothing short of an excellent experience. I have felt a real sense of community, the people who I surround myself with are very down to earth, caring, and inspired. I couldn't imagine being anywhere else. The only thing that I would change would be the dining hall changing up there menu more often so then students can experience more variety. This is something that they have been doing a good job of as of lately so I look forward to them continuing to do this."
Junior,5,"Choosing Salve was the best decision of my life! It is a very small, and quaint catholic school with lots to do and learn! My professors are so sweet and the overall environment is amazing. Usually there is always something to do on campus, but there is also tons to do in downtown Newport. It's a tight-knit community with love and mercy as our pillars. I couldn't imagine spending my four years of college any where else."
Senior,5,"Salve is a great place to call your home away from home! The community and atmosphere are amazing and it truly is home-y. My favorite part about Salve is the historical atmosphere that surrounds the buildings and the story of how Salve began in 1947, but the history extends far beyond that. The professors here truly care about you and take the time to help and listen to you. Advisors really help you plan your classes properly in order to succeed for your four years at Salve. OSE and CAB put events on every week to encourage students to get out of their rooms and who doesn't love free food and items?! There is no other place I would rather call home and I can't wait to live in Newport after graduation! GO SEAHAWKS!"
Junior,5,"Choosing to attend Salve Regina University has been one of the best decisions that I've made! I love every aspect about Salve - from the academics to the extra-curricular activities, Salve is an all around great place to be. All of the professors are wonderful and put 100% effort into what they do. The small class sizes are really nice and have allowed me to develop relationships with all of my professors. Salve also has so many events that they put on for students. They host weekly events such as trivia nights, food trucks, movie nights, as well as bigger events, such as a carnival, comedy show, and a concert. Not only is Salve's campus beautiful but if you choose to attend Salve, you also get to enjoy the beautiful city of Newport and all that it has to offer! I would definitely recommend spending your college years at Salve Regina University!"
Junior,5,Deciding to attend Salve Regina was the best decision I've made! The community is so welcoming and there are so many great ways to get involved.  Their education program has been amazing and I feel so prepared for my career.  All of the professors for my core classes and for my major have been so accomodating and helpful.  If you're thinking about committing to Salve: Do it!!
Sophomore,5,"Choosing Salve Regina was one of the best/easiest decisions I've ever made. It has definitely turned into much more than a school for me; it's become a home away from home. Everyone on campus is super welcoming, the professors are very accommodating and able to answer any questions I have, and the community has turned into one big family for me. I've already made life-long friendships, and, being such a small campus, I was able to develop close relationships with my professors starting freshman year. There are tons of helpful resources available to students all over campus, which help with anything from homesickness to getting a little extra help in Bio-101. I am forever grateful for what Salve has done for me so far and recommend anyone interested in the school to reach out admissions! They are extremely helpful and are there to answer any questions you have!"
Senior,5,"Salve is a great community-centered university. At Salve, students come first and the opportunities they are afforded are fantastic. The campus and surrounding town are gorgeous, with mansions and beaches flanking the school. The staff is caring, kind, and interested in the success of their students. The student life experience is heavily focused around the people and communities you surround yourself with. This school is best for those who love fostering strong personal relationships across different groups."
Niche User,5,"When I went there over the summer to do a college visit it was the first one I had ever done in my life so I wasn't really looking forward to it all that much. But when I got there I quite literally fell in love with every bit of it. The location, the people, the environment, the campus, all of it. I thought the school was perfect for me."
Niche User,5,"The location and people are great. Everyone is very nice and the close knit community is awesome. All the teachers are very helpful and willing to work with you. The campus is very cool with old mansions for most the classes and some dorms. It sits up on the water. Newport is also a very fun town and there is lots to do there from parties to out door activities. Boston and providence are very close and many people go there on the weekends. sports games are also fun. they are well attended for the most part. in the summers it gets more crowded due to tourists, but in the fall and winter is only the locals and the Salve students. I highly recommend Salve"
Junior,5,"This is a great school. With only about 2,500 undergraduates, there is a small, community feel. The school is very welcoming to all people. The classes are small, and thus the professors truly get to know you and care about your success. There are many school-promoted activities throughout the week and even on weekends to keep students involved and engaged in the Salve community."
Sophomore,5,"Salve Regina University has built an amazing community within Newport. Academically, I believe that most of the professors have a genuine passion for teaching and it definitely shows in the classroom. They are willing to go above and beyond for students to shine. 

Salve strives to show its diversity through multicultural education week and teach students about different cultures. The alumni connections are great. They love coming back as guest speakers and networking events. The value of the Salve experience goes far beyond the price."
Senior,5,"Salve Regina University is amazing in all aspects. It's been amazing and just great in every way possible! The housing is the best. I love the food and the teachers are ok. The fact that this school is great is no mistake. The area around is perfect for social hang outs. Newport is great with many diverse bars and restaurants. No restaurants however, can measure up to Salve Regina's amazing dining hall; Miley Hall- located right near Slave Regina's famous admissions building; Ochre Court. Going to Salve Regina is a great experience. I've met so many wonderful friendss, co workers and teachers here. The beachy atmosphere is perhaps the most unique aspect of this schools campus."
Junior,5,"Salve Regina is a beautiful campus located in Newport, RI. Their amazing staff is beyond helpful with anything a student may need regarding transfer info, financial aid and advising. Before I transferred to Salve, I was taking courses at community college. I was worried if these courses would transfer over to the university. The advisors were so caring and helpful they allowed me to send an email of each semester showing the courses I was taking at my school. They reviewed each one and notified me right away to let me know they would transfer to my major of Business Marketing. Overall, the staff and community is what makes Salve so great."
Sophomore,5,"Salve is a great school. The teachers are caring and accommodating, while remaining challenging. The campus activities board always has something to do and students can always be found at the hockey and football games. Overall, it is a great place to go to school!"
Junior,5,"I am finishing up my time here at Salve Regina University, and I have very few complaints. The faculty here is very accommodating. It can prove to be a burden managing academics, work, social life and mental health all at the same time. It often becomes a burden on physical health as well. Professors are aware of the difficulties placed on students and do their best to help you succeed in all aspects of your life. The area is also incredible, of course. Being on the water and being in a town where something is always happening keeps students involved in the community and gives them an opportunity to try out new jobs and meet new people."
Sophomore,5,"My experience has been great and the staff and professors have been wonderful, the campus and location is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"Salve Regina University is a very clean and safe campus. It has beautiful buildings and a gorgeous view of the ocean. The students on campus are very kind and accepting, and every professor is so kind and helpful. Salve Regina could use some help on their food and meal options. The community around campus is very clean as well and is very safe. The student life on campus is not a party atmosphere, but it is fun. There is always so much to do around campus. The Pell Honors program is also an amazing feature that Salve Regina has. The Pell Program has its own housing, classes, and fun events! Overall, Salve Regina is an amazing university."
Freshman,5,So far I have seen a similar enviroment like my highschool because the teachers are always willing to give you help when needed however they will push you to do your best.
Freshman,5,"Salve Regina University is an amazing school! I toured many colleges but no other school is like Salve Regina University. The campus is beautiful. The campus is right next to the ocean and it is surrounded by historic mansions. It is also a very safe campus. All the professors are so nice and welcoming. The professors are very eager to help their students become successful.  The Salve community is very welcoming and their are many clubs and athletic teams to participate in. The school offers different dorm options. All the dorms are very nice.  The food selection is awesome. The cafeteria has all different types of foods, drinks, and snacks."
Senior,5,What I love most is the community aspect of Salve. I have been able to pursue all of my passions (they are very diverse) while here at Salve and would highly recommend it to any graduating high school students. I cannot wait to continue my education there as a graduate student.
Sophomore,5,Salve offers many opportunities to learn beyond the classroom. The professors care about your future and take the time to get to know you. You call in love the second you walk onto the campus with its incomparable history of mansions transformed into classrooms and the ocean gleaming endlessly as you look out off the Cliff Walk to the gorgeous views Rhode Island secretly has to offer.
Freshman,5,"Salve Regina is amazing. It has a very good retention rate, and it makes you feel at home. Salve is another little world, and only people who know what is good for them choose Salve."
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the daily living that I experience at Salve. The students are all very nice and the staff and faculty are there for you and involved. Newport is a great place to be in and I feel safe at all times. I would change the high cost of college in general so it would be less stressful getting out of school with less of a financial obligation.
Freshman,5,"Salve Regina University is a beautiful school, with amazing professors and academics.  Their academic buildings have state of the art equipment, the school has a very close-knit community and a great atmosphere."
Niche User,5,Salve Regina is an excellent school that cares so much about their students and also spread the Catholic faith in everyday teaching. The sports here are also very good and competitive at the division 3 level. The parties are a great time too just to add on.
Alum,5,Small class size; beautiful location:  supportive faculty; work study program was tailored to my strengths
Freshman,5,It was the perfect fit for me. An absolute dream school with professors that truly care about your success. 10/10 would recommend to anyone that likes small school settings.
Freshman,5,"Salve Regina University is a small university located in the heart of Newport, Rhode Island. It has provided so many opportunities within my first semester alone that have allowed me to open myself to a whole world of adventures. The campus is absolutely stunning and it is small enough to battle through walking to class even on the coldest of days. The professors are beyond exceptional in what they do and ensure their students are on the road for success. Because Salve is such a small university, it allows professors to create a stronger bond with their students and therefore ensure personal help to those who need it. There are dozens upon dozens of clubs to join to get involved on campus or to get together with friends. It seems with each week completed at Salve I not only gain valuable information for my future career but also information about Salve or Newport that makes me anxious for the next days of opportunities."
Alum,5,I was just as happy to graduate from Salve as I was when I received my acceptance letter.  This community is like a family where they encourage success and are willing to guide students towards degree completion.  Salve provides a very well rounded college experience.  I would select this university again if I was a Senior.
Alum,5,"I completed my undergraduate degree here at Salve and I loved it. It is definitely a small school, but that was one of the reasons I enjoyed it so much. The class sizes are small, the campus is in an amazing location, and it is so easy to get involved in the student community."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Salve Regina University! Their social work program is absolutely amazing. The professors care about you and will do anything to help you succeed. They were founded by the Sisters of Mercy and the act of mercy on others is embedded into the curriculum, in which I find very valuable."
Freshman,5,"My admissions experience was wonderful, the staff always had answers to my questions. They made the college application process during my senior year a lot less stressful. Im so excited to be starting my freshman year there this fall."
Alum,5,"Although a little pricey, the education I received at Salve was top notch! The historic aspect of the campus coupled with the cliff walk, makes the campus like something out of a picture!"
Junior,5,"Salve Regina is an awesome university that can be whatever you make it. Those who think otherwise are entitled to their opinion, but in reality all that Salve takes is a little effort and it can be one of the best experiences you’ve ever had. If that’s not something that interests you that’s fine too, it’s not for everyone, but neither is any college. If you do choose to come to Salve and choose to make it the place you want to live, you won’t be disappointed. The school has resources and influence that people often overlook and take for granted. Come to Salve and find out what it’s really about."
Senior,5,"I have loved my experience here at Salve. The community is very tight-knit and welcoming. For a Catholic school, it is very progressive. They truly try to accommodate for people's needs to make them feel comfortable here."
Niche User,5,Highly recommend Salve!  The campus is beautiful!  The staff are exceptional.  The school has a state of the art science building which they invested into recently.  If your looking for a small school in a prime location this school should most definitely be on your radar.  They are growing & expanding!
Junior,5,Salve Regina is a beautiful and unique university that puts their students' interests first. This school helps each student and faculty member feel at home and accepted in every area. As an education major I feel as though I get the best first hand experience that is possible in comparison to other universities that offer similar programs. I feel beyond prepared to join the work force and this is because Salve goes above and beyond to help me achieve in every area possible.
Niche User,5,I really liked how Salve Regina presented themselves. They seem very organized and are really on top of things. Class sizes are small and the professors truly care about the success of their students.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Salve!  I would never want to go anywhere else, considering I don't think any other campus could compare to Salve's."
Sophomore,5,"Loved it, but feels somewhat small sometimes! Great area, and it's so nice to always be looking at the ocean. The dorms are often old mansions and so beautiful."
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus, kind students, caring faculty. Not much more you could ask for in a university of this caliber."
Alum,5,"Salve was absolutely the right college choice for me after high school. The ability to double major and hold a variety of leadership positions, while staying involved in the campus and local community was exactly what I was looking for. Newport was an amazing home away from home during my college years and I am fortunate to have a wide circle of incredible friends that I still keep in touch with years after graduation. "
College Freshman,5,"Overall the school itself and the environment are amazing, and the students are even better I can't wait to start learning here!"
College Freshman,5,They have a lot of diversity programs
College Freshman,5,Im not a big partier so other than alcohol I have not encountered any drugs or peer pressure.
College Freshman,5,High degree value/job opportunities after college
College Freshman,5,Professors are mostly wicked nice and very educated in what they teach. Classes are awesome
College Freshman,5,"large rooms, large closets, options for private bathrooms"
College Freshman,5,"Salve feels like home, and I know that the nurses that come out of here are highly sought after by a lot of hospitals"
College Junior,5,my school hasan amazing nursing program reputation i am hoping it is preparing me for the future
College Freshman,5,We all feel extremely safe on campus. Safety and security officers are always on patrol and we have our own mobile ambulance type thing. The officers are always ready to help if you need them and most are retired police officers.
College Freshman,5,"My professors all know me not as a number, and not just as a student but as a whole person. They know where I'm from and what I like to do and about my family. They are passionate people who really make connections with their students to encourage them to their own success."
College Freshman,5,"Where else can you live in historic homes this beautiful? Many residence halls are a short distance away from the famous cliff walk or have a cool ocean view. The homes have really been converted for student use well, and only freshman don't have kitchens in their dorms."
College Freshman,5,"Salve is a great campus community with lots of opportunities to meet people across grade levels, majors, and club or sports affiliations. The faculty are a vibrant part of the community, always around for lunch and offering lectures on campus. It's also a beautiful place to live, especially when you catch a glimpse out of your classroom window."
College Freshman,5,"Students can live in mansions, whats better than that?"
Freshman,4,"Salve Regina University has professional, supportive staff members from Professors to Housekeeping. The campus is absolutely jaw dropping with water right out of our windows, and classes inside donated mansions. The landscaping is kept beautiful and Downtown Newport is a five minute bus ride. Transportation running almost 24 hours a day is included in tuition with endless benefits of student discounts around Newport. The only disadvantage is the food in the dining hall, especially because freshman are required to have an unlimited meal plan."
Junior,4,"When it came to online learning, professors worked really hard to transition in such a small amount of time. They worked collaboratively with each other, and really made this difficult time of online learning, as easy and seamless as possible. With that being said, the reason that I did not give more stars is that I wish that this transition had been as seamless across the board. And I realized the reason why I do not attend college online because this was not my favorite. But Salve made every effort to make this transition as great as possible."
Junior,4,"I could not be happier with my choice of coming to Salve. I love living in Newport, the cliff walk is located right on campus and walking to the beaches in the early fall and spring are the best! The professors are caring and want you to succeed and  I have made the most amazing friends. There are also a ton of clubs to join and activities to participate in. I also love going to the athletic games."
Sophomore,4,"Salve Regina University is an amazing good that has a lot of opportunities to offer. The academics and professors are amazing. Also who doesn't want to go to school by the ocean?! On the contrary, Salve has a very dry campus. If you are looking for a party school, it's not the school for you. Additionally, Salve is a mostly white university so diversity is not their strongest suite."
Freshman,4,"I like the personal connections you make all around the school, whether it's with other students, neighbors, or professors. Everyone is willing to help you succeed at this school. The location is great and there are plenty of activities where you can meet people. One small issue is that there is only one dining hall, but there are other food options along campus in addition."
Sophomore,4,Great small school in a fantastic location. Campus is very small and is not built for large freshman classes so I expect the acceptance rate to go down a bit. Class sizes are high school size with a great opportunity for 1 on 1 with professors. I would highly recommend Salve to anyone who doesn’t mind a small school.
Graduate Student,4,The experience at Salve was definitely one of a kind. I always remembered people asking me as a African American woman why did I not go to an HBCU? and I would always respond that Salve was one of the only schools who were willing to be accommodating to my family and I needs when it came to scholarships and financial aid. It meant a lot because the financial aspect of attending college was one of my biggest fears!
Junior,4,"The campus area is beautiful. It is just a few minute walk from the cliff-walk, where you can take a stroll and view the ocean and historic mansions. What makes Salve Regina different is that you may have classes in a historic mansion, or even live in a historic home. Classes are usually small, which makes it easy to connect to your professor and other students. Professors care about their students and the subjects that they are teaching. Because Salve is a university founded on Merciful values, you will learn in a way which opens you to have empathy. The only downfall of this university is that it has only one dining hall and the weather may be a bit rainy, cloudy or windy at times. However, the town of Newport is great because of its tasty restaurants and nice water scenery. For those who love the beach, small groups, and historic settings, this university may be right for you!"
Junior,4,"I am a junior biology major with minors in psychology and chemistry at Salve.  The biology department has been hiring and rehiring people so its not very consistent, but the teacher I have learned from have helped me excel in my classes.  Miley (dining hall) needs to change up what they serve, and sometimes you look at things and dont want to go near them.  Our campus is gorgeous, and town offers alot of other food options, shopping and activities.  There is also always something going on on campus during weekends."
Sophomore,4,"I really like living at Salve! I’m a psychology major and a theatre minor and the theatre program is surprisingly wonderful, especially because I hadn’t heard much about it. The psychology professors are great and get to know the students very well. Campus is beautiful and I love my sophomore dorming. The only downside is the meal program food isn’t very good and there aren’t a ton of meal options, but there are a lot of great local restaurants and when you’re a sophomore there is a kitchen available."
Junior,4,"Salve Regina is a great school equipped with many opportunities for success. I really enjoy its small, tight-knit community. That way you can get to know your classmates as well as your professors. The campus is beautiful, with its mansions that you can live in, as well as easy access to the cliff walk (it's part of our campus :) ). The areas that are lacking at Salve are definitely diversity and food. Salve is a predominately white school and it definitely needs to step up its diversity. Salve only has one main dining hall, many times there are not enough options and there is little variety, especially on the weekends. The dining hall participates in events like Mardi Gras where the food is delicious, so they are capable of cooking good food, but they do not do so everyday. However, Salve has been working to improve both of these categories, and in the two years I have been there I have definitely noticed some improvement."
Junior,4,"I love Salve, I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. The campus is undeniably beauftiful and Newport is the perfect location. I have experienced some disappointment with the professors, they're all qualified but many hold outdated ideas and are unable to work with students. My department only has one professor, she is overworked and takes it out on us. The party life and experience at salve becomes excellent once you're 21, till then its lacking."
Niche User,4,"My son toured over 21 college campuses and applied to 12. He got into to several colleges but chose Salve. He liked the smaller campus feel and absolutely loved the campus on the ocean filled with mansions.  The main academic building (O'Hare) was recently renovated (I believe the upgrades were $26 million) including state-of-the-art laboratories and classrooms. He loves the school and the key is to get involved with sports, clubs, volunteering, study groups, and social activities in the dorm. If you are looking for a large college or big time Division I sports, this is probably not your school. However,  if you are looking for a solid school that is on the smaller side with a beautiful campus located in a resort town and personalized attention from professors then you should check out Salve Regina. We were overjoyed when our son said ""I have no doubt this was the best choice for me and I love this place""."
Freshman,4,"I am a currently a first-year at Salve Regina, ending my second semester. My first year so far has been great. The resources and the community at Salve Regina are definitely available and open to everyone on campus. Although, the diversity rate is a bit low I was still able to find those with similar backgrounds and interests as me."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I am really enjoying my time at Salve. It is perfect for me size wise, as I did not want to have to travel or walk far to attend my classes. The class sizes are also small enough to be able to know your professor personally and get the help you need. Salve is a very diverse and accepting school that I am proud to be attending."
Junior,4,"I love Salve Regina because it is a close-knit environment that welcomes anyone who wishes to join the community. I experienced this when I first toured the campus, which was the indicator that made me choose to attend Salve."
Sophomore,4,"Overall Salve is a wonderful university. One where the professors, students, and staff create a community of kindness, making the campus feel like a home. Though it is a small school its impact is large, as Salve gives each student different opportunities and opens many doors depending on the individual's path. Personally, I have been able to take advantage of many life-changing opportunities, such as studying abroad and diving into community service, all of which I have Salve to thank. All in all, I believe Salve is a university like no other, one that gives back to their students and makes time for the individual."
Freshman,4,I have had a great experience thus far at Salve. My professors have been very helpful and seem to care about their students. The overall feeling of the school is warm and welcoming.
Freshman,4,I love how Salve Regina University became a very welcoming community for me. The professors are always dedicated to helping me learn and experience my education in a unique way.
Sophomore,4,The campus is breathtaking.  The diversity of majors is great.  The professors are always anxious to help you succeed with small class size and extra hours for consulting and tutoring.
Senior,4,"Salve Regina is a great community if you look in the right places. Obviously sticking to cliques and niches isn't going to help you. It's very easy to get involved on campus while balancing work load and a social life. As a senior, I'm satisfied with what I've experienced at Salve; however, I would improve on its diversity, the school's mission integration, and assessing the five critical Mercy concerns. Although diversity and academics could be improved just like at any other school, Salve has given me plenty of opportunities to grow as a person. Since it is a smaller school, Salve has given me great, personal connections and lifelong friends."
Freshman,4,This is my first year at the school. I am an art major there. I was thinking of transforing when i got extrememly home sick but some teachers are just so great there and the art department is like a family i couldnt imaine going anywhere else. Truely love it there overall
Freshman,4,"Campus is beautiful , renovations completed on the main academic building are great. Dorms great, offer good variety. Majority of the profs. care for students and want to see them succeed. Classes are not too large-you have the ability to know your professors & classmates. Nice student amenities -free laundry, free admission to local mansions, free public transportation. Plenty of local restaurants/cafes/bars. Great shopping in Downtown Newport, lots of local history & beauty.
Pretty dead on the winter weekends-especially for those who don't like to party but still ""want fun"" -if you want a party you can def find one-otherwise you either chill in the dorm/watch movies with friends, go downtown (limited Winter activity), day trip, or go home if close. 
Food on the weekends is awful-bring freezer meals/ready-made food or be prepared to order/go out. Health Center is a joke-find a doc/walk in clinic in the area or stock up on VitaminC and never get sick (impossible in dorms)."
Sophomore,4,I love salve Regina university. All of the people at the school (faculty and staff) they are extremely friendly and personable. The connections that I have made with everyone I come in contact with has been great. Having that close relationship with my professors has really helped me excel in my classes because they know me and I felt comfortable asking questions when I was struggling .
College Sophomore,4,"So far my experience at Salve Regina has been amazing. I've loved getting to know the other nursing students and having a nursing advisor. My school hosts a lot of community service activities and has a lot of clubs, which make the school great and the people are really outgoing and care for the community. My school is beautiful, and is unique because we live in and around some of the Newport mansions, and are just a few feet away from the ocean! I would stick with my school if I were to choose again, because I always have fun, have made life long friends, and am confident in becoming a nurse straight from graduating."
College Junior,4,"Salve's athletic are a pretty big part of campus life depending on the sport. Usually basketball, football and rugby seem to be the most popular from my perspective."
College Junior,4,"I am an upcoming junior attending Salve and so far it has been a great experience. Aside from a little home sickness freshman year, Salve has encouraged me to grow as a person academically and mentally. I have met some of the best people I have ever met in my entire life in the two short years I have attended Salve Regina. There are a multitude of options for students that are struggling in a particular class and always someone willing to help. Aside from this, Newport is a great place to live. There is always something to do and many ways to get involved with the community. It is also cool meeting people from all over the world not only from Salve, but because of the many tourists that visit Newport. There are also many opportunities for employment. Many businesses are always looking for hardworking college students. I myself, work at Flo's Clam Shack in Middletown and absolutely love it. Salve is an amazing school and I would highly recommend it to students who are willing to work hard, want a small school and strive for success."
College Freshman,4,"Campus is pretty secure, and there is a lot of advertisement of support for violence"
College Junior,4,"Salve Regina is a community that really cares about you. It is a beautiful campus with plenty of activities and opportunities to get to know each other. The housing is less than optimal rarely and you get to live in MANSIONS. There is a party scene but if you don't want to be part of it, there is no peer pressure. The professors really care and want you to succeed. They give up hours from their week to answer your emails and meet with you. It really is a wonderful school and I am so glad that I came here."
College Freshman,4,I feel very comfortable at Salve and I was able to adjust very well.  The professors are very friendly and understand situations if you have any issues.  I find this school to be equivalent to a large family.
College Freshman,4,"Everything is great, I work hard so I get good grades"
College Freshman,4,Living on campus freshman year I was in suite style because I am in the honors program and that was a definite perk. Some of the housing options are gross and the atmosphere in each building is very different. I really lucked out for my first year. The housing lottery for next year is extremely poorly organized and I am dreading it.
College Freshman,4,I have had a very good experience at Salve so far!
College Freshman,4,"The gym is awesome for non-athletes, but recently some of the equipment has started breaking. They are surrently working to fix it"
College Junior,4,"i love my school and my school experience it is just so expensive i dont think i am getting my money's worth... especially when i cannot minor in anything because i am a nursing major, unless i pay to go abroad somewhere over the summer or pay for summer classes or pay to over load and i just dont have themoney"
College Freshman,4,"Career services will hold onto all your records for up to 10 years after you graduate. If you ever need help with resume building or interview skills or even looking for a new position, they will help you just like you are a student through those 10 years."
College Freshman,4,"Its hard to go to games since most are off campus and theres no transportation for many students, or you often dont know what time or when or where a game is."
College Freshman,4,There are shuttles and blue lights i feel safe
College Freshman,4,"Being in nursing, my workload is pretty tough and time consuming. Nursing is VERY competitive and is by far the toughest major here, and you need to have higher grades than other majors to stay in the program.  The nursing, education, and bio programs here at Salve are really great. The professors really know what they're talking about and really want you to succeed."
College Freshman,4,"People drink and smoke here at salve, but it's nothing crazy. I've heard a lot of horror stories from my friends at other schools, and nothing like  that really happens here. Of course there's some outliers but for the most part nothing crazy really happens, it's your average college. I feel really safe here."
College Freshman,4,"I feel really safe at Salve. Most people here understand their boundaries and are all here to do the right thing. The security is great, although nothing crazy really happens here. It's a really safe campus and drug conscious."
College Freshman,4,"for our top programs like nursing, education, and biology there are a lot of great options for internships. The professors and career center really want to help make sure you're all set after graduation and provide a lot of opportunities for students."
College Freshman,4,"The courses at Salve are great at long as you're interested and the professors want you to succeed. You just have to put in work, especially if you're in a tougher major like Nursing or Biology.  Class sizes are small and you really get to know everyone and your professors."
College Freshman,4,I love living on campus. Everything is so close and the dorms are really nice. Right now I live in a suite which is really spacious and we have our own bathroom. Upperclassmen even get to live in mansions which is absolutely crazy. The housing is definitely worth what you pay for.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Salve are pretty good for being D3, we have a really good rugby team and a lot of people sign up for intramurals. I use the gym upstairs a lot which is where a lot of the non-athletes and girls go. It's really nice and has a lot of high tech machines that are updated frequently."
College Freshman,4,"I'm a freshman nursing major and I love Salve. All of my teachers are great, and classes are really interesting if you invest yourself in them. I live in a suite because I'm in the honors program and it's really great. People are really nice for the most part, of course there are some that are stuck up, but I've met so many amazing and down to earth people. You really just need to find your group. My nursing classes can be a little difficult and time consuming, but it's nursing, and here they have a really great program and are even in the middle of building brand new labs. The teachers here really care about you and want you to succeed, and we have a BEAUTIFUL campus. Especially in the nursing department, we're always there for one another. Some may say the campus is small and doesn't have a huge party scene, and they're right but it's what you make of it. I love the size of the school and that I can wake up and get to class within 10 minutes whereas my friends at these huge schools have to take busses to their cafeteria and classes. There's a lot to love at Salve and I really think it's an amazing place to live and learn."
College Sophomore,4,I love the course options!
College Sophomore,4,I really love most of my professors and enjoy all classes.
College Sophomore,4,As an RA for freshmen I believe that we have been able to built a great community in each of the buildings and everyone seems to have respect towards one another. Our buildings are also beautiful although in the summer air conditioning is an issue.
College Sophomore,4,It's a small school that truly believes in its mission which is full of compassion and mercy which is exactly what I was looking for.
College Freshman,4,Almost everyone know who lives their floor.
College Freshman,4,all the athlets in all sports are really great players.
College Freshman,4,It has many great programs.
College Sophomore,4,Our sports teams are some of the best in New England DIII and very competitive. Not many people attend a lot of sporting events besides football. They most popular in the winter is hockey and in the spring is baseball. A lot of the athletic fields are not on campus which is annoying.
College Sophomore,4,"Coming to Salve was an awesome decision! The coursework is really hard in certain majors, but your professors really want you to succeed and are there for your needs. Getting involved and making friends is super easy!"
College Freshman,4,Alot of people attend sporting events and support the teams. A big portion of people that I know at Salve participate in either club sports or varsity sports and it is a big part of campus life.
College Sophomore,4,Nursing is hard but in a good way. There isn't always stuff to do on campus but there are usually parties.
College Sophomore,4,"Although some of the other academics are not that challenging, nursing challenges me everyday in a good way"
College Freshman,4,The academics are great and the small campus allows for easy access to different parts of the university and a connection with professors.
College Sophomore,4,"It's a small, beautiful campus that is easy to form strong relationships at. Professors work hard to make themselves available for any need that the student has. They work completely around what's best for the student."
College Freshman,2,"YES our school revolves around athletics... wouldn't that mean that the administration would take them seriously??? nope. Salve needs to step up their game with the facilities, coaches, and management if our school is going to be taken seriously."
College Freshman,2,We are only Division 3 so no one really takes them seriously. Even the athletes do not seem like they enjoy playing. We do not have any fields on campus so no one attends the sporting events. The gym is way too small for the demand and has extremely limited hours.
College Freshman,2,"There is not a true ""party scene"" at Salve. Since there is no Greek life, the sports teams throw the only ""major parties."" Everyone pretty much hangs out with everyone and there is drinking like every college. I like that there is no real party scene because we're here to learn and grow at college, not drink every night and party."
College Freshman,2,They don't give enough financial aid to really help with the burden of the fees.
College Freshman,2,"If you don't mind living off of pizzas, cereal, and the mongolian grill you will be fine here. I personally don't eat dairy and I had a very hard time getting enough fuel here. I have also found 2 moldy bagels in my existence here. Also, on the weekends a lot of people leave campus, so half of the cafeteria shuts down leaving you with even less options."
College Freshman,2,"Mostly white, upperclass, and conservative."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few parties here, and no, it does not get better with time. The beginning of the year I went to parties and the upperclassmen were so rude to the freshmen it was sickening. I left immediately, they were very unwelcoming. Most parties also get busted by 12, even though they are very small. Overall, if you dream of the typical college party experience this is not for you, all parties are very small and include very little mingling. At a typical Salve party you'll just find poser prepsters taking snap-chat pics with red solo cups."
College Freshman,2,"Newport is fun for the first month I was here. However, with time I started to wish I was in a more humble, down-to-earth town. There are always many tourists and the stores are all touristy. Very soon you will get tired of buying ""RhodeIsland Tourist"" Tees and you'll want to go to a real store that you'd find at the mall. Convenience stores like Walmart and Target are out of reach and require going on a trolley then bus, but there is a local CVS with little selection. I didn't like Newport because it seemed too preppy and old-ladyish with all the J Crew stores and Talbots, but some people like the charm. It gets old fast though, especially if you don't have loads of money."
College Freshman,2,"Its Newport, so you only get expensive restaurants. There aren't any fast food restaurants which is about the only thing most college students can afford. Go to the Newport Creamery, its easy and closebye."
College Sophomore,2,"As a D3 school, nobody really cares about the sports teams. It is rare that people will go out to support the teams."
College Junior,2,Not very diverse at all
College Student,2,"There is literally no diversity on campus. There are very little people from other countries, there are not that many people of other races, you know pretty much everyone on campus that is different. I dont know anyone with a different religion other than some form of Catholicism."
College Freshman,2,"Our food is not the best.  I have to eat gluten free and it has always been a pain.  However, at Salve it is not very good at all.  They do not have any options for us and do not invest a lot of time and energy into our dishes. "
College Freshman,2,Parking is slim but its reasonable. A need for a car on campus isn't too mandatory. It is convenient but not needed. 
College Freshman,2,The guys at this school tend to be jocks and stuck up. Most of them have no reason to be rude because they're not attractive. They are mainly focused on themselves and sports. They tend to dress preppy and like to party. 
College Freshman,2,The food is terrible. They need more options in the dining hall and more healthy food. They close very early which makes it hard for people that have activities in the evening to get dinner. 
College Freshman,2,The campus shuttle is very convenient in the evenings but should be able to be used during the day. Public transportation is sometimes not the most reliable thing to utilize. The cost is free to us so that makes it more convenient. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"Locally, there isn't much to do in Newport until your about 21 years old. There are many more options in the summer when tourism is high and beaches are free options. Safety is of the utmost in this area since it is a small town and 'everyone knows everyone.'"
College Freshman,2,"Many of the girls at Salve are set on just hooking up with guys and partying. It's difficult to find a girl that won't judge. It's hard to make friends here, because many are not willing to open up and let others in. I find that the guys are similar here."
College Freshman,2,Barely anywhere to park. No freshman cars are allowed because of it.
College Freshman,2,it's pretty average. i have never gotten in trouble.
College Freshman,2,"Some class are not engaging, although most professors seem interested. While some classes are smaller, one-on-one time doesn't necessarily happen with your professor. Unless you are enrolled in either the political science, education, or nursing programs, you're not getting a very good education. There isn't much variation or individualism in your education either; you follow the rules, courses and guidelines the school sets for you."
College Sophomore,2,"There is enough parking for everyone, but parking tickets are too expensive."
College Freshman,2,"Newport is a beautiful town, but don't be fooled if you visit Salve in the summer. It is not too great in the colder months. Shops close and the town is empty. It is extremely dull while school is in session. The mansions are beautiful but it gets old fast. There isn't much to do but look at it."
College Sophomore,2,"It actually has gotten better since last semester however it is still lacking. Def needs to be better. Most people here are white and females. you fo have your occasional asian and thereare a few African Americans, but it is still few and far between. I really do not have a problem with it It would just be nice to see a little bit more color"
College Sophomore,2,"I was never much into sports in highschool, and even less now that I'm in college. I don't know much about the sports at Salve but I know that girls basketball and men's rugby did very well last year."
College Sophomore,2,"Its Okay – Miley dining hall tries to have a variety of ethnic foods there but they mostly have the same foods every week. Once in a while there would be something different. You have very limited dining hall choice. Your choices are Miley, Wakehurst, or The Original Burger. The food is just okay. I would still pick my mothers cooking over Salve's food any day."
College Sophomore,2,Salve is a small campus so parking is tight. There is enough parking for those that live on campus but those that live off campus have to park on the streets.  Street parking isn't permitted overnight.
College Freshman,2,"White on White on White – swaggggggggggg.  but not really. there was no diversity at this school. every girl wears yoga pants, northface jackets, and ugg boots. The guys all play some kind of sport and are way too proud for their division III victory... every sport is referred to as a 'motherf****** brotherhood' by the participants. all the 'athletic' boys carry around legitimate gallons of water termed 'swag bottles'. what the.. seriously."
College Freshman,2,"Academic Sphere – The teachers are either nice or biased. There are a few gems, but others are poor choices. The Pell honors program has teachers who stink, yet teach the subject that honors students are required to take! There is a math teacher who's native tongue is german and nearly incomprehensible, YET TEACHES MATH! When working on my transfer application, hardly any teacher or faculty member would give me the time of day, much less help me with the process!"
College Freshman,2,rich people renting their sub par facilities to eager college kids who wish to live off campus because school housing is so putrid.
College Freshman,2,Security can be real sticklers about parking violations and give out tickets readily. There are a lot of parking spots but a lot of people have their cars on campus and there are always tourist that take sport so they fill up fast.  Freshman cannot have cars on campus.
College Student,2,"if you do not drive a bmw, mercedes, lexus etc. you are probably not going to make many friends. people here have money and love to show it. they all stay with their little clicks and act really cocky. if you went to public school, automatically not able to be associated with because you are not in their class because they all went to prep schools and private high schools. the gym is awful it is the size of my basement at home and always have to wait to use weights. the campus however is in a great area if you are 21 or have a fake. thames street would be a lot of fun if i was 21 and parties are almost non-existant anywhere if your a guy unless you have about 6 girls with you. people walk around like they are better than everyone and it is hard to talk to people. if your not on a sports team you will have a hard time meeting people. if you are on a sports team however, you will probably have fun in a great area"
College Senior,2,"uptight, religious, however they did start to slacken the rules for 21+ students during the 2010-2011 and on academic years"
College Junior,2,"Not Very Supportive – Salve's athletics are there, but we are not very good and no one goes to support them. The gym is very tiny and everyone has to share it with the athletes, even though sometimes there isn't any room in there because the athletes are all there together."
College Junior,2,"There are a lot of bars in Newport, but if you're not 21, there is not much else to do"
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of people participate in athletics but no on really goes to the games. None of the teams do that well, so no one really shows any school spirit or attends the games, and the university does not do a good job of notifying when/where games take place."
College Junior,2,Night Life – Salve does not really have parties in the dorms. If students want to go out they usually go to the houses of people who live off campus. A lot of the sport teams have houses off campus and that is where a majority of the parties take place. A lot of kids also go to the clubs in Providence. If you don't know someone its hard to get into the party scene.
College Freshman,2,It is annoying to have to park at school because people constantly get tickets and when parents come to pick you up it is a hassle.
College Freshman,2,Not Big – Drugs are not that popular here.  Especially not anything that that is hardcore.
Freshman,1,"I was very excited to come to Salve, but after a few months on campus, I realized I made a big mistake. The teachers here are friendly, but the work is not challenging at all; it feels like high school. Also if your looking for a school to party at every weekend do not come to Salve. Only parties thrown are from the sports teams, but they get shut down by 12. everyone just ends up drinking in a cramped dorm room while trying to hide from RA's it gets very boring and repetitive. Lastly, the food is terrible. The Miley dining hall has minimal options and never changes its menu. The food unedible and never cooked properly. It also closes very early, which makes having a late dinner after evening activities impossible. Overall I do not recommend Salve Regina University and will be transferring as soon as possible."
College Freshman,1,We dont have Greek life
College Freshman,1,We do not have a greek life at Salve Regina
College Freshman,1,"I would have chosen Salve if I knew my experience would be like how it has been. If you aren't on a sports team, I would highly suggest you don't go here. It does help to be on clubs, but a lot of the clubs listed on the website don't even exist. So if you aren't on a sports team, it gets boring here fast. The parties are very small and high-schooly, the students are preppy and snobby, and lastly, there isn't anything fun to do on campus.

After my first semester, I have only been dissapointed by the people I have met here. Many people are excessively fake, and spend all their money on Vineyard Vines and Jcrew Sweaters to flaunt. Not only that, but after the first month of school everyone is in cliques, and it is very hard to switch into a new friend group. Often I would try hanging out with new people, but they would be cold and exclusive, to the point where I wouldn't reach out to them ever again. 

The academics are also very poor. The teachers give a lot of 'busy work' here that doesn't teach you anything. I have done so many papers that were completely irrelevant and didn't teach me anything. One for an assignment I had to do a 5 page paper evaluating the Salve Regina Webpage...later I found out that they were updating the website so I now know why I had to do that.

Overall, I would highly suggest you don't even apply here. Salve will give you a huge scholarship and make you feel special, but then you will get here and realized how deceived you were. Sure the campus is beautiful and Newport can be fun in the fall, but in the end, does that really matter? No. The campus appeal gets very tiring when nothing ever happens on it that is fun."
College Freshman,1,"No diversity here at all. Everyone thinks the same and has those vinevines whales on their laptops. Everyone that I have met here so far is not passionate and spends their free time online shopping and not bettering the world. Most of everyone here strikes me as a poser, and tries to be preppy. If you are a hipster or have a sense of individuality, I really would advise you to not go here."
College Freshman,1,"The sports teams are the only people who throw parties and apparently their idea of having fun is playing pong for hours on end and sitting around.No one goes crazy, or does anything that wild. They're not exciting and they usually get busted anyway. I'm someone who wanted a wild fun college experience and so far this school had been horrendously lame with parties and stuff like that."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life here.
College Freshman,1,"Salve is not what I thought it would be. It is a beautiful school but that is all it has going for it. The classes are not challenging, people are very selfish and self centered, and its constant pathetic attempt to party. Often I feel like I'm living in a real life version of mean girls and it's impossible to escape. The school does do a lot for students but Newport is very boring. The weekends are no fun because there is nothing to do but party and that not even good. Everyone is fake."
College Freshman,1,"It is mostly all girls that go here. Everyone is exactly the same and very two faced. There is one type of girl. The guys are all wannabe athletes who couldn't make it into a better sports schools and the girls are here for the beauty of the campus, not the academics. There is more drama here than I ever experienced in my life. People are mean and bully. I never experienced this personally but I have seen a lot of people hurt because their friends suddenly hated them. It is extremely childish and not what one would expect in college."
College Freshman,1,"There is no diversity and not just in race, economic status, or religion, but also personality. 95% of the girls are exactly the same. Snobby girls in northface jackets, jeans, sperrys, uggs, polo, leather boots, yoga pants. It is awful."
College Freshman,1,The classes are almost too easy. I was more challenged in high school. I have one teacher I really do find intelligent but he is such an easy grader and tells us all of the answers. The rest I do no work for the classes and I get good grades. I feel like for the amount of money I am paying I don't get much out of class. I think my money goes to preserving the school and not much important.
College Freshman,1,Salve's work is not a challenge. High school was much more of a challenge. I do almost nothing and get good grades. It's too easy and I feel like I'm learning nothing. I feel like I'm paying all of this money for little education.
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman, the weekends are entirely boring. Everyone does the same thing every weekend. All of the freshman focus their time on drinking however there is very little true party scene so much is done in the dorms and is honestly lame. I don't like to party and there is not much else to do. Newport is too expensive to go out often and it shuts down after October and doesn't have life again until May when we leave. I am not of age to go to bars yet so I can't rate that accurately. Freshman year weekends are more boring than the weekdays unless you enjoy drinking with overexcited dramatic girls in the rooms while hiding from RAs."
College Freshman,1,"The girls here are ALL THE SAME. If you're a young woman who prides themselves as an independent person, this is not the school for you. Also, most of the guys here are jerks. Though there are a few nice one's (mostly in the Pell Program) most guys here won't talk to you if you're a girl who is intellectual and doesn't fit the stereotypical mold of the Salve girls."
College Student,1,"NO FRESHMEN CARS – I wound't know about parking at school because freshman are not allowed to have cars on campus.  If by chance one were to have one for just the weekend, it is not an option to park on campus under any circumstances.  Newport is also very strict about parking on the street."
College Freshman,1,"Go to the Bars and Spend Tons of Money – Get a good fake I.D. and pad your pockets with cash, because other than that your night life will be non existent."
College Freshman,1,"Horrendous, Dirty, Gross, Dorms. Dorms are disgusting. No one cleans them. Bathrooms are not cleaned on weekends... puke all over the stalls. Holes ripped into the hallway walls. ABSOLUTE pig pen."
College Sophomore,1,everyone here is white. few black students or other ethnically diverse student body. the black students tend to stick together amongst each other.
College Freshman,1,"Don't Count on It – As a freshman, unless you have good connections with upperclassmen and can get to the house parties, good luck finding anything. Freshmen dorms are way too quiet on the weekends. A lot of people go to Providence for the clubs (especially 18+). There are many bars and liquor stores in town, but be careful. Personally I go to Roger Williams a lot, because there are always parties there."
College Senior,1,"If the security officers did not ticket their own students for parking in dorm spaces and instead focused their attention on tourists parking illegally, then the grade for this would not be so bad. There is a definite lack of parking, especially during high tourist seasons, and resident students are not allowed to park anywhere on campus except their allotted dorm spaces, and even then officers will ticket them if they are not in their exact spots. However, parking for commuter students is not so bad. You can either choose to pay the commuter parking permit to park in the commuter lots or you can just park a little further away on a side street to save $50.00"

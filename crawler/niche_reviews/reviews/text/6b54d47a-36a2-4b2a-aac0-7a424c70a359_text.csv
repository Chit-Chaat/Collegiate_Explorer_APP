Freshman,5,Online classes went well with easy access to all the instructors via email.  When we shifted to a hybrid model students were able to continue online if they felt more comfortable with it.
Freshman,5,It's great to have a Christ-centered education to bring you closer to God without having to wade through the junk of a public institution.
Senior,5,"William Jessup is a school that values community. Everything that they do is to foster a strong community of support, friendship, and love on their campus and that makes being there desirable! The professors are some of your best wisdom, friends, and are always fighting for your success. Each student is willing to step up and help you through prayer, support, and education."
Senior,5,"Professors truly hoped that you would succeed when we switched to online learning. They altered their lesson plans, were incredibly supportive academically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually as our daily lives changed so drastically."
Alum,5,I loved my online classes! Some of my favorite classes were online. It never felt lesser than in person classes and my teachers were always available.
Senior,5,My online course were well-organized and met my need as a commuter student with a part-time job. When we moved to distance learning due to Covid 19 I feel as though the teachers did well with the transition and I still received great content in my field.
Senior,5,I was a commuter student and worked part-time so my on campus experience was very limited. I feel as though I am prepared to begin my student teaching and eventually become a teacher.
Sophomore,5,"Jessup is amazing! So many friendly people, it's really hard to not have a few friends after a semester or two. The food at the cafeteria is really amazing, it's been voted the best restaurant in the area."
Junior,5,Very friendly sociable university. They treat you like you are a valuable family member. They care about you and want to help. This university is very active on singing and have so many performances to choose from. Love it here.
Junior,5,I love the community at Jessup! Everyone knows everyone at this university and the love of Christ is so surreal through peers and professors!
Freshman,5,"So far, the admissions and housing personnel have been amazing. What my friends have told me also seems great. Great staff and food. I can't wait to go in the fall."
Junior,5,"Still attending and am loving my experience here so far. This is a Christian college which means that the curriculum includes Christian ideals and principles. However, they are incorporated well. It never feels preachy or like beliefs are being shoved down your throat. Instead it is more about how Christians can have a positive role in society. Sometimes the climate can be a bit cheesy in like a modern Christian rock persuasion. This is very true during chapel. Despite this, it is a great school and it has helped me spiritually. I can't really say much on the housing and athletics because I don't live on campus nor do I care about sports. Diversity is interesting. A good chunk of the students are sheltered and innocent while others have gone through a lot. I said average because it is not the most diverse setting I've been in, but it is diverse enough to make it not boring."
Freshman,5,"As I am ending my freshman year at William Jessup, I have made many close relationships with my fellow classmates and had a very successful education so far. All of the professors I have had were all very encouraging and only wanted to see you succeed. They went out of their way to stay after class to tutor, met with you anytime you needed help and made it clear they were available. I know with bigger universities that may be harder, but at Jessup you really feel empowered by all the people around you."
Freshman,5,"I recently got accepted to William Jessup University and went to visit them for the first time for the preview day. Everything was just AMAZING in there, everything was well organized, the administration and counselors were super friendly and very helpful too. We got to visit some dorm rooms which were actually bigger than I expected and very cute. The food in there was so good too, just the salad bar was already delicious and the rest was even more. The area seemed to be very calm, friendly and safe. All the students that I met that already go there, seemed so happy to be there and not stressed at all (especially since finals are coming up). They told us about many activities that the college offers like before finals they have the teacher making pancakes at 11pm because they know students are up studying....
I loved their worship team and everything all Jessup, cant wait to start there for the fall :)"
Sophomore,5,"William Jessup is an amazing school. Everyone here, from the professors to the students are friendly and encouraging. The teachers are engaging, and the classes keep me challenged and interested."
Niche User,5,"William Jessup is an amazing school, when I went for a visit I felt so welcomed. There were many helpful people that were there. If I had a question, my tour guide was more than happy to answer. The school is very communal like, and I enjoy that very much."
Sophomore,5,"This is a GREAT college. The education and support from the professors, the administration, and the student workers. Everyone here is so supportive and helpful. They make sure you have all the tools to be very successful going into your career. The cafeteria serves excellent food. I cannot find all the words to describe this college and how amazing it is."
Sophomore,5,William Jessup is an amazing school. The students are welcoming and the professors really care about your education.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love William Jessup University! I love the Christ-centered education and atmosphere. The professors here genuinely care about the success of their students and they make sure to keep their doors and hearts open for their students.  The environment in general is just welcoming and when you walk on campus, the people there make sure to make you feel like you already belong."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love the cozy size of the university, it makes one on one time with a professor extremely helpful. The environment is so inclusive and tight-knit."
Sophomore,5,"The professors to start with, actually care about you as people and more importantly your walk with Christ. They also pour into you academically. The community is smaller for a college so you get to know everyone at least a little bit and quite a bit of people very well! It honestly felt like a new family for me as soon as I got there!"
Junior,5,"William Jessup is a great university with quality professors and staff. The close community there is amazing, and the environment is positive and supportive."
Junior,5,"Jessup is absolutely wonderful! It is in a great area with many different things to do on and off campus. The professors love to teach and are very good! The class sizes are relatively small, so the learning experience is that much greater. Other students are very friendly and friends are always around! Finally, they offer great degree programs and are continuously adding more."
Senior,5,"I love how they take care of me. They tell me what forms I needed to complete for financial aid, etc. They are also willing to discuss any questions I have and the professors are helpful and knowledgeable. I also take classes at the local community college and the difference is amazing."
Sophomore,5,"I love William Jessup. This school is affordable, safe, and the professors care. The teacher to student ratio is 13/1, which means your teachers know you and care about your success."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at William Jessup has been life changing. I have made friendships that will last through anything, and I have learned immeasurable skills that have prepared me for life in the real world. College life can seem daunting, especially when you are nearing graduations, but I feel pretty prepared to handle it and I know God's plan for my life is far more than I could ever expect it to be. I have grown in Him and as a person through this college environment"
Freshman,5,"I will be attending as a first time freshman in fall of 2018, but I have been on campus several times, interacted with students and staff, and spent the night in the dorms a couple of times. I absolutely love the campus vibe and cannot wait to be a student there!"
Freshman,5,I like how everyone is really nice and helpful. It is a blessing to go to a University where everyone practices the same religion as myself which is Christianity.
Sophomore,5,So far I have loved my college experience at William Jessup University.  The professors are real-life professionals in their field and are able to make the classes relevant.
Freshman,5,Jessup is a great college to apply to if your looking for a friendly Christ-centered environment. They provide many great resources with many teachers who have real world experience. Everywhere you look you will encounter friendly faces and genuine people.
Junior,5,William Jessup is a relatively small school that allows you to form strong relationships with other students and with your professors. The professors are devoted to helping you grow both in your knowledge and in your faith.
Sophomore,5,The teachers are engaging and care about their students. I am challenged to think critically and work diligently. It has a friendly atmosphere and has a strong community.
Sophomore,5,"I love my university. The way that everything revolves around people and relationships and Christ makes me want all my friends to come here. The people at Student Life care about Commuter Students, our Campus Pastor Ryan is very approachable and friendly, our President Jackson has the perfect word of encouragement to share during chapel, the list can go on and on. The music here is wonderful: Wednesdays and Fridays I go to chapel in the morning, and the atmosphere here is truly Godly. It's great to be here because people care. You are not just a number or body in a seat here, you are a person, and the faculty does care, and do want to meet you, and help if they can. Another thing, is that our school is well connected with the outside community, the city of Rocklin. There are connections here that will grow and shape our future leaders. The possibilities are endless. I will always be forever grateful for Jessup, and that the Lord led me to come here."
Sophomore,5,The people at William Jessup are some of the best people I've ever met. The professors really care about you and want you to succeed. The environment is really just amazing at Jessup.
College Sophomore,5,I feel completely positive that I will get a career thanks to the legacy of the school in the Rocklin area and the connections that I have been able to make thus far.
College Sophomore,5,I've never felt unsafe on campus and I've felt that there were always people to approach if needed.
College Sophomore,5,"So many of my friends at other colleges are itching to get out of their dorms asap because they are so small, require a meal plan that gives them terrible food, and are expensive. However, everything at Jessup is exactly the opposite of that for me and I am perfectly content and happy living on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"When I originally toured the school, I heard my guide saying everything that I now say to prospective students. I was told of how community-based that the school, students, and even professors were. However, I has no idea exactly how true those words were. This school is like a safe haven where you feel as if you can achieve anything and that you will always have people there to support you no matter what. Reading what I just wrote, it must seem silly. However, every single word is really true and I can't imagine being anywhere else."
College Sophomore,5,"I am not to the point yet where I am looking for internships, but I have no doubt that when I do, people will be there to help me.  The career center is always available, and the chair of my department is personally interested in his students' success.  Every semester the school has a chance for students to attend a meet and greet with professionals and potential employers, and there are numerous campus jobs available for students.  If I ever need work while enrolled at WJU, I know I will have it."
College Sophomore,5,"I've never felt endangered on campus, and no one I know of has either.  All students have to take an hour long sexual assault informational course, and are given contacts in case something did happen.  Safety is taken seriously, and I have not needed to use any of the available tools."
College Sophomore,5,"I am not personally involved in the campus sports, though I did participate in intramural Ultimate Frisbee this past semester.  But I've got to say, our teams are pretty amazing.  The whole school cheers them on, and it's a lot of fun."
College Sophomore,5,"I knew from the first tour I took of the campus that I wanted to attend William Jessup University.  That sentiment has not changed; I love my school.  All the students are friendly, the professors are welcoming, and the campus is beautiful.  WJU is sensitive to the financial needs of the students, and has been very generous and helpful with me.  I am learning so much, and there is no better place to get started in life than a place that genuinely wants to help you succeed.  Commuting as far as I do is tiring, and my heavy load of classes combined with theatre productions can be a struggle, but I wouldn't trade my experiences.  God has blessed this university, and I am honored to be enrolled."
College Sophomore,5,I have not heard of any sexual assault on this campus.
College Senior,5,They have very good connections with local businesses so finding an internship is fairly easy!
College Senior,5,I love my classes and teachers that I have taken. All of the teachers that I have had have all been very easy to talk to and approach with questions. They really are here to help each individual student!
College Senior,5,"I feel very safe on campus, and we have a great security/police team!"
College Senior,5,We have very nice dorms and a new dorm section that was just built!
College Sophomore,5,I love Jessup! It has a great atmosphere of community and love.
College Junior,5,I really do love me school.
College Junior,5,Everyone at the school is so helpful and very friendly.
College Sophomore,5,I love my school and I would trade my experience for anything
College Sophomore,5,"I have a great program, that is the best there is I have no doubt about getting a job after."
College Sophomore,5,"The only thing I would change is the fact that sometimes, I feel like the meals are to fancy when we are just college students who sometimes just want comfort food."
Recent Alumnus,5,Christy is the best and she helps with the career services!
College Junior,5,"The people in the Psychology department are very friendly and helpful. The Psychology program is one of the biggest programs at William Jessup and they are very proud of that fact. If you have any questions or comments, you can talk with the Psychology department and they will gladly help you or listen to you. They will ask you lots of questions about why you want to be in this program and ask you what you want to do with it and the purpose this psychology degree will play in your life. Make sure your prepared for questions and be ready to answer them honestly and thoughtfully."
College Junior,5,"As I already mentioned, the psychology program at William Jessup is an amazing program! I enjoy it also and the psychology department is very well organized, thoughtful, throe, and you are able to talk to them one-on-one. The workload is a little on the heavy side but it is not bad. It is very doable. There is a good amount of internship and job opportunities that are offered through this department"
College Freshman,5,I enjoys rules so it is great
College Freshman,5,I have never even heard of it on campus!
College Freshman,5,Great amount of work load! Love the Professors
College Sophomore,5,"California weather, can't go wrong!"
Graduate Student,4,I am just entering Graduate school.  One of the counselors shipped me vitamins without me paying for it.  They really care about your well being.
Alum,4,I really enjoyed my time at Jessup. I think that my teachers cared a lot about the students and I was well-prepared biblically. I think the grading could have been a little harder.
Sophomore,4,My overall experience with William Jessup has been very good. My only problem is the parking lot. It is very small and the majority is on gravel while the rest is concrete. This makes the cars very dirty and dusty fast.
Sophomore,4,I greatly appriciate the smaller class sizes and more personal relationships wich the proffessors that comes with it. Classes are rather interactive and there is a clear drive for exelence displayed by this school.
Sophomore,4,"Don't be discouraged by the size, there are some pros that go along with this: Your connection with your professor is found no where else in most universities, and you can grow in a loving environment with people you see every day! The food there is also not bad, I believe it's in the top 20 best cafeterias in the nation for colleges!"
Junior,4,"Overall, I love Jessup. The people are  amazing and I am learning a lot about myself and I'm growing a lot. This school isn't a party school, and although they embrace the athletics a little too much for me, it's always fun to see how people are learning and growing throughout their time here. The school emphasizes how much they want students to grow in their journey with God, and I have definitely grown in that regard. 
However, there are some classes that I am not a huge fan of. You really need  to  know the teachers and study the syllabus before enrolling in the class. I've had two classes that were not what i thought they were. I am also an art student, and some of the art classes are not what they are cracked up to be. I learned more from my digital painting class about Photoshop than i did in the  Graphic Design class. But overall, I love  the school and cant imagine going anywhere else."
Freshman,4,"At Jessup, the weight and stress of becoming an adult finally fell on me as I for once questioned the price tag of my education. My recent Spring semester was spent worrying about financing for next fall, accruing loans, and completing the year poorly. Other than that, I liked the community and enjoyed the positive atmosphere of Jessup. Despite the rumors, Jessup is not so bad a place. I just wish the bureaucratic system can be improved so I have all the financial information about every service offered upfront."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time here at Jessup.  I will be graduating soon, and I think this university has taught me well.  The professors care about me and want to make sure I succeed in school, and in life.  The students here are friendly, there have not been any violent incidents that I am aware of, so I feel like this campus is safe place to be.  I has been a pleasure going here, and I highly recommend spending your time here."
Alum,4,"I had a great experience at Jessup.  I feel like some of the facilities are great and others are not, but that's to be expected of a small school.  The best thing was getting BFA level training in a small group setting with a group of people who had the same faith as me.  Music department is a bit too commercial and could use more of a classical base.  But Jessup is a great school and I really hope to see it continue to grow, especially in the arts.  It has great potential."
Sophomore,4,"I think the professors are very good and understanding, they have a deep connection with the students. The diversity here is very limited which is the only negative thing I would say. The town is very quiet and agreeable but not much to do close by."
Alum,4,This is a great University!  The small class sizes are awesome- I felt like I knew all of my professors on a personal level.  The cafeteria is the nicest I have seen at any college and the dorms are great as well.
Sophomore,4,I like that I get to learn about God on a daily basis. The professors are very helpful in assissting me when I need help on an assignment or need an extension to turn in homework. My fellow students are very kind and loving towards me. They are very encouraging and good people. This campus is the biggest I have ever been on and I really like it. The staff here is very kind and humble.
College Sophomore,4,"In every course I have taken so far, the professors have been extremely approachable, understanding, and have formulated their course work to be meaningful and worthwhile assignments. The size of classes are pretty small for a college and that helps maintain the feeling of community on campus. Overall, I want to go to class because I feel a mutual respect between myself and professors, and I feel as though every time I go, I get something out of the experience. I wish the classrooms themselves were more cheerful though."
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are ideal, and so are most of the professors.  They have the feeling of friendship about them, and I always felt like I could approach one of the professors with questions or in need of help or advice.  The courses offered are neat, and I like the informal yet informative nature of them."
College Sophomore,4,"As long as you bear in mind this is a Christian school, everything is great."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel that the work you put in is what you will see after graduation. I heard a guy getting a fantastic job in Santa Cruz before he graduated, but he put in time and made connections for it. It does not matter that our school is tiny and relatively unknown, Its the effort put into the degree and making connections that matters."
College Sophomore,4,"Every student that I have met, is reaching for the goal to graduate and earn a degree. The student resources to earn jobs is growing each year, but I, personally think that the campus could find even more resources for graduating students. The school does require that we go through an internship before we graduate."
College Sophomore,4,"WJU overall has great professors. The professors are the reason I chose this school. They each care greatly about their students that their lives. They are very accommodating because of their class styles and class sizes, which are small."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience includes how unique my school is. William Jessup University is a private Christian University that is small, welcoming and religious. There is hope built into each course."
College Senior,4,"I love going to school each day, every one is very kind and it makes the overall experience very fun and welcoming!"
College Senior,4,Sports are important at William Jessup but not more important than a great education.
College Senior,4,Our security staff is always present.
College Senior,4,Students are supportive if teams and players. Coaches are respectful.
College Senior,4,Students are very helpful around campus and helpful moving in.
College Freshman,4,My experience with Jessup thus far has been nothing but positive
College Sophomore,4,There are lots of options for food off campus. You need a car to get there though.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of great options. They often are not great about allergies. They claim it does not have curtain ingredients bit people will have allergic reactions.
College Sophomore,4,I love housing but don't love the idea that I may not have housing in the following years I really don't have many options when it comes to alternative housing so I am really hoping I get on campus
Recent Alumnus,4,The girls are getting more attractive! The worship team is hot.
Recent Alumnus,4,The security at our campus is legit. Super nice student workers.
Recent Alumnus,4,I got good financial aid!
College Junior,4,"It's in a small city that has lots of activities and friendly places to go to. There are lots of places to go, site seeing, and friendly community. The off campus housing is hard to find, and can be pricey."
College Junior,4,"The athletes at the school work hard and train a lot to be able to perform their best. With the sports facilities, gyms, fields, and    trainers available to the athletes, they all come together to work as a team. The school spirit gets pumped with all the athletics and sports games, the school/fans are big supporters of the school athletics."
College Sophomore,4,There are always some kinds of events going on and the mall and shopping centers aren't too far from the school. It's a really calm atmosphere around Jessup
College Sophomore,4,I'm part of the athletic department and I've had a fun and hallenging experience with it
College Freshman,4,They really work with you!
College Senior,4,Lots of apartments near by. All vary in prices. Always has availability.
College Sophomore,4,There's nothing to complain about. Jessup is a safe environment to be around physically and mentally.
College Sophomore,4,We get opportunities all the time to go into he field as youth workers and try to help. Without that experience we wouldn't be able to translate what we have learned in the classroom to reality.
College Sophomore,4,William Jessup is located near a variety of different restaurants. Especially with the Galleria mall just about 10 minutes away! You have lots to choose from.
College Sophomore,4,I live on campus so I haven't had a need to use transportation but our school is small and in a small area we do not need transit options
College Sophomore,4,"I live in the on campus apartments. I enjoy having a full kitchen and two bathroom especially living with 7 other girls. I would prefer to live in the apartments over the dorms because it is so much spacious and I can cook for myself instead of having to force to eat in the café. The café is nice but there is only so many times you can eat ""taco Tuesday"""
College Sophomore,4,Campus safety makes sure every students has their number. Their office is easy to find and will walk you out to your car at all hours. Makes sure all the students see their presence and feel safe while on campus. 
College Sophomore,4,"Easy to get into, just made sure you have your core classes for a typical 4 year college already taken and you should be fine. All majors are relatively easy to get into and the school is adding new ones all the time. "
College Sophomore,4,Close to many different local restaurants. Within a small walking distance or a short drive close to almost everything. 
College Freshman,4,"I love the education most of all. I love the professors here and I look forward to my classes. My biggest complaint about the school is the people. People at Jessup are very controlling and noisy. No one knows the concept of privacy. Plus, all of them have these idealistic Christian standards that most of them don't meet but they insist on shoving down your throat, and this is coming from a Christian. "
College Freshman,4,"Most people have their own cars, and those who don't can always ask for a ride from a friend and usually people are more the willing to help you. I don't have a car and i have never not been able to get somewhere i needed to, but if you want an off-campus job you need a car for reliability. "
College Freshman,4,I was able to get a considerable amount of academic scholarship and if i had chosen to could have gotten additional scholarships for athletics.
College Freshman,4,"The weather is humid compared to home for me but most would consider it dry. It never get's too hot never going above 100F, and never too cold as long as you have something to block the wind!"
College Freshman,4,Library is great and spacious although it is sometimes quite loud.
College Freshman,4,I am in Rispoli and I love the facilities. The maids are very nice and clean daily as well.
College Junior,4,Not any problems as far as I know.
College Junior,4,"There are plenty of great dining opportunities. Various fast food to satisfy students' preferences and budgets, and also lots of nice exquisite restaurants to try."
College Junior,4,I feel safe here with hardly any concerns. I'm not sure if my campus has a health center on campus.
College Junior,4,"It is very much apart of the city with a big mall and plenty of other shopping. The students are respected by the city. There are nice parks. There is a little bit of a lack of pretty scenery. There are great sports arenas and opportunities to attend. There is a Sunsplash Water Park and a couple miniature golf attractions. There are bowling, lazer tag and movie theaters nearby. And it is a safe place with hardly any crime. "
Recent Alumnus,4,"we just got a new athletics center and new cafeteria as well as new classrooms. I loved the facilities at my school, the only thing I would improve is the gym on campus, as far as I could tell it was mainly for athletes and wasn't grade A"
College Sophomore,4,"The range of majors here is not particularly wide, but if you are looking for a major that is offered here you are guaranteed a good education. The teachers are all outstanding and with class sizes of usually around only twenty or so people if not even less it allows the teacher to give attention to each student who needs it. The workload is not all that bad, while enough to encourage learning, it is not so much that a student should be discouraged, I am a full time student and I also have a part time job, and I still manage to get all my homework done."
College Senior,4,The dining halls always have something good to offer. The menu is always changing and the food seems to always come out delicious!
College Sophomore,4,"The off-campus housing at William Jessup University is very diverse and has many different locations and availability. They range from many different prices and areas. Most of the off-campus living arrangements are extremely close to the school and have a lot of restaurants, convenience stores, and grocery stores in the area along with many parks and recreation opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,The caf on campus is great! They always have something for everyone. The food is surprisingly good! And they also accommodate to food allergies quite well.
College Sophomore,2,"1/3 of the population attends sports, and most of the 1/3 are on the team. There is not much fan support or school spirit, there was also very little athletic teams available. There are very little sports offered."
College Sophomore,2,You are unable to live off campus unless you meet curtain requirements. Housing is cheaper off campus even with them removing scholarship for living off campus.
College Sophomore,2,Overly strict with policies. College students need to learn life lessons in college and not be treated like toddlers.
College Sophomore,2,There is little aide for middle classed students who are unable to pay for college out of pocket but do not make the income requirements for government aid.
College Sophomore,2,The on campus housing in the apartments is nice. You are stuck living on campus unless you meet curtain requirements. Often treated as were unable to make a proper decision for our selves.
College Sophomore,2,The are around jessup is not really designed for college students; it isn't a college town so finding housing is not easy.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no school shuttle service, or any kind of transportation service set up on campus. We all rely on each other to get around. Those who have cars just always jump in and help those who do not, and it has never seemed to be a big issue. Our student body is so small and tight knit that this is not a big issue, but if it is an option for you to bring a car to school I would highly recommend it."
College Senior,2,"It's Non-Bay Area California. California is a place where there are only two seasons, wet and dry. Right now is the dry season, but about halfway through the semester the season will change. Since Jessup is near Sacramento, and everyone knows Sac is a sauna, prepare for that type of weather and you'll be fine."
College Senior,2,"It Looks Like a Stereotypical Private School. The school is expanding so everything is getting rather pricey. The teachers are well versed in their art and genuinely want to impart their knowledge, while the students are here mainly for the social aspect. They will probably do well in life because getting great jobs isn't necessarily about what you know, but who you know, and these social butterflies are all about networking. A big thing people first notice about this campus' life is how nice everyone is, but it takes a little getting used to."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus dining is really small, but that will change next year!  The food is quite repetitive and can become somewhat sickening."
College Freshman,2,"Mixed Bag – The parking on campus is a mixture of good and bad.  The yearly cost is cheap, which is a major plus compared to most schools, and there are always enough spots.  However, the parking lots are fairly far from the living areas, and the more popular of the two available lots is not paved, becoming muddy when it rains.  If the first lot is filled, the other lot requires a longer walk back to housing, which can be grueling especially in the extra cold or extra hot weather."
College Sophomore,2,There are compouters in the library and the computer lab which is available to those who do not have a laptop. The internet on campus is horrible. The Wi-Fi is very sketchy of when it will and will not work. The only way to ensure internet access is to have an ethernet cable which is not provided by the school.
College Freshman,2,"The caf food is edible but very repetitive, particularly in the morning. Some of the dishes are good usually at lunch time, but the breakfast and dinner are often poor quality taste."
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately, Jessup does not have a wide variety of students yet. The majority of students come form home-schooled families. The majority are white. And the majority live relatively close to the school. We could definitely use some kids from different places, with different ethnicities, and with different high school experience."
College Junior,2,Apartment Living – It would be great if Jessup helped students get off-campus housing. Or if they had some kind of a deal with the local apartments for students.
College Sophomore,2,Need More – We need more parking because we have to walk quite a distance from the dorms to our cars.
College Freshman,2,It Is Cool – though our school isn't very diverse yet it is an ok atmosphere
College Freshman,2,"Diversity in Sports – Sports are okay, our girls bball team loses alot and I wish we had a football team. We need more diversity in sports. Those interesting to different types of people,"
College Freshman,2,"Night life is slow. Jessup is in the middle of a suburb. Sacramento is only like a half hour away, but there's not much to do there unless you're 21. And even then, there are really strict rules about drinking while you're attending Jessup."
College Senior,2,"Never Know What You're Going to Get – The Dining at WJU is somewhat questionable.  There are days where the food is just average, but others when it is just plain disgusting.  I can honestly say I have never had a meal that I am completely thrilled over.  The food is overall very average and very repetitive lacking in variety."
Senior,1,"1st thing 1st, William Jessup University ""bribes"" their ambassador program with service hours to write a good review for this school.   
Christian education is a joke; a brain dead monkey could earn a minor in Theology at this school. 
Chapel is pathetic unless you love going deaf to out of sync loud music. 
If you like having your hand held the whole time, this school is perfect! You do not get much freedom. 
John Jackson (The President of the School) has five different speeches he rotates around anytime he speaks to the whole school. Seems like a nice guy, but an awful speech giver. The biggest lie he told was ""you do not have to be a Christian to go to this campus"" but be prepared to write essays as if you were in Sunday School on your love of Jesus! If you are not Christian, do not come here. 
If you are a Jesus loving white girl who also loves Disney, you will fit right in! That is the majority of this campus!  

Professors are great though, and people are friendly."
College Sophomore,1,"There are no parties that occur. No alcohol allowed on campus, no intoxication even if of age."
College Freshman,1,People are very nosey and get in your personal business and force their beliefs down your throat.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at this school is awful!  You have to incorporate driving around looking for a parking spot and then hiking to class which is like an additional 45 minutes before your class even starts, unless you get lucky and can pull it off in 30 minutes.  WAY too many students and cars at this school. Stressful experience just trying to find a parking spot!"
College Senior,1,"They're Only Available During Certain Hours. Not only are there limitations on when a student is able to use them, but there's also a limit on how many. The reason that is a huge problem is because when it comes time to sign up for classes for the next semester, there are not enough of them in the one lab. A lot of the time people don't get the classes they need due to inaccessible comps."
College Freshman,1,"There Is No Sorority or Fraternity...Or Any Clubs That Is Active Enough to Be Worth Joining – There is no sorority or fraternity for you to join as the school believes in ""christian"" values and anything outside of it is considered morally unacceptable"
College Freshman,1,You are not allowed to live off campus or commute without getting a special approval from the student life office. They will likely dig through your life just for the fun of it and student information are not kept confidential as information leaks happen in the office.
College Junior,1,"I got a parking ticket for parking in a place where everybody else parks! No one else did! The no parking areas need to be clearly designated. Also, we shouldn't have to buy parking permits. Aren't we already paying 30,000 in tuition and housing? $45 is too much to pay to park somewhere where we should already be allowed to park."
College Student,1,"Disney Movies and God – The movie scene is rediculous. These people never get outside, they are scared to leave their bubbles of safety. This school is not reality. Bottom line. Those who associate college with partying beig social, etc. Stay far away from here. It more closely resembles a boarding school. Professors are good however."
College Student,1,"Despite having a full gym, athletes get 100 percent priority. Non athletes have no use. The basketball ""stadium"" is smaller than my high schools, and the cafeteria is painfully overcrowded."

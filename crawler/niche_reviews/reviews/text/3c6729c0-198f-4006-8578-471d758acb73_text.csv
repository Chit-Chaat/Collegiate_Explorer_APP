Sophomore,5,The online classes are great and the teachers who teach them make sure that you get the help you need.
Sophomore,5,Lander University has a good population of students. It's not too big or too small. All of the professors know you by name because there's not 200 students in one classroom.
Sophomore,5,"Lander is great because since it is a smaller university, you get to connect with your professors and they actually know your name. I have made great friends from meeting people in my classes and who I lived with my first year!"
Niche User,5,I only had one class online and my professor was very helpful and attentive. I was also lucky because he was a professor on campus too. Lander's library offers plenty of computers to use if you do not have one that you like to use.
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus, amazing resources, affordable costs. Helps prepare you for the real-world. Has a small, comfortable campus with A-grade facilities."
Freshman,5,Easily convenient for any working/studying location. Same learning environment as being inside the classroom.
Sophomore,5,"The professors have been very understanding when we had to move online, and regular online courses have been nice as well at Lander. Work is not piled on and absurd, but there does need to be a sense of time management like any other college course. I feel like I did get the same content I would have gotten in a typical college setting."
Sophomore,5,"I was nervous at first to move to fully online classes in response to the Covid-19 crisis, but each of my professors did their part to make the transition as smooth as possible. They designated certain times in their days to set aside for helping students, and they continued reaching out to us by email asking if we had questions or needed any assistance. The way Lander professors care for their students is something I will always admire, and I will always be thankful for their determination to succeed during these times."
Sophomore,5,"I fell in love with Lander the very first time I came to visit. From the smaller classroom sizes to the multiple activities and attractions across campus, there is something at Lander for everyone. They have great, competitive Division II athletic teams who have the best home game attendances. I just finished my first year at Lander and I am so excited to be going back this fall! :)"
Alum,5,"In my experience, Lander has always felt like home from the kind emails from staff members to the family of students. It is truly my home away from home."
Alum,5,"I have not taken online classes with Lander; however, everything is easy to access online and is not difficult to find"
Sophomore,5,The professors at Lander University are very friendly and will not hesitate to offer assistance when needed.
Freshman,5,I enjoyed how Lander there is a small student to instructor ratio and how the faculty knows each of their students. They could improve the time slots for classes as many overlap and can make it hard to fit in a complete schedule.
Freshman,5,My only online experience learning has been due to Covid-19 however I felt very supported by my professors.
Freshman,5,"I LOVE the Lander campus. The faculty, staff. student workers, and clubs are all so welcoming. Each person I encountered welcomed me to Lander with arms wide open and made my experience wonderful! I love the class room sizes, my professors, and how open my advisors are to helping me determine the best path for my future! I would not want to be anywhere else!"
Niche User,5,"When I went to visit the campus, it felt like home. The staff was great and the students were very helpful. I love that Lander has a such a small campus and that the people there actually care about their students."
Alum,5,I loved my experience at Lander so much that I am considering returning for a second degree. The staff was helpful and made classes enjoyable. You can tell that they care about the success of their students as much as they care about their own success
Niche User,5,I am very excited to be a part of Lander in the Fall of 2020 for their nursing program. The academic and student life seem to be great.
Junior,5,"Lander University goes beyond expectations when it comes to your personal and academic needs. With tons of job opportunities to one-on-one time with professors who truly care about your future, Lander is a great college to attend."
Freshman,5,Lander is very diverse and easy to get around. The campus is beautiful and the professors are very helpful.
Freshman,5,"I am in love with Lander University. The professors are helpful and nice. The students are friendly. There are always fun events happening like concerts, movie nights, festivals, and much more. I love going to the student lounge where you can watch TV, play pool, ping pong, and board games. The gaming lounge is fun too. There is Xbox and PlayStation games. The only downside to Lander University is the food. Most of the time, the only food available is pizza, fries with an unknown meat, and salad. Those food options get old, especially when they are not completely cooked. I believe there should be more variety and healthier food options."
Niche User,5,"Right now, I am still a senior attending Beaufort High School. I've toured this college and saw how perfectly sized the campus was, how caring the staff is about their students education, and how organized everything is. These factors led me to make my decision for this being my number one college choice."
Freshman,5,Lander has provided me with the best college experience so far. It is a beautiful campus with professors who strive to help their students succeed. I would not change a single thing about Lander University because it fits every need that I have.
Niche User,5,I loved everything about Lander. Everyone was friendly and willing to answer all my questions. When touring they did not leave a stone unturned.
Freshman,5,I love the small community. Everyone is so friendly. The teachers care about you. They make sure you learn all material necessary for the test. It’s so pretty.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Lander University and so far I have truly enjoyed my first year experience.  I  have met new friends and is now on the cheerleading team. It has been fantastic. I would highly recommend this institution to anyone who is looking for a small rural college nestled in the heart of Greenwood, SC. Even the professors are attentive and make you feel as if you can call on them with any concerns. Lander University is a ""go"" for me and I am grateful that I made this institution my choice to further my education. ""Go Bearcats""!"
Niche User,5,"I visited Lander University on September 28th. The experience was great. I instantly felt connected to the school. The campus was clean and everyone I met was very friendly. The business department professors were informative.
 I do believe I have found the right school to pursue a degree in business."
Freshman,5,"great place to start your college experience its more then just professors, and fellow classmates , we are a family"
Freshman,5,I that they have a fishing team and are very concerned with their students and the students success out of college.
Sophomore,5,"Lander University is a smaller school in a small area. I feel the school is focused on students networking with one another over common interests. The campus is beautiful and clean. The teachers are understanding as well as outstanding. During my freshman year, I was put in a class along with other people who have the same major as me. The purpose of the class was to teach us as feshman how to nagivate college life and meet others with the same major and interests."
Sophomore,5,"Lander University is a very diverse university. The campus is very open and all of the people are friendly. The professors are genuinely interested in the students and have a easy way of making you feel their willingness to help if needed. The open layout of the campus easy to navigate, making arriving to your classes pleasant and refreshing."
Freshman,5,I start school in August but I'm really excited to be attending Lander. Even though this will be my first year as a student in know I'm going to love it. My experience here so far us beyond what I hoped for.
Sophomore,5,"My first year at Lander University was great. I enjoyed my classes and i have great professors. The food could be better but I cannot complain. I enjoyed my housing and i loved the quietness of greenwood. I feel very safe on greenwood campus, our LUPD are great with handling any incidents and they insure that everyone is safe. Also we are very diverse, with people from all over the world and many people from different states. I enjoy my first year college experience and i look forward to my sophomore year."
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus, great academics, great sports, and overall good time! I love my friends and teachers at Lander, I am glad I chose it as my home."
Freshman,5,I love Lander university and the friendly vibe that it gives off. This is the right school for me because it is small and does not have that many people on the campus always trying to discredit the campus.
Freshman,5,I am a Freshman here in the education department. Every single teacher I have here cares about us getting the best grade we can and to move on to graduate.
Niche User,5,Lander is an amazing university. Everyone is nice and professional. You'll always find someone willing to help.
Niche User,5,"When I toured Lander, it just felt like home. The faculty are genuine individuals and the student body is small enough, you get a private college feel, at a public university cost."
Sophomore,5,I toured Lander University and I absolutely loved it! It was great. I would not like to see anything change but I do know that the freshman classes are getting bigger by the year!
Sophomore,5,"Lander University is an excellent school. The smaller campus and class sizes really comfort the home feeling students want in a college. Professors, advisers, and school officials are very helpful."
Niche User,5,Lander University is perfect school for people who don’t want to go to a big campus but still want many of the same benefits. They provide you with so many resources and willing to help everyone who needs it.
Freshman,5,"small campus, with friendly staff and teachers who are always willing to help.  small class sizes around 30 usually at most 70. the food is good, but will get repetitive eventually."
Freshman,5,I enjoy everything about Lander. There are some few things that I wish would change. I wish that the instructors would be more understanding when you need extra help. I have experienced negative feedback such as come back later or I don't have time.
Freshman,5,"My experience was .meeting other student and the connections  I develop with my professor and my academic learning,  so much to explored..

I am a athlete second and the experience  and learning  has been great. I was able to develop my skills under a outstanding coach who bring unique perspective to his team and was able to connect as family."
Senior,5,Lander is great! The professors are knowledgeable and helpful. There is plenty to do as far as student activities.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the school and I am very interested in learning a lot more in my classes everyday. The food is amazing, and the athletics are fascinating. I’ve only been on campus for a week, but I already know that I will enjoy every day for the next few months."
Freshman,5,Lander is a very fun and safe place to be. You're surrounded by unique individuals who want to see each other succeed.
Junior,5,"I met some life long friends, people with similar mindsets, and people who challenge my thinking. I have learned so much from my peers and professors and I have fallen in love with my major through this school. Stay super involved: you'll meet great people, accomplish things you've never dreamed of, and build a great resume."
Senior,5,"For me going to Lander was a move to branch out into a different community.  From day one, the people in my hall and the local Baptist collegiate ministry was so welcoming. All of my hall-mates helped me move in and Lander offered a meal for dinner the first day of classes. I am currently going through the dual degree program in math and engineering with Lander and Clemson. Lander is a small school that consists of faculty that intentionally care about your success instead of just on research like most of my professors at Clemson. Due to Lander's size, the student body is personable and frequent conversations occur in between classes. Moving on to the big school has made me appreciate where I came from even more. I miss talking to my professors or walking into their office any time I want. Lander is growing little by little and one of the areas they need to grow in is creating more activities on campus to keep students there on the weekends."
Freshman,5,I loved how I felt so at home even though my actually home wasn’t close. It was just the atmosphere and friends that I made along the way get me through.
Junior,5,"I love going to Lander University! It’s small so the professors are more one on one with you in class instead of there being a huge lecture class Also, the student life is great so many clubs to get into and activities to be apart of and there’s no easier way to fit in. There’s not much i would change about Lander, the housing, food and staff are wonderful!"
Niche User,5,"Lander University is an amazing school . I love the environment of the school and the relationship of the teachers and students. Lander has an outstanding nursing program. The only thing that I would change is location because it is located in a weird spot. Other than that, Lander is one the best schools out there."
Niche User,5,I went there for a tour and was very impressed with everything. I'm really looking forward to attending.  The only thing I wish they had done is more information on financial aid and what are all my options.
Freshman,5,"its accepting nature,its opportunities that freshmen are qualified for.The ease of applying and getting accepted.The diversity and friendliness of fellow students"
Junior,5,"My experience with Lander University has been nothing but positive! I love Lander and would strongly recommend all of my friends to go here! I have made so many friends at Lander and I absolutely love all of my professors. The environment is great. It is one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever toured. All the professors are friendly and helpful. Everyone always seems to be smiling and happy. I absolutely love the library because there are so many options. From single study rooms, group study rooms, the loft area, and even a Starbucks! There are many food options whether you are eating in the cafeteria, Which Wich, or Twisted Taco! Great school!"
Freshman,5,I feel as though almost everyone I have met is from out of the country or even the town! It is very diverse and I love that about my school. There will always be some sort of activity for one todo so that boredom will never occur. The academic level is really high and that is a great thing! The instructors are excellent! Each professor has their own style of teaching and that's cool.
Freshman,5,Lander University is an amazing school which I have grown to love and cherish. The atmosphere is so wonderful you feel right at home and welcomed all over. I have gained so many friendships and wonderful opportunities by being at Lander I hope you come here and enjoy it as much as me and all the people I know at Lander have.
Niche User,5,I love Lander! I am so excited to play college volleyball there and I am excited to further and advance my education there.
Sophomore,5,"I love how small the school is, i feel at home. I’m able to work on campus at a work study job that works very good with my schedule. We also have a decent cafeteria, followed by several restaurants on campus and a Starbucks. I’ve only been here a year and a half but it’s the best decision I’ve ever made."
Sophomore,5,"Lander is the only University that I have talked to that actually helps you any way possible, goes out of there way just to get you where and or what you need. Lander will work with you, and they generally want to see you succeed."
Sophomore,4,"Lander is a great university to attend. I love this campus because it's small and easy to learn how to find your way around, and the professors are amazing and friendly. I highly recommend this university!"
Freshman,4,I like the campus and how they have Starbucks and Chick-Fil-A on campus so those of us who don't have a car we don't have to go anywhere. If covid wasn't going on I would like them to be more involved with the students I also think that they should do better on getting news to the students about activities. Like the ra's could put a flyer up on the building or take a note to our door. Although the teachers seem ok the campus is clean and it pretty and it's a nice place for students to chill and hang out in the courtyard. I also like how I feel pretty safe because policemen are walking around but at the same time I don't see them too much. Overall pretty nice and decent school.
Sophomore,4,It was actually pretty good! My professors very rarely used zoom but they did upload videos about the lessons and had online office hours through Blackboard Collaborate. They were very good at answering emails and questions.
Niche User,4,"Overall the campus and staff is awesome! All of my professors were very kind and helpful, they really want you have make good grades. The university itself is just too small and there is little to no ""night life"", which is why I am transferring. I do recommend Lander, but you have to be honest with yourself if you are okay with going to a small university in a small area."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Lander is a very cool, calm, and collected university. There is always something to do if you are interested, but it never seems ""busy."" The professors truly care about how you do and the small class sizes give them a chance to make sure you understand the material. The dorms are a little worn down and the food is less than appetizing, but it is tolerable and for being a cheaper university, there isn't much to complain about. The graduates do great things and the Lander family is something to be proud of. We do not have a bad reputation at all."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy Lander university for it's small classes, and beautiful atmosphere. I enjoy participating in plenty of club activities and sports."
Sophomore,4,I like Lander for the environment. I have met amazing new friends. The professors are great. The classes are not hard. The student life is great. The dorm are not that bad. It feels like a family once you step on the campus. You will never feel alone.
Freshman,4,"Love the small town vibe and people. Can get a little claustrophobic knowing everyone by your second semester. Hate the cafe but I have seen much worse. Brookside is an experience, I would recommend off campus! Teachers have always been great in my experience. Party life is surprisingly good #buffs"
Junior,4,"Lander is a great place for students who like small class sizes, a quiet campus, and has a very diverse and safe environment."
Junior,4,"While a smaller university, the community is super close knit and provides a plethora of opportunities for it's students and even alumni. The professor successfully take on the role of mentor and are able to offer a wealth of knowledge."
Junior,4,"Lander University is a college located in a small town of Greenwood, SC. It is in a developing city, rather small, but the community has impacted the University and the students and is really friendly within these aspects. Although the school is smaller than most, student life is really important. You have to get to know other students to make your college experience better and to also enjoy the reason you applied and wanted to go. The academics are phenomenal and the professors are even better. They want people to succeed and puts in a lot of time to make this happen. One thing Lander needs to do is accommodate on dorms. As their schools is progressing to become bigger, they are not accommodating dorms and this is slowly but surely becoming a problem."
Niche User,4,Lander university showed me a good experience on why I should attend their school.  Lander has diverse backgrounds and beliefs. they show you have the essential process of building personal networks on campus.
Freshman,4,"Lander University is an amazing school. LU offer lots of different career and volunteer opportunities. They even host career fairs frequently. They also have many internship opportunities available. In my opinion, the College of Nursing and College of Business programs are the best programs at Lander. Lander also has a variety of different sports and clubs/organizations for the student body. Their organization are involved in the community in many different ways. As for sports, my only complaint would be I wish we had a football and track team. My only other complaint about lander would be that the school needs more diversity in its faculty, staff, and students."
Freshman,4,"I really like how Lander is small and the ratio between students and their professors is small and manageable. So your professors are aware of how many and who is missing from the classroom if a student doesn't show up. Also Lander is very affordable for me currently. My parent's aren't necessarily paying a lot a semester but I hope to change that as I apply for more scholarships. Plus, Lander is located in Greenwood which is about 40 minutes away from my hometown so I'm close to home. What makes Lander special to me are the student activities. Every week there is always something going on that Lander students can get involved in."
Junior,4,"Very friendly and helpful staff and administration! This is going to be my first semester attending Lander University, so far my experience has been wonderful!"
Sophomore,4,"I feel like this school is more like home to me. I feel connected to my school more and even go to their events. At first, I thought that will be weird and different meeting new people and stuff like that but as I started to open myself up I felt like I belonged. Lander has wonderful teachers who are there to help their students in need. The dorms were nice to live in and were a place to create memories from. The only thing that I wish that can be better is the food. The food is ok but it just needs a little bit more love in it."
Freshman,4,"Love the small school feel. It creates a community within the student body and faculty. The cafeteria is probably the worst part about the school (along with parking). Too many students, not enough stations or healthy options."
Freshman,4,"My Freshman year at Lander University has been an amazing experience. The staff here is wonderful. Everyone is so nice. They want you to learn and feel at home if you need help with anything they are right there to hep. The dorms are really nice. I stay in New Resident Hall, built in 2015, I literally feel like I stay in a hotel here."
Freshman,4,"I would say that this school is the school for people who don't know what they want for the future because this school will give you all of your tools to succeed. Lander is a very good school for nursing and education majors, if you are an art student it is good too, but not if you aiming for movie and films like screenwriters."
Graduate Student,4,"It need to offer more locations for the Montessori training. Im a distance learner and they have many but for my program I have to live on campus during the summer cause Im a hour away, so that means I have to leave my family and pay to stay in the dorm or pay for a hotel for two months."
Freshman,4,"When I first moved to Lander I was very terrified that I would not make any friends and that the teachers would be strict, however Lander is quite the opposite. My first week was more than amazing! Everyone ( including teachers) were very sweet and easy to approach. I am in love with this school and hope I can continue to go here!"
Junior,4,I would like to implement more areas of scientific studying.  As of now we do have the broader areas of scientific studies such as Biology and Chemistry but I would like to see more specific career orientated programs.
Sophomore,4,"Lander University is an amazing experience. All of the staff are very welcoming and treat you like family. As you take various courses, you soon realize that professors at Lander truly care about your grades and want you to succeed."
Freshman,4,"I like everything about Lander especially how they have organizations that host events to get students involved. They have things such as the UPC,RHC, many greek organizations that host events such as having movies, parties, etc."
Freshman,4,"It is easy to get involves in the Lander community. It is a university that caters to all interest: sports, arts, science, writing, etc. The professors are fair and will go out of their way to help you succeed. A large portion of the student body consists of people from all over the world. The science department is exceptional, and I am excited to see how much I can learn and grown over the next four years at Lander University."
Niche User,4,I loved the campus and the people that go there the only thing is that I wish there were more to do around the area but the college itself is beautiful and great living standards and amazing academics!!
Junior,4,This is my first time attending the school as a transfer student. The school has a lot of activities and clubs to join. The professors seem nice and they are willing to help you if you ask for it. I wish the school didn't have so many large classes because it is difficult to get extra help with so many students. I also wish there were more parking spaces for commuters.
Niche User,4,Lander University is a place where you have the freedom to be you and have a great education while doing it. Lander offers tons of terrific programs and great staffing.
Freshman,4,"The professors are invested in their students. The students are nice and friendly. However, I spend most of my time feeling like I have nothing to do.  This is a school where you have to get your work done because you're bored."
Freshman,4,Lander is a wonderful school filled with much diversity and many programs.  The teachers care very much for their students and it is obvious that they're first priority it the students.  Especially the education department.
Junior,4,"Lander College has been a great experience for me thus far. I began in August of 2017.  The faculty/staff and other administrators are very welcoming and supportive thus far.  The facility is very clean (including grounds) and security is always visible.  I have been able to reach out to my professors and have gotten at least 90% positive feedback.  Lander recently added a bus to transport students to and from shopping centers and this has been a great support system for me since I don't have a vehicle to go off campus at this present time but would continue using their service after I do bring my vehicle on campus in the Fall of 2018.  Again, Lander is an excellent college and I look forward to continuing my education and graduating with a Bachelors Degree in Psychology prayerfully by Fall 2019."
Niche User,4,"I toured Lander and it was such a great experience! The professors were nice, the student life is amazing, and the mass communications program is a great one."
Freshman,4,"Although Lander is a small university, it has a lot of diversity and opportunities, both on campus and in the community."
Freshman,4,Everyone on campus is friendly. All of the workers and professors are willing to help freshmen find their way to class.
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed Lander. For Lander's small size, it offers students a lot. Many of the instructors offered a personal interest in student success before, during, and after college, a number of instructors challenged students to make goals and to aim for self-improvement, and considering its size, it has a nice culture and atmosphere."
Junior,4,"I think the dorms for the upperclassman should be redone or at least have the bathrooms remodeled instead of just the rooms. It doesn't make much sense for the freshman to have better dorms, then they're moved into crappy dorms for the next three or so years."
Sophomore,4,"This is my second year at Lander and being away from home this has really helped me branch out more. I know what my focus is and most of the professor are always helpful. With me having dyslexia I was a little nervous having to take the test to see of the school would accommodate me with my need. Of course, the accommodation are not like the ones I had throughout my high school years but I do get quite time away from other to take test and extra time and that's appreciated. I just desire to be successful in everyday possible just wished more assistance was available and it would have improved my first semester verse me failing Chemistry no matter how hard I tried my mind and focus is different for others so this took me out of a few scholarships that was needed financially for me and my family verses student loans."
Senior,4,"I love my department and my professors. The diversity in the school is great, but we could always have more diverse activities."
Sophomore,4,"My first year was difficult, because I had to essentially start over socially, but the students here are varied and friendly. The Honors Program is excellent, and they truly made me feel like knowledge, and acquiring that knowledge, were important parts of life. The festivities at Lander are always enjoyable, and the campus' usage of FALS events (Fine Arts and Lectureship Series) gives me the added motivation to get out of my room and go do something fun and meaningful with my friends. More accurately, they're how I tended to make friends. The events can range from concerts and hot chocolate outside in the plaza to a movie presentation in the auditorium to a voice actor's presentation about why a student might want to consider becoming a voice actor. I've thoroughly enjoyed myself at this university so far, and I'm happy to be returning here next semester."
Sophomore,4,"My freshmen year was a trail. I had problems with my roommates.  There was a lot of guy traffic, and as the year progressed they seem to get dirtier. Also when I was studying they either had loud company over or loud music on. On serval occasions my roommates would wake me up at 2 or 3am from going out.  But despite my roommate problems I made the Deans List both semesters. What I love about this school is that all my professors wanted you to succeed and they would love to help you.  Also their tutoring center and writing center was amazing. I loved my tutor's and we became friends. Another thing I love about Lander is the beautiful campus and a plus is you can get anywhere in 10 minutes. One of the things I would like to see change is the cafeteria menu. For people who only eat fish and chicken as their meat the menu was very limited. I lived off of pizza, salad, and fruit. Also their pizza needs some improvements because the bottom is always wet."
Sophomore,4,Landers community is very welcoming. The campus is a good size and feels relatively safe to walk around at any time. The visual arts area is very much like a family and I enjoy being an art major very much for that reason. The professors care about the students and often do activities with groups of students. I enjoy the small college atmosphere.
Niche User,4,This is a really good university but the staff some time can put you in all of these classes that you don't need and it can hold you back from graduating on time.
Niche User,4,"I am going to attend Lander in the fall of this year and I can honestly say that this was the only school I intended to attend and the only school I applied to!!! It is a beautiful school, has small class sizes, and was the best fit for me! Although they do not have football, Newberry or Presbyterian College are easily 30-50 minutes away and they both have great football programs! I can not wait to be a bearcat this fall!!!"
Freshman,4,"One of my favorite things about Lander is the size. It's not big, yet it's also not too small. The class sizes are really good for me and how I learn. I'm always able to contact my professors and get help and talk to them when I need it. All the people are so nice, everybody's always willing to help you out with anything."
Freshman,4,"Lander University is a great institution academically that has many qualified professors who have a passion to not only teach students but to also see their students pursue their dreams, expand their knowledge and perfect their talents with any given majors. I would love to see more activities throughout the year so the students are not as bored and in their rooms so much. Also the fraternities and sororities are not as involved with the campus as much as they could truly be."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere here at Lander. The people are nice, the housing is comfortable, and the cafeteria is pretty good. So far, most of my professors have been pretty great. They are really helpful and easy to get along with, not to mention knowledgeable. I'm not really sure if I'd want to change anything; maybe more single-room housing?"
Freshman,4,"My experience has been very good so far, however, the students were not as academically inclined as I thought they were going to be. The Honors College was very easy to get into, and as such the people are really no more over achieving than the average populace. The teachers have all been very helpful and knowledgeable and they seem genuinely interested in my success, which is a very big plus for the college itself. The sports games are free, however, I am not a big sports person so having to pay for it out of a part of my tuition is very frustrating."
College Freshman,4,Everything here is amazing except for the fact that it is a suitcase college.
College Sophomore,4,Seems interesting. I might even join one.
College Sophomore,4,Great school. Lander is amazing. Glad I decided to transfer.
College Freshman,4,The Greeks and the non-Greeks treat each other as equals and both participate in on and off campus events.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is supportive of the teams and has great sportsmanship.
College Freshman,4,Campus housing at Lander University is great. The housing places are safe and close to class.
College Freshman,4,Our team performance at Lander University is great. We also always have a great turn out for fan support.
College Sophomore,4,Lander has provided me plenty of opportunities to enter the job field.
College Sophomore,4,"Dude, amazing. I can't imagine going to school anywhere else."
College Sophomore,4,I have no need to feel unsafe while on campus. We all look out for each other.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my housing. It was important to me that I get a single room, and I did."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the fitness center. I'm not an athlete, so it's important to me to be able to go to the gym without being looked down upon."
College Sophomore,4,"The general atmosphere at Lander is so incredible. Everyone is dedicated, hardworking, and friendly."
Senior,2,"Everything that you seen said about this university is true. The dorms are very old, low standard and sometimes unsafe, the cafeteria staff and food is definitely below average that mess up your stomach more than nourish, and parking gets more and more horrendous as the years go by and the school accepts way more students than they can actually afford to house. I would definitely give this school a 1 if it was for the couple of good professors here and for being small enough to where you can have quiet weekends so you can catch up and study on missed material throughout the week. Other than that, this school was a worst microcosm of my high school experiences. PS: a lot of the teachers and faculty are very rude and inadequate to teach"
College Sophomore,2,"My school barely has greek life, and the ones we do have, is easy to join."
College Freshman,2,"Since the main fraternities have been put on probation, Lander does not exactly have the best social life. Many students go to a club down the road from Lander, but it is not really too safe."
College Freshman,2,"The availability of off-campus housing is very limited. If you want to live off-campus, it is important to search for a place at least 4 months ahead of time. Some landlords will allow you to reserve housing, others will not. It is definitely MUCH MORE affordable to live off-campus, however, the safety varies depending on location. It is extremely difficult to find housing under $700 a month with more than one bedroom and generally utilities are NOT included."
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do in Greenwood.
College Freshman,2,I do not receive aid except in the form of loans.
College Sophomore,2,They just go around for parking tickets and drinking tickets. They are never around at night when you need help or to boost off your car before class. It takes them forever to get to you when you call for help.
College Sophomore,2,Alcohol use is the most common. It is really easy for students to get it. Our campus is supposed to be a dry campus.
College Sophomore,2,If you don't qualify for financial aid then you are pretty much on your own. Scholarships are rarely offered and the only thing offered are loan options. 
College Freshman,2,"The greeks throw parties all the time and most of my friends that are in them are usually gone to the parties or the late night meetings for the sororities. I think its a waste of time, but if you want to be busy alot i guess its a good option. "
College Freshman,2,"The wireless internet here is terrible. Invest in a long Ethernet cable, it'll make your online homework much easier to access and do. There are times the internet goes out altogether though, so dont depend on it. 
The tech support is pretty good, they can fix almost anything with your laptop. 
By the way, HAVE A LAPTOP. The computer lab in the library is horrible. Its usually crowded and the desktops are really really slow. "
College Freshman,2,Nothing to do. No shopping. Few restaurants.
College Sophomore,2,I wish there were more.
College Sophomore,2,There are a decent amount of places to choose from but not as many as one may like.  Cost is pretty average but haven't found anywhere with student discounts.
College Sophomore,2,"It's not a big deal if you are in a frat or sorority, and it is not a big deal if you never set foot in one. It's nice because you can go to frat parties, which can be fun, but it's not a status thing"
College Senior,2,"Parking can be quite annoying, but I think you'll find this pretty much anywhere you go. If you don't have a parking permit, which costs around $60 for a year, then you will most likely get a ticket. However, ever so often they have a blood drive that will give you the chance to get rid of the ticket by donating blood."
College Senior,2,"Greenwood is the type of town where you have to make your own fun. The mall doesn't offer many options, and unfortunately there's no Target in the town. However, it is my belief that Greenwood is expanding, as they built two pet stores and 3 more shopping places away from the mall. There aren't too many museums, but there is a theatre where there are at least 3 plays a year. There are many farmers markets available in the summer, one close to the Humane Society (where you can volunteer), and one near the mall. People in the town are very nice for the most part, and if they learn you attend Lander they will ask you about your major and why you're interested in that subject, so be prepared to answer that question! There aren't many parks, but there is Lake Greenwood, where many students enjoy spending their time in the summer."
College Sophomore,2,Since I have been here I have notice a lot of students from Asia. Most people are very friendly and try to respect there culture.
College Sophomore,2,"The Cafe and the Bearcat lounge are the two food places on campus, but eating there is extremely expensive and the food reminds me of High School food. It's normally cold and I hear people complain about the quality of the food often. I don't eat there often. Maybe 2 or 3 times total. It costs the equivalent of eating out, which is too much for crappy food."
College Senior,2,"Greenwood is really not a bad place, its small and has attractions and things to do, however it needs more security. There has been problems with things happening to students."
College Sophomore,1,It is way too expensive !
College Sophomore,1,I do not think that our financial aid staff is properly equipped for helping us.
College Sophomore,1,There is not enough parking space at Lander.
College Sophomore,1,I am pretty sure that it rains at least three times a week in Greenwood and our campus floods easily.
College Freshman,1,I didnt have a car my freshman year so depending upon others for transport to WALMART of all places was terrible. You need really good friends with cars or a car here because everything is too far away to get to on foot. The stores and restaurants are farthest but theres like a gas station nearby campus. 
College Freshman,1,"Dining in Greenwood of all places is horrible. They have the usual chain restaurants like McDonalds, Chick fil A, Bojangles, Burger King, etc. They have an Outback, Cracker Barrel, Red Lobster, a japanese sushi/ hibachi restaurant, Shoneys, Ryans, Chilis, and thats about it."
College Freshman,1,"Im not interested in athletics, but from what i hear, which isnt much, there are  few games that people actually attend. Its not a big part of this school. "
College Sophomore,1,The campus police are constantly down the students throats. They are sometimes an annoyance more than helpful.
College Sophomore,1,There are many races at LU. Majority is of Caucasian decent.
College Sophomore,1,There are not a lot of scholarship for my major I usually I am offered the pell grant and maybe the life scholarship. I usually have to accept loans every time or semester.
College Freshman,1,"Seriously, the weather is horrible. Rainy one day and then it is scorching the next. I suggest getting The Weather Channel app for Greenwood on your phones ASAP!"
College Sophomore,1,The Greek Life is not really a big factor at Lander. They do not really get involved in things around the campus enough. There are maybe three or four frats or sororities. As for housing I have only seen two Greek houses. Parties are rarely thrown because I have only heard of one party being thrown by a frat. I wish Greek Life at Lander could be better and it could but it is not a factor for me.
College Freshman,1,No Second Chances – There is no alcohol or any illegal drugs on campus and if you are caught then you are kicked out of housing. Same goes for alot of other rules like fighting or stealing.
College Sophomore,1,"I originally did not plan on attending Lander but due to some circumstances, i ended up enrolling late. Upon visiting the financial Aid office, i was tended to by students who were brash and just tried to hurry me out of the door. They provided relatively no help and left me with even more questions and no answers, resources, or options. At the end of the day, my loans were very insufficient."
College Freshman,1,"Dining Hall – The food is, to put it mildly, lacking. The same foods are served countless times. It's a bad sign when the cafe is the butt of every joke at school."
College Freshman,1,"Lander University is a suitcase campus. Every weekend three-quarters of the student body pack their bags and go somewhere else, usually home. The reason for this is the lack of activities and the dullness of the school itself."
College Freshman,1,Its Awful – The weather is so terrible. one minute its hot and the next it is snowing. Just terrible

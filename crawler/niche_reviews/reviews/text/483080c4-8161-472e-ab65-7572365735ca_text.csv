Senior,5,"My experience at Lourdes University has been awesome. I have felt like home since day one. The professors, staff, and sisters at Lourdes University really make you feel at home and welcome you with open arms. The smaller class sizes make it easier for you to get assistance with something your struggling with. Being a former player on the men's Basketball team I have formed relationships that will last me a lifetime. Go Gray Wolves!"
Senior,5,My online classes at Lourdes University were excellent. The professors explain things perfectly and make sure you understand each assignment. They send you reminders on when due dates are approaching and host weekly zoom meetings to explain chapters and check on everyone.
Sophomore,5,LOURDES UNIVERSITY STAFF HAS BEEN EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE IN MY HIGHER LEARNING. THE ONE ON ONE ATTENTION IS PRICELESS AND ADDITIONAL HELP YOU MAY NEED TO SUCCEED. THEY ARE THERE FOR YOU RATHER IN THE CLASSROOM OR IN YOUR PRIVATE LIFE. DURING MY CONTINUE EDUCATION I HAD EXPERIENCE SOME HARDSHIPS WHEN I REACHED OUT TO THEM THEY WAS VERY WELCOMING AND MADE ME FEEL LIKE FAMILY AND PROVIDED RESOURCES TO HELP MY SITUATION SO I COULD CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON MY EDUCATION AND FOR THAT I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY DIDN'T SEE ME AS JUST A NUMBER ON CAMPUS BUT FAMILY.
Sophomore,5,I HAVE NOT TAKEN CLASSES ONLINE AS OF YET BUT I'M SURE WITH THE AWESOME TEACHERS THAT THEY HAVE I'M SURE IT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN IN PERSON
Sophomore,5,What I like Lourdes University is the people. They are very kind people who really cares about you no matter what situation anybody is in. What needs to be changed about the school is better selection of food during the cafeteria hours.
Niche User,5,"It is a great school and community. Not only are they open with welcome arms but they are also diverse which in my books are a great advantage. Although it is a long way from home I think Lourdes University is and will be the school for me!! I mean my cousin is there right now and absolutely loves it there, she tells me about it all the time which makes me even more excited to go if I get accepted of course."
Junior,5,"I chosen Lourdes because it's not to far away and its in a very safe urban community. I like the class sizes is very small and if you need any help theirs tutors to help you. I like the campus cafeteria because it serves great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. What I like about Lourdes is meeting new people and were for the first time, most are from this area, or from out of country, but it was nice to introduced them."
Junior,5,"I like that the professors do what they can to make sure you learn the material, they want you to do your best in school."
Freshman,5,"Lourdes is a very nice small Catholic university, it is a very beautiful university with some great professors that make it all worth it."
Junior,5,Professors are knowledgable and have real world experience. They know students by name and make themselves available for extra help. Small class sizes allow students to ask direct questions.
Niche User,5,"I had gone on a visit to Lourdes University, located in Sylvania, Ohio and it had made me aware of the fact that Lourdes contains tons of good people, right away I felt welcomed. I went on visit as baseball prospect and I can say that their baseball program is very good and that their coach is able to connect with you. Lourdes dorms are also very nice due to the fact that they come already furnished; this is very good as it allows me to save money on furnishing. I am an international student and Lourdes has welcomed me with open arms."
Junior,5,Lourdes College is a wonderful university based in Franciscan values.  The small class sizes give more one on one accessibility.  Located on a beautiful campus with lots of administers located very close it gives students many things to do and enjoy when not in class.
Freshman,5,The faculty and staff are invested in student success.  The beautiful campus makes it easy to study.  The apartment dorms are great!
Sophomore,5,SO far my first year at Lourdes University has been many of things but precisely two. My first thing is that the community is so caring and wanting you to succeed that it's really hard to feel out of place and everyone is so welcoming! Secondly The academics and faith base is out of this world! The courses are challenging and you have professors that are always willing to work with you to help you succeed. The great thing is that you can express yourself religiously without anyone judging you are putting you down. Here at Lourdes University you can be comfortable being who you are and getting the chance to experience college for the first hand!
Junior,5,"I have really enjoyed Lourdes so far! The campus is beautiful. The class sizes are small so you get to know everyone. The professors are very open and willing to help. Also there is also events, fundraisers, job/shadowing opportunities, tutoring center, etc. There is more than plenty of great features about this college! I would highly recommend it!"
Niche User,5,"If i have ever loved a school so much! To be such a new and advancing University, the housing is literally an apartment complex. Also, there are so many options for people to do. There are so many opportunities for working, volunteering, traveling, and simply being involved. The LEAP crew hosts free programs like going to Lions games or Cedar Point. Also stuff like glow parties. I still have my TShirt from my freshman year of 2012. The RAs are very attentive. Jets has the greatest enployees and they help the students. There is always something going on in the Den. There is also an open door policy. If there is a door open, walk into it and say Hello!. I also love the FYE course. It encourages freshmen students to get involved with the school and to attened different events. They even take you camping for orientation which was 4 days of awesome. I Love Lourdes University...HOME OF THE GREY WOLVES."
Senior,5,"Lourdes University has offered what I could not find at any other college I considered. They offered a small class size and focused education that remained geared toward my chosen major. Instructors are very willing to help after classroom hours and they offer subject-specific tutoring. The community is very safe and free of the ""big city"" life-style that dominates other colleges and their dorms are actual apartments complete with secured entrances, a complete kitchen and sharing with only one roommate. It is easy to get involved while remaining focused on graduation."
Sophomore,5,"Lourdes is a wonderful place to study. Its quiet campus helps students to be in a noise free environment in which is safe, and allows each student to focus on his or her studies. The professors and academic advisers are really supportive and do want to help each student succeed."
Alum,5,"Lourdes University offered excellence in faculty,programs and schedule to complete my additional two years required for a Bachelor Degree in Religious Studies (Major: Theology / Minor: Ecumenical Relations). The staff, faculty, students and location provided a comfortable, inclusive, respectful and positive holistic experience.  I served in administration staff positions at School of Medicine - University of California Davis and recently finishing my career in Diversity, Inclusion, Media Relations & Community Engagement at Texas A&M University-Commerce - President's Office.  My volunteer work in parish health ministry, choir/music, lay ministry service and Diocesan board member at Episcopal Church has been well served.
Pax et bonum. R.J.Ernst (Class of 1987)"
College Freshman,5,I have enjoyed the professors I have for my first semester of college
College Junior,5,Excellent apartment style dorms. I'm lucky that people in my dorm all get along.
College Senior,5,My experience with the professors have been excellent they tend to break down the course for you step by step. And they class sizes are perfect because you'll have that one on one with the your professor.
College Senior,5,"As an athlete it's very busy and the staff do everything to get involved, and the performance of all athletics programs are amazing. I am a soccer player myself and we're a new program. And everyone are very supportive of the program that's what makes it exciting."
College Freshman,5,"Campus housing is apartment style, giving students room to freely roam the apartment with one or two roommates. This also helps with having a quiet place to study. Students are responsible for cleaning their own apartment, which is good to teach them responsibility: after all, nobody is going to be their maid in the real, adult world."
College Freshman,5,"Lourdes University, in my opinion, has great athletics. Many sports including cheerleading and lacrosse are played; however, the academics are always the top priority. As a non-athletic student, they also offer many other ways to get involved."
College Sophomore,5,A nursing degree is applicable anywhere
College Sophomore,5,"Great apartment style dorms, but too expensive"
College Sophomore,5,Fantastic and entertaining volleyball team
College Sophomore,5,Many study clubs. everyone know everyone
College Sophomore,5,"I like living on campus because the res life is opening and inviting. They know how to set rules and keep them, they make sure they are enforced."
College Sophomore,5,It is very welcoming and friendly.
College Junior,5,"Apartments are big and so nice, but kind of expensive is the downside."
College Freshman,5,The campus dorms are really nice and everyone loves them
College Sophomore,5,The safety of the students and staff are the number one priority.
College Sophomore,5,I think that if you put in the effort and work with the university you can get your dream job.
College Sophomore,5,For me I have had an amazing experience in classes and with professors. I went from a university where it felt like no one cared if I did well or not to having professors who really cared about me and my success.
College Sophomore,5,"For me Lourdes has been life changing. I transferred to Lourdes this past semester because the college I perviously was attending was making me miserable. I have always been a person who really loved school but I was actually considering dropping out of college as a result of it. Since I have attended Lourdes I have started to enjoy school again and my faith has been strengthened. Catholics schools a current feeling when you walk in and the second I walked in the front doors I felt like I was home. The atmosphere at Lourdes is extremely positive. The professors at Lourdes are more than just teachers, they genuinely want you to do well. Lourdes is an incredible place to be."
College Student,5,"I am absolutely in love with my school and everyone in it. I love the way that all of the professors explain and teach the topics they need to in modern terms to where I can easily understand them, even the hard subjects are easy to understand due to the amazing teaching abilities by all of the professors. I also love the community within the university. Everyone knows each other and are very friendly to each other."
College Freshman,5,Everyone seems so kind there.
College Junior,5,"Lourdes University is such an amazing school to attend. Every staff member is so welcoming and helpful. The teachers really care about their students and will do whatever they can to make sure you get your degree. The dorms are very clean and I know many people that love living there. There are always event that students can attend and meet new friends. The one that most people like is wings n sings. This is where people sing karaoke and enjoy chicken wings. The cost at Lourdes is always on the rise and I know many people, including myself are struggling to pay for tuition. The school is great and it is pretty close to my house so it is worth the money."
College Junior,5,very active and supportive staff
College Junior,5,"I feel that every person has something to bring to world, so rating a person is not ethical, in my opinion. Judging people based on their dress is very shallow. Poor question."
College Junior,5,I feel very safe on campus. I have never worried coming home from work late at night and walking into my apartment.
College Junior,5,Wonderful professors who actually personally care for the students and wan to see the students excel.
College Junior,5,Anything a person needs or wants is right by. We have the greatest resources a college student could ask for.
College Junior,5,"Toledo (10 minutes south of campus) has the #1 Zoo in America, an Amazing Art Museuem, Musicals, Toledo Mud Hen's, Major Concerts, Toledo Walleye Games,  and some of the best Metro parks in the USA."
College Junior,5,Lourdes is a great community! People really care about you here. Respect is very important at LU!  It's a new and growing campus. I am excited to be apart of it!
College Junior,5,Amazing career services office/High Job Placement in most majors
College Junior,5,New Rec Center will be built soon :)
College Junior,5,There is not a crazy night life in Sylvania. A few bars are a block from campus. There is a lot more to do in Downtown Toledo! It's about 10 minutes from campus.
College Junior,5,"Even though Lourdes is a Catholic University, they do not judge people based on their backgrounds. Everyone is welcome. Mass is not required, but there are still a lot of activities for those who are Catholic. I consider myself a moderate Catholic and I am very happy there. They even have an LGBT group!"
College Junior,5,Toledo has more local restaurants per capita than anywhere else in the US! So much good affordable food.
College Junior,5,Lourdes has all apartment style residence halls. You can't beat the price and quality.
College Junior,5,The business program requires mandatory internships.  I'm excited to start the new MBA program! They study abroad every year. Last year they went to London. This year we are going to China & South Africa!!
College Junior,5,Internships are required for most majors. Lourdes has high job placement also!
College Junior,5,"The dining hall is the best out of all the other campuses I've been too! The chefs will prepare things special for you, if you have dietary restrictions!"
College Sophomore,5,I love the education program! Amazing faculty
College Student,5,There really isn't the peer pressure or anything like that that would be at state schools.
College Student,5,Everything is great except verizon is dominate wireless and I have Att and only have one bar inside buildings.
College Student,5,"This is a small town setup a lot like where I grew up. Plenty of nearby things to do,"
Freshman,4,"Lourdes University is great school if you're looking for a small-knit, community like school where the classes are small and the professor and classmates know you by your first name, this is the school to come to. Everyone here is very nice and welcoming to make sure you be successful in school. The professors are always willing to help you if you have any questions and they have many support systems here you can have access to like academic coaching, counseling,  tutoring, and your support system. The environment here is very calm but pleasant at the same time."
Junior,4,I think the teachers are very knowledgeable and well informed on the courses they teach. They are always willing to answer students’ questions in a very thorough manner. The only thing I would like to change is how much the tuition has gone up. Lourdes is expensive and the financial aid department doesn’t have many direct sources of scholarships to help students who don’t qualify for grants.
Sophomore,4,"I liked making friends and acquaintances. The professors were hard on students, but they also gave them a chance to do better. Unlike many big colleges in the U.S., Lourdes is a small liberal arts school. That means that there are more people who are genuinely pushing for your success. It’s also a great place to branch out connections."
Sophomore,4,Lourdes university is a great school for students who are there for academics. They have great housing and dining hall options. One thing that is a downside is that they do not offer very much financial aid assistance for people who have good grades.
Freshman,4,"I just started so I don't have a lot of experience with Lourdes but what I have experienced is an administration that would like its students to succeed, faculty and coaches seem to care."
Sophomore,4,Focus on diversity.  Would also like the administration to look at the culture of life more so and incorporate opportunities from the community for the student to take an active role in.  For example the Legislative Breakfast for Life.
Junior,4,"I had an overall good experience at Lourdes. I still am. I really didn't like my first two semesters, mostly because of not having much of an option for the first few classes. I also wasn't a big fan of the orientation that all freshmen had to attend. It wasn't something I was into. Besides that it is an overall good experience. Plus the curriculum is a hard one, but it means that I actually had to learn, and I liked that about it. On another note, we have lawn care come to campus way too much. I don't think a lawn needs mowed twice to three times a week. it really only needs done once a week at the most. "
Junior,4,Lourdes University's campus is very well taken care of both in the summer and winter. The staff are all very friendly and are more than willing to go out of their way to help you with anything you may need. They have a variety of resources to help get the the best possible education you can. 
College Freshman,4,Lourdes University has lots of sports but I need to look into more
College Freshman,4,I would recommend Lourdes University. I like the small class size and the professors.  They care that I will succeed in college
College Junior,4,The quality of staff is pretty excellent. They know what they are doing
College Junior,4,"Professors are nice enough.

Class sizes are generally small which is good."
College Junior,4,It is a good school. Everyone knows each other and they're people ready to help you if you speak up.
College Sophomore,4,As a soccer player I enjoy the athletics. The weight room has most anyone could ask for and with the addition of a new facility the sky is the limit in the personal gains a person can make.
College Freshman,4,I really like the apartment style residents halls. I think this is the best feature on campus.
College Sophomore,4,It is very diverse and they even have diverse training
College Senior,4,Lourdes administration do everything in their power to make all students feel welcomed and home with warm hearts.
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at Lourdes isn't over, but I am a transfer student. But my experience there was absolute amazing."
College Freshman,4,"Lourdes University is a small, catholic university that provides students with many tools for success. My favorite aspect of their school is the small class sizes, which enables students to build meaningful relationships with their instructors in order to help them succeed."
College Sophomore,4,The sports teams are like families and they get to know each other and build a relationship out of it.
College Junior,4,The staff are always there and ready to help you and it really shows they just want you to succeed!
College Freshman,4,The academics are really great I have learned so much so far. It takes work to do well but it is so worth it.
College Freshman,4,Overall the health and safety on campus is great. I always feel safe and an immediate report goes out to all students saying what was wrong.
College Freshman,4,A lot of people are involved in athletics and they take good care of the athletes. The facilities could be better for non athletes but they are working on that now
College Freshman,4,I really love how everyone likes each other around the school and you are pretty much friends with everyone. The athletics are great. I love the small class sizes.
College Junior,4,the professors are the best! They are very nice and helpful and caring!
College Junior,4,I would choose Lourdes again. great school
College Freshman,4,"If you want to find a party, you can find one at UT or BG."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of places! Chipotle, Panera, etc."
College Freshman,4,"Strict on some things, on some things not."
College Freshman,4,"Good food, but it gets repetitive."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone gets apartments, not dorms!"
College Junior,4,they are very career driven n strict
College Senior,4,"Sylvania is a nice little town, very safe and very quiet. With that comes added expense, though. There are several places renting within a half mile of the campus, but nothing less than $600/ month. If you live in the city, it's a little cheaper. I have a roommate, and we split $525 a month to live in a nice two bedroom home in West Toledo, however it is important to check out the neighborhood before moving to the city, because some neighborhoods with low rent come with high crime."
College Junior,4,"As long as you mind your own business, there will not be a problem. If you let people know what is going on, then expect to get in trouble."
College Senior,4,The student centers are very nice and the buildings are just beautiful.
College Senior,4,"Psychology major is great. There are a lot of classes offered and it's nice because there are maybe five psychology professors so your professors always knows you. The work load can get overwhelming, but students are always there to help each other out."
College Senior,4,We have great classes offered at Lourdes and special seminars that are a lot of fun.
College Senior,4,I've had a very positive experience at Lourdes. I've only had a few instructors who I think should get reevaluated.
College Senior,4,Our school is very safe. I have never even heard of parties going on.
College Junior,4,"There is a new Athletic Center ( $15 Million) that is going to be built soon! Currently, we have a gym and 2 work out facilities. We also have sand volleyball, disc golf, & basketball courts for students. 

Mens' Volleyball & Lax Teams are ranked!"
College Sophomore,4,Food at the Grille is OUTSTANDING
College Sophomore,4,Many places to eat off campus. On campus food rocks
College Sophomore,4,Faculty and staff are always there for students.
College Sophomore,4,You are not just a number. You are important.
College Sophomore,4,Campus housing is very comfortable.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone on campus is very friendly and helpful
College Sophomore,4,Sylvania is a safe and fun city. I was born and raised in sylvania and there are plenty of things to do around Lourdes Campus
College Student,4,Plenty of normal places to eat. I don't eat out often the food on campus is awesome!
College Student,4,"There is a lot of student support at all the athletic events,"
College Student,4,Love the small classes and the town is so much like what I'm use too but not at home!
College Student,4,Easy to get around town and plenty of things going on.
College Student,4,They are considering taking away shuttle service which is really a big mistake especially for incoming freshman.
College Student,4,"Easy process, you just have to keep your grades up. I'm able to attend a private university with financial aide but also Need outside scholarship money to make it work."
College Student,4,Casual but not too casual. Many different cultures.
College Student,4,Apartment style living as a freshman can't beat it!
College Freshman,4,Campus security are easy to reach
College Freshman,4,"Love the Social Work Program, great opportunity to study aboard."
College Freshman,4,"Apartment style dorms accompanies 3 people. Costly but worth it, freshmans can have cars, which is awesome."
College Junior,4,"The resources that Lourdes offers to students are awesome, they have on campus housing, a shuttle service, and many after class programs that students can be part of. Lourdes does a wonderful job of keeping students informed via e-mail."
College Senior,2,"Lourdes has glorified rent a cops for security. The best thing they are good for is to chase squirrels off the campus. They aren't armed, and if something big went down, we would be screwed. They get a kick out of busting people for stupid stuff like smoking in their own car in the parking lot, but they don't do jack about security. The least they could do is start going through the parking lots and towing people that park there for the sake of parking there."
College Junior,2,"Lourdes just started athletics, so it will take a few more years to build up the programs."
College Senior,2,"I had so many issues with financial aid. They request some tax transcript thing that the IRS took forever to send and then I guess I requested the wrong one. After all the hassle I find out that my financial aid and loans did not cover everything and now I have to find $2,000 before fall semester ends."
College Senior,2,"There aren't many options and because of the city and school districts, they are normally pretty expensive."
College Freshman,2,Rumors of no shuttle Fall of 2014
College Freshman,2,"One place to eat, no options"
College Freshman,2,Jets pizza gives a discount and only place within walking distance
College Freshman,2,Nothing fun is in walking distance
College Freshman,2,Free parking but too many cars
College Sophomore,2,"The shuttle service is not the worst but I have been late to class on numerous occasions because I was waiting for the shuttle. I ride the shuttle to cut back on spending money for gas. There are students that don't have cars and next semester the president has decided to rid us of the shuttle for good. Although the shuttle was always late, it was still a means of transportation for those without a car."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid people, generally speaking, are some of the most uncooperative, incompetant people I have ever delt with. Don't wait till the last minute to file your FAFSA, because if you do, they will screw it up and you're going to be without financial aid. I always file my FAFSA while I'm filing my taxes (good habit to get into btw), and both years I have been going to Lourdes they waited so long to get stuff done on their end that I almost didn't get any aid in the Fall. Like I filed in February and they were still supposedly working on it in July. It's bad. "
College Junior,2,"Lourdes has strict rules about alcohol and drug use on campus and in the dorms, but it seems that they only enforce them with the people who are following the rules. For example, I'm 24 years old. I don't hardly drink and I never use drugs. It seemed like every 2 months I was subject to a random search and they would check and make sure I didn't have more than the maximum amount of alcohol in my dorm. This, when they should be busting up the rave party going on in the next hall over. It's irritating. "
College Junior,2,"If you live off campus, you pretty much have to drive. There's no way around it. If you drive, you have to get to school a half hour before your class starts or you won't find a parking spot. When I used to live in student housing I would have this problem as well. It would irritate me that I would have to park a block away because some other student was having a party or something and all the student parking spots were taken. Campus Police rarely enforce parking violations, and therefore violations run rampant. Do the math, 320 students in student housing with 500 parking spots. It should work out, especially since not everybody drives. The fact of the matter is, however, that it doesn't."
College Junior,2,"With the ever rising costs of tuition, the hidden fees that just keep showing up, and the incompetant people at the cashier's office and financial aid, the ONLY reason I am still attending Lourdes is because I have come too far to turn back now. Before this semester started, I seriously considered transferring to Bowling Green, and I wish I would have. "
College Junior,2,"In the name of diversity, the majority have become the minority. When you step on campus and look around you, you see very few people who don't fit into one of two categories. Category 1 is the children of extremely wealthy parents who had everything handed to them their whole life and whose parents are funding their education. Category 2 is minorities and immigrants who are attending school for free on a scholarship. Then you have the few students like me who are ""too rich"" for financial aid who get treated poorly all around.
We have some of the most liberal professors I have ever seen, also. I'm pretty sure I got flunked out of a class for being conservative. I did the work, I came to class, and at the end of the semester I found out I got an F. There was never any good explaination from the professor, either.
I'm all for diversity. I'm all for attending college with people from all different backgrounds, who think differently from me and who practice different religions. What I do have a problem with is giving preference to anybody over another person because of their background. In essence, in the name of ending racism you are just creating racism toward the ""majority"" race. That's what happens at Lourdes."
College Sophomore,2,I don't usually participate in any and I don't live on campus with the other students to know anything about that
College Junior,2,"We have a lacrosse team, a volleyball team, and a baseball team, but I've never seen a baseball diamond or a volleyball court on campus, so I have no clue where they practice. Obviously, I've never been to a game, but there is a fair amount of school spirit. The person who dresses up like Gubi, the mascot, is paid a stipend to do so, while the athletes themselves are not, which personally I think is wrong.

What would put this school on the map is if we had a football team."
College Junior,2,"There are constant wild parties on campus, usually in student housing. Campus police are out there at least once a week, often more than that. There are few, if any, campus- run services to assist students struggling with alcoholism or drug addiction as well."
College Junior,2,Because the school the is so small the campus food is pretty good but the times are not convient for the students schedule all the time need more and longer times for breakfast thru dinner.
College Junior,2,"With the transition to being a University still somewhat recent, there are still a good amount of adult learners at Lourdes. This means if you're fresh out of high school, your chances of finding a sweetheart are somewhat low. The girls I've met are very nice, though. It has been hard for me to find a date this past year because most of my social circle at the college is married.
In general, the girls are good looking in friendly, and the guys are attractive and upstanding. This is just my opinion, but it certainly seems like there are a lot more single guys than there are single girls.
If you're looking for a sweetheart, you're probably not going to find him or her here. Most of my friends go elsewhere (UT or BG) to find their dates."
Graduate Student,1,"This ""University"" is probably one of thee most scummiest I have ever been to and apart of.

The Nursing Program is run by a bunch of lazy scum. They only want your money and nothing else. They will try and screw you out of every dollar you have by any means possible, even if it is their mistake."
Senior,1,"I’ve went here for 3 years and am about to graduate. Nobody seems to want to do their jobs, I’ve been fighting with the registar’s office about sending transcripts for graduate school. 
Also the athletic department does not care about their athletes. They keep abusive coaches in their positions and allow students to have romantic relationships with their coaches. So glad to be done with this place."
Sophomore,1,"Lourdes University was absolutely the worse school I have ever decided to go to. The school does not know how to handle conflict and they anyone get hired as faculty. The athletic department heads do not listen to the students' when there are issues and are ignored. They allow student athletes to go over their assistance coach's house alone during late hours. For it to be a catholic university, it is not ran that way. Very unprofessional school system."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a greek life because we are not a university that offers it.
College Freshman,1,We're not allowed to live off campus.
College Junior,1,"We do not have Greek Life,so I cannot give it an appropriate rating."
College Sophomore,1,Lourdes has no greek life
College Freshman,1,"No night life at Lourdes, unless you create your own."
College Senior,1,"There is no real greek like, it is just a simple ""Business"" fraternity for girls and guys in the business programs or related fields of studies"
College Junior,1,The Nightlife is really bad because this a small school and campus is in a small community area that does not offer the party life so this school is very good for just getting things done and finish school on time!!
College Junior,1,"One of my main pet peeves about this school is they charge us a ""technology fee"", in addition to all the other fees and the $500/ credit hour tuition, to use the internet and the computer labs. The internet in student housing is very unreliable, and getting worse by the day, and the wifi on the main campus does not reach some parts of the campus. It is free to rent a laptop, but it is not free to print. These issues are the main complaints that have caused me to seriously consider taking my education elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,The weather does not play a factor for my experience.
College Sophomore,1,University is too remote. You need a car to go anywhere else off of campus.
College Freshman,1,"Stay to Yourself , and Be Smart – At my school there really is no night life. Most students have nothing to do but have movie nights or little get together's most students who live on campus stay in their apartments. Best bet is to have a couple of friends over for entertainment."
College Freshman,1,Greek life is available but I don't hear a lot about it. People don't consume themselves with fraternities or sororities at Lourdes.
College Junior,1,"Way Below Average – Lourdes is a very small school so campus is very small.  The surrounding area is also very rural, so the availability of restaurants is very limited.  This grade is solely based on a lack of options."

Junior,5,"Due to covid, classes were moved online and I absolutely loved my experience. Assignments were handed out in the beginning of the week and students had their own time to complete the work as they wanted. Professors were always available for help and it was a successful experience."
Sophomore,5,"I truly enjoy living and learning at Edgewood, and I would like to continue here but I have taken all the courses I can for my desired major and need to seek a new school for more courses. If I could change one thing, it would be more animal-based biology courses."
Junior,5,It is an amazing college. You get individual attention from proffessors. They are more than happy to help during their office hours. Math lab and Writing center are the most helpful resources one can ask. I totally like the system.
Alum,5,"Loved my experience at Edgewood College. Just 8 short blocks from the Madison campus it was fun to be involved in many of the same activities that the UW students were as well. However, at Edgewood College we were able to get a lot of one on one attention from our professors and advisors, due to the smaller class sizes. I also was a student-athlete, and their academics were very helpful when working with you for scheduling conflicts. I received a well rounded education at Edgewood College and would recommend it for many majors."
Niche User,5,"This is a very small school if you need one on one help, this is the school for you, the staff all know you by name and are there to help you. There are studies for those that struggle in any subject, the room are huge and the food is amazing here!! They offer many clubs and study abroad as well."
Freshman,5,Great school with a lot of great people who are devoted to getting the fullest potential out of you. The school is in a great place and as beautiful as can be. There is always so much going on in Madison and it is nice to be on a small campus away from all the noise.
Graduate Student,5,"Edgewood college is secluded with intimate class sizes, yet close enough to UW Madison campus to have the feel of a large campus social atmosphere. The buildings are beautiful and have great spots to study. The athletic facility is free for student use, but leaves a lot to be desired."
Freshman,5,"Edgewood has provided me with a great experience so far. The professors are always more than willing to help, there is a variety of resources for students, dorm living isn't really ""dorm living"" (luxury compared to other schools), there is a diverse population, and the academic experiences and opportunities provided here are outstanding."
Junior,5,I love the small class size at Edgewood. I get to know all of my professors and they get to know me. The campus is easy to navigate and is close to downtown Madison.
Graduate Student,5,"I am a graduate student at Edgewood College seeking a Master's degree in Bilingual Education. Edgewood is nestled right off of a lovely little lake that provides great scenery, a bike path to a nearby nature preserve, and a short walk to great independently owned restaurants and shops. The professors and administration are very helpful and supportive. I would highly recommend Edgewood to other graduate students - if they can afford it."
Freshman,5,the atmosphere was great and the other students and staff were friendly. they helped me throughout the process of applying and any questions i had.
Freshman,5,Edgewood is amazing with being a smaller school. There is always someone to help you. The professors are awesome and the dorm life is great!
Junior,5,Fantastic professors. Welcoming environment. You really get what you pay for. Tuition may be expensive but the small class sizes assure that the teacher actually cares for you and your education. Resources to assure you succeed in school are plentiful on and off campus.
Freshman,5,"My experience with Edgewood College so far, has been wonderful.  The campus is beautiful and so close to many businesses.  
The classes are small, which gives you a more one on one with your professors, which truly enhances the learning experience.
Edgewood has many extra curricular events that encourage students to bond and become a bigger part of the school.  
I feel very safe and confident in knowing that I am a member of such a wonderful school."
Junior,5,"Great school for mom's returning to college, instructors who care about your success, classes for every interest, flexible schedule, beautiful campus"
Freshman,5,It's a safe and happy environment to be at Edgewood college. The professors are dedicated for you to succeed and you are not just a number there.
Sophomore,5,"Edgewood College holds a very small, diverse campus. What I've enjoyed most about this college is the class setting. It is much easier for me to learn in a small class setting when I can confront the professor when confused as opposed to a larger class setting. Along with the class setting it was very interesting and neat to have a diverse campus, you get to meet many people from different cultures and learn their stories of how they grew up."
Junior,5,A small school that gives personalized attention to students. Teachers and staff are easily accessible. Good school for commuters. Small class sizes.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a Sophomore at Edgewood College, I am pursuing a degree in Nursing. Overall, I have loved my experience here. My professors have always been there to give me extra help and notice if I am not understanding something. Edgewood has a lot of extra help available, I have taken a lot of use out of that, both my freshman year and sophomore year I have tutors that Edgewood pays for. I have been able to get close with my classmates because it is a small school. We work with the community, many classes really emphasize the strength of working together. I believe being here has and will continue to push me to being not only more educated but a better person in total."
Sophomore,5,"I love going to school here, everyone is very friendly, and I always feel safe walking about campus. Edgewood has a lot of Organic food, and I am not a huge fan."
College Freshman,5,We are all aware of danger and how to stay safe.
College Freshman,5,All teachers are very nice and are willing to help.
College Junior,5,"There are so many services on campus to help you in your school and career path.  Advisers and counselors are readily available and there are many postings for internships and positions in various fields.  Several times a year different organizations will come into to promote and recruit for their businesses and non-profits.  If you need assistance, you can find it."
College Junior,5,Edgewood has a smaller campus which contributes to its personal charm and focus on student success.  Class sizes make it easier to know your professors and for them to know you.  Multimedia teaching styles feed the various types of learners on campus.  As a private college the cost may be more but it is worth it for the excellent educational and life learning experiences at this college.  A sense of community on campus and the benefits it provides to each individual is irreplaceable.
College Junior,5,"Edgewood College is a member of the Northern Athletics collegiate Conference. In Edgewood College, a student will be challenged to develop characters on and off the field, course and court. Hands on learning activities will enable students to put their leadership skills to work in the community, in a way that does not end in field."
College Freshman,5,I feel like Edgewood is a safe pocket in the middle of the city.
College Freshman,5,It's very easy to find a job once you graduate from school with a nursing degree.
College Freshman,5,"The teachers are always there for you. There is a few that aren't as willing to help you as much as others, but most professors are very good about it."
College Sophomore,5,I love this school. I love the community including the professors and the students.
College Freshman,5,UW-Madison is right next to you with a lot of parties going on and there is usually something happening Thursday-Saturday night. Also the safe ride shuttle the Edgewood offers has the right stops and will drop you off near a party but you'll have to walk some which is alright!
College Freshman,5,Anywhere near UW-Madison and upper classmen have parties on the weekends when they can! The parties are fantastic and filled with a bunch of people!
College Freshman,5,"I love where I live on campus (Stevie Hall). It's the freshman dorm and it's fantastic! You get 2 room mates but the rooms are huge and you have a lot of space! It is a VERY social dorm, you will know everyone within the first week. It is a great freshman dorm!"
College Sophomore,5,"Being from a small town, Edgewood College was the best place to choose. It has small class sizes where teachers know all of the students names and are willing to help each one. Everyone is welcoming and warm. There's not a day that goes by that I do not pass someone who smiles at me or says hello. It is a true community! I would not choose any other campus over this one, even if I was given a second chance."
College Junior,5,"UW Madison students are professional partiers. It's generally pretty safe place to party too. The Campus police are friendly and pretty forgiving for any party so long as you're not destructive. Lots of spots to hang out and have a good time too, if you're not a drinker. Plenty of places to relax, read, snack, and chit chat."
College Junior,5,"Madison food is amazing. So many choices, so many late hours. GO GO GO for the food and music and everything."
College Freshman,5,Edgewood is in Madison. Tons of places to eat and grocery shop.
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus. I currently live in a single and although some people would think its not as social like that, I find it even more sociable because we are forced to come out of our rooms. I find that the cost is a little expensive but comparing it to the cost of tuition, it makes sense. My dorm hall is also very convenient and in the middle of all the buildings."
College Junior,5,I feel like their are always people to advise you and give you extra help that you may need. It is easy to get overwhelmed but the professors and faculty are very accommodating
College Junior,5,I love the scenery with the lakes and plenty of activities within walking distance
College Junior,5,I thought the office was extremely helpful. I fell on some hard times right before the fall semester began and the financial aid office was able to get me the extra help I needed.
College Senior,5,I don't live on campus housing so I wouldn't know
College Junior,5,Excellent area to live in.
College Junior,5,"Been living off campus for two years, well worth it."
College Sophomore,5,We have posts for people to press a button if they would like an escort from a campus officer. I have never felt threatened or uncomfortable walking on my campus at night or during the day. I always have felt safe on Edgewood's campus.
College Sophomore,5,The people in my program are great and dedicated. The upper classes are willing to help you figure out what to do and how to do it. The program also sets you up for the internship that is required for a year to get your degree.
College Sophomore,5,"There are many requirements for majors, however the counselors and professors help make sure you get all the requirements in so you can proceed in your major. The challenges are trying to get a certain amount of volunteer hours for my major, but also getting class work done and getting good grades, while also balancing a job."
College Sophomore,5,"Edgewood is in walking distance of State Street, the party street of Madison, so the nightlife is great for Edgewood!"
College Sophomore,5,The class sizes are perfect. The most people I have in my classes I think is 23 people. I can build a relationship with everyone in my class and the professors know me by my name. I am able to talk with them one on one about assignments and even personal issues. The staff is absolutely amazing!
College Sophomore,5,I am going for child life which is an up and coming major. So far Edgewood has a 99% student placement in internships for this program. That is amazing and leads most students to their job once they complete the internship.
College Sophomore,5,The dorm rooms at Edgewood college are so spacious and big that you feel you have your own space even though you are sharing it with 2 other people. They are air conditioned making it comfortable and they do not have community bathrooms in many of their dorms which is always a perk.
College Sophomore,5,The campus strictness is pretty high at our school. This though allows students academics to be as high as they can because our school wants the students to focus on what's important
College Freshman,5,Madison has everything to offer when it comes to nightlife.
College Junior,5,"I love my program.  Certainly is challenging, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  Definitely feel as though I'll be prepared for my career."
College Junior,5,"Edgewood's campus is beautiful!  Tons of landscaping all around that is wonderfully kept.  The buildings range from old to new, but all look wonderful!  A lot of care is put into keeping the campus looking divinely beautiful!"
College Junior,5,Edgewood's main principle is compassion towards everyone is ideal for campus social life.  All people from all walks socially interact with great ease and enthusiasm! I've never heard of anyone being put down or discriminated against during my attendance. 
College Junior,5,"Madison has an amazing variety of cuisines to choose from, with above average quality.  In Madison they always push for healthy, organic, and local options.  The restaurants also have a vast variety of choices based on religious food practices as well!"
College Sophomore,5,"The process of getting into my major is very easy.  I just talk to my advisers, pick my major, declare my major, and start taking the classes I need."
Recent Alumnus,5,"My program had many requirements to get in.  I first had to write an essay about my self, creat a Curriculum Vitea and submit my undergraduate transcript.  Once I made it past the paper application I was asked to attend an interview day at the college.  While there I was interviewed for an hour about how and why I thought that I would be a good therapist.  I then conducted a moc session with a fake family in front of a few psychologists that took notes on my questions.  In addition to the interview I was expected to have volunteering, a solid GPA and research on my Curriculum Vitea.  
The whole application process was a challenge.  It was scary and intimidating.  I recommend taking a deep breath and doing the best that you can do.  You will end up where you need to be."
Recent Alumnus,5,I attend Edgewood College for a Master's in Marriage and Family Therapy.  It has been one of the best experiences of my life.  I am learning about the theories and models of therapy and how to apply them to my life.  I am enjoying the personal growth that my program has fostered and the plethora of knowledge that I am gaining.  I am so glad to be in this program!
College Junior,5,It was very simple and they were always available for help whenever I needed assistance.
Junior,4,I love the class sizes at Edgewood College. I think each class is set up to help students be successful and I feel like I can get help anytime I need it. I also love the community of Edgewood College and being in the city of Madison.
Senior,4,"Edgewood College is a small, liberal arts school in the heart of Madison, Wisconsin. It is great for students who want a tight community and the ability to build more personal relationships with students, staff, and faculty. With it's proximity to UW-Madison, you can still enjoy all the benefits of a big D1 school."
Senior,4,"The online learning was very good, as many of the professors have experience with online teaching. In addition, because class sizes are small, you are able to get more one on one help via email or video chat. The teachers are very helpful."
Junior,4,they were fine. Due to the circumstances there wasnt much the professors could do. It wasnt too hard to get things done but it was a nice expirence.
Junior,4,its a good school to get to meet new people. There is a lot of advantages to living in madison and going to a smaller school than UW
Alum,4,We used blackboard which is great for getting receipts on assignments.  Some professors are not online though so it isn't a universal system.
Alum,4,I had a great experience.  The professors were great.  The tag system is a bit confusing though. overall it was good.
Freshman,4,"Edgewood College is one of the best private colleges in Wisconsin. The small class sizes make the professors accessible and able to grasp the information better. It has changed my life. You can receive help whenever you like whether it be academic, person, or social assistance. The party scene isn't the best, but UW Madison is right down the street. The food is really good and they let you have a buffet of all you can eat. The dorms are new and very spacious."
Junior,4,"Edgewood's small campus and class sizes allow students to form close connections with peers and professors. Professors are always willing to help and enjoy getting to know their students' individual interests and strengths. The campus also hosts a variety of events for students to have fun, meet peers, and connect with professionals in the community."
Niche User,4,"When I visited, I liked how the student to teacher ratio is composed, the faculty is great as well, and they have one of the best nursing programs around. Diveristy is getting better too and it's close to home which is a bonus."
Freshman,4,"They really value community and making sure everyone feels like they belong. With it being a smaller school, class sizes and one on one time with professors and staff makes it that much better."
Sophomore,4,"Edgewood College is a great place to be! The location is ideal, as you are in the center of Madison, Wisconsin. Great professors, extra curricular activities, and programs are offered here. Small classes sizes and one on one professors time is readily available!"
Freshman,4,The thing I like about Edgewood is the small campus and the small classes. The reason being you get more one on one time with your professor.
Sophomore,4,"Very nice school, just a little to pricy. Wish there was more diversty and teachers can be alittle more understanding about life. Most students aren't as friendly as you thought they could be."
Senior,4,"The low student to professor ratio and small class sizes are amazing. The professors really care about you as a person and a student. The campus is pretty, especially in fall. The food is subpar and the dorms are expensive. They try hard to be inclusive but the student body is not diverse."
Sophomore,4,The professors at Edgewood College are amazing. they are very attentive and helpful when you need it. If they can't help you during class then they have office hours. The diversity of the campus is something that could improve but it's not a huge factor in the overall college campus and student life. There are numerous student-led organizations that incoming freshmen or transfer students can join. I am content with
Freshman,4,"This school is great for students when it comes to classroom settings, professor help, counselor help, and connections outside of the campus. It lacks in residence halls, food, and bills."
Senior,4,"Edgewood is a great place for the student community to come together. Most of the staff and faculty try to make The Edgewood Environment to be open, comfortable, and trustworthy. It would be a great improvement if all of the staff and faculty could participate, as well as the students."
Senior,4,"Overall, it was a great pick for me. I'm from Madison and enjoyed being able to stay in the town I grew up in as well as go to a smaller school in a larger city. The school is very expensive and sometimes doesn't seem worth the money."
Sophomore,4,"I have so far enjoyed my time at Edgewood College. The class sizes are small, and I have been mostly satisfied with the professors. I do wish that the higher up staff would be more in touch with the students and their needs, especially with how small the school is."
Freshman,4,My experience with Edgewood has been amazing. We are a small campus in a big city. We are 5 blocks away from one of the biggest campuses in the United States. The class sizes are very small. The biggest class I have had so far had 22 students. Also is very easy to get the one on one help you need. Plus every teacher knows your name. It is very simple to get an on campus job. Our campus food gets a little repetitive and easy to get sick of. But the good thing on being in Madison is there is a lot of food options so when you get sick of the food you can just get something else. Edgewood is easy to make friends.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Edgewood College, and when I came, I felt like it was a very welcoming place. It is a small college, and I like how I can have many of the same classes as my friends do so that we can work on classwork together."
Freshman,4,Edgewood College is a small sized college which makes it easy to get to classes. The classes themselves are challenging yet fun to take. It is a school that takes pride in their values and live up to them. One area that Edgewood struggles with is diversity.
Junior,4,I love the small class sizes and the professors are very well educated and really have a passion for what they are teaching. It is a bit pricey as far as college goes but they really try to help you out with scholarships.
Niche User,4,"Edgewood is one of the safest schools I've seen. It also has the perfect small-school feel in a big city, making college life extremely great. Also, the relation to the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is extremely strong, and benefits are able for everyone at both schools without additional costs."
Sophomore,4,I love the small class sizes because it gives me more one-on-one time with teachers. It is also located in a beautiful city!
College Freshman,4,It could have more variety.
College Freshman,4,"I think academics are more important but sports, school spirit, and other factors are also very important."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had any opportunities, but I am only a sophomore."
College Sophomore,4,I think the professors are great at what they do.
College Sophomore,4,"I think the TAG system requires too many tags for gen. ed. requirements, and is too general. It could be made specific for your major."
College Junior,4,There are phones or call boxes all over campus that connect with the security office as well as cameras.  Edgewood provides shuttles and students are well educated on how best to be safe on campus.  The initial tour highlighted the safety message and the school's feelings on student safety.
College Junior,4,The best part of campus living is the set up and options for on campus housing.  The sense of community and acceptance only adds to the ease of freshman transitioning to adult independent living.
College Junior,4,Unfortunately with the University of Wisconsin right down the street there is no football team which I believe would be beneficial to the school spirit.  However the baseball team is one of the best.  There is no lack of support for the teams that Edgewood has.
College Freshman,4,I love that we have a small enough school where you really get to know your professors and they get to know you. We are not taught by T/As so we get what we pay for. The professors care about us as students and we are not just a number to them. They are as committed to our education as we are.
College Freshman,4,Career services is really good at working with you and helping you figure out what best fits you with your intended major.
College Freshman,4,"I really like going to a smaller private school that has an enclosed campus. I think we have the best of both worlds because Edgewood is right on a lake, and is a ten minute walk to the zoo, but is also close to downtown Madison and students can choose to be as involved or not involved with the city as they want."
College Freshman,4,Class sizes vary-- but the professors are always helpful.
College Freshman,4,"For a small school, it has a great traveling abroad program."
College Freshman,4,Edgewood has great professors who are always willing to help. The worst thing about Edgewood is probably the meal plan. It's extremely average and the same meals get old after a while.
College Junior,4,I really enjoy this school.
College Junior,4,"In my degree, Edgewood is excellent."
College Junior,4,I really enjoy attending this school. I have had a great experience so far!
College Junior,4,"The small classes and connection with professors is something that is really helpful and important. The nursing program is difficult, but excellent and the professors all care so much about your success."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe as a female at night on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I like how the campus is small as you get to know the faculty and students more, but at the same time I wished it was a bit bigger."
College Freshman,4,Professors care about and what you receive in their class. It is truly great and the workload is good and enough to handle.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is accepting here on campus
College Freshman,4,They really care about us and always make sure we are safe
College Freshman,4,"They really help you get a job when you are looking for one, they bring in jobs from around the area and give you ""interviews"". As in fake interviews but sometimes you can do so well that they actually give you the job!"
College Freshman,4,"I love it here at Edgewood! A small school in the big city of Madison, you won't run out of ideas on what to do! There is so much! Don't worry about parties because UW is right there next to you! The class sizes are amazing, and you aren't a number in the class you are a person that the professor cares about and you will get more 1-1 with them! You will know all the people in class and have a great bond with them! It's easy to make friends and the campus is great!"
College Freshman,4,"I love it here! I've met so many great people and made friends so easily! The class sizes are great, with only up to about 18-20 people in a class, you will have a lot of help from the professor! Walking to classes isn't that bad either because everything is so close! A small school in the big city of Madison, there is always something to do!"
College Freshman,4,"We have the safe shuttle that runs every half hour, starting at 8 pm until 3 am, Thurs. thru Saturday I believe.  Plus security does rounds"
College Freshman,4,"I enjoyed all my courses and most of my professors, the class sizes were perfect for me and how I learn."
College Freshman,4,"Living close to classes is nice, especially in Stevie Hall"
College Freshman,4,It's expensive but I wouldn't change schools.
College Freshman,4,"The nightlife around Edgewood is great! Sense UW Madison is a short walk away, there's always a party going on. Edgewood has a shuttle bus that runs Thursday-Sunday that will take you by all the hot spots in Madison, and has route times that the bus will be there to pick you up."
College Freshman,4,"There is a lot of diversity relating political beliefs, religion, and sexual orientation. But there's a big gap between economic background."
College Freshman,4,"I love the small school atmosphere, small class sizes, and the fact that downtown Madison is only a few blocks away."
College Freshman,4,I'm a nursing major so there is always opportunities for volunteering and internships available. Great clubs and opportunities for resume help and mock interviews.
Freshman,2,in general college dealt with the virus issue horrible. i was told to pack up only essentials ie my medications  &  later told i cant get my other belongins. my RA can go through my belongings for me...
Freshman,2,"I went to Edgewood my freshman year because I got a good scholarship, but I will now be transferring to a different school. It was definitely not a good fit for me. The campus is very small and the students tend to be narrow-minded and cliquey. The academics are sub-par, I hardly learned anything in my classes because they were so easy. Even though Edgewood is in Madison, I felt very closed off from the city, and I'm from Madison! If you don't get financial aid, it is insanely overpriced. Basically, my only positive memories of Edgewood are going to the UW-Madison parties."
Freshman,2,"teachers & students are MEAN & RUDE! 
1.teachers told me id fail if i transferred to uwm for engineering prgm & told me to do collab prgm. you take classes at public college for degrees edgewood does not have but pay 4x for private tuition fee.degree still from edgewood & employers will know edgewood has no engineering. 
2.students are clique,worse than hs. have less kids in class than hs & live with them. sick to tell me im going to fail. no classmates stood up for me"
Alum,2,"Filled with UW-MADISON rejects. You don't get the brightest of the bunch even though they think they are the next einstien but are delusional. Many students couldn't ready a 4th grade level & have no business being there. This place is definitely pay for play, scraping bottom of the barrel and a degree mill at best. Advise to stay away."
College Junior,2,Athletics are not really part of campus life.
College Freshman,2,"We don't have Greek Life on campus, but you can find a fraternity/sorority around the campus at UW-Madison and join if you would like, I know people that have done that!"
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people in my dorm always talked about using drugs, I personally am against drugs so it was a bother. Some students would even abuse drugs and alcohol, but they were most likely turned in by another student and had the remaining drugs flushed by security."
College Freshman,2,"Edgewood doesn't have Greek Life, if you want to be a part of a sorority or fraternity, UW-Madison is very close"
College Freshman,2,"If you are looking for individual attention during class time you have come to the right place. The courses are by far the easiest college courses you could enroll into. My 349 class is very easy. If you are looking to actually learn something, I would recommend choosing a different school."
College Sophomore,2,"Our ""gym"" is shared with the elementary school nearby as a lunch room and our work out room is about the size of 3 dorm rooms put together and there is not much equipment for anyone but athletes to use. It sucks if some athletes are using it because it leaves nothing for the rest of us to use. School spirit is good but not many people go to games just because it can get so crowded in our small gym ."
College Freshman,2,I feel that there are not very many activities that have to do with my major
College Freshman,2,Most of the technology here is pretty reliable except for the wifi that connects and disconnects randomly
College Freshman,2,"There should be more computers available, especially in the student dorms."
College Freshman,2,People here are very stuck up. Over half of the people have a lot of money and know it. 
College Freshman,2,There is not enough parking to go around. The pass cost for one semester is outrageous! Parking tickets here are also very very high. 
College Sophomore,2,"Edgewood college is not that close to the downtown area, which is wear dining, and different stores and cafes are located."
College Sophomore,2,I hate the cold and the snow. Walking to class is really not fun but the campus is pretty small so the walk is never more than 10 minutes which is nice and easy to adjust to
College Freshman,2,"Even though there is diversity at Edgewood it is predominately a white college . Our school is not known for its diversity, which is a shame because people of different races bring so much character and fun to the campus because they are proud of who they are!"
College Freshman,2,"The visitor policies are what I dislike the most about Edgewood College. Male guests on the weekdays in the Regina dorm can only stay till 10pm and can only come three times on the weekends in a two week period. They are just way to strict on making sure guests leave when they are suppose to, and I feel they should be able to stay later than 10."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much to do on campus if your not involved with the clubs and organizations, however there are plenty to go on UW campus which is 5 minutes away!"
Sophomore,1,Teachers are lazy and just assign homework. You wonder why you are even paying when you realize you can. Learn off Google for free
Sophomore,1,sucks. i paid thousands of dollars to teach teachers how to teach me online . .only give you the task however dont show it
Sophomore,1,"Continuously stay away from for profit schools at all expense! This one included!This is a for profit school and it irritates me so much they state they are a not-for-profit organization. they are misleading  for profit schools are famous for bad education and this one didnt disappoint. one of my teachers never showed up because she didnt feel like it and the other half cant use a computer to save their lives. Ooh btw your credits don't transfer to other schools so good karma attempting. its transfer friendly in but your screwed trying to get out.This school has sketchy accreditation I attempted to move my credits to the uwm down the road and they said they didn't see my credits from edgewood an authentic and with this schools unreliable management you may wind up having it shut and you cannot move credits. read the article 20,000 reasons never to go to a for profit school and youll get it"
Senior,1,"Excessive hard and unforgivable homework. Why on earth do I have 6 or 9 assignments in a week? They take days to finish! I barely get anytime to relax as a student especially with my friends and peers. The costs of some fees like parking are outrageous. Better watch out or you'll get tagged with a $100 or more if you forget to properly place your permit or park in an inconvenient spot by accident. By the way, they make the permit so large it blocks your vision when you're driving and is a pain to take down and place up when you're on a busy schedule. Very poor and annoying design. Some of the students and teachers can be nasty at times. Makes me feel like I came to work with a boss and co-workers who have unpleasant and bickering attitudes. Can't express in words the problems this place has. Stay away while you still can. Stay far away."
Works Here,1,"$43,400/ year and its not worth it! RUN!!!!!  and they say they are a non profit, ! why are you charging 43/year then? its going to be almost 200,000.000 for a bachelors for what? this is not like its harvard of yale."
Alum,1,It's a good location that is on the lake but this place is incredibly disturbed. this place is a political hysteria and staff and the ones pushing it. BTW you need to buy a graduation package to graduate and told them I could not afford it.staff just asked for my address to send my diploma which was cheap paper and didn't even work with me help me attend graduation.

Alum,1,I still have nightmares about this place. The staff and professors were beyond hit and miss. They drain you financially and want to hit you up every chance they can. They hyped up their job fair and basically had 9/10 businesses only looking for account majors so 2/3s of is were out of luck. They hit me up for a donation 6 months after graduating while having tremendous student debt. 5 years later the degree has been completely useless and still in debt.
Sophomore,1,"26,000/year tuition for profit and they keep on adding to their CORE  classes which dont add any value. This is keeping students behind. since the school is so small, if there is lack of students, the class is canceled, but its a prerequisite for other classes so you cant actually move ahead because you need to wait for that canceled class. Also some of the teachers are so disgusting, they talk beneath about people who dont have degrees and think we all agree because we are in getting degrees, even proposing they shouldn't have the right to vote because ...no degree. i was shocked! got out of there and havent looked back!"
Niche User,1,"Despite graduating with honors, I had a terrible experience at Edgewood College. I wish someone would have told me to go elsewhere. Many of my instructors were clueless and unable to answer basic questions in lectures. Administration in my program had no interest in student concerns and feedback. If you want to prioritize your education and save your money, attend a different school."
College Freshman,1,The only good thing about Edgewood is their Cutting Edge program.
College Freshman,1,"Edgewood does not give you experience. Find a bigger campus if you're looking for experience, especially experience with social skills."
College Freshman,1,"Attending Edgewood College means the Greek Life doesn't exist. UNLESS if you can find a sorority/ frat that will accept you from UW-Madison. Some students are able to get in, but its selective."
College Freshman,1,"No one really attends the games. Its a very small college, so school spirit doesn't really exist. At least we have the Badgers to cheer for, right?"
College Freshman,1,Edgewood is the most anti-social college you will find. Attend UW-Madison if you actually want to find decent parties.
College Freshman,1,I would HIGHLY recommend trying to get out of the meal plan. It is a waste of money.
College Freshman,1,"Edgewood College is a great college if your intended major is nursing. They focus solely on their nursing department, and they put little to no effort into other departments. The social aspect of Edgewood College is very poor, and I would HIGHLY recommend looking into other colleges if you're even remotely outgoing. Overall Edgewood feels like high school. The only difference is you're paying thousands of dollars to go there, and unfortunately you have to live on campus for two years. You are also forced to buy a 1300-1500 dollars meal plan (PER SEMESTER). The food is outrageously priced, and to be honest the quality is not at all good. A majority of the people I spoke with before attending Edgewood College told me I would have the best of both worlds. I would have the small campus, large city feel. The truth is, Edgewood is over two miles away from all of the activity in UW-Madison. Its honestly rather depressing. During the winter it is nearly impossible to get over there. Nine out of ten times I found myself bored out of my mind. Yes, you make a few new friends here and there, but it is difficult to meet large groups of people. Also, they will tell you that they have quite a few organizations, and clubs. The truth is, it only takes three people to start an organization, team, club, etc there. There organizations are very tiny, and very limited. If you are looking for the full college experience, you will not find it here."
College Freshman,1,"We do not have greek life at Edgewood College, but I wish we did."
College Freshman,1,Nightlife at Edgewood is not good. There are no parties held at the college. If you want to go out you must go to UW Madison's campus.
College Sophomore,1,Very poor opportunities for graduate students to obtain scholarships.
College Sophomore,1,"As a commuter, I hate the transportation services.  The parking costs somewhere between 200-300 dollars per year and if you don't buy a pass then you have little to nowhere to park.  The streets are where you end up and in winter, it sucks.  They have a shuttle available for free but it doesn't pick up very far away and so you still have to drive almost the same amount.  There is a huge shortage on parking and they don't accommodate you very well."

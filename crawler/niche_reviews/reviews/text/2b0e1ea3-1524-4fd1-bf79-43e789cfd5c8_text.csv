Sophomore,5,The professors did a great job adjusting to online during the pandemic. The classes were really easy and ended up being more interesting without a professor lecturing.
Sophomore,5,"Overall the teachers are super easy. I have taken harder AP classes then these classes. Watch out for the psychology teacher Professor Campbell at the Titusville campus, she is a hard teacher. Robert Allen was a great teacher, as well as Fried, Boyette, Hartley, and Mangone."
Sophomore,5,I took classes online and in some cases I actually prefer the online experience for just how well-oiled and well-organized everything was! I'd certainly take it again if given the chance.
Sophomore,5,"One of the best colleges I've ever been to in my entire lifetime. The food is entirely way too good for what it is, the classes are nice and affordable. The staff there is wonderful and the professors are well-educated."
Sophomore,5,"I am a dual-enrolled student and this college was a great first step experience for me! I am almost done with my associate's degree and am pretty confident with my majoring decision (child psychology). The professors I had were all great and it was a nice atmosphere for me to get stuff done. Overall, I would recommend this college to any newly departed high school students or those even still in high school."
Alum,5,Eastern Florida State College has helped me advance my education immensely. The school is challenging but offers numerous resources to help succeed. The math tutors and writing tutors are very amazing and professional.
Sophomore,5,It was easy and my teachers were awesome and they made it easy taking classes online with how helpful they were.
Sophomore,5,I love this school. My advisor is awesome and knows her job and is very helpful! I love how there is different campus you can go too
Sophomore,5,"I take all of my classes online, as this is most convenient for me. The classes are well planned, I have no issues in which expectations are confusing. Due dates, instructions, any helpful material is all readily available at any time of the day."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern Florida State College is well priced, easily accessible, and allows for full-time online students to get the attention they need. The instructors are knowledgeable, and the courses are educational."
Niche User,5,"I attend the Melbourne Campus of EFSC and it is a great environment to learn in. Especially since they have built the new Student Union Building, it functions as a cafe, study hall, and hang out area. It has a very beautiful open floor plan (they have also begun to build dorms too). That is not the only thing that makes this school great, it is diverse, has friendly staff, it is cleanly, and you receive a great education at EFSC. It is a great ""starter"" school as well to take interesting classes to discover what your passion may be, it helped me in my own discovery. It also accepts high schoolers to attend as a way of getting ahead in their college careers 100% free (if their high school offers the opportunity of Dual Enrollment and/or Collegiate High Program). Highly recommend!"
Junior,5,The class that I took online was nutrition. My professor was dedicated to helping her students succeed from offering extra credit opportunities to staying up late and answering emails with questions that I had.
Junior,5,Eastern Florida State College is a great place to continue your education after high school while enjoying the comfort of living close to home. The professors are dedicated to helping you succeed in your academic career and want to see you thrive. There is nothing that I would change about this college and the amazing opportunities it has to offer.
Alum,5,"I loved their online classes. Amazing professors, wonderful programs and very well organized. I took more than half of my classes online."
Alum,5,This a great college I am so glad to have started my college career here. Professors are very caring and respectful. I have learned a lot from them. Both in person and online.
Alum,5,Online learning really helped me save time and gas. It was a great experience. Every online class was simple user interface and intriguing learning curriculum.
Alum,5,I loved the ability to build my own schedule it really meant the difference between an A and a c for me.
Sophomore,5,The professors cared and made it obvious! If I had any questions I never felt uncomfortable asking. I also loved the advising and UCF Direct Connect office. These offices were super nice and helpful with any of my concerns. Very well organized overall!
Sophomore,5,"EFSC is a great school. I got my associates degree and certificates from this school and now I'm going back for my bachelors. The only thing the school needs to improve on is the parking lot. There are more students than parking spaces! No matter what campus you are on, the parking  lot is a nightmare. Maybe invest in a parking Garage?"
Niche User,5,"I only took one math class, but my professor was fantastic!! The staff and admissions counselors were extremely helpful when navigating dual enrollment! :)"
Sophomore,5,I'm a dual-enrollment student at EFSC and I've really enjoyed the transition from high-school to college. I thoroughly enjoy the professors and the coursework. I also like taking specialized courses towards what I want to become and I like the availability of these classes.
Sophomore,5,Eastern Florida State College is a friendly campus with professors that engage and encourage students to thrive.
Graduate Student,5,Great school! For a public college they have a lot of resources and help options for students to succeed.
Sophomore,5,Eastern Florida State College is very diverse. I love the teaching staff. The one major thing that i would like to see change is the campus activities. I would like to see more events and more activities for the students.
Junior,5,Love the small classes and instructors. The counselors are always willing to help. Would recommend for first degrees
Sophomore,5,My experience at Eastern Florida State College has been exceptional during the past two years. I will continue here until I complete my Associates degree. My major is in Nursing and my plans are to transfer over to University of Central Florida for my third and fourth year to complete my degree.
Sophomore,5,"Excellent campus and teachers.  The advising department are very helpful in guiding you on the college journey. Before enrolling, I do recommend  using rate my professor. Like any other college, their are great and horrible professors. If you have the ability to take Andrew Forbes, TAKE HIM. He is the best teacher there. He guides you and teaches you.; I recommend him. 100%"
Sophomore,5,"For the most part, great staff and good student atmosphere! There's a good diversity of students. The campus (at least the Melbourne one) has/ is being updated. Student housing is supposed to be built in the near future! As far as a party scene... I'd say you'd be better off going to a university. It is your basic community college, although they have done a great job redoing it."
Freshman,5,I really like the campus!! And the the friendly staff and also like the classes I'm currently in as well !! I'm currently in bio and phycology
Junior,5,"While attending Eastern Florida State College, I have learned a plethora of things.  I was given the opportunity to attend ESFC while I was in high school. This gave me the full college student experience that not only broadened my academic knowledge but also gave me a new sense of maturity. Going to EFSC helped me get two years of my college out of the way. Not only that but I was able to create a relationship with all of my professors."
Freshman,5,"I like pretty much everything, the teachers are very encouraging and they help the students get to where they need to be. I wouldnâ€™t change anything about it to be honest."
Freshman,5,My experience has been pretty average! I enjoy the college life and taking classes at Eastern Florida State College!
Senior,5,"The Professors are excellent and care about their students success.  The tuition has not increased for 8 years, which I think us very good."
Freshman,5,If you are not sure what you want to do in the future yet I suggest attending EFSC. The courses range in difficulty and the advisors are helpful own your journey for a better future.
Junior,5,It is the best place for a student to start out in because the teachers work with the students to help them understand what they truly need to know in their life and the advisors try their best to give students the best path to success as possible.
Sophomore,5,Eastern Florida provided me with a quality and fast education for my first 2 years of undergrad. It also allowed me more financial freedom since it wasn't as expensive as other colleges.
Sophomore,5,"I'm in my second year of college at EFSC, and so far I enjoy my classes. All the professors I have had have been interesting, fun, and helpful. I recommend EFSC to anyone looking to receive an Associates Degree."
Niche User,5,Every teacher and student I encountered while studying here was a delight and I enjoyed my time very much.
Graduate Student,5,"I have loved my experience at Eastern Florida State College , the class sizes are ideal and i would highly recommend this location and school."
Sophomore,5,Eastern Florida State College is a wonderful environment for students to experience. The advisors and professors are helpful in every situation. The classes are productive and make students work hard. The campus is enjoyable with great food choices and beautiful study rooms. EFSC is a delightful school to attend.
Freshman,5,"I have had nothing but helpful hands, and smiles. the admission process is definitely a process, but the teamwork with their employees really do make things a lot easier."
Graduate Student,5,Eastern Florida State College has been a benefiting experience for me as I was able to be dually enrolled through my high school. The professors work well with your schedule when you are dually enrolled. They are very good teachers and are very caring and considerate.
Freshman,5,I enjoy Eastern Florida State College as the professors are suburb and the student friendly is warm welcoming. The professors are truly of the highest quality and care deeply about the students. This college encourages growth and achievement and values its students.
Freshman,5,The professors are great and extremely helpful even when someone doesn't fully understand something. School staffing are easy to work with and always try to find ways to help the students.
Sophomore,5,Overall the service is excellent at the school.  The teacher want you to be successful and they are used to working with a diversified group of students. Ideas for improvement could include more courses to choose from and pretty campus.
Freshman,5,"The academic experience at EFSC has been remarkably much greater than my expectations. Due to its small class size, A student is able to enjoy the benefit of individual attention. This ultimately helps stay Scholastically  focused and motivated."
Junior,5,It is a very good school where the teachers actually care about you and make sure you are learning. Unlike other school the teachers don't stroke their ego and actually try to teach you properly.
Sophomore,5,"If I have questions or a problem, the staff was always eager to help and they did the best they possibly could to prepare me. Overall a very nice college experience so far."
Alum,5,"It was here at this college that I discovered my passion for acting, and acquired a lot of experience. If it wasn't for this school, I would not be the actor that I am today. It was affordable, and opened a lot of doors. Because it's local,  made a lot of new friends, and was able to received my Associate's degree, which has really helped me when applying to universities."
Alum,5,"Classes were flexible, and many were offered online. The instructors were all very well-read in their respective fields, and always willing to help after hours."
Niche User,5,The environment of the school is great. The student government are extremely involved with the community and the teachers are all great. Everyone is willing to help at all cost. Where titian's rise!
Freshman,5,"EFSC is a really great college. The staff, teachers, and security are all very helpful and welcoming. They understand and are able to accommodate your needs. I always feel safe on campus and personally, the Cafe has really good food. There are learning labs open at all times, and tutors who are very helpful and supportive. Overall, a very safe and positive environment."
Senior,5,"This is a fairly new four year university. Although, the teachers are great! The classes are smaller, but the learning environment is excellent."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern Florida State College is a fantastic college to go to if you are in high school and would like to receive an Associates Degree or if you want to receive a bachelors degree at a cheap, and affordable cost. This college is great for people that want a jump start on life."
Sophomore,5,Love that there are many options available to take classes. There is always something to do on campus and they even put out a employment list to help those that are looking for a job. They care about their students and make it easy to succeed.
Freshman,5,"I like the first college experience, it wasn't as scary as it seemed. I came to the school with no clue on how to get to any of my classes, but luckily there's friendly students and great faculty to help you. On another note, the campus is beautiful, there's a lake and a view that makes the whole campus beautiful. The professors here are very helpful and resourceful, they make sure that you're included in everything that's going on. These professors make sure that if you're late or even absent that you're provided with the information that you've missed. The only thing that I would critic about this school is the lack of  team sports that should be included, but other than that its a great college. Im glad that Eastern Florida State College was my first choice of college to attend."
Sophomore,5,"I am a mother of 3, I hold a full-time job and EFSC offers online courses to make it easier for me to access my courses throughout the day to complete my assignments.  There is also tutoring on campus that I have used to help me fully understand my work.  I was skeptical about returning to school to earn my degree in nursing but EFSC has made it such a smooth and easy process from admissions to taking my online courses.  I couldn't be happier.  I am now on my way to providing a better life for my children and all the lives that I will come in contact with throughout my career.  Thank you EFSC!"
Freshman,5,My experience with eastern Florida state college it's a great one. I like the fact that the college is divers. I also like the fact that the campus is nearby . I like the fact that the professors take pride in what they do .
Niche User,5,I love the area! It is close to the beach. The bridge that leads to Cocoa beach is near the campus. The academics there are wonderful. I learned all necessities for business. I am looking to pursue in the business management field.
Freshman,5,"I love the friendly, professional and laid back nature of this college. The staff and professors are very interested in their students success, and setup many programs to assist in the success of all students. They really have worked hard to foster an environment that is geared towards encouraging learning. I highly recommend this College."
Niche User,4,"Everything about this school is pretty good, but I did have problems with one of my professors. So 4/5."
Niche User,4,"Everything was really good, my class transferred really well. The only problem was that my internet didn't work sometimes and I couldn't do school."
Freshman,4,Eastern Florida State College is a great community college. It offers a large variety of courses and their tuition is very low.
Senior,4,"Eastern Florida State College has a large range of programs that can pertain to any student.  They have programs for every specific position related to Health Sciences.  If you have an interest EFSC probably has a program for you.  EFSC is a small school, so it is not much of a party school and does not have many popular athletics."
Sophomore,4,"I have taken many classes online and overall it was a great experience for me, especially during this pandemic (COVID-19)."
Niche User,4,"EFSC is a good school, they have the courses that I need and all of the teachers have been favorable."
Niche User,4,"The teachers are accessible, and the platform (canvas) has been easy to use. I appreciate the hardworking advising staff and professors."
Junior,4,"A community college like Eastern Florida State College was a good transition for me. For people that are coming out of high school and are not ready to go to a big university, this would be a great choice."
Junior,4,Taking courses online has been one of the best choices. I was able to work at my own pace and intake the information given to me better. The professor always helped you and provide other resources if needed.
Freshman,4,"I loved this school, it  was extremely affordable and there was a wide variety of class times for those who needed it. The classes were small which I loved. I would definitely love to go back during the summers when I'm back home from school elsewhere."
Freshman,4,"Switching to online learning isn't easy for everyone and I was one of those people, however, EFSC made it easier on me. It wasn't too crazy of a workload and the professors did a good job at giving us a heads up when assignments were due."
Niche User,4,"I have taken a couple online courses at EFSC and it is a good experience. It is convenient and the professors I have personally had so far are tech savy enough to make it through the course. I do recommend to look up reviews on your professor if it makes any difference to you. Overall, make sure you manage your time, stay on top of your work, and working ahead helps a lot too."
Niche User,4,"Lots of great professors, awesome campuses, and good use of resources! I have had a great experience at EFSC."
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at Eastern Florida State College. I have really enjoyed my time here. All my professors have been wonderful. They are definitely challenging but you learn so much. The campus is beautiful and clean. Such a nice environment. I really enjoy the location its around a lot of good places to eat and study. The only thing I wish to see improvement on is the array of degrees they offer. I feel like its a smaller college with not a ton of options for certain people.
Freshman,4,"Nice campus, making some expansions to add more programs. Staff is really nice and helpful both in person and via email"
Sophomore,4,"Very easy and convenient campus, enjoyed all my options. I began taking courses my senior year of high school and my transition was as smooth as possible. I was able to choose any classes I wanted to but was guided with the help of my advisers. It is a very small college but I enjoy it if that is what you're looking for. Class sizes are relatively small and the online options are very resourceful."
Sophomore,4,Overall Eastern Florida State College is a very good school. They offer alot of flexibility for all types of lifestyles and needs. They are fairly organized and helpful. The Health Science Department could be a little more helpful though. I have encountered a few people within that department who act as though they are doing a favor by answering questions. All and all I cannot complain about the school overall though.
Freshman,4,"Nothing terrible about the college. I do recommend looking at professor rating sites to avoid potential headaches. Also, if you are a high school student it would be your benefit to do dual enrollment here over AP classes if you already know what degree you want and especially if you are applying to a easy to enter state college."
Sophomore,4,Multiple campuses across the county; accessible and informative. My campus is less than a mile away. Quick responses from advisers.
Sophomore,4,"I did exclusively online classes which were easy to use and had excellent instructors, but the fact that you have to pay a third party to proctor exams is a bummer"
Junior,4,"I enjoyed my time at Eastern Florida State College. For every negative experiance I had with professors, I had two good ones. I participated in the Military veteran service center, Phi Theta Kapa chapter, Core Scholar program, and various activities around campus. Classes and professors mostly foster an interest in learning and the subjects that they teach. Overall, this school is what you make of it. If you apply yourself to the challenges that you face, you can come out successful. My first semester was terrible but after I chose to get involved and apply myself I averaged mostly A's. I would recommend this school to veterans and any student who needs a stepping stone (or less cost) path to specific 4-year degrees or transfer to a 4-year university."
Sophomore,4,"Eastern Florida State College was a great start to my educational path. The teachers want you to succeed. Students around you are relatively friendly. Events are going on all the time and there are lots of clubs to choose from. One thing I would like to see changed is the communication of club information at a more widespread level, so that more students can get involved."
Sophomore,4,Eastern Florida has been a great school in terms of space. There are multiple outlets to study everywhere here. My personal favorite is the library as well as the language lab. One of the downsides to EFSC is the parking situation. We are located next to the King Center so parking can be frustrating sometimes and the other student parking lot is full of twists and turns as well as a lot of stop signs that make parking stressful.
Freshman,4,"I really EFSC, I go to the Melbourne campus and so far loved all my professors and teachers. Make sure to check them at ratemyprofessor before picking just in case it might be a teacher that you dont want. I'm taking a couple of online courses this summer and really like it. I'm more of an online person person person person person person person person person person"
Senior,4,I liked the relaxed feel of the campus and many of my professors seemed to care about their students success. I would like to see a cleaner campus with updated classrooms and new restrooms.
Freshman,4,It's a small school but most of the teachers are cool. The campus has a lot of new buildings and student resources available.
Senior,4,"I enjoyed the small class sizes, the low cost of tuition, and the interpersonal relationships that you can develop with your professors. Really my only complaints about this school is getting answers for generic questions from any admissions office. The academic advisers are no help. But overall if you can navigate in your own its a great college."
Sophomore,4,I started Eastern Florida State College as a sophomore in high school. My junior year I graduated from high school but continued to attended the college as a full time student. In some events after my graduating early complicated a few things but it wasn't anything the school wasn't helpful with. I'm proud of how far I've come and plan to graduate this May. I'm so grateful for the opportunity and the support I've received from Eastern Florida.
Sophomore,4,"I love the beauty of the 4 different campuses. I enjoy how I can interchange each campus to suite my needs. The majority of the students are also working full-time or part-time jobs, so the party scene is non-existent. That is particularly wonderful because the focus for the most part is on the classes and not the next party. Brevard County is what I refer to as for the most part a sleepy town that offers good jobs and opportunities for working students and graduates. The down side is that there is no on-campus living as of 2019, which requires you to rent an apartment from the surrounding area, so if you come to this college from out of area, then I recommend visiting the website or calling the college to work out where you will be living."
Sophomore,4,"A majority of the professors at Eastern Florida are extremely insightful and encouraging. This is not a pressuring school which can make college more enjoyable. I would have given five stars, but I feel as if a few professors are in need of replacement."
Senior,4,The college offers many courses taught by several professors. The student center helps with practically any need a student may have.
Freshman,4,Eastern Florida State College is an excellent school with great facilities equipped with experience and knowledge in order to help students achieve their goals.
Freshman,4,"Easy guided enrollment, student information online access. Advising and administrators easy to speak with.  Many clubs and volunteer opportunities."
Freshman,4,Professors are very helpful and the classes are flexible. Staff and Admin are very helpful when choosing classes. They take the time to show what credits are needed and the best track for your major. The campus is very large and clean and I enjoy the vending machines that are placed because it is access to snacks after class. The parking is usually empty so there are plenty of spaces for parking and there are many lights so it is very safe at night. Campus police are very friendly and will walk students to their cars if they feel unsafe which is great.
Freshman,4,I started at the Palm bay campus in September. I am currently taking two classes and the professors are cool. The campus has a chill vibe very aesthetic.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy Eastern Florida Sate College for a number of reasons. That campus has small class numbers so I can better talk with my Professors and understand the material further. There are also a wide variety of courses available for all sorts of interests and fields of studies. The professors are also very good and easy to work with. Very good college.
Alum,4,A quality college that offers a great foundation for students entering college and for those looking to complete specialized degrees or certifications in law enforcement or EMT training.
Alum,4,"Good local school for students who can't relocate, faculty cares about the students. This school has multiple campuses located throughout Brevard county, Fl."
Sophomore,4,"The classes are small so it is easy to get help from professors, and to develop relationships with other students. It is an easy to navigate campus with a friendly and welcoming staff.  The learning lab is frequently open for free tutoring, proctored exams, or peer reviews on papers. The in-state tuition is relatively inexpensive, and they offer a variety of different classes for different degrees. I have enjoyed my time there throughout my career as a student for my associate in arts degree. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small and efficient college in Brevard County."
Niche User,4,"During the three semesters that I spent at Eastern Florida State College Cocoa campus, I had a pretty good experiences and created many new fun memories. The classes that I took were all taught by professors who knew the subject that they were teaching and were very helpful. All the professors made it easy to get in touch with them if you need extra help, had a question, or needed to make up a test. The other students that attended EFSC were people that you probably already knew from the local high schools or just being part of the community. The college offers many resources to help you succeed in the classes that you are taking. There is not much of a campus life at Eastern Florida since it is a community college, but the school does put on events for the students before classes or in between classes. One thing that could change at Eastern Florida that I would like to see is the school bringing a little more attention to the sports teams."
Graduate Student,2,"Some instructors are excellent; however the processes and communication across departments for admissions, FinAid, advising, etc are terrible."
Sophomore,2,"I've recently returned after 14 years since I last attended. While the classes have been fine, the Financial aid and Advisement departments have been absolutely no help whatsoever. I can't quite get over the fact that NO ONE seems to be able to answer any questions or even relatively knows more than the very basics of their job. When you try to go higher up, as advised to get answers, you either don't get a response or are stonewalled. As a professional myself, I don't understand how they are able to function with this complete lack of knowledge and professionalism. I am beyond frustrated and angry with the administration of this college. I am beyond disbelief at the overall incompetence of the departments that are the most crucial to the functionality of this college. The reputation of this college is suffering. I have no pride in saying I attend at EFSC. In terms of cost and convenience, this is why I'm still attending. If I had a viable choice of elsewhere, I'd likely go elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,some of the teacher at my school can be not so great. I would really like better teachers. At this school you have to talk to other student to find out who the good and bad teachers are.
College Freshman,2,For my major there are not many opportunities for me. I have not heard of any great internship opportunities and there are not any great programs established. I wish there were more hands on classes but as of now we only have the typical science classes. My school is more focused on the outdoor majors than health majors.
College Sophomore,2,There are not many options for class schedules offered. I have had to take several night classes that were not desired as the parking is distant from the buildings and security inadequate. I have not needed to transfer credits so have no experience to comment on in that area.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I like nursing but being young without all the experience I find it hard to earn the right amount of ""points"" to get into the program."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is very small and has limited resources. however, I did just read that the college was awarded a million-dollar government grant to help with standing their degree program and resources on campus. I believe that will help in the future."
College Student,2,"I definitely felt valuable as a person when I went to the career center in Titusville. However, I don't feel that using the career center will actually give the student a better chance of attaining employment. Mainly, the career center just gives you an idea of what jobs may be available in your area. They also have computer programs available to help you decide whether or not you may be interested in a particular career field. As for finding a job, you might as well just open the paper and start calling. "
College Junior,2,"I'm a pre-medical major, and its hard to get the classes i want to take related to my major. The advisers that I saw didn't help at all."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are a great number of classes available, the problem is there is a not enough face to face and forces you to take them online."
College Senior,2,We have to pay an internet fee every semester but no one seems to know the password.
College Sophomore,2,"For visual/performing art students I would not recommend this college. For everything else, it is not bad."
College Sophomore,2,The online network isn't very reliable but when it does work it is alright.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The policies to qualify for financial aid are sometimes downright draconian.  I have been going there for 4 semesters with one left to go and a 3.06 GPA, and I still have to jump through hoops very semester to get my aid package."
College Freshman,2,Wireless Internet isnt even accessable in evey building of the campus. It can be rather slow and the tecnology is lacking.
College Student,2,Theres not much to do on campus other than the King Center in Melbourne campus
College Student,2,"Everyone there seems to be doing their own thing, although their medical/nursing program is amazing."
College Junior,2,"Interesting question! I will tell you that my experience in the beginning was good, but I'm not happy with the school and there is a reason for that, and it's to long of a story to explain. What's frustrating is that when I transfered my credits in from another college, they brought all of my classes in except my math which they are making take over again! Also I have a ton of english classes as well they had transferred into the college for credit, but guess what? They're making me take all of those classes over again which is insane and confusing to me. Why transfer the credits in if you're just going make me repeat the classes that I already have taken over again? Does that make any sense to anyone? So,please people don't let them do that to you and question them if they do, but don't be satified with their answer because I think they just want to make more money out of you and it's a waste of time and a huge set back...... Make sure you fight them when they do that and they don't stick with your plans don't attend the school find another institution that will accept everything where they wont make u repeat classes that you have already taken..... I'm paying the price of that right now, but I'm leaving the school after this semester is over anyways....."
College Junior,2,"The school is okay; however, their isn't enough tutors for math which is a problem for a student who is having problems with math. I mean how is any person going to be successful in any subject when there is no enough tutors to going around to the ratio of student? I would like to see that changed soon or else there going to lose students because of it! Other than that I think it an ok school...."
College Senior,2,"There is no Hospitality Program despite being fairly close to Orlando, arguably the heart of the hospitality industry."
College Sophomore,2,My school consists of mainly lower class students ranging from dual enrolled high schoolers to adults returning to college.
College Junior,2,"There aren't any real courses for engineering. Of course, they have the math classes and physics up to the 2000th level but they don't offer any courses aimed for people who want to become Engineers. They have a degree for engineer technician which is a manufacture worker and is not the same as an Engineering Degree or even a stepping stone for one."
College Senior,2,"The facilities on campus could  use a little improvement. The gym that we have is really small with  limited equipment. The library is pretty big , and over looks the lake which is really cool. Our cafe could use a little improvement, just more space for every one to congregate."
College Junior,2,There is no gymnasium where students can exercise unless they are enrolled in campus athletics. This is limiting. The student center is accessible and many computers are available for students to use.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the people in the healthcare setting are fantastic. They work together well and are always willing to be part of a team. However, BCC has a large number of high school students on campus for their early admissions and dual-enrollment programs. These kids are TERRIBLE. They are extremely loud, rude, and tend to be distracting in classes."
Recent Alumnus,2,I had a lot of problems with advisors and financial aid. I did however enjoy my professors.
College Junior,2,My school to me is not very unique in its qualities.
College Sophomore,2,Printing is now charged at our campus so I try not to do it too much. The speed is very slow on wifi. Computer labs are open in the library until seven at night.
College Junior,2,At least in the Titusville campus its like this. There are some good people but overall the people are lazy and are only taking at least one class a semester and want to get by without doing any work at all. Although the good people are very nice and can make good friends.
College Sophomore,2,Most of my classes are full of very young kids still in high school so the level of maturity is low and I have to deal with kids chatting and laughing during class.
College Junior,2,The college is very pro-active in emailing students and alumni when jobs become available in the area. There are also several career service workshops throughout the year.
College Junior,2,"For a community college it has some nice things, including outside seating and study areas. But compared to even a basic state college it lakes in many of the things listed."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The student body consists of adults who are going back to school, people with part time jobs and families, or students who couldn't get into a university, or have a plan after high school just sort of find themselves at BCC with little motivation, and it shows in class. School spirit, or any interest in school functions at all are almost completely unapparent. BCC comes off as more as a pass through school than a real college experience."
College Junior,2,the financial aid office isn't the most friendly or helpful. this was the first time applying for aid and i felt like an idiot asking them questions. not very helpful
College Sophomore,2,"Overall is was hard to get in contact with the correct people you need to speak with.  Staff working in specific offices did not seem to enjoy their jobs and seemed quite angry to be asked any questions at all.  Not a very pleasant experience.  I was required to pay of out state tuition for a year, which I knew about, however, when I went to apply for residency I was told that the documentation that I provided may not be accepted.  Overall very stressful."
College Sophomore,2,Too Many Different Opnions â€“ While in classes I believe BCC is a good school.  However meeting with advisers to schedule classes if you are unsure is quite a hassle.  I had spoken withe a few advisers while choosing a schedule and each one told me different things and each one told me I was at very different spots in order to graduate.  When telling them the major I wanted to go for they did not seem very knowledgeable in what path would be best.  Overall slightly disappointing.
College Senior,2,"Its a Typical Community College â€“ The best thing about this college is that the classes are cheap and you have the ability to get your degree completely online, however, I do not feel like I have learned anything here. I was an AP student in high school, but because of financial problems I had to stay here. The classes are very slow paced, and its easy to get very bored after a couple of weeks."
College Senior,2,"Computer Networking â€“ Just transfering to Brevard Community College after completing 44 hours at South University, Savannah, Ga."
Recent Alumnus,2,Below Average â€“ The financial aid office is very helpful but the number of campus scholarships is minimal. Meaning you have to search other resources to find scholarships.
Recent Alumnus,2,The student centers don't have much and what they do have is old. The Libraries are nice and well shelved.
College Student,2,"Ages 13-80+ â€“ All walks of life here. Most are there for free, so most don't care about the class. But still proper bell curves for the most part. Most have families and are going for nursing..."
College Student,2,"Cheapest There Is, but Not Cheap Enough for Me. It runs about $1500 for 12 credit hours, more if they are online or labs. I dont get grants, so I pay CASH. Its the best deal around though.Its $20 just to get your grad papers, and $10 for an official transcript. Printing is free for 10 pages most places, but I hear that instead of raising tuition, they will charge 25 cents a page per print...? I know when the semester starts, the lines to talk to Fin-aid are CRAZY so get your questions answered early!"
College Junior,2,"Discussion Boards â€“ I have to say all is not roses.... I wish the discussion board was visual-friendly.. the posts are hidden and you have to keep clicking to see other posts. If it were in a style such as a list, I think it would be easier to respond.. Visually I think it could be improved."
College Junior,2,"Teachers Are Not Great! I enjoy the flexibility of classes online, but many of the teachers are horrible! I have had to communicate several times with teachers due to the fact that they are not actively participating in the class themselves."
College Junior,2,"Professors Unfair â€“ The teaching staff at Brevard Community College is a sad one. The teachers are normally not prepared or teach off of a old power point and just read the slides. I can do that....  A teacher should know or have the ability to research questions that are brought up in class, and not be upstaged by students. I have had many classes where the student would know more the the professor teaching the class and the teacher would show no effort to find the answers to some questions we had. The common response is ""its in the book, you should read it"" when the answer isn't even in the book or the question doesn't have anything to do with the book. Oh and books are a scam. Teachers say read the book but some students have almost gone through BCC with out perchasing a single book and still come out with staight A's."
College Junior,2,"The SGA is realy the only ""club"" that does anything. SGA tries to do a monthly event to try to get students together and have fun or do and learn something about culture or awareness of something. Their events normally have food and a good guest speaker."
College Junior,2,Classes Were Ok. Most of my teachers looked like and sometimes were people who the college begged or couldn't find anyone else to fill the spot. The college has poor teacher recruting skills and either do not give enough training or information on how to use the grading scale. Some times teachers moods got in the way of how to grade the class. Some wouldn't care if you were in the class and some were strict. There needs to be a more uniform type process. Some teachers at the Palm Bay and Melbourne campus's need to be looked at again. Some gave questions on tests and study questions that they didn't know the answer to. How are we the student supposed to learn if the teacher can't teach. I have gone to the department of chairs office many times and nothing gets resolved to grade changes or anything. All they say is thanks and we will look in at the problem. No word what so ever. The college is about to be a four year college I hope it changes a few of its staff members...
College Senior,2,"Course Difficulty Not Equal â€“ Courses often seem like ""high school 2.0."" Some professors do try to give you a college appropriate workload and difficulty, but in the end, most classes are too easy and not up to the standards of many universities."
College Senior,2,"LOL at Titan Pride â€“ Brevard Community College has no communication to their students. By the time I realize a fun event had taken place at the school, I find out it had taken place a week before. Most teachers treat teaching as a job, not a passion. Despite the ""close student-teacher"" atmosphere the small college tries to pass off in brochures, the teachers don't want to be bothered and won't loose sleep over whether you passed or failed their class. After basing my classes off of ratemyprofessor.com and seeing how awful the teachers in their math department are, and knowing from personally being enrolled in a few, and seeing a shocking amount of students dropping the class, it befuddles me that the college does nothing to fix their staff situation. Overall, I see BCC as a passthrough college and would prefer not to spend more than the required 60 hours there."

College Senior,2,The tuition is ok I wish getting financial aid was easier to obtain.
College Senior,2,"Although I am able to take classes online to work around my full time work schedule, the dates are limited. I prefer two minimesters of classes but the minimester classes are extremely seletive. Also, BCC needs more classes offered at night/weekend/early morning. It is hard to have several classes when there is only 2 different times at night that overlap offered. Also, the cost of tuition is nearly impossible to recover from and I am charged EXTRA for online classes that I have to TEACH MYSELF. Why should I pay more to use my supplies and teach myself? The previous college was more desirable and provided grants to me. Now I am struggling to pay for 1 class. I may not even be able to go to school this semester."
College Junior,2,"College Is Not for Those Without Patience â€“ Paper work, paper work and more paper work. Thats what College is about Paper work, fees and due dates."
College Sophomore,2,Since it is a community college there aren't many post-grad services.
College Junior,2,"One Unorganized Class Killed the Experience â€“ I sorry but I feel when I'm spending this much money that I want what I'm paying for.  I'm not paying for attitude.  I want to be educated and I don't want to hear excuses about software.  If there is something wrong with it correct it but don't  put students through hoops to work with something that should have been tested before classes started.  I don't want to hear from the provist that its not an issue when I've read from other students that it is an issue.  
I did have one class that I enjoyed and I learned and it was worth my time, the instuctor was great.
The bad experience now makes me investigte every class and instuctor."
College Senior,2,It is an alright school. There isn't really anything good or bad about it. It just seems like any other average school.
College Freshman,2,"For the most part Brevard Community College is a very convenient school. It has four campus locations in Brevard County as well as an online campus. It has a wide variety of apprenticeship other degree programs. Class sizes are small enough for students to easily interact with their teacher and fellow peers. Teachers are aware of students' workloads, so class work and tests are not an overload problem. However,BCC needs improbement when it comes to class variety and availability upon semester registration. Every campus is different, and I have found that some campuses offer a wider variety of classes, teachers, and  class times than others. I go to the Palm Bay campus and quite often am disappointed when registration time rolls around. This coming semester, I wanted to take Bio II, but could not because the only bio II classes available at my campus were hybrid courses-- not all students can take hybrid or online courses with ease--Iam one of them. Also, Online registration begins 1-2 weeks earlier than walk-in registration. I do not feel comfortable doing online registration, as I would rather sit down with an advisor  and register. Due to this lapse in registration availability, my desired classes would often be closed already, thus having no other choice but to take night classes for courses I would already struggle with in the day time (i.e. Pre-calculus Algebra)."
Recent Alumnus,2,High School Part 2 â€“ I feel like the teachers at BCC are just continuing on with the high school education I have received. I do not think students are well prepared coming out and I know that I have had to teach myself most of the time. I do not feel challenged and the school often plays favorites. It is just a continuation of High School with the clicks and the drama.
College Junior,2,Its a community college so i guess im not getting the entire college experience. Brevard community college is ok...nothing more nothing less/
College Sophomore,2,the computers are kinda slow at my school. the only thing we use computer is for a project. but the wirless is not good
Graduate Student,1,"Registration and counselors are limited and require a long wait time plus they suck at what they do. If you need registration confirmation for insurance or other purposes, be prepared to meet some incredibly rude people . I spent weeks trying to get them to do some 5 minute paperwork to be sent to the VA. The VA office itself is equally worthless as they pass the monkey to the registration office and never give good advice. Whoever is in charge of the administrative part, should go back to (another) college to get a refresher.  As far as the professors are concerned, about 20% are good teachers, but most fail their students miserably by not explaining the curriculum well, giving very confusing assignments to complete or not givingthe right study directives and not using internet resources or read their emails. I failed several courses due to lousy teachers and with me many others!"
College Senior,1,ive never seen or heard of employers coming to the school to recruit people and the alumni network isn't that great
College Sophomore,1,Whats the point of having an online class if I cant take the tests online? The point of them is to not come to the campus but yet you have to not just come but schedule and appointment for the tests and some quizzes. Makes it seem sort of moot.
College Sophomore,1,I don't like that the school's Financial Aid Department. They aren't very proactive in assisting the students to find other financial assistance other than FAFSA.
College Junior,1,I wish the instructors cared a little more and actually wanted students to learn. The student body in a lot of my classes are not really that large once students start dropping which is almost always the first week in class.I have never sat down with an instructor and felt like once I asked a question they went out of their way to help me understand.
College Junior,1,"I honestly chose this school because it was my only option if I could relocate and be happier at a different school I would in a heartbeat. The administration is actually pretty good, its the instructors at the school that I honestly have a problem with. Its like a lot of them are there to collect a paycheck and have been really rude and snappy towards students, but since it is the only community college reasonable in price everyone has no choice but to attend. Picking out a schedule is considerably easy, and so is the financial aid part of enrolling for the school. I attended another college in a different state and it was totally different experience, i felt confident and like I was learning and my instructors cared about my grades and well being in class. I transferred in credits and it was not all that bad, except for my math credits did not transfer and so now I am stuck on hold from graduating from Brevard Community College because they require so much more math for the exact same degree. I don't believe Brevard Community College is a school of convenience its not challeging and I believe the school could do a whole lot better. I have attended two other colleges before Brevard and I loved both of them."
College Junior,1,There is little if no academic flexibility within the curriculum.
College Junior,1,I wish my professors would be more involved with the students and there education. Most of the teachers have 2 or 3 cflasses in 1 so they dont have time to meet with each student or each class to explain things. The teachers need to be more knowledgeable about the subjects they teach.
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing unique or special about my community college.  It is very average, a little old, and not the most friendly."
College Sophomore,1,"Because I attend a community college, there is really no recreational aspect to the school.  There are no student centers or places to meet people. No events or opportunities to show school spirit. Everyone just goes to school for the lecture and goes home after.  I have been there for five semesters and have not met anyone."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have never even heard of a career service being offered at BCC. I gave a D+ because some students work for the book store or in the tutoring center, and these could all be helpful towards there career. Other than that, I am unaware of any service options."
Recent Alumnus,1,There aren't very many extra curricular activities. Those that do exists are kind of lame. The most interesting ones are in the north Brevard campuses such as Cocoa.
College Junior,1,"the people at financial aid are very unhelpful. They appear to want to deny me a scholarship due to the fact that I already have a bachelors degree. I'm currently pursuing a degree in nursing. Last year I got financial aid but ended up having to pull teeth ( figuratively) for financial aid while being forced to choose the chem tech major due to not quite yet being accepted into an RN program. This year, after being accepted, I'm having to fight for financial aid once again due to me changing to the major I actually intended upon return to college"
College Senior,1,"Campus Facilites â€“ Most buildings are older, but fairly well taken care of inside. The outside is another story. It looks like the sidewalks were made of gum. There are plenty of areas to access computers if you need them, although the technology is so restricted and/or outdated its better to just use your own equipment."
Recent Alumnus,1,I would never choose BCC if I had a choice. I only go because I am dual enrolled and my high school pays for it. It is a waste of money and time and the education is a joke.
College Sophomore,1,Post Grad Services â€“ I have no knowledge of my schools post-grad services.
College Senior,1,Medical Assistan Program â€“ I did not like my experience with the medical assistant program are the professor. Ms. Hardy was a very rude and hurtful teacher. She was not understanding and has made the program nearly impossible to complete. I think there should be another professor for this course.
College Sophomore,1,Finacial Aid â€“ I have been applying for finacial aid since 2007. I was never able to recieve it up until i had my son. It's crazy how the proccess works I am just glad I am in school.
College Senior,1,"Academic Flexibility â€“ Transferring credits was not easy from my prior school in Connecticut. Brevard Community College didnt accept some pretty basic credits for classes I had previously taken. There wasn't much flexibility in choosing classes. I came to Florida as an outsider and Brevard Community College did nothing to change that. It is difficult to get in touch with the admissions and other offices at the school because everything is automated and you cant talk to a person, just a machine."
College Senior,1,This class was ridiculous. I am paying out of state tuition for a professor who looked like she was a homeless person who walked in off the streets. There was hardly any work. All you had to do was show up and raise your hand and answer a question every so often. There were only two tests during the semester. Paying almost one thousand dollars to take a class I could have taught myself. I am certainly not getting my moneys worth. This institution has proved that college is becoming more and more like a business and not an educational institution.

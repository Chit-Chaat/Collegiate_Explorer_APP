Sophomore,5,"Good program, lots of work.  Instructors are very available to help out any student that wants it.  Instructors are also active industry professionals who can give you a true look at what the field is like."
Junior,5,I am a student at The Art Institute of Houston and it is a great school to go too. Everyone feels welcomed and all of the students and professors are kind. The curriculum is very great. The professors make everything easy to understand and want to see you succeed in life. I am very excited to be able to attend this school to obtain my degree.
Freshman,5,This school is career based meaning I am able to study in art without the fear of never being able to do anything with my degree. I know that I will be able to make a career out of my major which gives me the confidence to continue art.
Sophomore,5,I currently go here and all professors I've had are professional and always help students whenever possible
Senior,5,The Art Institute of Houston has been an excellent experience for me. Their immediate hands on instruction has helped me to understand my future career profession. I only wish that they would offer more financial opportunities for struggling families. But I truly love my college!
Freshman,5,I enjoyed how great the Admin assisted me when registering.  Lauren whom was assisting me was there from start to finish. They made sure everything was in order by the time my classes started. I was comfortable once I was able to meet fellow students in my class.  The staff is real easy going and very helpful.
College Senior,5,"I loved taking online classes! They only lasted five and a half weeks, so there was a little bit more of a work load. Rather than meeting and turning in work once a week, you had two assignments due a week. The advantage of taking classes online was that you were finished with it sooner than if you take it in class. I learned a lot in the online classes and hope that I am able to take more in the following quarters. I also felt that my grades overall were better while doing a mixture of online and on campus classes."
College Sophomore,5,I really don't anything about what i'm going to be doing until I go to orientation.
College Sophomore,5,"When I visit the school, It felt just like home everyone was very nice, kind, loving and helpful. It felt like i should've been there my first year of college."
College Sophomore,5,My skills have improved quite a lot since i started going here.
College Sophomore,5,It was such a great experience. From the time i first walked into the door i knew this was where i belong.
Recent Alumnus,5,It specifically fits my major perfectly which is to become an Master Animator and its not far from my parents
College Junior,5,Students are friendly and unique. I enjoy the school partly because of them.
College Sophomore,5,It has been very flexible for me so far. I'm able to work part time and save up for stuff too.
College Sophomore,5,i love everything about school very hands on. Hope i can graduate from here be successful so i can come back and lead other future students.
College Sophomore,5,"Its really great, I made lots of friends here. It is really fun, and I do feel great coming everyday to this school and feel welcomed by friends and tutors. I would choose my school again if I want to major in another major."
College Sophomore,5,I was lucky to find this college to have a special interest on my Game Art and Design Major; the majority of the other colleges do not hold much attention for my major. Even if no one was in my Major they do a really good job supporting what the students needs for their Majors.
College Sophomore,5,"The jobs and internships held here are good. There is always a job fair scheduled once in a while ahead of time to help students pay for their tuition. Internship is really good as well, if you show good effort the tutors will contact their company to do an internship for you. Also you can ask for an internship availability and they will help you out in any way."
College Sophomore,5,"My professors are very passionate about what are they teaching and at the same time they are willing to aid you in any way. Always ask for help, befriend them, the professors are really cool people. The quality courses are really good, since this is an institute, the classes will go by quick, but you do catch up a lot of learning. Class sizes are sometimes large, but majority of times they keep it small."
College Sophomore,5,"This campus is very friendly, I remember coming here for the first time, I was nervous and I thought the people here were not going to like me. I was wrong, here everyone is so friendly; even you can be really great friends with the tutors here as well. Here, no one treats no one like a number. Everyone knows everyone like family and the faculty and members are willing to help anyone out. There is a lot of diversity here, there are whites, blacks, hispanics, and asians. No one judges anyone here, your beliefs are safe here."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus holds many job fairs and internships in a scheduled manner. Many of my tutors come from and have worked for a company, thus connecting them to the students to take under their wing if they want an internship."
College Sophomore,5,"Here, we have campus activities like meeting important people from game companies and animation companies. We have voice actors coming over as well to directors and more. We have a small student lounge that lets students eat and hang out (and play videogames on certain hours). The library holds good resources for animation, 3d modeling help, and more. The library keeps increasing its variety on its books. Also, tutors offer help on days for the students to meet up to aid them on whatever they are struggling with. This campus is small, everyone here is really friendly here and know each other like family."
College Senior,5,"There is a whole floor that has computers in each room, even if there are classes going on, if you ask politely most of the time the professors will let you use a computer while they are teaching, if not there is a library with computers in there as well. And there is a tutoring center where you can also get help with any homework or project."
College Senior,5,"At first I was not sure about how people would interact with one another at this school, but everyone is beyond friendly. From the fashion students, to the animation students, and video students. People are extremely approachable. I've made more than a handful of amazing friends here and I'm always getting to know more and more people! It doesn't matter what your background is or where you come from everyone is more than welcoming."
College Junior,5,Financial aid was great it was very fast and everyone was very friendly.
College Junior,5,It's very diverse here.  From ethnicities to age difference but everyone is there for the same reason and we're all comfortable.
College Junior,5,I feel really comfortable with my classmates and professors. They make me feel like me and not just another number.
College Junior,5,Everyone is very friendly. I love the smaller size class it makes you feel more personal with the class and instructor. Also love the one course a month it's still paced but not overwhelming. I feel really comfortable here and I love it.
College Junior,5,The student center is filled with useful information about tutoring and other great things the campus offers
College Junior,5,Courses are designed to be more technical in my field of information technology.
College Junior,5,It's only one course a month and it makes it a lot easier to just focus on one subject since I am really busy with family and work.
College Junior,5,I love the quality of the career center.  They are really nice and friendly and help us look for jobs while we are in school as well.
College Junior,5,We do have the top of the line equipment when it comes to technology.
College Junior,5,I love the culinary management program its wonderful
College Junior,5,Online classes here are truly the best way to go.
College Senior,5,there is a variety of different people and the best part everyone respects each other
College Senior,5,I love it! since there is programs that I always wanted to learn and I finally got the chance especially learn what the major companies of animation uses.
College Senior,5,I love my professors and all that I am learning.  It's inspiring and exciting to be a student at the Art Institute of Houston-North!
College Senior,5,"We rely on the computers, so they are usually in great shape!!"
College Senior,5,The financial advisors seem to be able to find a way to help you meet your needs and stay in school no matter the situation.
College Senior,5,I have a hard schedule to work around because I am a wife/mother and a full-time elementary school teacher.  My advisors have gone above and beyond to help me find 2 classes that fit my plan each quarter.
College Senior,5,"The professors are knowledgeable and hard working.  If you put forth effort as a student, you can gain a great wealth of knowledge from your teachers.  All of my teachers have always been willing to help me in and outside of class."
College Freshman,5,I would of made the choice to go to this school a lot sooner.
College Freshman,5,I love our small campus everyone knows each other.
College Freshman,5,great range on the wifi and the speed is amazing.
College Freshman,5,they do an amazing job at connecting us with job interviews and internships.
College Freshman,5,bigger is not always better.
College Freshman,5,ive been able to balance all my classes while being a full student and working two jobs.
College Freshman,5,we are all very diverse and it s great because we come from different backgrounds but at the same time we have similar likes.
College Freshman,5,we start off on basics and later we get into the more advanced courses of video game design.
College Freshman,5,my instructors come from very great backgrounds and are giving us the highest education because they know what we are going to encounter on our careers.
College Junior,5,"Classes that are quick, and get to the point. Registration that is easy to follow"
College Junior,5,We are shown how the in and outs of the business work. We are encouraged to come up with our own ideas. And we are given project deadlines to ensure we are used to the speed of the business
College Junior,5,"Friends start together, and finish together. Its like going through a specialized high school for what you love."
College Senior,5,"Computers have minor issues sometimes, but are quickly fixed by the tech departments. Their are plenty computer programs that are constantly updated."
College Senior,5,The students are very creative. They use the skills that they have to help each other with large projects or events.
College Sophomore,5,Love the fact Fin. aid will do everything they can to help you with school
College Sophomore,5,Helpful and friendly i love the place waiting til next month
College Sophomore,5,"GREAT SCHOOL, GREAT LOCATION, GREAT STAFF."
College Sophomore,5,VERY HELPFUL AND FRIENDLY RESOURCE TO USE AT THE SCHOOL.
Freshman,4,They have teachers that have experience and tell you what to expect in the working field. Teachers are also understanding and will go easy on you if you are having difficulty with life or their material.
Sophomore,4,I liked how willing to help every professor was. It was one building so you just went to your classes in one building.
Freshman,4,"My academic adviser is incredibly friendly. Unfortunately, he is the only one that I have talked to that has not been rude, they need nicer people like him."
College Sophomore,4,don't really know about post-grad services.
College Sophomore,4,Professors are very laid back and very understanding. The classes are small and the students get to know each other.
College Sophomore,4,"Being an animation student you to understand craftsmanship,all the principles of design, and the fundamentals of drawing, and animation history. Unique part of this field is that you get draw and interact with your peers. You must have great time management to to finish to homework. Don't expect Disney to hand you a job easily you to have to work a little harder."
College Sophomore,4,The Art institute of Houston  is a very inspiring place when come to art. The teachers know what their talking about  and are very relate able.
College Senior,4,"There are career services that help you to find jobs, there are employers who come in at the end that you are able to talk to about getting jobs after graduation."
College Senior,4,"There are sometimes issues whenever it comes to registering for classes. The farther that you get into your degree program the less classes that are generally being offered. You typically, at the end, have to take an independent study if the classes you need are not being offered. The class sizes are decent, they are not overwhelmingly large. The professors are willing to help you, if you are willing to help yourself. Occasionally you do get a professor that ""sucks"" simply because their teaching style doesn't make any sense to the entire class, their requirements are not able to be met due to certain criteria that they want you to achieve."
College Senior,4,"A lot of the professors know people outside of the school that are looking for work. It is a type of community were it helps to know people. The more people that you know, or have connections to, the greater your chance is to get work. The downside of that is, that it is harder to get a job if you know next to no one. The professors are willing to help, it all depends on if you want to put forth the effort.There are also career services people who will help you find internships. At the end you do a portfolio show where employers will come to see if they want to hire you, so you gain things that way as well."
College Senior,4,"The work load is a very heavy! You are in a classroom for four hours per class, then on top of that you have all of the homework to go with it. Most students take in between four and five classes. Each class has about four to five hours minimum of homework time along with it. Some classes have more homework time. The lab classes are the ones that have the most homework and generally the general education classes have less homework. Some classes we are unsure as to why we have to take them, but they're for basic education in certain areas so that you can have a basic understanding of different things."
College Senior,4,"The teachers here are mostly knowledgeable about the classes that they are teaching. There is generally always something going on, if it be in a classroom, club meeting, or even outside on the sidewalk or in the front entry way. The financial aid department could use some help, they are terrible to have to deal with!"
College Sophomore,4,Many graduates have been able to find work in their fields thanks to connections through the institute
College Sophomore,4,I'm still in the early stages but the assignments and courses I'm taking are helping me better myself for my field of work
College Sophomore,4,Most of the instructors do work with students to accommodate situations or help learn the material fully in order to accomplish tasks and be able to use skills for future use
College Sophomore,4,Faculty has many connections to businesses as well as businesses themselves to help students enter their field or get the resources needed to start off right
College Sophomore,4,"Well of course no one likes paying tuition especially if you don't have the funds or resources to cover it. At the school, instead of the costs students pay buying books at ordinary schools, we have the aid of ecompanion and ebooks. Although an art lifestyle isn't cheap so it makes up for it when buying supplies. Other than financial issues, the school is pretty great. It is filled with so many creative minds and artistic backgrounds, so you're able to find your place in the school and are given the chance to express YOU. And it's a nice feeling having people comment and have positive feedback on something you put passion into. Also with so many of the instructors having their own businesses and connections, they help students get out into a real career and allow them to do what they love."
College Sophomore,4,Every Creative and meeting people that like my self
College Junior,4,It's a great school I'm an very blessed for this opportunity
College Senior,4,"I love the school. I've made friends, and I've learned so much that i didn't know before. I do miss out on the opportunity to go to a real college campus, and i do wish the school was more like a normal college campus, even like a community school college. But its nice to go and be surrounded by people who are into the arts and music and have a lot of the same tastes and traits as i do."
College Junior,4,This is one of the only art schools available to me. That is why I was so drawn to this school. If I had more options I may not have rushed into this one. I am happy to attend the school but it is more complicated than that. I wish I could be a proud student but I am more fustrated because I can't afford to attend.
College Junior,4,"They are very good on working with your availability, sometimes they automatically schedule you by looking how you have been scheduled in the past."
College Junior,4,"Every month their are job fairs for all departments if the school, weather it is for fashion or culinary. Their are also a wall full of internships for students to apply for, and teachers are well networked for finding internships for students."
College Junior,4,"Students here are very creative in their own different ways, everyone is helpful to one another no matter what department you are studying. Everyone is very outgoing and friendly."
College Sophomore,4,The Art Institute of Houston is unique because it caters to different creative fields of study helping you get far in your future career. My favorite experiences were whenever I got the chance to use my creativity in whatever I was doing. I'd probably go back to this school if I had a change of heart about my career choice.
College Sophomore,4,"I rather like the Art Institute of Houston so far, it is very fun place. The classes are interesting and you'll get to use your creativity."
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience so far has been pretty good though I'm not going to say a whole lot on the internships and employers recruiting on campus since I haven't got to that part of school yet being a freshman there.
College Sophomore,4,The online classes are fairly easy and straightforward in regards to what we learn our work load and peer to peer interaction. The online classes are also very convenient since you only have to make a post into the discussion area or dropbox 4 days out of the week.
College Sophomore,4,My experience with the financial aid office was pretty good. They were willing to work with us financial so I could get my classes started.
College Sophomore,4,The professors I've dealt with so far are pretty alright and the class registration process is pretty straight forward helping you take as many classes as you need for your degree.
College Sophomore,4,I've been told that the internship and creating a portfolio comes that in the years of my school however from what I've heard they have promised not to let a student end up a starving artist or in others words leaving the school with a job from the planned career choice or being able to easily find one. The work load I've experienced so far isn't so bad and I'm able to get my stuff done while I work part time.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't needed to use their libraries very often but when I do I find I can find what I need. However I don't think my school has an athletic centers or teams since it is a school dedicated to various art forms such as culinary, photography, film, fashion, etc. However it does of studios such as sound booth, a shop where you can get other materials rather than books such as paper, paint, and other art tools needed to do the projects in my school of the Art Institute of Houston"
College Junior,4,My financial aid went smoothly and there was no bumps in it I got my moneys worth out of it. I feel like it was fair what they offered me and is not much to pay back Interests. As for the tuition fee I see that it was also a figure a price for the moment I am working on trying to get more loans so I can cover it for me.
College Sophomore,4,"The academics are great. The professors are spectacular, and they do show that they are passionate about their work. Registering for classes is not hard if one does it early, but it does become hard if one does not register in time. The workload can be very tedious, expect to receive lots of work. Special study options are available, like after school tutoring."
College Sophomore,4,"The online courses are great, the only Online Course I have taken was the College Algebra. My tutor helped me understand subjects I could not understand and as well always asks me if I am doing okay. Here, the tutors are very caring and are really helpful."
College Senior,4,"When it comes to the education that I am getting I'm really learning so much! My professors are more than knowledgeable in my field, they always make class interesting with past stories. And if there is something that you are not quite sure about, they will always find a way to try to help you understand."
College Junior,4,The professors are really there to help you succeed
College Junior,4,I have heard wonderful things about the post-grad services.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the fact that it opened my mind what audio engineer is really about. The instructors were really tough at first when i was taking a class that were hands on with the sound board but it made me realize that it wasnt because he just wanted to be mean but he was teaching the class that sometimes we will make mistakes and we have to learn the mistakes on our own and make sure not to do it again. The idea of how my career will be is intense that our instructor actually helps us locate a place we can work at, have internships, give us studio hours working on our projects they give us, and puts us to the test setting up the studio with instruments, microphones, and preparing the computer for pro tools and ready to work."
College Sophomore,4,"Registering for classes sometimes can be a pain in the butt because some of the classes i need to take to get my credit is difficult to register due to my work schedule, sometimes it would get full so  i would have to sign up ASAP and pick the right instructor that will be good for the class. The instructors are i choose are really good at teaching the class and its a lot easier being at the art institute because the class is not full of students of 300 but a class of 20 people with one teacher and easy to make connections with the instructors as well, get help on the homework, easy well to know each other. The tutoring center is the best place to get help when i might not understand the homework assignment and the library is good to be at when you want to study on your own and check out books that is helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of the students i met at the art institute started off with knowing them they were in my program. The teachers would make us introduce ourselves on the first day of our quarter to get to know each other and some of us immediately got the chance to get to know a little more during our brake time or after class and exchange number's, facebook pages, emails, etc. to keep in touch when we wanted to work together in projects, study, hang out, or just talk. After that i ended up getting to know other students from my other curriculum classes that are in different programs and we would make connections with each other. Even with that we would introduce with our friends within the program we are studying and become really close with each other and help out."
College Senior,4,since it is not a huge school I feel like I can ask the teachers more help and know more about the classmates
College Senior,4,when I don't understand they explain to the best
College Senior,4,"It's a small school and does not offer much in the way of student centers, athletics, etc but seems to meet the needs of most students."
College Senior,4,The truth is that I'm not sure yet.
College Senior,4,Online courses are a heavy workload and must be taken very seriously.
College Senior,4,"I'm not sure about career opportunities yet, because I haven't looked into that, but as far as the workload - it's manageable, and the facility is great.  We have a nice studio and a good selection of camera equipment."
College Senior,4,"The Art Institute student body is diverse, creative, friendly, and fun.  I notice groups of friends hanging out often, and it seems that when students have to work together for school related projects, the experience is usually positive."
College Freshman,4,there great but they don't beat the in class experience
College Freshman,4,i love the school I am going to I just wish it had a bigger campus but the small campus makes it for a home like feel since everyone knows each there and allows us to collaborate more.
College Sophomore,4,The great feature about online classes I work at my own pace and if I have trouble my teacher is aways there in school or online.
College Sophomore,4,Since I have not been in school for fifteen years the financial aid law have changed but the financial aid office was very help in getting me the aid i needed to get my goals started. They simplified the process and made it easy for me to go back to school.
College Sophomore,4,Since i am doing film the teachers there have worked in the industry and the curriculum is based on the field I am studying. 
College Sophomore,4,The professors know the subjects they are teaching and will help you out as long as you do your work. Class Registration is easy online or you can call and they will set it up for you.
College Sophomore,4,It is great since in have not been in school in fifteen years the student and teachers help me with subjects and projects.
College Sophomore,4,"The student body is very diverse you got student that are from different cultures but are very talented with the fields they are studying. You got other students that are so talented with art it is beautiful what they create. They all have different challenges but they all pull throughout them and make great art ing film, fashion, cooking, and other fields."
College Sophomore,4,They have alot of school activities run by teachers and student. Such as film club if your into films gamers clubs if your into games. They library is full of books and videos you need for the subjects you are studying.
College Sophomore,4,"There are alot of computer, printers and the wireless network is excellent. Your computer can access the internet very easy."
College Sophomore,4,Since it is a art and cooking school. They have art work every where and has a restaurant where students can display their cooking creations.
College Sophomore,4,The school helps you get a job in the field you studied. They help you with resumes and job fairs they hold every month. They help you setting up your portfolio with getting your own website so people can look at your work.
Sophomore,2,"I love the look of the school but not the lack of variety of class and helpful workers, everything is way too expensive and the security is not good at all , from multiple cars getting broken in to random people off of the street going into class rooms the Ai is not the best choice school to go to"
College Junior,2,"Students are paying all this money and i see no one getting their moneys worth, i hear students complaining left and right about how teachers are not worth their time."
College Junior,2,I was excited to join this school but after approaching my last year i've learned that this school cost way too much for a very small outcome.
College Junior,2,My financial advisor was the worst and gave us bad advice. It is working out so far though
College Junior,2,"Not much more than the necessary, because of the size of the school. We have our computer labs and library and breakroom. Thats about it.."
College Junior,2,"It's a bit risky to take courses online for subject you have no experience in. Teacher may or may not try to help student in serious need, but even when they do it's just difficult to do over random text explanations for some people."
College Senior,2,Tuition is too high for the education given. 
College Senior,2,To receive help from advisors is nearly impossible.  The curriculum for the fashion design program needs improvement.  Students are not always help accountable for their work which makes it difficult for those that are ready to move on to the next task.  
College Senior,2,Its too high for what the students are provided with. The quality of teaching or organization of courses could be better.
College Freshman,2,The services I've received have been very poor to say the least I just managed to speak with the career specialist about a week ago after months of trying and I've been getting the run around trying to get extra help with financial aid 
College Senior,2,"I'm not yet certain if the education I'm getting is worth the money I'm paying.  The Art Institutes are a for profit educational company, and tuition is much higher than other programs."
College Junior,2,"If Its Not One Thing Its Another. I try to finish everything but there really isn't much I can do since I had to find a new job due to class scheduling, and its caused me to have to stress about my money and bills. I have to try and pay the school and my rent and my loans all while trying to take 2 full days out of the week for class which destroys my work availability."
College Sophomore,2,Network Ain't All That – The network doesn't always answer my question directly. Why? I don't Know maybe because of my accent or how I write back to them over the chat online.
College Sophomore,2,"The Nicest Scam in the World. Before I graduated from high school, I was so life-unexperienced. I could have gotten conned by anyone; and by anyone, I refer specifically to the Art Institute of Houston. The admissions counselors are all so nice! They treat you as if you were part of the ""family"". From promising an excellent education to great job opportunities, they are so pushy, that I just have to believe them. However, it's all a scam in reality! 
   True, the instructors are excellent, and they care about you, but even them complain about the technology provided to us. I remember taking Art History II. The teacher had such a passion for the subject, but she had to stop the class every five minutes to fix the projector, or the computer was too slow, or it had a virus. This didn't only happen in that class, but in every other single room that had computers. After all that, I wonder if it's worth paying $90k+ for bad education. Where does my money go? I thought they would use it to buy the latest technology.
    Working around a good schedule? Not at all! I don't understand why when I try to register, they want to make me go the days I can't go. Online classes at Ai? It's so bad that most students end up taking those courses on-campus. Living on-campus? Not a good idea-HORRIBLE infestation of bed bugs, and they don't seem to care about it.  
    If I had a time machine, I would go back in time to stop my teenage self from making the biggest mistake I've ever made- making that call to the Art Institute of Houston."
College Junior,2,"The school is awesome, i love attending class and learning new things each and every day ,but the money is too much. Literally up to 5 grand every three months? You don't get as much as you would hope for, I am in the culinary program and I have so many complains about how cheap this school can be. For example, we run out of food to cook with? Like are you serious? and we also run out of equipment.. where does this money go to if not our supplies? In case of an emergency there's no nurse or such thing like that for a quick check up on a cut or any sort of that kind. Computer labs sometimes don't have ink in their printers or they don't work at all. Tell me why? They cut down our labs into 4 hours but we still pay 5 hours? Our cafeteria, it overprices all the food they have there and some of it 'we' culinary students make. This school can leave you broke but other than the money issue and how cheap this school can be, I wouldn't go any where else."
College Junior,2,"Scheduling for classes is a hassle because they are short on teachers so classes fill up extremely fast. There are very few teachers able to teach classes specific for my major so I have to wait several quarters just for a class I need to open up. Classes are four hours long and 11 weeks long, if one class is missed 10 points are taken off of our class average which most of us believe is extremely outrageous because if you get sick your gpa drops. The classes are fun and easy to make as long as there isn't any bad weather and you dont get sick."
College Junior,1,Classes are usually shifted around from term to term. But picking classes is difficult. I normally do four classes to be full time and try to get two a day so that I can work and on my two off days attend school. It is very hard to pick classes because I live out of town. Taking just one class a day is not an option because it is a waste of my time and money. When classes are not offered on certain days it puts me behind. I had to switch from full time to part time because I could no longer pick four classes that worked for me.
College Junior,1,It's not easy to pay tuition. The cost of the school seems too much and the fact that most people can't transfer their credits is a major turn off. You are doomed to stay at this school and pay the insane amount.
College Junior,1,"I feel betrayed with this school, they promised a great future and as i near the end i can see that this school was a waist of my time and money."
College Junior,1,This is the most expensive school yet. They dont tell you that when your looking into the school they just make it look good on the outside. I actually highly regret my decision to come here which is why im looking to attend a community college for a business degree.
College Senior,1,i am getting alot of hands on experience but the cost is just way to high im constantly having to pay out of pocket because loans are just not enough to cover tuition as well as financial aid. 
College Freshman,1,"I was ready and very excited to take my first online class. but after the first 2 weeks into it, it became very hard to keep up with it. i already know how my learning style is, and I noticed that already in the first class going into it that i wasn't going to learn or retain any knowledge from this class at all. After I obtained a job, it became harder and harder for me to keep up with class, which ended in a miserable failure."
College Senior,1,80% of the student population was either very rich kids (not adults)or military personal who paid with their GI bill. The other 20% was people who pay cash for their classes have families and full time jobs. This 20% fail most of their classes because of having an outside life.
College Senior,1,"Online Aia Courses – Registration was easy, getting the online text books was a huge pain especially when the site was down the first 2 weeks of school. Teachers did not give assignments based on actual textbook information so when it was time for tests and quizes everyone failed because of being unprepared."
College Junior,1,"Little as Possible. My school is an institution so when it comes to the government helping you out you're out of luck basically, but the tuition is a lot pricey. I can buy two new cars with the money I'm wasting for my three years  here in this school. The process is easy, but the money that you are give sucks booty."
College Sophomore,1,"Never Will Do Again. I signed up for an online course this quarter. As I live an hour and a half away from campus and classes fill up very quickly it was my only option for one of my classes but ended up having to drop. There was no way I was going to be able to get a decent grade in there with my other courses on campus. I had to log in every day for around two hours, discuss and make comments on the teachers nots while adding detailed comments to two other students work. Also keeping logs, reading chapters, and lots of extra online research. It was way to much and I was unable to keep up with it. If I was only doing online courses I probably could of done it, but having to be on campus three days a week, and all day those days. Plus the home work for those classes I just wasn't able to do it. Campus classes are much easier to stay up with. I would rather go up and sit 4 hours in a class one day a week then go home with home work due the next week then log in everyday for several hours online. I will never do another online class with them again."

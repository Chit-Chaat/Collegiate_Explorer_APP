Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Brescia university, there are several reasons why including a close knit college atmosphere, great professors, quality dorm arrangements, and more! I absolutely love the Brescia experience! There's even free tutoring available on campus available to all students who need help. There's plenty of student run activities and clubs, there are also a huge variety of sports including tennis, soccer, baseball, softball, and even a computer e-sports team."
Sophomore,5,"I had a great time at Brescia University. It's a relatively small college, so you get to know the professors extremely well. I would highly recommend checking out the history department, specifically because of the great professor!"
Senior,5,Brescia university has great professors that are always willing to go the extra mile. The staff are also helpful with questions and always emails back within a day. Outstanding campus.
Freshman,5,"Small but prestigious University, great safe location and beautiful campus. I actually work here on campus and when I transferred from the community college to Brescia, the transition was easy."
Senior,5,"I’m an exclusively online (BUonline) student - and I LOVE it. Most professors are fantastic and they all understand that I’m an online student for a reason, and you are really set up for success as long as you are willing to put in the work. The coursework is challenging (I’d say more so than the campus courses I’ve completed in the past) but the profs are super helpful and want us to succeed."
Freshman,5,"Brescia is a great school and I am glad I chose this to pursue my college experiences. I take the BUOnline courses and it is so convenient for my lifestyle. I have three children so having the opportunity to take all my classes online and never having to step foot on campus is very nice. I have nothing in particular  that I feel needs to be changed, the advisor I have is very helpful to make sure I have everything I need!"
Senior,5,"As an adult student over 40 years old, I have had the most incredible experience. I have been there for 3 years I am about to graduate and my professors are and have been amazing. They are knowledgeable, they interact, they are accountable and personable as well as professional. I have not met a professor I did not respect to the fullest. I have been blessed."
Sophomore,5,"This is my first year at Brescia and I love it! This is the third online school that I have attended and I have nothing but great things to say about my advisors, teachers, classmates and the material. I feel that I am getting a quality education and I have learned more than I anticipated."
Senior,5,I attend the online program at Brescia university and it is unlike any online program I have ever seen or participated in. The professors are there for you and are so understanding. It is a live classroom from your bedroom. It is designed in a way that let's you know they understand that life happens. I am so pleased to be a student in their online program.
Alum,5,The Financial Aid Office made an extra effort to find monies for me to attend classes there. All the professors were on hand to make sure the college experience at Brescia was successful. I enjoyed all the required biblical classes and decided then that I wanted to further my studies because of the priests who taught the classes. My time there was deeply satisfying.
Recent Alumnus,5,The quality of the education made me prepared to reach my employment goals.  There are many support services and people ready to lend a hand from advice to recommendation letters to job prospects.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Excellent, quality education.  You truly are part of the family when you enroll in Brescia. Challenging without being overwhelming.  Supportive without constrictive.  Engaging and superior!"
College Junior,5,"I love Brescia University. If I didn't already live in Owensboro, I would definitely want to live on campus because Brescia always has an event going on or a place to go to study. The sense of feeling like you are involved in a community engulfs everyone and no one is left out."
College Junior,5,"I chose this school because it was small in comparison to other Universities. However, the same amount of students attended my high school, so I felt as if I was just continuing school as usual, so the ""big shift"" between high school and University was not a fearful event for myself. There is a sense of community between both the faculty and students."
College Sophomore,5,Housing is great. It's livable. Nothing bad about it.
College Sophomore,5,They're great. Great in the community and on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Great variety of athletics. Great people, good fans and participants. Great team work."
College Freshman,5,Printing is free so it is awesome.
College Sophomore,5,We have students that come here other Countries and even have a special housing for them for the first year.
College Junior,5,There are tons of restaurants up and down the street that Brescia is located on. Very convenient and there's a variety.
Sophomore,4,This is a small campus. I love living here. I also have a work study and they work around your club and class schedule. It’s amazing here.
Sophomore,4,"I recommend Brescia university, playing athletics for 2 years made the experience great.   The overall experience and student life is great. The curriculum is challenging, but worth it."
Freshman,4,It's a great place to learn and get involved. The class are small and the professors welcome questions. If you live on campus there is always something fun going on. I love my school. It's great.
Sophomore,4,So far I am having a good experience! The professors are very good and everyone is so friendly. I am glad the my academic counselor has helped figure out what classes I need to do and has doubled checked that my audit was done correctly.
Freshman,4,"My first year at Brescia was actually a very good year for me. With playing volleyball, I got to experience so many things. Also, being on my own for the first time was nerve racking but I really enjoyed it. As all freshmen struggle through their first year, I felt like I was really on track. Some things I can improve on is being more focused and to study as much as possible! Overall my first year was very fun and I enjoyed my time."
Sophomore,4,"Brescia is a great place to further your education. The campus is small enough that you can walk anywhere you need to be in less than 10 minutes. The campus size also allows for students to get to know one another better. This is a university with great on-and-off campus activities, such as bonfires, trips to amusement parks, movie nights, and guest speakers. The academic programs are excellent, especially Social Work, and all of the professors are great. The only downfalls of Brescia are the living spaces for students and the financial aid office. The apartments are great, but the dorms are extremely small and are in a great need of being updated. The financial aid office seems to mess up constantly and its a hassle having to go down there to find out why you suddenly owe $5,000 every other month."
Junior,4,"I love the small class size at Brescia University. 
I wish that the education program placed students sooner for observations."
College Junior,4,"With a Business degree near this area from Brescia, I will be sure to meet fellow alumnis as potential employers, and also as a respected business school, my degree will hopefully, as backed with my internships, land myself a career I desire, and as any student desires."
College Junior,4,"Campus Security is seen at night walking the quad, checking to make sure the visitors to the dorms are gone, and that the buildings are only opened with an ID card at certain times of the day/night. If there is a problem, or if you are stuck outside, a friendly security officer is there to help. They monitor the parking lots, quads, entrances, and exits, and will let you know of any potential hazards."
College Junior,4,"For the small student body, the school has spirit and especially those on campus attend events and faculty attend events as well"
College Sophomore,4,"It's great they give you the tools and prepare for your field, although it is very challenging."
College Junior,4,"the dorms and apartments are really nice. In the apartment, you have your own kitchen and living room with 4 roommates. it is pretty nice."
College Junior,4,The faculty and staff at Brescia are very friendly and are willing to go the extra mile to help you achieve your dreams.
College Senior,4,I love the opportunies i have to engage in my mayjor
College Senior,4,topics help with my area of study
College Senior,4,I love my degress interests
College Senior,4,Brescia is a catholice school
College Junior,4,Each major will give you an outline of every class you will need.
College Junior,4,Its good atmosphere and it a small walk to the river.
College Junior,4,"We have security walking around the campus all the time, we are next to the police station so safety is the best. Health we have no clients on campus but there are plenty of urgent cares to chose from."
College Junior,4,you have to keep on checking on it and most of the time you will get the help you need.
College Junior,4,Depending on the sport is how big the turn out is. boys events will get more turn out than girls but its mostly parents.
College Junior,4,You have everything from fast food to seat down and there are plenty of options to chose from.
College Junior,4,We try to talk to one another and try to help one another.
College Freshman,4,"When I leave work study after the night shift, a campus security officer is always there to make sure we leave safely. They have stickers with the campus security phone number posted all around campus in case we need them."
College Freshman,4,"The campus rules are enforced for a reason. Whether or not we disagree with them, and we have to follow those rules."
College Sophomore,4,It has many opportunities to give to the community.
College Junior,4,"I had no difficulties and thought the requirements made sense overall. As an online student I know my professors for a short period and then move on. It was a little awkward asking for a recommendation from someone I hardly knew, but it was a requirement."
College Freshman,4,We have all kinds of campus activities to do
College Freshman,4,Brescia is a really good place to go. I love it here.
College Freshman,4,It wasn't the school's fault over my aid.
College Freshman,4,I've never seen any drugs or alcohol.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of majors to choose from.
College Freshman,4,The security is very good.
College Freshman,4,I don't really know for sure. I just know that we win a lot of the games we play.
College Junior,4,Public transportation is very useful. It's cheap and easy and can take you just about anywhere. The only problem with the buses is that they stop running at 7pm. Brescia is located on a main street in Owensboro making it easy to walk to a store or close restaurant.
College Junior,4,I would give the school an A in this area because of the online program. I am a online student and every class that I attend has  very diverse group of individuals.
College Junior,4,"The structures, particularly the fountain in the quad, sets it apart from other schools. It's like a little slice of Italy in the middle of the city. 
Students and faculty/staff are exceptionally kind, too. It's easy to schedule meetings with how few people there are, and it's also easy to establish friendships."
College Junior,4,Easily accessible and frequent – There's always something to do.
College Junior,4,"Activities at night are fairly often, but there are some time conflicts."
College Junior,4,"Everyone on campus has a significantly different background, and there are many students from foreign countries."
College Junior,4,"The computer labs are up-to-date, as are the printers. WiFi has gotten better in the last year."
College Junior,4,"Brescia is a dry campus, but if students are caught violating that rule, they aren't expelled from the university. They're usually put on a probation and fined for a first and (maybe) second violation."
College Junior,4,"With Brescia being a part of downtown Owensboro, there are many cafes and restaurants nearby and generally affordable. Most fast food restaurants might require a car to get to them, though."
College Junior,4,"Brescia is in the center of downtown Owensboro, and many things are within walking distance. 
The only bad part of transportation is through the city buses and taxis. They're not the most reliable means. However, many students on campus can drive and friendly, so if you need to get around town (like to Wal-Mart or somewhere not nearby), you might be able to catch a ride with someone."
College Junior,4,"I've not had any problems with financial aid, but I know many people who have had difficulty staying at the university because of financial aid."
College Junior,4,"The English department is full of phenomenal professors, and I am mostly satisfied with the program. My only complaint is that the professional writing emphasis requires too many literature classes in comparison to writing classes."
College Junior,4,The professors are knowledgeable and fair in every field.
College Sophomore,4,"As an online student, the admissions and registration process was very smooth. However, as a student who receives financial aid this is very long and tedious process. If you're a dependent student be be prepared to provide a copious amount of financial information such as parent taxes and W-2s. You must provide information on who's living in your household and be prepared to be questioned on it. Brescia University recently started using a third party organization to handle financial aid information so you will be talking to representatives of KHEAA regarding your financial aid verification. 

The reason why I chose Brescia was because they offer an online Bachelors degree in Social Work. This is amazing for people who work or have children and don't have time to actually go to university. The classes are great and they teachers are very helpful."
College Junior,4,"Honestly, I am an online student at Brescia University. I am not certain of their meal plans, etc. I'm sure they are pretty good but one may get tired of the same food, afterwhile."
College Student,4,"Most of the students here play sports, so they're pretty popular."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Never felt in danger on campus. The Owensboro Police station is literally right next door to campus. The hospital is also pretty close to campus (has a walk-in clinic).  There are security guards at night, and they are very helpful - i.e. they'll walk you to your dorm if you want."
College Freshman,4,"As an elementary education major I was able to take an education class my freshman year just to be sure that it was the path I wanted to take.  As students we are able to get classroom experience within the first year if our schedules allow.  If I could do it all over again I definitely would.  The school of education here is always willing to help and they do everything possible to make sure that you reach your career goals.  My career goals are the to teach either a kindergarten or first grade class as well as be the high school golf coach.  I don't really have any concerns when it comes to finding a job in my field, there is always a need for teachers."
College Junior,4,The financail aid has been exceptional and I really needed it. It was very helpful and I am greatful for the chance.
College Junior,4,I have my own laptop and I am in an online program.
College Junior,4,My experience has been great I love the convenience of the online forums and the instructors are very helpful. It has been challenging yet rewarding and I would not change it.
College Freshman,4,"Parking at Brescia University is not strict, you can park anywhere in any parking lot. There are lots of space to park in the parking lot."
Recent Alumnus,4,it is a Catholic University so it is not a party college
College Sophomore,4,"Brescia is a dry campus, but that doesn't stop a fair amount of students from smuggling alcohol and drugs on campus. The only suggestion for improvement I can offer is more security cameras and random checks from RAs and other residence life authorities."
College Sophomore,4,"The computer labs at Brescia University is usually pretty quite and peaceful, even during the week its a good place to study and get work done."
Freshman,2,"I really felt that the majority of the teachers don't care at all and want you to fail. If I participated more I probably would've had a better experience, but I'm happy that I'm going somewhere else now. They have redone a lot of the campus and it looks beautiful!"
College Sophomore,2,One we don't have a Sorority or a Fraternity at our school I think because it's a catholic school
College Junior,2,The main reason it bad is because you have to get permission to live off campus which is stupid. Its hard to find places but there are 18-22 years old living there (adults) and if we want to live off campus then let us.
College Junior,2,I am assuming there is not much diversity on a Catholic campus
College Sophomore,2,There are not that many parties and the campus is a dry campus but there are some bars for people who are 21 and up and the people who can goes to Evansville and do what they want up there.
College Junior,1,Online Student – I can only assume that the campus and staff is just as nice as the administrative staff that I have spoke with over the phone. As a online student I have only good experience with the staff.
College Freshman,1,Oh My God! the apartments aren't too bad. the freshman dorms are terrible.

Freshman,5,"There is a place for everyone at WLC. With a vast amount of majors and activities, you won't ever find yourself feeling like there's nothing for the school to offer you. The staff is extraordinary and work just as hard as you do to make sure you have every chance to succeed. There is also an abundance of low-cost or free activities happening around campus so you always have something to do and ways to meet new people."
Freshman,5,"The professors are all extremely nice and are very understanding in unanticipated situations. They truly are there to share their knowledge and better each and every student. If you need extra help, they are more than willing to take extra time out of their day to give it to you. They all have excellent classes that are somehow not very difficult (so long as you're a diligent student), but at the same time, you come out with lots of useful knowledge."
Senior,5,Students receive a high-quality education while strengthening their faith.  There are many opportunities and resources for aid and scholarships shared with students prior to applying for loans.
Freshman,5,The teachers make a great effort to help you in anyway that they can. I also liked that it is a small campus so you get to know everyone really easily.
Freshman,5,"I like being able to incorporate my religion into my education, it means a great deal to me that the college does this. There is a lot to do on this small campus during the week, but not much to do on the weekend.There are some people who can't go home on the weekends and don't have cars to leave campus, this causes a lot of us to be bored on campus. I wish there was more things offered by the campus for us to do."
Sophomore,5,I have had so many wonderful memories at this college! It is truly a blessing to attend here. The professors here want to see their students succeed and are always willing to help you in their free time.
Freshman,5,"What can I say about Wisconsin Lutheran College?  When I first went there for a campus tour, I felt immediately at home.  The small size of the college makes me feel less intimidated when it comes to finding my classes.  Plus, the students and the teachers there are always kind to help.  The professors let the students know when they are available, and they mention about not hesitating when it comes to questions.  As a freshmen at Wisconsin Lutheran College, all I can say is that this is the best choice I have ever made."
Sophomore,5,The small learning based community. Professors really care about your performance and you as a person in general.
Senior,5,"I liked the small class sizes, the professors knowing you personally, the activities that you can become involved in. I do not like the athletic facilities offered, there needs to be a separate study hall designated for athletes, and more equal funding for all the sports."
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed the WLC campus as well as the programs, for example, I will be able to complete my education degree in 4 years whereas most other schools require 4 1/2 years meaning now I don't have to pay for an extra semester of school saving me time and money."
Freshman,5,"Great vibe to the college, the people are very friendly. Small but hands on education. Very close to downtown which is wonderful"
Works Here,5,"I am an alumnus of both the undergraduate and graduate programs at WLC. Originally planning to attend a larger state school, I toured WLC late in my college search and immediately fell in love with the campus and the people. I've never regretted my decision and continue to appreciate the personal relationships and support I received. The campus is beautiful, the residence halls are among the best in the country, and the academic quality is excellent."
Niche User,5,"This college visit solidified why I belong at that school! The academics and the people! It was a one on one tour that helped me decide both what I wanted to do there and how college was going to be for me. I saw the dorms and the different sections as well as had a ""discovery"" session with students where I got to do an experiment. One of the best days"
Junior,5,"Love that the leadership at WLC actually emulate the school's mission: ""The college is committed to providing quality teaching, scholarship, and service that are rooted in Holy Scripture; promoting the spiritual growth of students, faculty, and staff; and preparing students for lives of Christian leadership."""
Sophomore,5,I am a sophomore at Wisconsin Lutheran College and I am a nursing major. So far I love going to school here! The students and faculty are so nice and caring for every single student. At the end of my 4 years I will be leaving with a nursing degree that will set me up for a great career in the future. I also play softball at WLC and that gives me the perfect outlet to continue to play the sport I love at a colleigente level.
Sophomore,5,"I love that WLC feels like home.  You have an amazing support system whether it comes to friends, professors, or coaches.  The education program has pushed me to become the teacher I want to be."
Niche User,5,"I don't attend Wisconsin Lutheran college, but hopefully next year I do. When I shadowed the school and stayed overnight for a soccer event I did notice a lot of great things from this school. The academics are challenging that I feel once I go there will prepare me for my career goal. I also notice there is a mix of culture in the school which is good because I would love to meet new cultures but still has my culture around. When I stayed at the overnight event the students seemed very friendly and very outgoing. Wisconsin Lutheran is a great school because it is not far from my home, so if I ever feel homesick I can drive back home. Another good thing about it is the local area it has everything so I don't have to drive hours to find the nearest walmart."
Junior,5,"The profs really care about you. The education program is outstanding. Not only are there many ways to be involved, but the campus community is close knit and friendly."
Niche User,5,"I am currently a High School Senior who is very interested in attending WLC in the fall. My parents brought me to the campus for a tour and I was beyond amazed. The staff is approachable and did a great job at asking any and all of my questions about college. Housing, the food, and overall students attending were outwardly nice. It has a small town feel in a big city, which is exactly what I am looking for."
Alum,5,I really enjoyed the small class sizes and the individual attention that professors gave to me. The campus is in a great location and has awesome dorms.
Sophomore,5,I love the small classes and feel like a person here. I would like to see the avoidance of older students go away in some of the students.
Freshman,5,"I may just be starting official college life next month, but I already feel as though I am part of something bigger. Last weekend, I attended the WOW session, which is designed to help freshman meet other freshman, and get a feel for the layout of the campus.  The experience was amazing! I cannot wait until I begin my next journey with WLC next month."
Freshman,5,I am a returnee to Wisconsin Lutheran College and it was the acedemics and atmosphere that drew me back. The professors are always willing to provide assistance and help to all students. The housing is pretty good too. The students are polite and fun to be around as well.
Senior,5,I don't want to type.                                                                                                                                                                                                    k
Sophomore,5,Wisconsin Lutheran College is truly a home away from home.  Faculty and students are very kind and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I love being a student at Wisconsin Lutheran College. It is a small campus with about 1000 students. I love having it be its own small community because even if you don't know everyone by name, you recognize faces. It is very inclusive also with many different clubs and organizations. We also have daily chapels which I strive to go to."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Wisconsin Lutheran was amazing. It was really nice even as I was a commuter! I loved the aid I received not only from my professors, but my classmates as well. The friendly people all around campus helped me to stay cool and focused on being on my ""A game"". I simply felt the positive desire to want to do well since I had positivity pushing on me. The experience was great. I aspire to continue to do well and keep my head up. Being at WLC motivates me to be an awesome student. It has molded me to be goal- oriented, so that I may surely have future success in my desired career, which is Theology."
Alum,5,"I made the decision to attend WLC late in my senior year of high school. It was the campus tour that sealed the deal. I loved the small campus and personal attention from my admissions counselor. It was a vastly different experience than the larger public universities I toured. Ultimately, my decision was one of the best I've ever made. I was able to explore multiple areas of study, serve as a Resident Assistant, participate in various clubs and organizations, and enjoy all that Milwaukee has to offer. The professors are top-notch. Vesper's each week was a highlight."
Niche User,5,"I love this school! All the staff, advisors and professors are so helpful! I am a part of the adult completion program, and it has been a great experience so far. "
College Freshman,5,The professors are always available to help.
College Freshman,5,The teachers go the extra mile to provide a great future for their students.
College Freshman,5,"We are completely safe, and the school takes the extra protocols to make sure we are all in good hands."
College Freshman,5,I don't really get off into sports.
College Freshman,5,"I love Wisconsin Lutheran College. Coming here was the right pick for me, as soon as you walk in the door it's a friendly atmosphere. The whole school is truly covered by God, and the faculty and students are very nice & welcoming."
College Freshman,5,"I feel that not many places in the nation can compete with the housing WLC has to offer.  They have quality, well taken care of resident halls with some pretty neat state of the art features."
College Freshman,5,My overall experience has been the best and I have been impressed with the campus and the people I've been around. It is very diverse and everyone is open to each other and new ideas. The food is great and God is always first in the classroom and throughout the college. It's beautiful and is a lot of fun.
College Freshman,5,The school has a 99% rate for the students to graduate and hsve jobs and pretty much every student gets a job. Internships and on the job studies are fun and informal and help the students grow and develop in their field choice. Getting a degree and graduating is always made important by the teachers and they want everyone to do well.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone on campus is polite and nice and everyone looks out for one another. The campus is safe and secure and no one worries of things happening. Crime, fights, sexual assault, etc are prevented."
College Freshman,5,I love being in such a safe environment that is full of students and teachers who want to serve God in everything they do. That is what makes my school so unique.
College Junior,5,"I am an Education major, and the professors are great!"
College Junior,5,"I am an Education major, and the professors are great!"
College Junior,5,I've always felt safe here.
College Junior,5,Wisconsin Lutheran College has helped me grow into a servant leader.  I can see that I am improving and becoming the best version of myself.  I truly feel prepared for my future.
College Freshman,5,I am a football players of course I'm partial !!
College Freshman,5,I am very happy with my college choice!
College Sophomore,5,I love my school. I love the experience I have had here so far and I do not want to change schools.
Recent Alumnus,5,"On the border of Milwaukee and Wauwatosa, WLC is in an incredibly safe neighborhood."
Recent Alumnus,5,As a small college in an expanding Milwaukee market career opportunities are always on high demand. Employers love WLC graduates and truly value that degree on a person's resume. Most people in my graduating class already have a job lined up for after school.
Recent Alumnus,5,"WLC boasts some of the best housing facilities in the US for college dormitories, and seeing as the campus itself is tightly knit you never have to worry about a long walk to classes."
College Freshman,5,I truely believe that my teachers care about me and want me to do well.
College Freshman,5,Living in the dorms is amazing!
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love this school. The teachers in my field are nice and experienced.  I know that I'm being taught by professors who have first hand experience with the materials.
College Senior,5,One of the biggest reason I go here
College Freshman,5,I love the new building I am in. VERY up to date.
College Freshman,5,"Got new fields this past year, best in conference"
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very welcoming and willing to help.
College Senior,5,Best on campus housing you will find
College Freshman,5,"The classes I took were challenging but not too bad. My professors are very nice and it is easy to contact them. Going from a big high school to a small college, I really like the smaller class sizes."
College Freshman,5,I am studying to become a special education teacher and I am already going to have time in a real classroom my freshman year of college. I also like how much the staff helps get their students out there so they can later have a good job.
College Freshman,5,The dorms at my school are very nice and in a good location to where the other buildings are. The rooms are pretty big and spacious. The janitors also always keep the dorms clean for us living in them.
Sophomore,4,My online learning experience has been very limited because they have done a great job keeping us attending class in person. Although the few sessions I have attended online have been great.
Freshman,4,"The campus is small, which can be viewed as a good or a bad thing. The community on campus is very welcoming and friendly! Tons of awesome opportunities to participate in fun events for little to no money, as well as free food ALL THE TIME. Seriously. Every Tuesday is Phat Tuesday and they get a different food from chain restaurants or bakeries. Next week we are having Buffalo Wild Wings."
Junior,4,"Overall my experience as a student at Wisconsin Lutheran College has been incredible. It is clear that the professors on campus love what they do and care about the success of the students. They will ask about the students' lives outside of school to get to know them better and work to accommodate for issues that may arise in the students' lives in and outside of school. Many of the professors go above and beyond what is expected of them when a student needs special accommodations for a project or test ensuring that the student learns and grows in their class. This has been done by extending a deadline, allowing a student to take a test in the library instead of the classroom setting, or setting up an appointment with the student to go step-by-step through a project the student is struggling with. However, the professors also push students to excel and set high expectations for the assignments and classroom atmosphere."
Freshman,4,The school is very clique-ish. The academics are good if you seek them out. The culture is wanting. Overall the professors are good.
Sophomore,4,"Classes are small, and professors are good, giving lots of personalized time. Nursing and education are the main focus of the school. Sports are very big. Fine arts are underfunded. Housing and food are decent."
Junior,4,"When it came to picking a college, I probably did not struggle with the decision as much as other students. WLC is small, close-knit, and grounded in the same faith as me. This is important. Now entering my third full year, I can honestly say that I love it at WLC. Yes, WLC is rather expensive, but the support I have found there from professors and friends is outstanding. I even became a tour guide because I love WLC and I want others to find their calling there, too."
Freshman,4,"Most of the professors here are very invested in their students and would like to see them succeed. The staff overall are very helpful. The dorms are much nicer than those of the UW schools. The school has a welcoming feel to it, and the academics are very good. The small class sizes means you get to know your professor and should you need help you will be able to reach them, unlike going to a larger school."
Niche User,4,"Wisconsin Lutheran College has an awesome, small school, friendly Christian atmosphere that I am well acquainted with. The campus impressed me, and it had many wonderful facilities. However, I would like to see more engineering majors in the curriculum."
Freshman,4,"Wisconsin Lutheran is a small, family-like campus that welcomes everyone with open arms. The professors truly care about every students and strives to push and help them."
Alum,4,"I loved the small school experience at WLC. The professors know their students on a first-name basis, and they are extremely easy to connect with regarding any questions you may have. WLC has some of the nicest campus housing I've ever seen. Despite the high-price of a private school, WLC was surprisingly affordable due to the grants and scholarships that are available. I loved living in Milwaukee and all of the activities that the city has to offer."
College Freshman,4,WLC has a high status in the internship and career world amongst many places.  This is encouraging to know that with my hard work I am in good hands.
College Freshman,4,"I really feel the passion of the professors in their fields and how willing they are to help struggling students.  If I need to miss class, like I did because of Labor Day, the staff is understanding."
College Freshman,4,I feel that I am very safe on campus and that the college's staff does a good job of keeping us safe and healthy as best as they can.
College Freshman,4,"Although I have only been in school for less than a month, I am already feeling comfortable and enjoying my experience here at WLC.  The professors and staff are all extremely friendly, willing to help at the shortest notice.  Academics are on the high end here which means a lot to me that WLC is so gifted.  There is also a lot of fun activities to do that I am overwhelmed with stuff.  It is amazing!"
College Junior,4,The student size is small so interacting with professors are always easy. Most of the professors are great at being in their offices and/or replying to messages via e-mail.
College Freshman,4,The resident halls are clean and the temperature is suited to everyone's liking. You get paired up with a roomate that has similar likes and can get along well with everyone around. The rooms are spacious and clean. It's feels good to have independence and to have freedom to leave at any time.
College Freshman,4,All the teams play together well to the best of their ability and work together to win. The sport teams carry good sportsmanship and support each other while representing the school and God.
College Junior,4,The housing situation is very ideal for a college.
College Sophomore,4,"I have had some pretty tough course in college so far, but all of my professors are very helpful if you ask for the help."
College Sophomore,4,At my school there is 100% placement when it comes to jobs. The school says that they will for sure get you a job when getting out of college. This makes it a little easier for you right when you get out of school.
College Sophomore,4,I always feel safe on campus. And I feel that staff at school are very supportive as well.
College Sophomore,4,The housing on campus is very nice. I enjoyed the dorm I lived my freshman year and I am excited to live in my apartment next year. But I feel like the rules were enforced too much.
College Sophomore,4,"I play softball, and I love my team and the coaches at my school. But softball is not as important as some of the other sports on campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,Athletics are a large part of WLC's campus environment. A huge percentage of students are involved in D3 athletics in the NACC conference and just as many get involved in the various on-campus intramural events.
Recent Alumnus,4,The small classroom and campus atmosphere is exactly what I needed to excel in the classroom and prepare me for my future.
College Freshman,4,The campus is mostly well-lit and they have guards around.
College Freshman,4,It is nice being able to walk to wherever I need to go.
College Freshman,4,I have met some really wonderful people that I feel comfortable with.
College Sophomore,4,I like the class sizes. Classes with about 20 people in them are perfect. I like that the professor gets to know you as a student and reaches out to you if they see that you are struggling. WLC offers a variety of courses that you can take.
College Sophomore,4,"I like having classes of about 20-30 people in them. The professors get to know their students very well and are always willing to help. Some of my favorite experiences involve me being in volleyball.  Other experiences include going to other sports games like football and basketball with friends. I would chose this school again for many reasons.  There are always fun activities going on to keep you busy even on the weekends, it is a smaller school so everyone gets to know everyone and you do not feel lost, and because of the Christian atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,I think that this school had the nicest dorms out of all of the schools that I visited and I still enjoy my dorm that I am living in. Where the buildings are located are good compared to where the classrooms are. But I do feel like the housing is a little expensive.
College Freshman,4,"In the fall during football season there is always a huge fan support. I believe that the most people go to football games over all other sports, but I have noticed that there are still fans going to baseball, softball, and basketball games including myself. Most of the facilities are new this year so the fields and courts are very nice. When it comes to team performance my school might not be the best over all the others but we are not close to being the worst either."
College Freshman,4,"The classes that I have been taking are pretty enjoyable and the teachers are very helpful when you need their help. The school plans different events throughout the year for you to do, so there is always something that you can do or be involved in. I feel like this makes my school unique because most schools would just have you find things to do on your own. If I had to go through the process of picking a school again I would choose WLC because I am able to play softball and they have a good education program."
College Freshman,4,There are security cameras literally everywhere
College Freshman,4,The equipment and fields ate in great shape. The money was donated and many things have been added to other fields as well
College Senior,4,So far I am satisfied
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus when outside or in the buildings. But the area around the campus does not always seem like the best area to me.
College Freshman,4,"I am apart of the softball team at school and our team is a larger team this year. I have gone to football, basketball, and volleyball games and there is always some type of crowd at the games. All of the teams are a decent size and from who I have talked to, people enjoy being on the other teams as well."
College Freshman,4,"I have had a great experience at my school first semester. I enjoyed the classes that I took and also the teachers I had for these classes. Outside of class, they have church everyday that you could go to and the service was always nice. My school always has different planned activities throughout the week or weekend that you can go to in order to keep you busy."
College Freshman,4,"There is a decent amount of student attendance to sporting events, not everyone chooses to go, but they are talked about often and a person doesn't have to go out of their way to find out when they are."
College Junior,4,There are plenty of students who get internships which turn into their permanent jobs one day.
College Junior,4,We have good severity system. Everyone feels safe
College Junior,4,looking forward to the future.
College Junior,4,I really enjoy attending WLC.
College Freshman,4,We have a full-time doctor and nurse. Public safety is constantly patrolling.
College Freshman,4,respected programs with lots of opportunities to get jobs after graduation
College Freshman,4,Loved all my classes and professors. Loved the small class sizes. learned lots
College Freshman,4,"I love the small, beautiful campus. The atmosphere is great. I would try to meet more people sooner if I did it again."
College Junior,4,"I like the small class sizes and the varied and abundant opportunities to study God's 

Word."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms for freshman are pretty nice for first year students they are large and each suite of up to five people contains one bathroom unit. The sophomore apartments too are just a year old and have a kitchen, living area, two bathrooms, and two bedrooms."
College Junior,4,I appreciate that they uphold the rules they have in place.
College Junior,4,The financial aid office is open to all sorts of questions. They were very helpful for advice in filling out my financial aid request and my first FAFSA after I got married in the middle of the school year.
College Junior,4,"I do not live on campus and do not have a meal plan as a result. The meals that I have had with friends have always had good options and variety. Students who live on campus complain about the food system, because it is often unclear about when ""swipes"" are necessary.

The beverage options from the Warrior Underground are great! Hot or cold, your specialty beverage desires will be satisfied in the WU.

The food service that I use the most is the free library coffee. It is your average brew, but it is always free, always hot, and always available. They usually have free creamer and sugar/sugar substitute to make it not so black, if that is what you want."
College Sophomore,4,"There are constantly employers on campus recruiting for jobs in the area which is great. I know the campus has many events that include alumni and current students, but I have never attended one so I don't know what they are like or how great they are. Internship is very high rate at my school, if you want one you can pretty much get one and receive school credit for it."
College Sophomore,4,the class sizes are perfect because they're not too large so that its intimidating to ask questions or hard to focus. I like the fact that all of my professors know my name and I know some on a more personal friendship level. They are very accessible if you need help and willing to help to better your education.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere, the housing is beautiful and they work very hard to keep it clean. My RA is hard to get in contact with and usually isn't around when I need her, but I don't know how the RA's are overall. The washing machines don't work all the time, but there are enough of them that normally I can find one that works. There is only one oven and stove in the entire building, which is annoying, but I think that's because of a health hazard. Still, they could two or three in the kitchen downstairs."
College Junior,4,"I have been blessed with wonderful, caring professors here at WLC, but there are some who are much less willing to help. Class styles vary--in a good way--and class sizes are nice and small."
College Junior,4,"Pretty good opportunities--especially if you live around the greater Milwaukee area, it seems."
College Junior,4,I think they do a fairly good job of keeping things in order.
College Junior,4,The housing options are quite nice compared to other colleges.
College Junior,2,I feel trapped in my school and feel like no one is willing to let me succeed. I feel like just a number and that they do not care about my education or career. But I feel like I have invested too much time and have passed enough classes to switch to a different nursing school.
College Sophomore,2,there isn't much for parties on campus.. if something is going on It occurs at a house off campus
College Sophomore,2,"They have the same menu in the cafeteria every week, the fries are ALWAYS cold, and the soup is almost never good. Sometimes the food for thought is good, but usually it's just nasty lunchroom food. There is always pizza, which is nice, but pizza gets old if you eat it twice a day everyday. The grill is good, but the line is very long, same with the sandwich bar. The salad bar is good, if it's early in the week and the lettuce is fresh."
College Freshman,2,There's not much to choose from close to hear besides fast food. Most everything isn't even within walking distance
College Freshman,2,The only time there is transportation is to WLC related events.
College Freshman,2,It goes out all the time
College Freshman,2,Wisconsin weather can be very abrasive and freezing cold weather makes it undesirable to move about campus
College Freshman,2,"I'm a commuter, so I need a spot to park my car. I didn't get a spot in the commuter lot as a freshman. Instead I had to pay more than triple the price for a resident spot that happened to be open still. I'm happy I have a spot to go to everyday, but it is 2 blocks away and ridiculously priced.   "
College Freshman,2,I hate snow and cold Wisconsin weather.
College Junior,2,Some issues with living farther away but still in on campus housing
College Sophomore,2,Campus dining is very poor. The food is not healthy and for the most part makes me sick. I find it easier to walk down the hall and cook my own meals most of the time. I truly regret getting the larger meal plan. More than half way through the semester and I haven't even used half of my meals yet! 
College Sophomore,2,"Our school is not very diverse at all. In fact almost everyone is the same when it comes to political views, religious views, and sexual orientation. This makes it difficult for students who like to think a bit more abstractly to feel at home. "
College Sophomore,2,There are very few computer labs on campus. There is a mathematics computer lab and a computer science computer lab. With this said there are no labs for just your average student. There are plenty of  computers in the library but due to the library's poor hours this does not accommodate the late night or early morning worker. 
College Sophomore,2,"The majors that WLC offers are not many. Other than you're average degrees such as nursing, education, and business you are practically left in the dark. "
College Freshman,2,"It sucks that you are forced to have a meal plan if you live on campus. We only have one dining hall and the food that is served just goes in cycles, it get's really boring and I end up eating the same thing for every meal most of the time. Also, the dining hall is only open at certain times throughout the day so if I'm hungry and the dining hall isn't open, I have to find somewhere else to eat."
College Freshman,2,"I personally do not have a car on campus, but being a small school has its limitations for parking. There is a parking circle that is up for grabs in the morning, but once it is filled up students are on their own. These spots are often reserved for visitors to the school, which makes it much harder to find a spot."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much variety in the campus cafeteria and the only other place to eat on campus is in the Brewhouse, which is pretty expensive. The food is ok, but it's hard to find healthy non-greasy foods for meals day after day."
College Junior,2,"Good but Needs More – The food at WLC is good but at times it can be gross. For example, when the lettuce at the salad bar is gross as in frozen or a bit brown. The food can also be repetitive and I don't care to eat the same thing all the time."
College Sophomore,2,"Same Old – The options never seem to vary or change from day to day all that much. During the first month of the semester, the food is good, but seems to worsen throughout the school year. I went to the lowest meal plan after my first semester because I would skip eating in the dining hall often."
College Sophomore,2,"Food Get Old – Our food choices given by the school are not always the best, especially for healthy eaters. The specialty food is always the best but since everyone wants it it takes too much to try to get it. There needs to be an ungrade in our school's food system."
Freshman,1,Don't go here if you have a mental disability they won't help you at all.  If you want help they refer you to tutoring.  They give you to many credits and they tell you that it is normal.😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
Niche User,1,Of you have a mental disability such as ADHD or any others don't go there.  Because they will screw you over big time. They will not cater to your disability at all.
College Junior,1,"We don't have one so I don't have a lot to say about it. However, we are able to go to parties in the neighboring schools"
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek Life
College Sophomore,1,"I have only heard mention of parties on yikyak, and saying how lame they are. Supposedly there are good parties, you just have to know the right people, but I don't believe it. It is a Christian campus, though."
College Junior,1,The places are average but the housing process sucks.
College Junior,1,We're not allowed to live off campus
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life or housing for sororities at our school.
College Junior,1,No Fraternities or Sororities are available 
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life at my school and everyone is fine with that.
College Sophomore,1,"My campus is not very diverse. To start, we have a very small enrollment, just barely over 1000 students, which greatly hinders the ability to have a large assortment of backgrounds. Also, being a Lutheran college, we tend to draw in solely people of this religion, the only exception normally being athletes. However, this does not mean that our college is not accepting of those with diverse backgrounds, but we simply tend to draw in a specific crowd!"
College Freshman,1,"WLC does not offer the major I want to study. They offer very little and the courses they do offer require you to take clinical work.  I don't mind clinical work, however when you are forced to find your own transportation with no car and no money, it's difficult to proceed with that major."
College Freshman,1,Wisconsin Lutheran College does not offer my major.
College Junior,1,"Very little parking spots due to lack of space to have parking. Also, the medical college takes up a lot of the parking."
College Sophomore,1,"Watch Out. If you're caught cheating or plagiarizing academic work, you'll be reported to the dean and even banned from the campus."
College Freshman,1,"As far as I know, WLC does not have any frats or sororities. Our campus is small and although we don't have huge parties and social hierarchies of the Greeks, it's an amazing university."
College Junior,1,An Enormous Joke. The public safety department here is a complete and utter joke.  They are more concerned with giving out parking tickets and increasing the cost of the partking spots than they are providing the services they are supposed to provide.  It is really a disgrace.
College Freshman,1,TOO Many Sports – THe athletic teams ore not very good the crowds are horrible and they really need to boost the morale of students going to the games

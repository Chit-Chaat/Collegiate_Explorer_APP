Alum,5,"Yale overall is the best place to spend your undergraduate years. The academics are amazing and allow you to expand your mind in ways never before, if you let yourself. The city of New Haven is honestly a great place to spend college because of its urban environment while giving a small town feel. Yale really tries to make sure it feels like home to its students and I feel that it succeeds."
Senior,5,"Yale University certainly lives up to its prestigious reputation.  There are so many undergraduate opportunities and experiences, as well as a diverse student body and faculty, and that gives Yale a unique character.  It is amazing to meet many of the world's leading professionals and academics, and it is an honor to learn from them--and even work with them.   Most of all, Yale is a collaborative environment where the students support each other, rather than compete with each other."
Senior,5,"Yale has been very accommodating to online learning.  The professors interact individually with the students, and that allows for every student to have his/her needs met, given their specific individual circumstances."
Sophomore,5,"The student body at Yale is multifaceted, diverse, and extremely talented. Living, learning, and working among students from all over the world is eye-opening and broadening, even beyond the incredible education provided by the knowledgeable and accomplished faculty."
Freshman,5,"Learning online is a mixed bag. Some professors were very accommodating and understanding, but others had no idea how to use Zoom. Most professors understood that learning during a pandemic, online, was less than ideal. Successful student organizing for Universal Pass/Fail meant most of the grade pressure was taken off for this semester."
Senior,5,Lives up to its name. The professors actively try to help you and serve as resources. The student life is enriching.
Niche User,5,"I loved the campus. You can feel the history through the architechture. However, New Haven is not the most inviting town so stay on campus. There is so much happening on campus as well, its a terrific environment."
Niche User,5,haven't even started there yet but i'm so excited to. admissions process is great and they do a lot to get you connected to other incoming freshmen
Niche User,5,I went on a college tour at Yale University and absolutely loved it. The buildings were nice and the people there were so friendl It makes e feel a part of thir faily before attedning there already!
Freshman,5,"Going there helped me fit it, not at all what I expected. The environment isn't rigid, cold, and cutthroat but rather welcoming and passionate. Everyone is driven to work together toward what is best."
Freshman,5,"People who gave New Haven a C+ are literally racist and just scared of black people because of their whitewashed upbringing. How does Columbia have a higher safety rating when one of their students was stabbed to death last month? New Haven is safe, some people are just bigoted."
Freshman,5,"From the moment I stepped on campus, the students and professors were extremely welcoming and committed to making every student feel at home. The residential colleges allow first years to have a small, tight-knit community that is enriched through social and cultural events. The academics are top notch in every department with accessible and enthusiastic professors that push their students to achieve greatness. The party scene is incredible and open for students to enjoy on the weekends as a way to connect with others. Although people who have never visited New Haven are concerned about safety, Yale does an amazing job of making sure the campus is safe at all hours and works to connect Yale students to the city of New Haven."
Sophomore,5,"I love the sense of community here, being a part of a residential college really gives you somewhere to belong. There are also so many extracurriculars available that its easy to be overwhelmed by the choice! Although Yale has been a mostly positive experience, I would love to see the Student Income Contribution get eliminated, so FGLI students aren't obligated to work in order to have a place at Yale."
Niche User,5,There is no place like Yale. The community is supportive and the campus is absolutely gorgeous. New Haven is a perfectly place for anyone that wants a college town experience with a mixture of the big city feel. The campus is huge and there are great eateries all around the campus.
Freshman,5,"My expectations were high coming in, but they were far exceeded in every way. Life at Yale is incredible in all aspects."
Senior,5,"Great college! They say the more options you have the more regrets you'll have, and that has been true of my Yale experience. While I do not regret doing the things I did do, I do wish I had more than 24 hours in a day so I could do even more! There is so much to do in terms of career development, extra-curriculars, and just entertainment in general. There are so many classes to choose from and most of the professors are incredible not just as professors, but as people in general. If I could redo college I would definitely choose Yale again!"
Freshman,5,"Yale University is an amazing school. It is home to a variety of students with diverse backgrounds and interests, and provides its students with all the resources necessary to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing school with some of the best people I have ever met. Professors (for the most part) genuinely care about you and how well you know the material. Very easy to set up meetings/lunches with them. Many different on campus events and summer opportunities that can be found. It can be a bit difficult to navigate Yale's website since there are so many and it's not that organized but as long as you google, you can find internships, research labs, etc. Decent food and amazing dining hall staff members. The new residential colleges have amazing dorms (really big) and facilities (being a Paulimur). Pretty good support in terms of career help. There are daily drop-in hour times that offer resume/cover letter help. Lots of different clubs available although most of them have an application process which in my opinion can be slightly annoying."
Niche User,5,"I love Yale University because it is wonderful, unique, supportive place filled with brilliant, interesting and fun people. In my opinion, other schools can't offer the sense of community that the residential college system fosters, or simply support their students with as much funding, resources and advice. 
""Urim and Thummim"""
Niche User,5,"Yale is an amazing university that has some of the best academics, values, and curriculum, but lacks in providing a good typical college experience."
Graduate Student,5,Love the school and wouldnt change anything about it! The university truly cares about each student’s success and support in doing so.
Junior,5,"unique experience, students are happy, food is great, professors are the best in the world!!! Yale is a place for young minds to develop and change the world"
Sophomore,5,"Love it! I am constantly academically challenged and have really felt like I'm truly learning at Yale. The people are amazing, and it is an incredible experience to be surrounded by so many talented students."
Freshman,5,"An amazing school with so many different positive qualities about it! There's also a lot of balance - Greek life doesn't dominate but it's still there and pretty open to most people. Academics are challenging/rigorous but so captivating that you're motivated to work hard. There is a variety of social, political, economic, religious views represented on campus and yet almost everyone is respectful and open about getting to know about why you think the way you do. To cut a long story short - best college in the world, and I couldn't be happier."
Sophomore,5,"Yale is the best. The students are well-rounded, kind, and eager to learn. The professors care about teaching and want the students to do well. The environment is very collaborative, which is a product of the small class sizes and residential college system."
Niche User,5,The campus tours are fantastic! The students gave incredible insight in being a student at Yale University.
Niche User,5,"While on spring break, I went on a college visit to this school. They presented well and I enjoyed the experience."
Niche User,5,"I really like the online courses from Yale University, you can choose btw a lot of different subjects and get smarter.
And the proffessors are amazing!
This university changed me a lot. Not only do I feel like an expert in my area of study, but I have been taught to write and speak in a much more compelling way than ever before. The university is very conducive to fostering strong friendships among undergrads. I have close networks of friends that I could not have formed elsewhere"

Freshman,5,Great school and great experience so far! I love everything about it and can’t wait to spend the next 3 years here!!
Niche User,5,"Great people, education, campus life, environment, restaurants, you name it! This college is definitely meant for everyone!"
Graduate Student,5,"The campus is absolutely gorgeous, rich with history and amazing architecture. The fact that Yale is a smaller college not only allows you to walk wherever you need to go, but the individualized attention you receive from professors and administration sets this school apart from everything else. You get to know everyone on a personal level and the staff truly wants you to do well. This school is a must."
Graduate Student,5,"I love being in this school because there is no limitations on your abilities. The professors I've had, push and believe in me. My school is encourages creativity in thought, instead of being average."
Graduate Student,5,"Yale University is basically the most beautiful school in the world, by far. I still can't believe just how gorgeous the place is. Sometimes when I'm walking around by myself on the old campus, I just want to pinch myself. It's pretty much the ""Blue Steel"" of colleges and universities. Funny story, but my African mom basically describes it in the following terms: ""ohh, it all looks like Harry Potter's world! I bet this is where he really goes to school!""."
Niche User,5,"Best school in the country. Incredible financial aid, sports, campus, academics (obviously). Food is great too."
Sophomore,5,"Yale University is an amazing school with amazing resources. It is special because of the name: it draws faculty and speakers with interesting backgrounds and experience you can learn from. the huge endowment provides great opportunities for financial aid (and therefore diversity). It is so beautiful in and out of the buildings. If you can get used to the weather, it is a great place to be a student."
Alum,5,"Yale was amazing! I felt like I belonged there and now I am a software engineer who makes $240,000 a year. Couldn't have done it without Yale."
Freshman,5,"Amazing people who are so diverse and incredibly humble. Great Professors, some of the best in the world. Residential colleges make for supportive communities and it’s much easier to make friends and get to know your classmates."
Niche User,5,"When I went there for my YYGS program, it was nothing but amazing. The staff was friendly there (especially the lunchladies) as well as the professors there. The campus is also beautiful!"
Freshman,5,"I knew a lot of people who talked about Yale's community before coming here, but I honestly didn't really take it too seriously. However, after just a semester here, I see exactly what people mean and truly think it differentiates it from other top schools. Students aren't backstab-by or overly competitive; high school was honestly more competitive from my experience. Other students are always willing to share notes, form study groups, and generally be helpful. It creates a very positive environment which honestly is so healthy and makes college so much more fun."
Senior,5,My favorite part of the place is definitely the people. Everyone is world-class and super humber and down to Earth. I definitely recommend this place to everyone
Junior,5,"Great academic experiences to be had at Yale. The college is full of amazing and interesting people, but the city and area Yale is in is not the greatest. It is in a good location, though, as it is close to nyc, boston, etc."
Freshman,5,"When stepping on Yale's campus for the very first time, I immediately felt welcomed and comfortable with the environment I had just entered. Each individual that I encountered was different than the rest, proving  to me that Yale values establishing a diverse community that embodies similar values to  me. Yale is a place where creativity and dreams  come to life which is why I chose  to attend the university."
Alum,5,"I was able to really find my niche and find my people there. I specialized in what I wanted to study, and was able to explore education in ways I had never previously known were possible."
Niche User,5,"Yale University has an amazing atmosphere, a dream school for anyone wishing to major in anything. The campus is not too large and it feels comforting."
Niche User,5,"This is a great private school for students prospecting to go on to law school or business school. Also, if a student is medical-oriented, then there is a wide variety of laboratories for research."
Freshman,5,"I don't need to tell you that Yale is a world-class university with renowned faculty and seemingly unlimited resources. But you might not realize that it is also an extremely open and welcoming community where you will find every single type of person you can think of, and where it is possible to have literally any kind of social experience you like, whether that means Greek life, D-I varsity athletics, international trips with your music group, working on top-notch publications and productions, clubbing every night, or never leaving the library. Whatever you are looking for exists here. If you would like to not only be in awe of your peers, but feel at home among them, Yale is your place. It really is so much more than a school."
Freshman,5,"It's an amazing university, full of talented students and brilliant staff. Yale does a fantastic job of giving you a well-rounded, liberal arts education."
Niche User,5,"I""m not yet enrolled at Yale, but my experience with the college so far has proved positive in every regard. The school sets a high priority on helping every student to excel, with an atmosphere that is challenging and relevant to our society."
Junior,5,"Yale is, like most things, what you make of it. It has resources that couldn't be dreamed of in most schools (dorm rooms, residential colleges, fellowships, advisors, career offices). But sometimes the richness of the opportunities confuses and overwhelms people to the point of not really taking advantage of them as fully as they can."
Freshman,5,"Great college.  Felt like i made a great choice to attend Yale.  Teachers are excellent and are interested in teaching.  Students are very friendly and the atmosphere is very conducive to learning.  Enjoying the sporting community, the arts atmosphere and the student life.  Very easy to get around campus and feel very safe.  Weather has been great thus far.  I feel challenged in my classes and i have to work hard to stay ahead.  Great class opportunities.  Flexibility in choosing major and easy to talk to professors about college goals."
Freshman,5,"The students are extremely kind, the professors are very involved and available, and the campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"Check out the open yale courses online! Amazing resources! I cannot recommend this enough. As a member of the class of 2022, I am obsessed with everything about this college and I can’t wait to step foot on campus!"
Niche User,5,"I lived at Morse College, great food, great dorm, and great people. I think it is one of the best locations on campus, right in front of the Payne Whitney Gym. 
Professors are great; my personal favorite is Physics Professor Daniel Prober. Best moment in his APHY 120 course is he took off his shoes while listening to a student presentation LOL."
Freshman,5,Yale has been an amazing place so far. It brings together people with interesting stories who are super kind and overall really great.
Works Here,5,"Yale is a highly diverse university with exceptionally friendly and helpful faculty, staff, and students. The food is beyond exceptional, taking sustainability, food waste, health, and nutrition in mind when it comes to every dish. I'm always learning new things each time I step foot on campus. I can't say enough about this place!"
Sophomore,5,"Yale is the most amazing place. Though when I think of Yale I first think of old white men reading old white books, it really isn't that anymore. It is an involved, active campus with an incredible amount of diversity. Most people here are excited to be here, and the residential college system really is the best."
Senior,5,"Although my first two years were a bit rough, I absolutely adore Yale. The financial aid is generous, the campus is beautiful, the curriculum is both challenging and interesting, and the variety of extracurricular activities and funding available to students is still overwhelming to me, even in my final year."
Freshman,5,"The sense of community is phenomenal. Yale truly fosters individual growth and strives to make college an experience worth having, not just a means to an end. I, along with mostly everyone, love it here. <3"
Alum,4,It was alright. Only did spring 2020 online because I graduated. Professors adapted their courses pretty quickly!
Sophomore,4,"No online class can have the same impact and verbosity as an in-person class, simply because not all students have equal access to online materials. Also, some professors are more adept and skilled with online platforms than others. Yale provided all students and faculty with Zoom, as well as several ongoing online resources (like access to libraries, audiovisual materials, etc.). Yale's response as a whole to the transition to online classes was fairly good. Eventually the administration switched to a Universal Pass/Fail grading system."
Sophomore,4,"i think there is a lot of room here to be yourself. it's not a sporty school, but there is a big WASP atmosphere present. New haven has its ups and downs"
Niche User,4,Yale is really great! The community is super supportive while also being competitive. There is plenty to do and see at Yale. If you are interested in joining clubs they have hundreds of clubs in all sorts of areas of interest.
Freshman,4,"World-renown institution with impeccable resources and educational opportunities. Unfortunately the University still has some growing pains with diversity, resources, and affordability."
Sophomore,4,"Yale offers incredible opportunities for its students whether its in-depth research, travel abroad programs, or amazing extra curricular activities. There is so much to do on campus, it can feel overwhelming at times. There is plenty of support and people to turn to for help."
Sophomore,4,"Surrounded by talented peers, excellent professors. Definitely still a university that bears marks of its past as a finishing school for the wealthy."
Senior,4,"It is good, but can be better! Academic environment is excellent. The city is very exotic. Amazing library! Shuttles are perfect. You can whereever you want in the city whenever you want! This makes you feel safe."
Alum,4,"Academically, Yale was amazing but very rigorous. I wish that I could’ve spent more time enjoying Yale and less time just trying to survive it."
Alum,4,"I have heard many great things about Yale but what I experienced during my two week program at Yale is why I am writing this now. I really enjoyed the engaging lectures by Yale professors and I corresponded with a few of them to learn more about their research. I visited laboratories and met up with a professor who works at Fermilab, astounded by the facilities and opportunities available at Yale. It would be really exciting to be able to participate in such research and I like the emphasis on involving undergraduates."
Graduate Student,4,"Yale is a great place to be a student - variety of class offerings even as a grad student, and plenty of cool events and opportunities among the different schools and departments, though food and housing options around campus are not always as great."
Alum,4,All of the students at Yale are kind and are passionate about something. There is a community for every kind of person. Diversity can be improved. Many students of color have reported racial incidents on campus.
Sophomore,4,Great! A beautiful campus with so many resources to have an amazing college experience. Highly recommend
Junior,4,"Yale offers a great breadth of academic courses, thus allowing students to explore different majors that they may be contemplating. The group approach to studying  courses involving math and science can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on how one best learns. The campus is spread throughout an urban city,  so one has to use awareness as navigating an ""open"" campus. Student life is improved by creating bonds with the advisers, deans, and peers that Yale matches one with to avoid isolation. Interest groups also keep one inspired while attaining academic goals. Lastly, dorm life, in general, is good including  gym, laundry facilities and junk food splurge nights."
Freshman,4,"There is definitely a large adjustment to be made in your first year when students are first exposed to many realities quite different than in high school. Going from the top of the class to just trying to beat the average can be intimidating, but the amount of resources here is truly amazing. Many people are looking out for you and want to help, so although the academic adjustment was quite difficult, the competition is manageable because for the most part, people are very helpful and supportive."
Freshman,4,"Everyone at Yale is very self-motivated, and that can be both very refreshing in the classroom and overwhelming. Regardless, Yale provides plenty of support to transitioning first-years with their residential college system and access to the multicultural centers on campus. It is extremely difficult to fail at Yale because of all of the people: Professors, Frocos, College Heads, etc. that are around to cheer you on along the way."
Sophomore,4,"It is one of the best experiences, and the 'Ivy League' title is a silver lining. YAle yale yale yale yale yale yale yale!!!"
Sophomore,4,"After being here for two years, I feel that I belong. It can take a while but there are amazing people here that devote themselves to the students they serve. At the same time, Yale is by no means perfect; it can improve in terms of diversity (racially and socioeconomically) and administration can be more responsive. Overall, however, I can't complain."
Senior,4,Good sense of community. New Haven isnt great because its small. The liberal arts courses are pretty interesting. However they are adding two new residential colleges (and not hiring more professors) which will make it more difficult to get into popular classes.
College Sophomore,4,"Yale students care not only about their studies, but about so much more. Whether they are singers, reporters, debaters, or athletes, the typical Yale student is engaged in both learning and extra curriculars."
College Freshman,4,The best times of my life.
College Freshman,4,I want to work in a lab and do cancer research
College Freshman,4,IT was so much fun
College Sophomore,4,I have never felt unsafe on campus and am extremely comfortable walking alone at night. There is always a security presence at all hours of the day and night. I have never experienced or known anyone who has experienced any form of crime on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms vary extremely depending on what college you belong to, but every dorm and college has an amazing community of people that it really doesn't matter where you live as long as you are with those people. Each college has their own amazing amenities such as a gym, late night snack store, theaters, and other unique amenities. The housing process is relatively straight forward and not a huge topic of drama or hassle."
College Student,4,Yale feels very safe and was easy to get use to.
College Student,4,Yale has many opportunities for on campus jobs and internships.
College Student,4,The professors are always very accommodating and intelligent.
College Student,4,I think that on campus living is very convenient.
College Student,4,Sports are a big part of my schooling as I play on the women's ice hockey team. The school spirit is outstanding and we have a lot of support with our courses while being away for games.
College Freshman,4,"You're in New Haven, which isn't the safest city, but Yale does a lot to make sure you feel safe and secure.  Security guards are everywhere.  Yale itself is relatively isolated from the surrounding city.  You'll be fine if you just follow regular common sense safety rules."
College Freshman,4,I mean it's Yale...it's exactly what you'd expect it to be.  Not much else to say here
College Freshman,4,"The residential college system really does provide a great community.  And there are a lot of amenities in each college.  Buildings are old though, and rooms are small/not very well kept."
College Freshman,4,"I'm in a sorority, and I really like it.  We have lots of mixers and parties to go to.  My only complaint is that it's not as satisfying (as far as making actual friends goes) as I expected it would be."
College Freshman,4,You learn something new from every person you meet here!
College Student,4,There is next to no crime or assault on the campus. I feel very safe at Yale.
College Student,4,The school spirit is very high. The coaches are amazing and their is great team performance.
College Freshman,4,"good facilities, less good teams"
College Freshman,4,I think it is great but I do not live on campus and never have
College Freshman,4,"I have not yet started at Yale but my experience interviewing and doing the admissions day was fantastic, and I have total faith in the faculty. I can't wait to start."
College Freshman,4,"people go to yale for the academic quality, but athletics are still great"
College Freshman,4,Some of the professors could make their classes more interesting.
College Freshman,4,"There could be some improvements, but overall, living at Yale is great!"
College Freshman,4,"It is a great school, especially if you plan to major in humanities or simply want to have  a broad, wonderful education."
College Freshman,4,Generally very safe. New Haven is not the best but there are Yale police and secured buildings. Generally good.
College Freshman,4,"Freshman dorms are far away from science classes, but are nice rooms."
College Freshman,4,School spirit is more around the school as a whole than the athletics program
College Junior,4,I love this place. I would gladly choose it again.
College Junior,4,"I love it. I would choose it again. It's been a home away from home. Of course, there have been some problems, but no school is perfect (and no home is perfect either)."
College Sophomore,4,"Be smart, and you'll be fine. Most of the lines about New Haven being a ""bad city"" are just racist/classist/stupid. Yale Police and Security are great, and as long as you're personally aware and don't do anything dumb, New Haven is very safe and is a great city to live in."
College Sophomore,4,"Had a rough time with some intro STEM classes, but have had the best time in social science classes. Awesome profs, TAs, variety of courses, variety of seminars v lectures. Hard to get into seminars but great when you do."
College Sophomore,4,"Can't say too much here, but pretty confident in the career office services here to assist in job/internship prospects."
College Sophomore,4,Very safe - but poor mental health services
College Sophomore,4,"You definitely have to take initiative, but there are amazing resources"
College Sophomore,4,"As someone in a sorority, I love it, but it still has its flaws"
College Sophomore,4,SILLIMAN IS THE BOMB DIGGITY
College Sophomore,4,"Yep, it's hard. It should be. But for everything that is frustrating, there is a lot more that makes it all worth it.

Frustrating things: really rough intro STEM courses, getting into popular seminars, res colleges can make living with friends not in college difficult, shopping period is insanity, freshman advising isn't set up well, working with distributional requirements, sometimes Yale as an institution (i.e. Yale Corporation) is s***ty

Amazing things: people people all the people, friends, most professors, most TAs, post-freshman-year advisors, most things about the residential college system, dining hall staff, dining hall food, living spaces, extracurriculars holy PANTS BATMAN (service, politics, music, theatre, literally anything you can think of), engaging courses, insane course variety, requirements exist but there are no gen-eds, student activism, amazing student responses to s***ty situations, people compete with themselves not each other, generally very chill loving friendly non-competitive passionate student body"
College Freshman,4,"The culture here is that there can be a large separation between the athletes and ""narps"" or non-athletic regular people. While this divide can be frustrating, the sports culture otherwise is great. Some sports are better attended than others, such as Hockey and Basketball. It would be better if the football field were closer to campus."
College Freshman,4,It's hard to find your place but people here are generally pretty open and so a lot of opportunities to make friends and try new things are available.
College Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere at Yale. It has so many interesting and fun things going on, and is also strong in academics."
Alum,2,My classes went online after the COVID pandemic hit. The professors tried but there really was not enough guidance from the university and the transition was shaky at best.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is more or less nonexistent on campus, only about one in ten are greek and the culture here makes it so that they don't except oddly fratty guys n gals"
College Sophomore,2,We don't win very often. Still fun to go and watch.
College Freshman,2,New Haven is not the safest place to live on your own for the first time.
College Freshman,2,"There are only a couple of sororities and they're pretty hard to get into. There are a lot of frats, though."
College Freshman,2,Most people here don't care about sports at all...
College Freshman,2,"It took me several attempts to get a financial aid package, which was supposed to be enough to allow me to pay for school without a loan. However, I still needed to take a loan in order to pay tuition."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Literally went through undergrad without going to a single frat party, and I think the same was true for a bunch of my friends. The Yale equivalent of Greek life is actually a cappella."
College Sophomore,2,"There's no huge parties. But everyone is out at night being loud and drunk. Actively participating isn't great, but then not participating and being subjected to those who are is also not great."
College Sophomore,2,There are only three sororities. The fraternities are basically associated with the athletic teams.
College Sophomore,2,"The social scene is super fun as a freshman! It just gets a little old as you're here for longer - not as many options as there should be. I mean, New Haven is no Boston or NY."
College Junior,2,"I've definitely found my car to be useful, especially for grocery store trips. Parking on the street can add up, and they hand out tickets pretty diligently."
College Sophomore,2,"Because we don't have strong varsity teams, there is a lack of support. Exception include Mens Ice Hockey and the Harvard-Yale football game (which we always lose). IM's are largely attended by freshmen and club sports are  not funded so they remain relatively unimportant."
College Freshman,2,Hard to find parking near campus.
College Freshman,2,"Cold, rainy, humid and mehhh...."
College Freshman,2,"The weather is pretty awful and there isn't much to do in New Haven, but Yale campus is really all you need!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"I never had a car on campus myself, but I heard so many horror stories of break-ins that I don't think I ever would bring a car to New Haven."
College Sophomore,2,It's cold and gray often
College Sophomore,2,Sports don't get enough attention
College Sophomore,2,"School is expensive and as long as the federal government allows for schools to charge the max to students, they will continue to be drowned in student loans for the rest of their lives.  There is no accountability or sense of responsibility from school administrators of the impact of their budgets being paid out on the backs of their student body."
College Junior,2,Lots of Dell computers that do not work very well - sometimes they run out of disk space too
College Freshman,2,"Okay, I'm from the South, like extremely southern, like coastal southern, and that probably makes me biased. However, it's freezing in the winter. I mean FREEZING. I've never felt cold like this in my entire life. I mean, finally seeing snow for the first time was awesome, but then it NEVER WENT AWAY. It's not enough to make me regret the decision to attend this school, but let's just say I don't leave the dorm much when it's winter."
College Junior,2,"The school does a relatively good job protecting students, but unfortunately the school is located in a very bad town."
College Freshman,2,"Weather in New Haven can be pretty dreary sometimes. We're really close to the ocean so it rains a lot. Weather is really bipolar. It snows an average amount but once the weather turns nice, everyone comes to hang out outside."
College Senior,2,"All of it is metered, and actual parking lots are few and far between. That said, if you are looking for one on the average day, you can find a place easily enough. Most students on campus don't have cars, and rent zip cars if/when they need one."
College Senior,2,"There are many apartment options, but they are expensive, and New Haven, like any city, can be dangerous at night. Besides that, the on campus housing is amazing. There are 12 residential colleges, and all have their own dinning hall, computer lab, library, laundry room, gym, dance studios, and some kind of art room. In addition some have pottery rooms, basketball courts, climbing walls, book binderies, dark rooms and so much more."
College Sophomore,2,"For faculty diversity, I would drop the grade to F"
College Freshman,2,"Having not lived in a city that has four distinct seasons before, it has been a little rough getting used to having to layer up in the winter. As long as you bring a heavy coat and snow boots, you should be fine. And make sure to check the weather before you go outside. Just because the sun is out doesn't mean it's above freezing."
College Freshman,2,Nobody really cares much about sports at Yale. Yale doesn't offer scholarships for Athletes and the only games people care about are against Harvard.
College Freshman,2,"Not too much too look forward too, but not terrible. There are bigger draws on campus."
College Senior,2,"Everything is metered, and the cops around there are pretty harsh about handing out tickets."
College Senior,2,"It's Fine – There's nothing special with Greek life -- although they have parties occasionally, it is not a big thing to be in a fraternity or a sorority."
College Junior,2,"Drug Lack of Safety – There is not enough policy enforcement. There has been at least one alcohol or drug-related death reported in the last 2 years. But you don't need to worry about peer pressure, so this is not something you necessarily need to worry about."
College Freshman,2,"Very Lax Administration – Alcohol and drug policy enforcement is very lax. When you arrive as freshmen, the administrators will essentially tell you that they don't expect to be able to stop people from drinking, and won't punish it, but encourage you to get in contact with them if you feel you or someone else is at risk of serious health or academic problems.  It doesn't seem like it would be difficult to get alcohol-- in my residential college (and most others, I think), there are groups of students who stock up and spam everyone's email accounts with information on how to get some from them during ""alcohol-free"" events like Spring Fling, dances, or residential college events. Pre-gaming is a big part of the culture (not just games or dances-- some people drink before big tests, too.)  There are always events going on without alcohol, though, so you can avoid it. I haven't run across too many people who use drugs recreationally, but I have known several who use drugs to focus, study, de-stress, etc.  Again,the administration is pretty lax with enforcing rules on drugs, even when there are health risks to other students."
College Freshman,2,"There If You Want It, but Don't Bother – Doesn't affect the lives of most students, but can stir up controversy for its own sake."
College Sophomore,2,"Most Students Live on-Campus – Relatively few students live off-campus. With a chance to live basically in a tricked-out castle in the residential colleges, who would want to go through the expensive hassle of finding an apartment close enough to campus?"
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty Sparse – There are a few frats that throw parties. Other than that, you wouldn't know they exist."
College Sophomore,2,"New Haven is not a particularly safe place. The driving is terrible and there is little to no interaction between students and New Haven residents-the divide between Yale areas of New Haven and other areas is startling. Most students I know stay within Yale and don't do much exploring of the area. I think people should do more exploring (though not at night) because there are a lot of interesting parks, restaurants, and community service organizations off campus."
College Senior,2,It's New England – I'm from California.  It snows here and gets cold.  The worst is when the snow starts melting and then freezes into giant grey clumps along the sidewalk.
College Sophomore,2,"Our Teams Are Pretty Good...But No One Cares – From what I read in the newspapers, we have some pretty good teams. Volleyball, soccer, sailing, hockey...all good. But I don't know of anyone who makes an effort to see games or keep up on statistics. We are really involved in IMs though. People are really into IM sports, more so than even major events like football games."
College Sophomore,1,Greek life isn't very big. There's not really a point to being in a frat/sorority here
College Sophomore,1,I would not recommend venturing off campus in New Haven
Recent Alumnus,1,"This isn't true of all fraternities, but there are a couple (DKE, Zeta Psi) who consistently, at least once or twice a year, behave in a way that publicly degrades women. It embarrasses the University and contributes to a hostile environment for women on campus."
College Junior,1,It's New Haven - enough said
College Junior,1,The dating scene is absolutely abysmal. Most guys only want to hookup
College Junior,1,"The Sun Never Shines – The sun never shines in New England during the academic year and the ""snow-pocalypse"" that comes every winter is pretty terrible."
College Junior,1,"The food quality claims to be wonderful, but the bread can be stale or even moldy. The food program is mandatory during some years, and it is always overpriced. There are no options outside of the dining hall system. Unlike some campuses, there are no alternative restaurants or food places where one might use meal points or card swipes. Definitely not worth the money or the hassle."
College Senior,1,"We are good at a few preppy sports--squash, crew, etc. However, Yale is not really good at any of the main sports: Football, basketball, etc. Additionally, the administration does not really support athletics, so athletics are a rather small part of campus life. Jocks often hang out together, and rarely will you see anyone attend a football game except for Harvard-Yale."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't Bring a Car! It's very costly and unnecessary since there is so much public transportation (campus shuttles, buses, trains, etc). And there is not a lot of parking available!!!"
College Freshman,1,"Distinctly Underwhelming – For all the fuss about the quality of Yale's housing, I simply don't rate it. Freshman dorms are universally mediocre to poor; expect to be sharing a bathroom with six or seven others, and expect outdated rooms that haven't been refurbished in years. Farnam, Durfee, Lawrance and Welch are the best, but still aren't impressive, whilst Vanderbilt is refurbished but tiny. Bingham is mixed, and Lanman-Wright unacceptable. College housing is better, but that isn't saying much: there are far too many doubles throughout. Many justify the housing by saying that other places have it worse; I don't doubt that, but that doesn't make Yale's facilities good.

If Yale stopped pretending that its housing was fantastic, perhaps it could improve it. Living environment is integral to personal happiness, and for over $55,000 a year I simply expect better."
College Freshman,1,"Not Exactly the Nicest Place in the World – There's not much going on in New Haven. It's not a very safe place, and everything important or interesting is in some way connected to Yale."
College Sophomore,1,"No one comes to New Haven for the weather. I have lived in the New Haven area my whole life, and would like to move to a nicer climate upon graduation. New Haven is intermittently cold, but the cold is not the problem: the problem are the gray, cloudy skies, which show up with irritating regularity. Expect a lot of rain and many days that start off sunny and turn cloudy. There is also little to no horizon in New Haven. Also, when it snows, don't expect classes to be canceled. Weather gets better come mid-April and May, just when everyone is studying for finals."

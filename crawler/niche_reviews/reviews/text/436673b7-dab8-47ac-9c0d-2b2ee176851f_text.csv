Freshman,5,Although we're in a pandamecic the school has been a great support system in achieving my goals and getting good grades.
Sophomore,5,"Yes I take all my classes online. I actually really like it. It maybe confusing at first but once you get a hang of it, it is quite easy."
Junior,5,It’s been good I actually enjoyed the online learning better since there were less distractions but I can’t wait to be back with my friends.
Sophomore,5,This college has assisted me in evolving as a human being. Within one year of being there I gained long term relationships and of coursr credits. I am now a sophmore at just 18.
Senior,5,I truly love my HBCU! The experience there has been great. I am an uprising senior at the Edward Waters College on a volleyball scholarship and a academic scholarship and I am truly happy that I got to enjoy my college journey so far with this school.
Senior,5,"Oh waters college is the first  HBCU in the state of Florida. The campus life and the scenery of this institution isn’t as up to par as it should be however, the administration staff and faculty as well as the president is working diligently to improve the phase of the campus."
Senior,5,Edward Waters College is a nice small college for kids who are going to be first generation college students. With its small campus you can easily get to your classes on time and also the class size is small so it won’t be hard for your professor to notice you. The faculty are always there to help the students alongside with the alumni. The thing I would like to see change at Edward Waters College are the majors. I feel like the college should have more majors so that students can choose their path to their purpose in life.
Junior,5,Edward Waters makes me feel like I have a family and it has helped me in so many areas especially when I had became distracted!!! The professors are able to assist one on one!!!! There are many areas to help you academically
Freshman,5,Overall this school is great. The teachers honestly do care about your education and make you want to be there. The environment is very safe because we have security throughout the whole school. The president has speakers to come to the school to talk to us and give us motivation. We have church on Wednesdays which is great because we can keep the lord on our side so he can give us strength to take us through college. We are an hbcu so we are all family and love each other dearly And all wish to help each other succeed.
Niche User,5,At this college they make sure you have the tools needed to build a bright future. The involvment of the teachers there is amazing.
Freshman,5,"They help a lot, they want to make sure that the students are getting the help that they need and be successful in thiers life careers. Its a great school with great opportunities as long as you keep focus on your goal."
Junior,5,Edward Waters College is one of the best private religious college. Very small campus in a local community.
Sophomore,5,Some of the things I enjoy about EWC is that they have staff that cares as well as a great campus that actually cares about students well beings. Also I love how They actually give back to the students by having a building just for free and donated clothes for those who struggle financially.
Senior,5,Edward Waters is definitely dedicated to ensuring that it's students gain the education necessary to become an asset in the professional working society. Their teachers and faculty are deeply involved in their students martriculation  and go above and beyond to be involved in their college experience.
Niche User,5,"I would say i have a lot of experience in everything like dance, art, basketball, football, swimming and also love working in groups i feel that i would more understand things when i would need help i would have my teammates to help me when needed. Although i Feel that Edwards water is the college i would love to be apart of cause i feel that i would learn much more that i don't know and also meeting new people and roommates."
Freshman,5,This is an amazing school where everyone is like family and we all get the help we need to succeed. We are a smaller college then others so everyone knows each other and you can really get the help you need from your teachers and staff when you need it. I would recommend this school to anyone wanting to attend an HBCU ! 
College Freshman,5,Mr.Stark is great at doing his job and providing jobs.

College Sophomore,5,They're really helpful with academics and more
Freshman,4,"At Edward Waters College, online courses are widely used in colleges providing easy access to course materials, classroom discussions, and feedback to instructors. The course materials and activities may be accessed from any computer, whether it is from the University or from the comfort of your own home."
Freshman,4,"My experience has been great so far, a few of my professors have live classes in in place of the times that we would meet, as if we were physically present."
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are very understand since this is a new change for both the students and teachers. Classes seem very safe and good. Only thing is, is that since I’m a transfer, it’s hard for me to adjust the way they do online because I’m use to doing blackboard for online and they use moodle which is kind of more difficult than blackboard so right now I’m just trying to get a hang of it."
Sophomore,4,"I like how everyone is friendly and nice. The teachers, administration and etc. are very welcoming and makes you feel at home. For check-in they gave us a lot of free goodies like a shirt, custom school mask, gloves and more.The campus is a little confusing though but you get used to it."
Junior,4,I love everything about my hbcu. I love all the people that I’ve met that are helping me get to my goal.
Senior,4,My experience at Edward Waters college has not been to bad expected a little more from it but so far i am enjoying it. The school is good could be better but like i said so far i have enjoyed it. I played football for 2 years and it was a great experience. Now I'm so close to graduating and that is something I'm very proud to have achieved at this school.
Sophomore,4,"Even though I am only a sophomore, I've encountered many problems here. But I think the good outweigh the bad. It's what you make it in the end. If you get involved and learn whatever you're really interested in than you'll be fine."
Senior,4,"I love the fact that Edward Waters college is a small institution. This makes all of the relationships personal. Edward Waters is under new management and thing are changing for the better. Sports are getting better, food is getting better, academics are getting better, and student life in general is prospering."
Freshman,4,I like how diverse it is. I have learned about my heritage and culture and how to apply to everyday situations. I have learned from my peers and teachers from different social backgrounds and economies of life.
Freshman,4,It’s my first year here at Edward Waters and I already feel at home. My dorm mates are like my family away from home. We look out for each other. The staff here is wonderful and the students are very helpful and friendly.
Freshman,4,Edward Waters College is a nice school. I wish they would change the dorms and give out more verity of foods. Overall pretty chilled.
Sophomore,4,This is a great school if your athletic or can play an instrument or can sing and the classes are really easy but still on a college level
Freshman,4,Edward Waters gave me everything I needed to study in Criminal Justice. the college is small and intimate and makes themselves available for one on one counseling when needed
Freshman,4,I liked the small class room setting and that the city is investing the the schools football program. Would like for them to expand there class course options. More food options late nights.
Sophomore,4,I like it at Edward waters college coming from Baltimore city and have the chance to go to school out of state is a blessing I'm proud to go to Edward waters college class of 2020
Niche User,4,Great experience at this HBCU but the one thing i would like to see improve is the price of the school. Seeing that it is a private College it is kind of expensive.
Junior,4,"Edward Waters College is a historically black college located in Jacksonville, FL.  I like this college because it offers smaller classroom settings which allow more time for one on one assistance with the professor.  I am majoring in Psychology and my professors demonstrate concern in my ability to learn and grow as student and person.   EWC also have a police sub-station located on campus for any parents concerned about safety.  The staff and administrators are very knowledgeable in their fields"
College Freshman,4,Very big greek life at the school.
College Freshman,4,"It's been different going to college when no one else in my family has been to college and I'm trying very hard but it will a,L be worth it in the end when all is said and done"
College Junior,4,it's okay besides the fact the the professors who don't speak English really do not speak English so sometimes it's hard to understand some of them
College Junior,4,"Greek life pretty much runs the school, the organizations are great it's just some of the people in them aren't"
College Student,4,The one time I went to a game was a basketball game. It was a great turn out.
College Student,4,"Although Edward Waters was not my first pick, I have came to actually enjoy and like my HBCU. Its small, so the professors can actually focus on the students, your not just a number to them. All the staff wants is for you to succeed, its like a family. Even though the students do not particpate in everything they still try to make our college exprenice a great one."
College Freshman,4,"I'm in the choir and the experience with travel, seeing new cities and states and the people excepting what you are giving them is a feeling"
College Freshman,4,Our security on campus doesn't do a good job. It is like they walk by and they do not tell people that are not suppose to be on campus to leave.
College Freshman,4,My Overall Experience would be good. It could be better but I am grateful for being here.
College Freshman,4,"My school has it's pros and cons. I get a lot out of the program itself, but it is just the rest of the school that is not that great."
College Freshman,4,Being apart of the basketball team had allowed me to stay focused on school and grow in popularity. I really enjoy the student activities here.
College Junior,4,The financial aid experience for the most part runs smoothly. They are always there to help you whenever you need it and they even have a Facebook page that always have a fast reply.
College Student,4,I honestly feel safe on campus. I just do not like walking alone at night because who knows what can happen in this type of area.
College Senior,4,"I am currently enrolled in Edward Waters College, and the education environment is fairly meaningful. The professors are very helpful with students, and the small classrooms give students frequent one on one time with their professors."
College Senior,4,The program I am currently enrolled in has taught me so much. I enjoy every minute being here. After college I plan to further my knowledge in a computer systems intern surely after graduation.
College Junior,4,"We have a community friendly based campus which is open to the community freely. We have a fun Student Union Building which has fun and games, we also have events for everyone to enjoy different lifestyles and cultures, our school is in a city of three profesional championship teams."
College Junior,4,"In our CJU department we are honored students to be taking advantage of each and every oppurtnity we face. I truly enjoy being in this department because of the authentic compassion shown by the professors and department heads. In our department we strive for an average GPA of 2.5- 3.0, our professors expects us to turn in all work not one minute late or it'll be denied, our department is currently getting a brand new building constructed right now, and most graduates have been employed within the field, and I'm looking forward to working with these juvenile delinquent boys."
College Junior,4,"I plan on interning on this upcoming semester with a program called Black Male Explores, which is a mentoring program where college students mentor deliquent juveniles. I plan on doing this to gain more experience in the field of dealing with these kids."
College Junior,4,"The process for me getting into my major was not a difficult thing. I choose Criminal Justice over Biology, Education, and Mass Communication which was a easy decision due to the fact I grew up in a place that lacked a Justice System but had plenty of criminals to flood any jail. Only challenges that I first encountered in Criminal Justice Department was how strict they were on staying and being professinally inclined, and our appearance of looking like a Criminal Justice major students. Which I quickly adapted to wearing slacks and ties more often. I would say the most important criteria in being admitted in the Criminal Justice Department is soely nothing more than hard work and dedication. Our CJU program has a simple application that every student must fill out. Our program accepts everyone that works hard and that is dedicated to their futures."
College Junior,4,"As an Criminal Justice major, Edward Waters College has developed me into a new person that has reflection of our CJU department. The professors, and departments heads all are motivators as a whole unit. If had a choice of doing it over again I woulud still choose Criminal Justice because this is where my heart is destined. My career s goals are to first attain my B.A. degree, and also continue to work with juveniles but eventually have my own program. My concerns pertaining to my job oppurtunities after I graduate are minimal as of now, but I have some resources that I'm Keeping in contact with that could possibly be a job oppurtunity."
College Sophomore,4,The academics are very well scheduled and everything works like a clock. The teachers have no problem helping you out after class hours and are very supportive and also help students network.
College Junior,4,"They Are Strict but It Is Good – They have security, they make sure no smoking or drinking on the campus. They tell us to attend Chapel on Wednesdays, and they make it a criteria to take a religion class."
College Sophomore,4,Greeks often host parties and have events on the yard. most people are inspired to join a Greek organization by their on-campus involvement.
Freshman,2,"In class, the experience is pretty good, but all that money we are paying for room and board, the dorms are horrible, looks like a prison cell. It also has the worst WIFI ever, it crashes every 5 minutes. In the bathrooms, the showers barely have hot water."
Sophomore,2,"When I first got to EWC, I was excited but as I actually started classes, my perspective changed. I had a hard time understanding what my teachers were saying. If there were events on campus, I never knew because the communication is bad. Also, it's very unorganized. I don't really connect with any of my professors and I'm planning on transferring to another college."
Junior,2,"I like the people and some staff at Edward Waters College. I would like to see the dorms, food, teaching style, and look of the school change."
Junior,2,"Have to make the most of it.  Fun student body with caring teachers, always something to do in jacksonville."
Sophomore,2,My experience with the school has not always be good due to the finances office. The teachers and resources help out with the planning of career after graduation with certifications.
College Freshman,2,I feel like more work could be done to prepare students for after college.
College Freshman,2,Everything except the honors village is pretty bad
College Student,2,The need to rebuild. The freshman dorms are to small.
College Sophomore,2,its far away and the prices are high.
College Sophomore,2,there are not manyplaces to party except clubs
College Sophomore,2,they need more places to eat.
College Sophomore,2,need more options and selections
College Sophomore,2,it needs alot of work.
College Junior,2,We don't have parties like that because the students don't know how to act
College Junior,2,"The meals are repetitive, and the quality is some timing ,"
College Junior,2,"The off campus housing wishing close proximity is terrible , the cost of living is low around the school but I'm a person that believes in quality not quantity."
College Junior,2,"The only option near school are fast food; like checkers, Burger King etc. You have to drive away from campus ten or fifteen minuets to enjoy dinning."
College Junior,2,"The school is in a low income area so there are no stores or restaurants near by, you would have to drive about ten to fifteen minuets to reach a rural area."
College Junior,2,It's not as promenade as a bigger HBCU.
College Sophomore,2,"Many times you can never get signal what so ever, not even when you are in your dorms. We have been complaining but it has never been fixed."
Freshman,1,"The teachers and the instruction are great but communication and staying updated with the administration and other services, can be difficult."
College Junior,1,"The price you have to pay for on campus living should be cut in half, also the ""dorms"" are no co-ed. The spacing in the room are bad especially as an athlete and you have to share a room that won't accommodate the amount of clothe you or your Roomate has."
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have a car, you will find yourself paying a lot of money for a bus or cab."
College Freshman,1,"Weightlifting materials are horrible, benches torn and molded, no AC rusted weights and bars cracked mirrors, broken machines. Football locker room is a trailer."
College Freshman,1,"The dorms are horrible. 

1.very old, they made us sign waivers saying they are not responsible if you get sick from the lead in the paint throughout the dorms. 

2. MOLD MOLD MOLD!!!

3. RA's are very very very rude

The cafeteria food is horrible!!! Dishes are constantly dirty, food sometimes served undercooked/raw, sometimes it's overcooked/burnt, the best meal is breakfast, and even that sometimes is bad!"
College Sophomore,1,Their housing has mold and is lacking in space
College Sophomore,1,They told me that I am ineligible for financial aid but yet only one of my parents work. 
College Sophomore,1,I am terrified to walk alone and the fact that it is an open campus makes it easier for something to happen.
College Junior,1,We do not have off-campus housing.
College Sophomore,1,"For my school off-campus living isnt very well known,not many students live off capmpus being that its pretty far away and it could be costly."
College Freshman,1,"The schools fails to have things for the students to do on campus. I can count on one hand the amount of activities they provided for the students for the whole year. The only time the school have activties is only if it is followed by something else. Such as homecoming, or voting for the next president for the students."
College Junior,1,"With our campus not being very spread out and big, parking is very limited on our campus. Most times you're lucky to find a spot on the side of the road. If you do not early you are surely out of luck."
College Junior,1,My School – I wouldn't choose my school again if i could do it all over again. They treat us like little kids. No kind of freedom. They need to rebuild dorms and more activities.
College Junior,1,"Too Strict – At Ewc we the policy is no girls/boys in the opposite sex room. If caught you are kicked out of school. It's really not that serious, being that we are grown and in college we should at least have a little freedom"

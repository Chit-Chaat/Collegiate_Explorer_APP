Freshman,5,"My online experiences have gone very smoothly so far. All of my professors are straightforward and tell you exactly what is needed if you ask for it. The online portal is confusing at first but is super easy to navigate, Overall, I absolutely love the the experience and flow of online classes at KSU."
Freshman,5,"The experiences that I have had on campus have been exceptional! The Student Rec Center is amazing with several options for new and exciting hobbies to choose from. The food on campus has a wide variety of options with great local options off campus as well. The overall look is very modern and is constantly being improved upon. In all, KSU is a great campus with a lot of extracurricular  activities to enjoy."
Senior,5,"Though classes online may appear to be more difficult with the lack of face-to-face instruction, the professors I have had offered much support in all areas that I have needed. They are very accommodating and accessible throughout the course."
Freshman,5,"I love the professional virtual meetings they have for transfer and upcoming freshmen. The virtual open house was a success and they had all the meetings well organized. During the meetings, they answer the questions that the freshmen or transfers have. They make you feel welcomed from the meeting just like we had an actual in-person tour. Kennesaw provided me with enough information about my major.  When I went up to Kennesaw, the campus looked beautiful and it made me want to go to Kennesaw."
Freshman,5,Pretty professional and I was satisfied with what they did this year. They made me feel like I was actually at Kennesaw.
Freshman,5,my experience online has been great. very easy program. teachers know how to use the program as well which is nice
Freshman,5,"the teachers are super helpful the environment is very safe and theres alwaqsy things going on, on campus"
Senior,5,Online classes are pretty easy. The platform is not hard and most professors are understanding. I like the flexibility it gives me.
Senior,5,"I love Kennesaw! The campus is so nice and everyone is friendly. Thereâ€™s a lot to do in the area. The cost of living and school fees are quite high, but not much different than other colleges."
Sophomore,5,I'm currently an online student. I love the convienence and enjoy my classes! The instructors are available when I need them.
Sophomore,5,Kennesaw worked overtime to help me get enrolled in my classes and importing my transcripts due to me being a late enrollee.
Freshman,5,"its neat but due to the pandemic there really isn't much to be able to do, but there are good professors."
Freshman,5,"I have taken online classes, they sufficiently relay and teach the necessary curriculum that would normally be taught physically."
Senior,5,"So far, my experience has been a mixed bag. When we went online in the spring, I withdrew, because the professors were just as disoriented as we were. I don't hold that against them- we were all going through the same thing. with that said, I returned for the summer and fall semesters, and so far they have really brought their A-game. As quick as they've had to learn everything, I think they're doing an excellent job."
Freshman,5,"This is the place to beðŸ’¯ As soon as you step on campus, you feel at home. Its the best of both worlds as far as large and small campuses go. It an outstanding campus with a close community feel. The people, the places, the food... What's not to love here.If you come here, I promise you won't regret it."
Junior,5,KSU is very diverse and a great school. There is a lot of things to do on campus and the environment is very welcoming. There is lots of fun clubs to join and be a part of. The professor are very friendly and understanding.
Junior,5,I have taken a lot of online classes here at KSU and they are great. The professors online make sure they give you the information you need to finish the course. It is very organized and easy to navigate. If you have a question you can email them or attend office hours.
Freshman,5,Many of the other students are still trying to get in touch with their classmates to make new friends. The professors are understanding that some students learn better/worse over computer.
Freshman,5,It's truly a beautiful campus. The professors are extremely understanding especially with online classes!
Sophomore,5,I am taking 3 online courses so far they are more of a teach yourself course however i am enjoying them and learning much from the presentations. everything can be found on D2L and is easily accessible.

Junior,5,Kennesaw is a great school.  It's got the perfect mixture of campus life for on campus residents and commuter options as well so everyone feels a pay off the owl community.  The staff members are so nice and helpful I have yet to have a complaint.
Freshman,5,It is a very good school. Teachers and atmosphere are excellent. The enviorment is a friendly. I enjoy my time and feel like the transition to college will be very smooth
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my experience at Kennesaw State University for several reasons. One reason is the numerous opportunities for a community the campus offers. They have many student organizations and campus ministries. They also have done an excellent job with class sizing. I have never stepped foot in a class where I didn't end up unknown by the teacher or students in my proximity. I thoroughly enjoy being a part of a school that sees students and creates opportunities for them to connect with others. From organizations reaching out in person to emails sent through our school email about campus events and ways to plug in, KSU has done well in seeking to include every student."
Sophomore,5,"They had a bumpy start like all other schools when the virus hit, but they were quick on their feet and able to pull it all together. The school made sure our professors were reaching out to us and checking in. They have done an excellent job maintaining educational standards while also catering to everyone's needs and challenges that come with online learning."
Freshman,5,"Everyone on the Kennesaw Campus will immediately make you feel at home, they'll do their best to make you feel comfortable, safe and make sure you get the best college experience you can! They have a wide array of majors, so there's a diverse amount of people you'll be able to meet! The campus is beautiful, and you are always able to find something fun to do and meet new people!"
Freshman,5,"I haven't taken any online classes, but I've heard that the professors and their classes are just as good as the in person classes!"
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school! Professors want to teach, and students want to learn. Very friendly environment. All buildings and dorms are very clean."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, Kennesaw State University is very organized. There are many things to do on campus such as clubs, theater performances, and etc. Attending KSU will be an experience and adjusts to different student personalities."
Senior,5,Didn't think I would like a smaller school at first but it ended up being a great choice.  Most classes you can really connect with the professor and there are plenty of opportunities for research.
Senior,5,Online courses were much easier than in person courses. Would recommend for people try to get a degree while working/ having other important commitments. The only issue is there are limited choices for the courses in upper level STEM electives.
Freshman,5,Very helpful with all my questions and very timely in their responses. The campus is beautiful and there are plenty of dining options.
Freshman,5,I havenâ€™t taken any online courses yet. However my fellow peers have and they felt like they were well prepared for the class. And the professors were just as supportive as a face to face class.
Freshman,5,Kennesaw State University is a hidden gem. Youâ€™re always kept in the loop with everything related to your success at this school. Everyone is willing to help you no matter what.
Freshman,5,"great college experience so far, they were very helpful when it came to applying and answering questions!"
Freshman,5,"Currently enrolled to be an online student in fall 2020, so far the enrollment and class schedule has been great."
Junior,5,"If you were good at being on top of things, I would like to say that online classes are for you. Without the face to face teaching, a lot of the responsibility falls onto yourself. I have taken a few amazing online professors who sent weekly emails to keep the class on track, so I am grateful for that. Although they can be more expensive, I can say online classes are definitely worth it if you are given the opportunity."
Junior,5,"Learning online is what I'm used to, so the whole COVID-19 situation didn't change much for me. Profs are very helpful and supportive and they provide thorough materials. Not al are the best at communicating, but that's what RateMyProfessor.com is for!"
Sophomore,5,"Kennesaw state university is an amazing school to be social and find new friends. learning is of course the main focus. With amazing school resources to help aid student life, learning, studying, and making new friends is an amazing experience! Kennesaw is the place to be for new opportunities and finding what you're passionate about for a career choice. So many professors and people will want to genuinely help you find your way and guide you to what you need."
Sophomore,5,"I am taking my first online classes this summer, but from what I have hear they are really great and the professors are very helpful."
Sophomore,5,"I have been wanting to go to KSU since the beginning of high school, and now that I am in I have been nothing up satisfied with everything revolving KSU."
Freshman,5,I donâ€™t take any classes online but I heard if you do take classes online itâ€™s fun and sometimes easy to learn.
Freshman,5,Great staff members and teachers. Highly recommended. The housing at KSU are fully furnished and the neighbors are nice. The food on campus is very good. The transportation to and from classes are very convenient. Everything is close to eachother.
Junior,5,"Since going back to school as a single mom, I opted for online classes. It has been a seamless process to getting adjusted and the professors have been fantastic!"
Junior,5,I have had the best experience with everyone at KSU! I decided to go back to school After 10 years and they have made the process extremely seamless!
Senior,5,"Kennesaw State University is the perfect University, for working adults, who wish to go back to school. They offer a great selection of online degree programs. The classes are interesting and provide a great online learning environment. KSU online program allows you the opportunity to balance school, work, homelife."
Alum,5,"I loved online learning at Kennesaw. It came in handy to do so, especially with working internships and on campus jobs."
Junior,5,"diversity, great team, high perform professors. I like the environment and the school locations, clean and full with many trees"
Freshman,5,KSU is a great place to study and earn a degree from. KSU is also excellent to any aspiring nurse majors due to it's great nursing program and it's outstanding performance review. I am very happy to have entered such a school.
Freshman,5,Kennesaw State University is one of the best schools in the state and some may even argue in the nation. It has great professors who do everything to assure that you understand what is being taught and will be strict to put you back on the right track. The food there is phenomenal and i have no complaints on the healthy precautions taken there. I would go back to receive my Master's in Science degree whenever i get the chance.
Senior,5,"I have been a Kennesaw all 4 years of college, and I can definitely say I had great experience. I have learned a lot from a lot of great professors. It is such a diverse place and I have grown so much."
Freshman,5,"This university is the best if you are looking for something affordable and low tuition fees. However, their source of transportation is not that great."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely fell in love with the atmosphere, the people, and the staff! Kennesaw has a beautiful campus, with so many things to do and endless opportunities. From the professors to the landscapers, everyone is very caring and willing to help in any way they can!"
Freshman,5,"Although I've never been I've heard great things about the school! Kennesaw is known for its diversity in majors and students, lively campus life, skillful instructors and more! The school brings people from all walks of life. Everyone here comes for a different purpose which is what makes the school so great! When I attend I hope to bring a little more of that energy to Kennesaw!"
Freshman,5,"Kennesaw State has been a welcoming school with professors who truly care for their students. On the campus tour, there was any faculty and staff that would answer any questions, even if they weren't on the tour. They offer help sessions for extra credit and will try their hardest to make your schedule the most convenient for the students."
Senior,5,"As a student athlete at KSU, I really enjoyed my time there. Additionally, the eateries and the housing was amazing."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy its distance from home and how relatively cheap it is. I enjoy the countless clubs and society I have the privilege of joining. Though the campus itself is not as spectacular as others, it offers a home-like feeling keeping students comfortable and content."
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere of the university is lively with several communities within campus to suit various lifestyles. Food is great, lots of opportunities and prestigious pathways to take; overachievers are rewarded with scholarships and programs such as honors cohorts. The dorms are great."
Freshman,5,It feels very much like home and the campus is absolutely beautiful. The people are always happy to help and everyone is so nice.
Alum,5,"My experience with Kennesaw State University was positive. Even when my academics suffered in the beginning, they offered support so that I can finish and graduate."
Senior,4,"My educational experience has been very thorough, and I feel fully equipped for the workforce. The professors have been great, and the quality of my education stands above all others, I have no doubt."
Freshman,4,All of my classes are hybrid or 100% online. Each professor uses their online platforms differently which has led to some confusion in the beginning.
Freshman,4,Kennesaw is a great school with a really nice community. If there was one thing I could change it would be the online and hybrid classes due to covid-19. Starting my freshmen year online was kind of complicated.
Freshman,4,"The online experience is great. The professor do a wonderful job at explaining the new changes, how to access course work, and being transparent. I didn't give a 5 star because there is always room for improvement, however Kennesaw has done a phenominal job at adapting to the pandemic."
Sophomore,4,"KSU has been a great addition to my college experience. As a freshman it was a little scary and I was very unsure of how everything worlds. Quickly I was able to make friends, study groups, use of resources and communicate with my professors. Sporting events were a great place to connect with my peers. I truly enjoyed my first year and look forward to using my new knowledge as a sophomore. Go Owls!"
Sophomore,4,"Overall when the professors communicate well, the online learning portals are made easy to understand."
Senior,4,Professors typically understand online can be more difficult for some and therefore are pretty lenient. Easy access to documents and quizzes/tests through d2l.
Senior,4,Overall good. Classes are easy. Professors typically very knowledgeable and easy going. Some office workers especially financial aid office employees are horrible and lazy. Can be difficult to get involved in school activities. Very affordable.
Junior,4,"Online is good but the Kennesaw computer program is lacking,  in general.  Overall it's a great school though."
Alum,4,Kennesaw State University has grown tremendously in recent years and is a really great school that I am now proud to say I am an alum.
Alum,4,"Kennesaw State University has tons of opportunities to help you grow, you just have to be willing to put yourself out there to join clubs, organizations, etc. Kennesaw is more on the conservative side, which I would love to see change, however, a majority of their staff is really willing to help out their students."
Alum,4,"I didn't take many classes online (maybe like 1 or 2), but the ones that I took in person, there were a good bit of online assignments that were explained very well in class and the professors were knowledgeable in the work they assigned."
Junior,4,Kennesaw is a great school ! A little bit on the pricey side but still great. Excellent food & the campus life is amazing !
Junior,4,Kennesaw is a great school overall. Kinda on the expensive side but itâ€™s still great. Campus life is amazing and the food is excellent!
Sophomore,4,"KSU is a very good school for either online class or in class lectures.  KSU, the professors and other employees actually care about the students and had an overall a good experience my first year."
Sophomore,4,My professor used a learning platform that was easy to navigate. The professors really care about teaching their students. Generally they'll send an email out before class starts and they let the students have a vote/ballet of their concerns and learning preferences.
Senior,4,"Professors are very active online, consistently updating students on the nature of their coursework and upcoming assignments. Most professors were rather knowledgeable with their online tools, making lectures easily understandable and providing relevant study materials afterwards. They have up-to-date technology, such as clear mics and superb webcams. Overall, the online experience at Kennesaw State University has been a very pleasant experience."
Senior,4,"It's a very well managed campus with attentive faculty and very responsive student services. It utilizes in-depth applied learning as opposed to pure theory-directed lectures. The campus has a variety of diverse students and faculty, which I really believe helped me look past my own individualism as well as provide new perspectives and knowledge. Campus events are numerous and very enjoyable, the university does a good job at urging students to interact with one another and make connections. 

Living on-campus provides a fuller example of this, where RA's are always available and ready to assist students as well as striving to foster a sense of community among your fellow students and dorm mates. The food provided on-campus is notably superb, due to a well-regarded dining program as well as a number of private franchised options. Overall, Kennesaw State University is a very pleasant school to attend."
Freshman,4,"At Kennesaw, I definitely enjoyed the dining room. They ha cuisine ranging from breakfast food to Asian, to even pasta and pizza. Basically, the menu is very diverse and the food is extremely delicious. Another thing I like about Kennesaw is the events and organizations they have on campus. The pumpkin launching competition, the beginning of the year block party, and student-led organizations such as NightOwls (we plan events). If there was something I would change, it would be having a mini-fridge in the University Suites."
Freshman,4,"I took chemistry online and it was a bit difficult having to learn more from the books and homework, but my teacher was there if I had any questions. Also, I could relax in my dorm and complete my assignments, study and I had a little more free time."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Kennesaw State University and doubt I can get a better experience anywhere else in Georgia. The top three highlights food is amazing, students are great, and the tuition is affordable."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes are hard for me to keep up with, but all my professors are flexible and understanding. They want you to learn, and they will do what they can to help you. Work load can be overwhelming."
Freshman,4,"I have not taken any courses online but hearing from other students, they seemed to have enjoyed it."
Alum,4,Kennesaw made for a nice school for me to start my learning career. It had enough to offer in terms of student life without being too much of a distraction.
Freshman,4,"I am going to attend KSU this fall of 2020, but from the brief experience I have had with the staff is phenomenal"
Freshman,4,"it is, as far as I can tell, a diverse school. Open and a lot of free space. It has a perfect layout for those who are starting a new life"
Sophomore,4,"The online classes I have taken have been very straight forward and easy to adapt to. The only class I had a tough time transition to online with was lab, and that is a completely understandable reason. Labs are meant to be done in a classroom."
Sophomore,4,"It is very diverse and the campus is beautiful. I wish there were more biology teachers, but overall I have had a great time. I highly recommend going to the commons. They have so many options for food and you can meet a lot of people there. Recently I have been spending most of my time at the gym or library and both are very spacious and accommodating."
Junior,4,So far I really love KSU for my online learning. Professors so far are quick to respond even though they quote a 48-hour time frame to get back to you it has always been within the same day for me. I can't afford to transfer to another school to complete my degree so I am hoping that it works out for the rest of my degree.
Junior,4,"From my college tour, I knew I wanted to attend KSU. Having the chance to leave home and attend a university opened my eyes. KSU for the most part is still a commuter school. After living on campus freshman year, I got to experience the traffic from living on off campus student housing. Socially, I met a lot of my friends through my roommate and it helped me become more outgoing and less shy. Academically, I would like to say I struggled. Being a nursing major was tough and the science classes were tougher. Even though that was the case, I have enjoyed my time here at KSU and developed studying skills that have helped me become a better student today."
Sophomore,4,"I have loved my academic experience at KSU very much! I'm a raising sophomore and my first year was quite full of both learning and extracurricular activities. The sport teams are excellent, there are many opportunities for students to get involved, and the student and teacher populations are quite diverse. Because of these factors, I have been able to make life long friendships and feel confident in my education."
Junior,4,"KSU is a moderately rigorous and high-achieving school. It's relatively cheap for online, but still good quality."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere at Kennesaw. Everything is light and happy on campus; the greens and the trees and bushes are beautiful. There are plenty of spaces with varying degrees of people and noise that makes it perfect to find a place to study alone or with friends. If I could change some things, I would make things more disabled-friendly by having more buttons to open certain doors, like the bathroom or classroom doors. It can be very taxing getting from one place on campus to another, as people often hold doors for me because there are no buttons. That is especially difficult if there are no people around. 
Some professors are not willing to accommodate very much with disability-related absences. Other professors are amazing, kind, and very understanding of my circumstances and are willing to work with me. I love Kennesaw, but they could work a lot harder to accommodate the disabled."
Sophomore,4,The campus is super nice and Iâ€™ve never had issues with professors. The only reason I didnâ€™t give 5 stars is because the traffic flow is really bad at times and I feel it could have been designed better. Thereâ€™s also not enough parking at times which is crazy. Academically this is a fantastic place for school!
Sophomore,4,"I have taken many hybrid classes, and now with coronavirus I have switched fully online. I can't lie, it has been a little bit challenging because doing online school requires self motivation, and being organized. I usually am that type of person and even then I struggled a bit. Depending on the professor with depend on each student's experience. In my personal experience all my professors wanted to help and make sure all their students were able to have online access and made sure to answer student's questions. All in all, as long as you do your part and the professor does theirs, it should be a good experience."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy attending this school very much. Many of the professors that I have had were very great at teaching and cared for the students.
Alum,4,"What I really liked about KSU is that the school itself consists of two campuses. Making it convenient for anyone that lives within the Cobb county district. Both campuses are very different but have a lot to offer and there is good communication between the two. 

For anyone interested in majoring in architecture should really consider attending KSU. The education one receives during the 5 year program is world class as there are great facilities and professors. The Department of Architecture is quickly making headlines as the students that emerge from there are doing big things. 

The program itself is nationally accredited meaning that once you graduate you are eligible to begin the licensure process. As a recent alumni I can say that my experience at Kennesaw State University has been incredible. I've learned a lot and am well prepared for the next chapter of my life."
Senior,4,Kennesaw State University has two locations allowing students to take classes at both campuses. The professors are caring and are willing to help you succeed. The campus environment is clean and has a number of events you can attend.
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Kennesaw. As a black female student, there were many opportunities for me to find on campus employment and use that to my advantage. I also joined several on campus organizations and made life long friends. The dorms were nice and the food was decent, both better than I'd seen at my friends' universities."
Freshman,4,I loved the food and the students. Organizations are  fantastic and gives you many opportunities. The mascot is very entertaining and academics is the priority of the university. Some of the housing is very small but some of the housing is expensive. The  University could work a little better on their communications though.
Sophomore,4,"I loved the classes and the professors. the classes werent too big so you can ask a lot of questions and learn as you want. Something i would change is the cafeteria food, i feel like they need to diversify what they give out every day."
Sophomore,4,"Being at Kennesaw there's always going to be something for you to do, you'll never get bored being at the school. Most of the teachers there are amazing and really care about your education. The food is great and its just a really fun place to be."
Sophomore,4,"Kennesaw State University is a very diverse, beautiful place. There are students with different ethnicities, races, religions. Everyone is very welcoming and open minded about their students. One thing I would change about it is the social events that take place on campus. No one promotes the events which leaves many students unknown to the fact that there is an event going on. Most students want to attend and meet new people and make new friends. Kennesaw State University has to do a better job at promoting social events for students."
Freshman,4,"I love Kennesaw State University because it is an amazing school. The staff and faculty care about the education and wellbeing of all students, and the school seems very organized and well managed. However, a lot of students at the school are prejudiced due to the lack of knowledge about racial injustice as well as the apparent lack of diversity in the school."
Freshman,4,"Kennesaw is a great school. It's not the hardest school to get into ,but when you do get in it's fairly hard to get classes because they get full VERY quickly because it's such a large campus. The food on campus is great. The meal plans can be a little expensive, but the food is great."
Niche User,4,"I am a high school senior, so my rating is based upon visiting the school and the environment. I gave four stars because although I do like the feel of the school, I feel their communication with students can be better, and how they handle situations altogether. How schools have been responding to COVID-19 has shown a lot. For instance, as a freshman, I have had to pay about four different fees during this time of uncertainty. Fees for orientation, housing fees, and etc, Kennesaw has required this. I feel they could have waited to request money, as these are troubling times."
Freshman,4,"I am not a current student here, but I will be in 2020. Even though I don't attend this school I have toured it and have attended many events. I can tell that I am going to enjoy My 4 years of college here!"
Junior,4,Kennesaw State University has teachers who really care about you learning the materials.  The campus is also gorgeous and has amazing food.
Sophomore,4,It's a big school and has several clubs to join.Getting past gen ed classes and onto major-related classes makes the college life more personalized.
Sophomore,4,I haven't taken many classes. But i like what i have seen so far. College is stressful though. Im not really sure what the party scene is like.
Freshman,4,"I love how this school accepts people no matter who they are. This school does a great job giving people job opportunities. They even have a writing center that helps students become better writers. The only thing that this university needs to work on is to have more teachers offer extra credit opportunities, because there are students who work extremely hard on their classes, but get bad grades, because they are not strong on that subject area. The teachers also need to focus more grading quizzes based on answering the question correctly, instead of focusing on formatting, grammar, and punctuation."
Junior,4,Very diverse and colleagues are very friendly. Professors care about you and most classes are small enough that you can even become friends with professors. Highly recommended college.
Freshman,4,"The thing about Kennesaw is that it is the place where there is so much opportunity to connect with others, and still focus on obtaining your degree at the same time."
Freshman,4,Great school for people who commute or don't need a super prestigious education and for a reasonable tuition cost.
Freshman,4,"They were very welcoming for freshman students unlike my experience at my high school when I was a freshman. People helped me feel comfortable and guided me my first semester. It was easy to meet new people and find a group of friends that you could rely on.The Food is great, cafeâ€™s are open late to dine at or even do homework in a nice quiet setting. The rooms are very good for the price and it holds everything you'll basically need for a dorm. The transportation is alright, you must make sure you catch the bus or else your screwed for class if you don't have a car. Finally, you canâ€™t forget about the classes. Now professors come in all sorts at this school, in all honesty you have good ones and bad ones but that's basically every school."
Freshman,4,"so far i have had a great experience! it has not been perfect by any means, but definitely a decent experience for me. i do online classes and so far have not had many complaints with any profs or classes."
Niche User,4,"The campus was pretty. Lots of walking. Finding parking was TERRIBLE....... 

Sports are pretty good and interesting to watch the games and interaction."
Freshman,4,"I am a ""freshman"". I love the school because it is extremely diverse. Growing up in Villa Rica, Ga, there was not many people like me at my high school. There was not many Nigerians let alone Africans. There are so many different ethnicities at Kennesaw, even though I think they can do more to make us feel welcomed, and we have a space where we can all connect. Kennesaw needs to work on being more sensitive to races other than Caucasians. There was an article about them allowing a speaker who has frequently used the ""n-word"" in his speeches. They also seemed to have wasted some of our money on a sign. But besides the nuttery, the professors, that I have had at least"" are pretty exceptional. The Commons food is so good as well and the campus always has something going on. I have met what I feel like will be my lifelong friends at The Kennesaw State University. GO OWLS !"
Freshman,4,The school cares about their students very much. They want to see their students grow in ways that the students havenâ€™t seen themselves.
Sophomore,4,Kennesaw State is a good school. It is a diverse community and has a large number of majors among the two campuses. I mainly take classes on the Marietta campus and enjoy it. Some of the buildings though are dated and need to be renovated. The food choices on the Marietta campus are limited compared to the main Kennesaw campus. Overall it is a great school and you will learn the skills necessary to succeed in life.
Freshman,2,"For me specifically, my intended major was different than I anticipated and I have since transferred schools."
Freshman,2,"Kennesaw State is not what I expected at all. The classrooms do not have advanced technology or any assets to the students. On the tours they give, they show the most developed parts of campus. The exterior of the campus is beautiful, but the interior is trash. The faculty is treated poorly by administration and administrative procedures when dealing with other students is flawed."
Junior,2,"Kennesaw State has a lot of potential to be a great school, but they aren't there yet. They accept WAY too many students and don't offer near enough classes which makes registration a nightmare. Most of the staff members and advisors I have come into contact with have been awful and not much help whatsoever. The campus is great and there is lots to do in the surrounding area, but the crime rate is steadily rising. The university also doesn't have much going on besides classes. Besides the 5-6 home football games in the fall, it's dead during the weekends. Like I said before, KSU could be an amazing school, but right now they're far from it."
Sophomore,2,"This was my second school i went to, and i went straight back to my first school. This school is main for majorities, there don't have a lot of activities for minorities, and things to do around campus. I believe since Atlanta is like 25 minutes away they feel like they don't have to do as much for the students. Teachers are not into the education as well as i need them to be and that's really surprising to me."
Alum,2,"I did not like attending school at Kennesaw State University. It isn't a bad school per se, but it wasn't for me. It was very conservative and republican which is not my cup of tea."
Senior,2,"The school is very money hungry and they do not care about the students and their financial needs. Its already a struggle to pay for school, but this school doesn't care as long as they get their money it doesn't matter to them"
Freshman,2,"I only have 1000 characters to describe this place, that's not enough words so I'll be posting an expanded review elsewhere. The ""Unlimited"" Meal Plan is not worth $1800, the unlimited part only applies to the weekdays and can only be used at the Commons(Kennesaw) and Stingers(Marietta). With this plan you get only 270 Kennesaw has several different kinds of food scattered across the dining hall based on the theme of the food. Marietta has an island dedicated to just pizza, like the other campus, but the dough is usually not fully cooked. The salad bar in Marietta lacks with old wilted lettuce and very few topping/dressing options each day. For breakfast(ends at 10:30 for some reason), they usually have old green carton eggs. Lunch and dinner follow the same schedule every week: Asian Monday, Taco Tuesday, Smoked Meat Wednesday, Fried Chicken Thursday, and Catfish Friday. Weekends are for the leftovers. You do have other food options though."
Senior,2,"KSU needs to be more cognizant of student needs. For example, the rent required by KSU is much more than what the apartments are worth. As a resident, some basic things expected are internet connection (there have been many times where internet is out. No matter how much EVERYONE complains, nothing has been done about it), a capable maintenance crew(KSU refuses to replace appliances, and instead has maintenance ""fix"" them over and over, despite the obvious fact that sometimes, things need to be replaced), working key card hot spots (students get locked out at no fault of their own), and a lack of bugs (roaches on the second floor, ants on the fifth, etc), yet none of this is evident. Another problem is the fees, and the fact that KSU turns around and ask for more later. It seems like all they care about is making money, with little ROI for those NOT on sports teams- which is a majority of the 30,000+ students. Finally, the academic advisers often seem unknowledgable and unorganized."
Junior,2,"While students are friendly, I find that the majority of professors are rude and unwilling to help. Upon asking a professor a question in class, I was told to read my textbook. However, my question was about the textbook. Life here was rough."
Alum,2,"Even before the merge with SPSU, I knew to stay away. Now that the merge has happened and it's only a couple years out from it, I can definitively say this university is a joke. The administration does not care about the betterment of the university or its students, many of the academic deans and departments do not care about students' success, and many of the charges you'll see on your billing statement are ridiculous. Good luck trying to find parking most times throughout the day. Housing is really geared towards freshmen, so have fun trying to secure a spot as an upperclassmen. I've found that very few professors are actually concerned with your goals and aspirations; some are honestly still there to just get tenure. If you can go anywhere, literally anywhere else, I would."
Freshman,2,"I sadly saw Kennesaw take all my parents money. Meal plan, housing and everything is expensive at this school and honestly not worth it. The classes are overcrowded and understaff. Classes also fill up very quickly leaving you with no options to choose from. I regret every penny at this school. Thereâ€™s definitely better schools in Georgia that are more affordable and offer more academics."
Senior,2,"I hate KSU, I miss SPSU. They are cheap and inconsiderate. Parking tickets galore, though there is insufficient parking for their students. They are uninformed about their newly acquired programs (Architecture and Engineering) and thus spend their days paranoid about safety concerns which were never a problem before."
Freshman,2,"Pretty sad college tbh They keep accepting more and more students, yet don't hire more teachers and open up more classes! Financial aid is average at best, don't apply to ksu thinking everything will be paid for. 
They place more priority on you (you're more likely to get a full ride) if you're apart of football -__-"
Junior,2,"Although this school has pretty decent programs, how they handle students is just awful, they charge you for stuff you just shouldn't be charged for and any time you need help, they just try to give you the good ol ""you need to contact this office instead of us"" deal. I am very disappointed with this school"
College Sophomore,2,"I do not feel that campus is the safest, especially after 8pm. I am also scared of walking in the stairwells and halls by myself."
College Freshman,2,Limited space and don't like sharing restrooms with so many. Price too much for what I got.
College Freshman,2,i passed up a full ride to Ole Miss for this.. smh
College Junior,2,"I cannot give a thorough or unbiased review of campus housing as I have never lived on campus at KSU. However, collecting experiences from my time in campus housing and listening to others, campus housing is pointless. One can find off campus housing anywhere from 2 - 15 minutes from campus with better sizing, cleanliness and pricing."
College Junior,2,"KSU gives the impression of having an extensive Greek life and selection of fraternities and sororities - however, this impression is a foot deep ocean. There is no depth to the organizations as they are almost all just avenues for parties and socials. Connections within the fraternities and sororities are often fake and do not extend past the fraternities and sororities."
College Junior,2,I think that there needs to be more coursed offered in my major and also more teachers.
College Junior,2,It is required that all students pay the athletic fee whether or no they attend athletic events. Most students in my view do not attend.
College Sophomore,2,too overpriced for something so small
College Freshman,2,The parties that I have attended were boring.
College Freshman,2,"It is sad, but you can smell it in the hallways of the dorms.  The RA's need to be more attentive."
College Freshman,2,"There didn't seem to be an unusual amount of crime on campus this past year, but when there was, I felt safe. The only thing that I don't like is the fact that they don't tell you what is going on ever. We had three older men break into our building one time and bang on girls doors telling them that they would get in and do this and that, and the cops never told us about it, the only reason that I knew was because I was in a sorority and it happened to one of our sisters."
College Senior,2,"Greek life is not a priority on this campus. They don't have Greek housing, so they can't throw the kinds of wild parties you see in the movies. The most I see of them is when they're on the Campus Green doing something for charity or recruiting. Non-Greeks, which are the majority on campus, are typically negative - indifferent concerning Greek life. A lot of students commute and choose to save money by living at home, so Sorority or Fraternity dues are seen as an unnecessary expense and as a way to buy friends."
College Freshman,2,Hate it. No one will tell the guy down the hall to stop smoking his weed at all hours of the day.
College Sophomore,2,I have not had the best experiences with teachers at the school. This semester i have had a teacher give me a failing grade on a test which i had actually scored a B on. If i had not had the suspicion that the grade was too low i would have never caught the mistake. Before this semester i have had teachers say sexist and homophobic slander during class as well as have anger issues and mistreat the students trying to learn.
College Freshman,2,"We just got  our first football team this year, so students and parents were pretty excited. The facilities are really nice as well. However, not many people attend other sport events such as lacrosse and baseball."
College Freshman,2,"Very few options. Not much going on, especially for non greeks."
College Freshman,2,I would partake if I knew of any.
College Freshman,2,"Their parties are sub-par. They take themselves way too seriously. Most frats and sororities don't even have their own houses; everyone goes back to their dorms or apartments at the end of the day. VERY cliquey and closed groups. If you aren't in one, you don't get to associate with them."
College Freshman,2,Nobody really goes to watch any of the teams. Boring to watch. Not a real big deal.
College Freshman,2,"The only bad thing about Kennesaw Housing is the board that runs it. The housing itself is great, but as far as communication from the housing leaders, it could be better. They are often misinformed or inform the residents of important issues very late, and we have to find various options rather stressfully."
College Freshman,2,This school is not secure whatsoever.
College Freshman,2,The students does not get their money worth. It's a rip off especially for freshmen.
College Freshman,2,"I would there be more opportunities on campus, but here isn't."
College Senior,2,"Bunch of people smoke pot on campus, you can smell it in classrooms and watch them between classes. Ever notice that chacos smell like a combination of sharp cheddar, caramelized onions, and Marijuana?"
College Senior,2,"I've gone to the Marietta campus for a reason. The town is nicknamed 'scaryietta' for a reason, some fond memories from my college experience include two encounters with the SWATT team on campus, and multiple police chases using campus roads as cut-throughs.  Don't leave your car unattended overnight or you won't have an exhaust system in the morning and never go south on Franklin road if you want to live."
College Senior,2,"Its like living in an inconvenient five star hotel with lots of fire alarms and annoying neighbors that you never see because they are either playing leauge of legends, or always hear because they aspire to proficency at their hobby of juggling bowling balls."
College Freshman,2,"I lived in University Village last year and thought it was great. But then they kicked everyone out and made it freshmen only(wtf?), so I moved to ARC and the quality here is horrendous. I have over 50+ pictures of repairs or cleanings that needed to be done when I moved in, and then each staff person who came to clean one thing said the other stuff wasn't their job. The roommate matching is also incredibly flawed, none of my 3 roommates and I like each other. Also, many rooms are directly next to the road. Right now I can hear every car that passes by and there's also a place where the buses always stop right outside my window, so there's no way I can take a nap or sleep during the day. Those are just some examples, it's just poor quality and planning in general over here. Really disappointed in KSU this year.?"
College Freshman,2,Football... The only sport here that really matters is football.
College Junior,2,Many degrees from this school don't really translate well into the real world and many classes are taught just to get the students through.
College Junior,2,"Very expensive, No involvement, KSU place is a dump. Not really worth the investment"
College Freshman,2,"In the fall at Kennesaw, first two weeks there, 2 people were raped. I'm not sure what the police did about it but it is a problem. I've heard from some of my friends that they have been drugged at parties too. Personally I feel safe, security officers do patrol."
College Freshman,2,Within the first two weeks of last semester there were two sexual assault incidences.
College Freshman,2,The process to get into a dorm was extremely difficult and there is not enough room for students.
College Sophomore,2,"the living space is not the greatest, but the walk to classes is very good. If I would have lived in the nicer dorms I would probably say the living space was good. Also, it was way too pricy."
College Sophomore,2,I feel as if you have to be in Greek Life to enjoy the school experience.
College Sophomore,2,"From what I've seen, the campus is really big on victim blaming, and with a very outspoken anti-feminist 'Men's Rights' student group posting ""Rape Culture Doesn't Exist"" posters all over campus all the time, no wonder."
College Sophomore,2,"I have never personally lived on campus due to the spaciousness and the price of the student living options. I highly suggest apartments neat the school because there is more space, freedom, and it's much more cost effective."
College Junior,2,"Individual bedrooms, poor management, and no rule enforcement"
College Junior,2,I don't know many people who participate
Recent Alumnus,2,"Kennesaw is a decent overall university, better than most of the other dumb state schools in Georgia, but regardless, it's really just for average students.  Get into UGA, Tech, or even Georgia State if you can, and get a real degree.  I liked the professors a lot, and the cafeteria, but that's about it.  The social scene is very weak.  Most students are either non-traditionals or local kids who already have a social circle.  Not much room for anybody else, and it can get pretty miserable.  The campus is quiet as a graveyard from Thursday night to Monday morning.  On-campus housing is a pain.  Registering for classes is too."
College Sophomore,2,"I can't say it's the worst since it hasn't had its accreditation revoked yet, however I can say that many of the campus personnel and employees are terribly unprofessional. Parking is absolutely horrendous and is not handled properly; it's a disgrace for a university to be this terrible in this aspect. Academic advisors for the most part are extremely unhelpful, with a few exceptions to advisors who actually care about their students.

Kennesaw's professors are a blessing to the University and are the best part of the school. The campus is extremely well-kempt and is held to high standards, however this school is growing too fast for its pants size; its seams are about to burst. Many students commute and struggle to find a place to live on-campus, this is very apparent in a percentage standpoint.

There are not enough classes open for the STEM population, it's an absolute rush to get into a chemistry class alone and you are NOT guaranteed a spot even with a bad professor. Saturday classes are a guarantee if you get a late sign-up for lab.

Overall I'm pretty disappointed with the university itself and its management, but not the professors' performance. All of my professors have been wonderful. Some very very hard, but amazing."
College Freshman,2,"I always have school as a priority over socializing, but having a social life is a big part of the college experience. I don't feel like Kennesaw State gives us an opportunity to do so. Every party/kickback I've ever been to has been shut down simply because it was a party. (Nothing bad has ever happened) I haven't enjoyed a party at my school yet. Greek life is barely existent on campus. They don't even have Greek houses near the school. I think the only way to be a KSU student and have fun would be to have a car and no of other places to go."
College Student,2,The scholarship deadline was too early and not much information was given so I missed out on the opprotunity
College Junior,2,"The Greek life is everywhere but it seems that its extremely cliquey and every organization is ""known"" for somethings. Such as Gamma Phi being ""known"" for being fat and ugly and AOPi being ""known"" for being the barbie dolls."
College Sophomore,2,"This is mostly a commuter school, so the campus is pretty dead after hours."
College Freshman,2,terrible not fun at all off campus is the way to go
Junior,1,"During Covid-19, I have become very disappointed in them. Every single on of my online classes (4) do not have any live lectures. The only ""teaching"" we get is through publisher PowerPoint slides with no notes or audio. Uploading a PowerPoint and giving  an exam is not teaching whatsoever. And it's not an individual issue. In multiple KSU groups (such as on FB) people have been complaining of the minimal effort given by the school and professors during this time. It really seems like nobody cares as long as they get paid. If Covid-19 is still a problem, I would not suggest attending KSU, you won't get what you're paying for. Side Note: All my other peers at other schools (big and small) seem to have normal live online lectures to emulate being in a classroom. Very disappointed in the effort (of lack of) that KSU has put towards making adjustments during this odd time."
Freshman,1,"If you do not care about your education, feel free to come here. 

- The school is rural and it is hard to get places without a car. 

- Do not major outside of the College or Business, Nursing, Education or 
   Exercise Science. Anything else is underfunded and bad. 

- It is impossible to meet people here outside of greek life. 

- Registration is always hot mess."
Freshman,1,This is just an extension of high school and you constantly see the same people. They say that it is a large university but I find it hard to believe that when I only see the same people every day. It's fine academic wise but socially it's terrible.
Sophomore,1,"Stay away at all cost! As a student that came out of state I HIGHLY regret the amount of money spent on this place, and I could only stay a year due to how bad it was! Extremely racist school. Bad professors - don't answer emails and put false information on the syllabus so they are unable to be reached in emergency situations! Everyone is very rude - its hard to meet people. The students are 90% from the same small town Kennesaw highschools - Made primarily of cliques. MANY shootings in local student housing complexes. Unsafe to walk around ON campus at any time of day. Daily rapes, fights and robberies. Campus police are useless, they just sit in the church parking lot and talk to each other - NEVER around when someone is actually in need. Would NOT recommend this school to anyone. Very unfair system and messed up priorities. You would do better not going to college at all than going here. DON'T waste your time, energy or money on this shit show of a university."
Senior,1,"Kennesaw represents everything wrong with the university system these days. They are a jumped up community college grown too big for its britches. The professors are 50-50, the students are mostly incompetent and frequently cheat their way through classes, the students who do work hard are constantly screwed by the administration in classes and otherwise,  the faculty is more concerned with diversity than actual quality, and the number of useful majors is limited. 

Most of the students shouldn't be in college, but the university does not help them figure it out, but instead lets them keep repeating the same class ad infinitum while the 3.8 GPA students and above are fighting just to get basic classes. They heavily promote whatever agenda is du jour, and waste money on magnificently appointed facilities as opposed to quality education.

They have everything that makes them look like a university and little of what makes one."
College Sophomore,1,grads after ksu have low chances of getting job in their field
College Sophomore,1,"The Greek life is one of the worst i have seen in all of the universities. The Fraternities are typical meat heads, while the sororities are mostly typical airheads. I do not have an interest in joining and most people with respect for themselves do not either. The fraternities humiliate themselves and the women they go to parties to obtain."
College Senior,1,"Honestly the formula SAE team, international student organizations, and Baptist Collegiate Ministry promote some of the most fun, least pretensions social life on campus. Otherwise you'll have to settle for super smash bros in the student center for a 'party scene' on the Marietta campus."
College Senior,1,"The main campus in Kennesaw has a party scene according to legend, about all you'll see at the Marietta campus is a spontaneous game of magic the gathering."
College Senior,1,"Nobody cares about Greek life on the Marietta campus, engineers don't have time for that crap. The Kennesaw campus is all about that Greek life though, not sure why though anyone can get in. If you want Greek and you go to Kennesaw State, there are some great local restaurants you should try."
College Senior,1,"If you want an engineering degree this is not the place to go. The program is well respected, hands on and very good training for the job field, but fighting with the advising staff to get in and receive credit for classes makes graduation require a level of effort on par with Georgia Tech. I was accepted to both schools and selected Southern Poly because it was cheaper, had a good reputation and a small-school feel. Since the merge with Kennesaw State it feels like the university system is employing every ridiculous policy possible to prevent former SPSU students from graduating. It's not all bad though, if you want an enjoyable college experience from a formerly respected engineering school from which you will never graduate, this is the school for you."
College Sophomore,1,Greek life on campus is very clique. I don't really like it at all.
College Junior,1,"You have to know the right people to party. And, most of the parties are way off campus like in Atlanta or midtown."
College Sophomore,1,I do not care for partying.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I get sick every time I eat at The Commons on campus. The food is either bland or salty----those are the options. I have found conditions dirty and the kitchen staff to be very offensive when this is brought to their attention. Do not apply to work there, the staff is  verbally abusive to the student employees in public. I have witnessed scenes that were both unprofessional and unnecessary.

Juice fountains/dispensers are turned off after breakfast leaving only milk or sugary soft drinks, and beverages sweetened with NutraSweet."
Recent Alumnus,1,there is no off campus housing near campus
College Freshman,1,It is way to cold for me. I hate cold weather and that's all there is.
College Junior,1,The Hoot is very NASTY!!!
College Junior,1,Kennesaw State hardly ever closes due to weather. There was a tornado spotted in Cobb County and the school sent out a a message to the students about it that told students to stay indoors and not go anywhere but that classes were going to continue as scheduled. The weather was so bad that I got stuck in the commons with workers blocking the doors telling us that we had to stay inside and they kept moving us further into the room. Classes were still not cancelled. Kennesaw State also did not close for the snow storm until the weather had gotten so bad that traffic was terrible. There were many wrecks on the road from people trying to get home. I sat in traffic for 8 hours trying to get home that day and only made it 5 miles from the school. I had to stay with a friend and was unable to get home. Kennesaw State does not consider their commuter students that make up a large part of their student body when considering dealing with bad weather.
College Junior,1,There are not many students that attend games of most of the sporting events. Hockey the club sport is the biggest sport at the school right now. The school is getting a football team starting 2015. Most of the a lot of the new athletic facilities are for athletes only and are not open the the general student population. There is very minimal school spirit.
College Freshman,1,Network is shared and very slow. Wifi is only good for phones.
College Freshman,1,No one is up; everyone is sleep. It's more academics than social life
College Freshman,1,The on-campus life is dead.
College Freshman,1,"Girls and guys on the spsu campus are lacking both socially and aesthetically, however make up for it through their intelligence "
College Sophomore,1,"There are not very many parking options on campus. The parking price is ridiculous, and then it is sometimes hard to find an open parking spot."
College Freshman,1,Considering the 82 to 18 male to female ratio their isn't much to say its a technical school with geeky guys
College Freshman,1,"The atmosphere is the worst, from the day life to the night life at SPSU there is nothing to do. "
College Freshman,1,Don't bother breathing if you're not Greek. 
College Freshman,1,"Don't even get me started. I can't find a spot, the parking deck is not lighted. Elevators don't work. Cost is outrageous. "
College Freshman,1,My car wouldn't start in the parking deck. I had the hood up on my car. Campus police drove by and just looked. Didn't even ask if everything was alright. Just kept driving. 
College Freshman,1,The parking deck is crazy. Good luck finding a spot. Parking cost $86 a semester. I commute so I don't use a shuttle. I am paying for other students to use the shuttle. 
College Freshman,1,"The school is too huge to have a ""private"" area to study. The professors vary widely. Make sure you get lucky during registration. I ended up without an english1102 class. They need to open more classes!!"
College Sophomore,1,I hate it when bad weather hits Ksu. most of our walking is done outside and you have to walk pretty far to get to each class. 
College Freshman,1,"We have the worst wireless system I have ever seen and that is sad because this is a technology school. Bring your own router. If you have to print on campus, it is easy, cheap, and fairly hassle free. "
College Freshman,1,"There is a nightlife. I would not recommend anyone to participate in it. The parties are usually lame, there are no bars or clubs worth venturing to, underaged nightlife is up to the individual and their friends. There is not a drunk bus service like some schools have to take them back home, but there is no need for one really. "
College Freshman,1,There is no campus transportation besides a weekly trolley that goes to Walmart or the town square or so. We have zipcars. You or a kind friend needs a car on this campus if you ever want/need anything off campus. The campus is very walkable though. 
College Freshman,1,"Stingers Restaurant is just about the worst college food that I have ever had. It is fine on open house days or days when there are official tours of campus, but otherwise the food is lacking."
College Junior,1,All they have is a trolley that goes to Walmart and the Marietta Town Center on Thursdays
College Junior,1,There is not any off-campus housing near the school unless you get a house. The apartments are not very close to the campus except for one and I heard they were not very good
College Freshman,1,"The process was agonizing, but that may have been to my individual case. Financial aid took forever to go through, and I barely made my rent because of it."
College Freshman,1,"Kennesaw has not been a four year university for long at all, therefore, the nightlife has not evolved yet."
College Sophomore,1,"I just transferred here so I know what its like at other schools, and KSU is pretty much a joke for social life. People are pretty reserved and dont really care to meet people in other ""groups"" at this school."
College Senior,1,Parking can be a hassle. Be prepared to be on campus at least 30 minutes before your classes start if you want a guaranteed spot.
College Senior,1,There is absolutely nothing to do. Marietta is an extremely boring city at night
College Sophomore,1,"I know plenty of underage students who attend parties and does, well, illegal things. Although I have never been part of this because I did not dorm, I have talked to peers and seen pictures of underage drinking. I have D- instead of an F because I know that at least some people are probably 21 and over when they are drinking."
College Sophomore,1,Getting my fasfa done for the first time was very difficult and frustrating. I did it by myself and had no help. At the end I didn't get any financial aid because I didn't qualify. Big wast of time.
College Freshman,1,"You have to leave early in order to get a good parking space, and also to get there on time. Traffic can be a nightmare. Typically I take the bus because I don't have to leave as early to get to class on time."
College Senior,1,"Food quality from day to day is UNRELIABLE! We ask each other if it is ""safe"" to eat in the Commons today! Taste of food varies from tasteless to too much salt---everyday! Administrator for the Commons does NOT care as long as the university continues to obtain grants for food studies!
A real shame because the majority of our food is locally grown and our Commons dining hall is only 4 years old----meal plans are also mandatory!"
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus IS a nightmare (daymare?) DO arrive ONE HOUR before class to park and know the times that classes let out---it is helpful to gauge availability.

IF Lanier Parking, the contracted parking company on Kennesaw State University campus would apply sensible practices this would NOT be so bad. There is pretty much the entire bottom floor roped off for visitor parking in the Central Parking Deck, the largest deck on campus, however even those spaces are yellow taped off and unavailable---pretty stupid when students are paying $80.00 a semester to park and have to drive up to the top for a space when gas is so expensive and an entire floor is practically empty! OPEN those spaces to everyone (not just faculty and staff), when events such as graduation and orientations are coming up, place signage to alert students that those spaces will be available only for visitors on those specific days---that just opened up over 100 spaces!
STUPIDITY has never solved anything! Let's get it together Lanier and let Kennesaw Students park their cars so we can get into the classrooms on time!"
College Sophomore,1,They take too long to respond any questions and issues. And when they do respond they don't provide enough time for you to get your finances in order.
College Senior,1,Non-existent. Have to travel in order to have true nightlife.
College Junior,1,Greek life at kennesaw is not very respected among the student population. I view greek life as an inconvenience anyway so I enjoy the absence of serious greek life.
College Sophomore,1,I can not stand living at upoint kennesaw. too loud.
College Junior,1,Greek life is not really interacted with the school. All they do is throw parties and show up at some events from time to time.
College Sophomore,1,Not nearly enough parking spaces for everyone. I have been late to several classes solely due to parking problems.
College Junior,1,"Parking at KSU is a disaster that needs some serious focus. Permits average $80, but you can only park in your designated area. With a campus the size of Kennesaw's it really isn't convenient to be confined to a singular parking deck. What if I'm running late due to traffic and really need to park somewhere fast? I'm fined for parking in a different lot. Fines start around $25. Oh, and everyone pays an extra $60 fee for transportation, even if the bus system isn't their choice of commute. I pay for my gas, and your parking permit, please don't tack on another fee."
College Junior,1,"Kennesaw is a suburban sprawl area. There are no real clubs or bars nearby because it is generally a suburban area.  There are malls and places to eat where you can drink and there are places for parties to happen but the KSU is not your typical undergrade experience.  You attend school with a lot of parents, professional and those going back to school to their degree. It is a good school to attend to work full time and be a student full time."
College Senior,1,I have a 3.9 and still can't receive a scholarship
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at Kennesaw State University is chaotic. If you pay for the best parking, judged by location, you still will have to spend a good 30 minutes trying to find a spot, and you also need to budget in time to walk to class, because even Central Parking is not all that central to your classes. The 6 floor parking deck is filled to mass capacity before noon every day."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no where near enough parking on campus.  If you have a class around 12 pm you will have to arrive at 10 just to get a spot.  Then they came up with this horrible plan to park people at the mall and bus them over.  You're car sets un-watched in a hot parking lot all day, and the bus schedualing is just not fitting for class times."

Junior,5,"Lesley is a relatively small University placed in the heart of Cambridge. For its small community, students are encouraged to create relationship within each other and the faculty and diversity becomes a reason to come together. Its location also makes it easier for students to take advantage of the stores and places around. There is easy access to the T and once you build a group of friends, discovering the city becomes an activity to look forward to. 
At Lesley, students are heard and encouraged to speak up for themselves, so that when they go to the real world, their voices and willingness to work are appreciated."
Freshman,5,The programs and aid  that this university offers  is measured far above the others. I can’t wait to be joining this beautiful family in the fall :)
Junior,5,"I love Lesley University, because it is very inclusive in promoting student activities and clubs for people of all types, regardless of race, identity, and religious affiliation. They have a very welcoming atmosphere."
Junior,5,"I love this place happy I chose it.  I am doing very well and I would have not chosen any other university.  I am as honest as I can.  A lot of famous people come from here and also there other schools, LA+D.  History and others are legendary.  I would never reconsider this place even if I had the option to."
Freshman,5,"My school is the perfect fit for me. I am currently studying fine arts and I couldn't be happier. My classes are great, my professors really care about their students, and resident life is amazing. The people in my dorm are like my family and we spend every dinner at our newly renovated dinning hall! The food is always changing and there is always a good selection to choose from. Getting to and from class is a breeze as well. Highly recommend!"
Junior,5,"Lesley is a wonderful, small school. It's easy to recognize faces on a day-to-day basis here, my professors are thoughtful and easy to work with, and the campus and location makes any difficult thing that happens feel better."
Sophomore,5,"best people i've ever met here. the teachers and staff all care about the students and want them to succeed. creativity is strongly encouraged and it's a very open, welcoming environment all around."
Graduate Student,5,It's a great environment and the professors really care about you and your success. They are always available if I need anything. They are well educated and have high expectations for their students.
Sophomore,5,"I had the best first year at Lesley.  There academics are great, along with their facilities.  The student to faculty ratio is excellent and I learned so much.  I can’t wait for my second year to begin in the Fall."
Freshman,5,"So far I really enjoy Lesley. Everyone there is so kind and cool, the students are really allowed to be themselves and explore their identities and what they want to do as a careers. There is a variety of classes that give you the freedom to explore new kinds of knowledge and skills that can be newly learned or further developed. The teachers are all very understanding and push you to do your absolute best. A really welcoming and wonderful experience."
Freshman,5,Lesley University took me in when the school I had planned on attending closed up unexpectedly.  I am so happy here and I believe that things happen for a reason and this was meant to be.  I am an animation major and have loved every minute of it.  I have learned so much this year and look forward to the next three!
Junior,5,"Overall, Lesley is an amazing school. I appreciate the hands on opportunities presented to me daily. Professors work closely with their students to help them succeed, presenting material in a verity of manners. Not only are the staff welcoming, but with a diverse population in the heart of Cambridge, students are exposed to a multitude of people from different backgrounds. Lesley works with each of their students as individuals in order to meet their specific goals and make accommodations to suit even the busiest schedules."
Sophomore,5,"Taking online course with Lesley University. Everyone was so helpful when I was to transferring to the program here and so far all of my classes, professors and classmates have been wonderful! I am really excited to be continuing my education at an institution like Lesley University."
Freshman,5,"The things I love most about Lesley is that the students are creative, accepting, empowered, and open-minded. People are expressive and not afraid to be themselves. The professors and faculty go above and beyond to help you and provide the best services that they can. The small class sizes allow for intimate interactions and I have yet to have a bad professor!"
Freshman,5,"When I first got to Lesley, I was greeted by tons of smiling faces. Over the course of the school year, I became very close with these faces. I am very sad that I am going to be transferring, hopefully to Berklee (if I get the money) or Denver University."
Sophomore,5,My school is a great fit for me. Professors and students are very helpful and great resources. The campus is easy to get to and navigate around.
Niche User,5,I liked how all the staff there was so friendly and out going and they seemed very interested and happy to have us students there.
Junior,5,"I love my life here at Lesley, I have great friends and I feel like I am surrounded by like minded people. Everyone is kind and open, and life simply couldn't get better."
Freshman,5,"Very welcoming, the professors actually want to help you, located in a beautiful place/city. I love it here. The food is okay, but you can easy just buy your own food."
Niche User,5,I have recently attended a summer semester at Lesley an also I have been to visit multiple times. I love it and love the food and atmosphere about everything about Lesley.  The school is a great college to go to.
Freshman,5,I love being in Cambridge! Our school is small so even if you don't know someones name you can recognize them. The teachers will do their best to help you even meeting you at starbucks if you cant make their office hours!
College Sophomore,5,I am satisfied with the size of the classes and the caliber of the faculty. Lesley is known for Art Therapy and I believe that I have made the best choice in selecting this school.  Most of the professors want learners to succeed and that is paramount. It is more than a job to them; it is a vocation.
Recent Alumnus,5,I transferred here from another school and wish I had started my education here.  Lesley is an amazing school!
College Freshman,5,"I love Lesley University. The area and the Community is great. It is in Cambridge, MA which is like its own little city. I highly recommend going here. The school always has something going on, always activities. We have a therapy dog here on campus which helps when your homesick, stressed, or just love dogs. They also have so may resources here so you do not need to worry. I have never seen or heard of a school that has such a great judgement-free community."
College Freshman,5,"Just started, and I love it."
College Sophomore,5,There are a lot of food restaurants outside of campus that are within walking distance.
College Sophomore,5,Nice neighborhood. There are plenty of things look and good schools around the Lesley Campus and housing.
College Freshman,5,"Foodler delivers to the dorms for very reasonable prices. There's restaurants of all varieties, especially ones with ethnic, vegetarian, and vegan options."
College Freshman,5,"SO many options. Expensive, but you can get anything."
College Freshman,5,So many options for all different tastes
College Freshman,5,"If I wan't something different than from the day before, something is literally around the corner."
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are just like apartment complexes. Dorms are extremely close to the classes as well as to the MBTA train station. They are a bit pricey, but it's definitely worth it. The lottery works fairly well and many students are generally happy with the results"
College Senior,5,I love my major. It is an excellent program at the school. Very strong support and I have learned a wealth of information about myself and working towards a profession in the field. I'm very satisfied with my experience. The hands on experience through the internships has been invaluable! The work load is very manageable and at times easy.
College Senior,5,"Living in Cambridge is vibrant and exciting. There are always great restaurants and bars. Many different and exciting events going on all the time. It is very much a college city, with an eclectic mix of individuals from all over. The locals can be a little blunt and unfriendly, but the high concentration of college students off set this city edge. People are generally very welcoming and friendly."
College Senior,5,"Very high standards to prepare students to enter the professional field. There is a very strong focus on self-care and reflection, equally supplying and teaching the necessary tools to succeed."
College Freshman,5,"Your in Cambridge/Boston, a city ! The off campus food is great here, there are so many options that really cater to everyones needs weather is be being vegetarian options or different types of ethnic cuisine. There always a pizza shop, burger place, tavern, ice cream parlor or Chinese restaurant around every corner. You can pretty  much find what ever kind of food your looking for in and around Cambridge. And the prices range so much, you can find a cheap burger at tasty burger or shake shack or an upscale burger as a fancy tavern."
College Junior,5,"Being right between Harvard Square and Porter Square, there are great dining options off campus. If you live on Brattle Campus, a five minute walk from Harvard Square, there are TONS of options. Doble Campus also has a lot of options, but you may have to walk just a little bit farther, but it's all still close."
College Junior,5,If you are interested in Liberal Arts or Fine Arts this is the school for you
College Junior,5,This is one of the best programs I could have found for what I want to do.
College Junior,5,There is always something to do on campus and off-campus it's Boston so there's always something to do
College Student,5,Cambridge/Boston is one of the best places you can live. Everything adn everything yuo want to do is right in front of you
College Student,5,"Being in Harvard square is the best thing possible. Every type of resturant you could desire! Except Cambridge does not allow fast food chains, so you wont find any of those nearby ): And there is also an app called Foodler that has every resturant around Boston and Cambridge that delivers! So if you had a rough night and feel like some wings at 3am, Foodler is your best friend!"
College Freshman,5,"Lesley is absolutely the best school to go to for education. They get you started your first year with actually going to field experiences and take their education courses extremely seriously. It's a really great program, and you truly will not find a better education program than at Lesley."
College Freshman,5,"There are various majors in Lesley, the art school as well gives good options."
College Freshman,5,I am confused about this question. I would say greeks are pretty accepted here.
College Sophomore,5,"Located just outside of Boston, Cambridge is a fairly safe, well-kept location. Lesley sits beside Harvard University, and although Harvard Yard, Harvard Square, and Mass Avenue are not known to be totally safe, there is usually not a time that you cannot see a police officer keeping watch. The local vendors are friendly and cool, but the cost of buying anything in the area is rather steep. Nightlife and activities are easy to come by, and there are even several restaurants nearby that afford places for young people to hang out, grab a drink and relax to live music. Entertainment is very easy to come by."
College Senior,5,There are so many amazing restaurants (I'm a big fan of the immense amount of Asian ones available).
College Senior,5,"Lesley is a 10 minute walk from both Harvard Square and Porter Square, so there are a lot of great restaurants in the area. Just off the top of my head I know you can find Sushi, Ramen, Italian, Froyo, Mexican, Pizza, Ethiopian, Indian, Thai, Hot Pot, Burgers, Korean, pretty much everything. And of course the T is conveniently located so if you want something more specific you can easily get to it. Some favorites of the Lesley community are Berry Line (Frozen Yogurt), Otto's or Pinnochio's (Pizza), Felipe's (Burritos), Flat Patties (Burgers), JP Licks (Ice Cream), Wagamama (Japanese), Fire & Ice (Mixed cuisine + dancing) and Sweet (Cupcakes!). There are seriously so many options."
College Junior,5,"With the events going on with Boston recently (the marathon bombing, the blizzard), it was very easy to feel alone and sad. However, at Lesley University, people go out of their way to make sure you feel the opposite. Several students had family members or friends at the finish line during the Boston Marathon. The night of the Marathon, we held a vigil in our quad. The accapella group sang and we all stood in a circle holding hands. It made me realize how important a close-knit community is and how thankful I was that Lesley has one."
College Junior,5,"There's always something to do on campus! Student activities are really creative with the entertainment they bring in, and student organizations are very encouraged to put together their own events and projects."
College Junior,5,everyone's pretty great. super creative and expressive.
College Junior,5,"Lesley University is a wonderful school. One part of campus has a very wonderful academic feel. The art department, which I was apart of, has this wonderful studio feel, which makes it easy to get into the flow of creating art. Class rooms are always clean! And I would know, I worked as a classroom monitor, made sure the rooms were clean at all times.
The food is never bad! Wonderful college area, near Harvard University. This really feels like the college life the tv universe always displayed."
College Sophomore,5,"Varsity sports at Lesley are very successful yet most students don't appreciate them.  They don't consider the attention athletics bring to our very small school.  A good amount of students are involved in sports, including a large majority of the male student population.  The fan support exists mostly within athletics as the athletes support each other.  None of the athletic facilities are on campus, which could diminish some fan support due to transportation to fields."
College Sophomore,5,"Cambridge is an amazing small city with easy access to Boston, an incredible large city with so much to offer.  Both Cambridge and Boston offer an array of activities that include great music and food.  There are also really good museums in the area.  Not to mention, all of the colleges that are around to visit."
College Junior,5,Every week there are events to attend to and they are mostly free. the athetlic center is new and is equipped with everything.
College Junior,5,Absolutely not tolerated by officials and security
College Freshman,5,"Very helpful! They offer many services and are very kind. The health services at Lesley are outstanding. The people that work there are very kind, gentle, and caring. They are there to help student and really seem to care about the students."
College Freshman,5,"There are many resources for public transportation. Near the campus there is a rent-a-bike station. It does not cost much and you have, I believe, 30 minutes of riding time. Boston has bike lanes on most streets so it is very safe to use. In Harvard Square a short walk from Lesley are two T(subway) stations. Its two dollars to get in and the stations are equipped with fairly easy to understand maps. The trains go further into cambridge as well as into Boston. There are also bus stops that cost a little less than the subway. 
You really wont need transportation unless you are going out or you have classes at AIB which then the school provides an hourly shuttle to and from AIB which is free to take."
College Freshman,5,"Security is very stiff about letting students in without identification which is extremely professional. It does make me feel safe that most buildings are mostly locked, especially at night due to the crime rate in Kenmore. Teachers are always informative about up-to-date viruses and warn the students to be safe and to take care of their hygiene which is both professional and thoughtful."
College Freshman,5,"This is actually a comment on TRANSFER ADMISSIONS, but obviously they don't have that on the list....
I recently got accepted as a second semester transfer from Salem State University. The transfer admissions counselor is incredibly nice, helpful, and personal. She emphasized from the beginning that it was okay to call for any reason whenever I needed help. So I did. I advise to be as involved as possible with the school during the admissions process, and I also HIGHLY recommend an interview even though it isn't required. I went in for an interview and was so impressed when the transfer counselor actually remembered specifics from my essays and knew almost everything from my application off the top of her head, and later on, when I found out that my high school forgot to send my transcripts on the day that they were due, they were totally relaxed and said no big deal, we'll still take this for the next few weeks. When I got in, the transfer counselor called me personally to tell me, also saying that she was happy because she really wanted me to get in. I'm starting in the spring as a commuter, and I absolutely can't wait to start!"
Senior,4,"So many faculty members genuinely care about their students and subjects. I've always felt supported and like those around me really care about whether or not I'm in a good place to learn and do my best. The location is lovely, and it's a gorgeous campus. Lesley hosts a lot of cool and interesting things, like their very own comic book convention. The campus is small enough that it's easy to stay connected. Of course, Lesley has its issues, too. Financial aid is difficult, and the split in funding between the art school and the liberal arts college creates tension. I feel like they don't offer as many classes as I was promised, so I'm not really getting the experience that I want."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Lesley. The professors are knowledgeable, and the students really want to be there. It's an extremely Liberal environment, which not everyone liked about it, so I caution those who are very Conservative. I was a commuter student and while Lesley is a big commuter school, my only wish is that they had more services and opportunities for commuters."
Sophomore,4,"Lesley University is a great school for those interested in fields of art, education, and art therapy. It is located in a great area and a hub for students to meet LGBTQIA+ community members. It is very accepting of gender and sexuality and makes that a focal point of their mission."
Senior,4,"My experience at Lesley was good. The teachers are awesome and it's a great environment for learning. I love every teacher I have had here. The only thing that I'm not a fan of is the advising. It took me a week to find out who my advisor was. The first person I met was someone who has a table set up at my previous school. She went through my transcript and told me that all of my credits would transfer to the social work program. When I met my actual advisor,  I found out that not only would my credits NOT transfer, but the social work program wasn't starting until the following fall semester. Having to change my major wasn't something I had anticipated but I feel like my current major (counseling) is actually a much better fit for me."
Sophomore,4,"Lesley University is a very accepting and open school. The opportunities that they offer are like no other school that I have seen. I am being submerged into the working world gradually, and advisors are there to help every step of the way. The only complaint I would have is not having food services open as much on the weekends. However, I do understand why the hours are more cut and am grateful that they put time and effort into giving us good quality food."
Freshman,4,"Lesley has a really strong sense of community, and makes place for anyone and everyone. I play softball here, and it is a great sense of team. I have some amazing professors as a freshman right now."
Freshman,4,"I like their effort to teach and embody social justice, in all aspects of the university. I also like how accommodating and proactively helpful they are with students with academic disabilities."
Freshman,4,I’ve had an overall good experience at Lesley University and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to pursue a career in the arts. I would say their shuttles are rather inconsistent.
Freshman,4,"Lesley University is a school full of opportunity and acceptance through the students and staff. The professors and staff at this university are kind, understanding, but expect high quality work. Being here has pushed my limits and taken me out of my comfort level, and by doing this I feel that I have blossomed as an artist and student. The art programs are full of experienced artist that help their students open their minds to the possibilities and have them try many different forms of art that some of the students have never tired before. The professors and students are honest with themselves and others and I feel like that’s why I really do love this school, because everyone can be their best true selves. The school mainly consists of  caucasian students and I think it is something that could be worked on. Diversity is very important to me as a Hispanic American because it shows that everyone from all backgrounds are welcomed to an establishment."
Freshman,4,"As I am only a Freshman at Lesley and have only completed a single semester I don't know all there is to know about it. However I do know that I really enjoyed going to school and being in class, all the professors were very personable and kept class interesting. I enjoyed being in the area and on campus a lot and I plan to continue there for the next 3 years."
Senior,4,"I really appreciate the knowledge of Holistic approaches. Also, the classes helped me to be aware of the unhealthy generational patterns/addictions and how to overcome it."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time at Lesley University very much. It is located in Cambridge which is right outside of Boston which is such a great intellectually geared college city with many historical and cultural points of interest. Lesley offers some amazing and unique programs that are taught with a humanistic approach that truly values the opinions and views of there students. The staff at Lesley I found very accomodating and willing to go the extra step to help out their students so they can succeed. The student life at Lesley is very supportive and fun as well. The student life has a great balance of serious study and fun which allows students to get the most out of their college experience. The downfalls of Lesley would be their dorms and financial aid office. The dorms are pretty lack luster and their always seems to be something that needs to be straightened out at the financial aid office due to errors or something else.
Niche User,4,It has a great location but the streets to get there are pretty rocky. Everyone is extremely nice and try their hardest to accommodate your needs. They are really inclusive when it comes to genders and sexuality.
Niche User,4,"Lesley University is an amazing investment. They have programs such as Dual Degree and Double Majoring that make getting a job very accessible after schooling. The campus is also unique, the line between Lesley Area and the outside world are practically seamless. Instead of being in a college bubble, a person can feel like they are a part of society, with two train stations a quick walk away and Harvard Square beyond. This is not a school that wants to drop its students at the end of their schooling, this is a school eager to help a student start their adult life and integration."
Sophomore,4,"There are a variety of majors suitable for a lot of different students. The classes are small, so students are able to stay in contact with their professors more easily, making the workload more manageable, and learning more effective. The students are activists, driven and intelligent. On campus, there are clubs and lots of events held on campus throughout the school year, giving students a lot to do outside of classes. Given the location of Lesley University, there is even more for students to do, being in the Cambridge and Boston area. Being able to take part in a small campus as well as a large city simultaneously makes for the best experience."
Niche User,4,"I went to Lesley for an official overnight as an athletic recruit. Everything about the University made me feel right at home. There was lots to do around the campus and it didn't feel too overwhelming. After touring the campus, I went on the T-train to visit the city of Boston. We had a blast!"
Junior,4,"It's pretty alright. Teachers are very good. Some others aren't. If you're looking for a diverse university, this is definitely not the place. The university is mostly filled with white students with POC spread out. This includes teachers. The dorms are alright unless you get stuck in white hall which may come with problems. The food is pretty good but you get tired after a while due to the lack of variety."
Freshman,4,"I just finished my first semester here and so far so good. Being a LUCAD student, it's like a go to a different school which I enjoy. From what I hear from some of my peers, some of the CLAS professors are not up to par. I can't speak too much on it because my experience is completely different. From what I've seen and experienced, Lesley University is very inclusive with the events and clubs available on campus. The only negative thing I have to say about the school is the class registration process. Every single person I know, including me, were unable to get into their classes for spring semester. However, the administrators did a great job at helping me get into all my classes and I'm assuming they so with others too."
Sophomore,4,"As someone who is passionate about social justice and good academic programs, I love attending Lesley University. It is an adjustment for some people, but I feel as though I'm constantly learning in and outside the classroom. The party scene isn't very big, but living in Cambridge and next to Boston, you don't need a party scene for the school. Fantastic overall."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Lesley. It is in such a great area and ensures that you are prepared for whatever career you are pursuing by making it mandatory to take part in multiple internships. This gives you experience as well as allows you to make connections with people already active in your field. As far as things I would like to see change; as a commuter student I wish that there were more spaces for commuters to meet and interact more easily with campus life. Also, the food isn't the best and I know that it is difficult for people who live on campus to find a good variety of food. Other than that, I love the area and the enjoy the vibe of the school and would recommend it to others, especially those who are interested in the education and or art fields!"
College Sophomore,4,I like the sushi places and japanese inspired restaurants. They are or were run by real japanese.
College Freshman,4,"There are so many colleges in the area, so especially if you're willing to have a longer commute its easy to find an apartment or house."
College Freshman,4,Use financial aid and apply for scholarships!
College Freshman,4,"Brattle is beautiful, a little bit of a walk though"
College Freshman,4,The only thing about it is that it's pricey.
College Freshman,4,"I got enough aid that I didn't need to pay for the first semester, and I used some leftover money to help pay what I have left for the second semester."
College Freshman,4,"It's pretty good. If you're looking for something fast and tasty, the dinning halls have food ready for you. It tastes pretty fresh and the only downside is that it can get a bit repetitive."
College Senior,4,Class sizes are small and intimate. The professors all know you by name and are very open to helping students the best they can. Some of the classes are taught by new adjunct teachers- some of which should not be teaching and consequently taught very little with a lot of confusion to what needs the students have. Long term professors are over all excellent. They are working professionals in their field and offer a wealth of knowledge and experience. I have had more positive experiences with my professors than poor experiences. There is a lot of open discussion and a lot of independent learning. The down fall with open discussions is that students can get side tracked and offer personal experiences pertaining little to what the topic of the day is. It becomes frustrating when the professors allow personal stories become the focus of the class versus actually learning from the professor.
College Senior,4,"Parking is strictly enforced and very limited. Parking is also very expensive. The dorm rules depend on the RA- residential attendants. Some RAs are very strict, and others a lenient unless students are blatantly disobeying dorm rules. Honor codes are very much enforced."
College Senior,4,"There is a wide selection of interesting and unique options for dining out. Unfortunately for the average college student, many restaurants are expensive. The food is fantastic and very convenient. There is a high volume of great restaurants, pubs, and bars in close proximity to each other. There is easy accessibility by walking or public transportation. I haven't encountered many student discounts."
College Freshman,4,"The area of Cambridge/Boston is a great place for students to take in. The atmosphere is very up beat and lively because there is always something to do. The local people are mostly made of up young professions and local college students so there is a welcoming feeling from people around you, with that being said that type of attitude towards the college students in the area  is based of of years of good behavior and respect of the town your living in. Really just being able to carry yourself and respect others around you allows for people in the area to think highly of the students in the area. With attractions , activities and events in the area there is ALWAYS something going on next week from the cultural festivals, boston calling, Berkley music festival, fluff fest , quincy market christmas tree lighting and the boston marathon. Year round, season to season there is always some type of event going on throughout the city. There are all museums and the science center available to students and is a great thing to do on the weekends. If sports are your thing there here in Cambridge/Boston you can see a Bruins game or a red sox game and even visit colleges like Harvard for their football games, or Boston College, Northeastern, Boston University for basketball ,soccer or hockey games. All tickets are not that inexpensive and is a great way to get off campus. Speaking off getting off campus there are many forms of transportation, the local T and Bus are primarily the ways to get around the city and they can usually be pretty convenient. They are cheap as well and can run pretty fast, occasional some T lines like the green line can take a little bit longer just because of the busy areas it travels through. If you can get used to using the bus then thats a great things to use and can be faster at times. Additionally cabs can vary in prices depending on how far your planning on traveling and the commuter rail allows you to visit surround towns like Salem or Danvers."
College Junior,4,"If you're living on campus, I'd highly recommend Brattle Campus. While they're a 10 or 20 minute walk from most classes (or a short shuttle or bike ride), the buildings are absolutely beautiful and the rooms are big. Brattle also has a nicer dining hall with better food, though there are a few less options. Doble Campus is not so nice in my opinion, but if you're looking for a more traditional dorm setting that's where you'll want to live."
College Junior,4,"Lesley University takes mental health very seriously. They offer 10 counseling sessions with graduate students/interns per semester. While the first time I visited the Counseling Center, my personal counselor was not a good fit, I had a great experience with my second try and ended up seeing her for all ten sessions that semester. While I wish I could have continued seeing her, I was only given those ten sessions. She did, however, give me references for people in the area that I could contact and offered to work with me to find someone else if none of them worked out. She was great and offered me a lot of support.

As for physical health, I have only had to visit Health Services a few times. They offer free condoms, HIV/STD testing, pregnancy tests, and Plan B. While I have not utilized all of those services, I know that many people have. One drawback is the requirement to make an appointment. Especially if you have a tight schedule, it can be difficult to make appointments work. You cannot, for example, walk in and ask for an Advil if you have a headache. I also have a friend who needed to acquire Plan B after a long weekend. She could not afford to get it on her own and the office is not open on weekends. She called first thing to schedule an appointment, but had a whole lot of trouble getting an appointment with them. Because there is a time limit for it to be effective after unprotected sex, she NEEDED to get it ASAP. She ended up getting them to squeeze her in, but she had to skip a class to do it. My experiences have all been pretty good. The nurse practitioners are all competent and kind, but sometimes visiting another clinic ends up being a whole lot easier if you have a tight schedule."
College Junior,4,"There aren't many parties on campus because not many people live on campus and there is no Greek life. A lot of students, however, host parties off campus on the weekends. They're kind of hit or miss. Some nights there are 5 good parties you want to go to and some nights there are none. They aren't generally ragers. Because most students live in Cambridge, Somerville, or Allston with a lot of neighbors they can't get too big. They parties are generally fun though. There's a lot of public transportation access so you can get pretty much anywhere you want to go in the area fairly easily. Getting home can be expensive if you stay out too late and have to take a cab, but as long as you're not too far you can walk home from a lot of places, especially in Somerville or Allston. If you're into clubs, I'm told that there are quite a few options because Lesley's so close to Boston, but I've never been too interested in them."
College Junior,4,We're near all the T stops for the bus and the subway
College Junior,4,"There's so much that's available to on-campus students, but it is expensive"
College Junior,4,This school is very accepting and open of diversity
College Junior,4,This school because of its location struggles with providing fields on campus for all of its sports but they make up for it by being able to use nice facilities of nearby schools.
College Freshman,4,"Great place to be if you identify as LGBTQ and/or trans*. Diversity is widely accepted here, which is awesome. It's a pretty liberal school so a super conservative person would probably feel out of place.  Also, feminism is HUGE here."
College Freshman,4,"Boston/Cambridge is a fantastic area. Lesley is small, so there isn't much on-campus activity, especially on the weekends, but if you're willing to leave campus, you'll find fun stuff to do. The T is so convenient, and it stops at plenty of places near museums, restaurants, clubs, bars, shows, shopping, sports venues, etc. Boston has some of the biggest sports teams to see, if you are into that. There is lots of cool dining options that are super diverse, even for people who have restricted diets. It's difficult to save money because of how many cool and trendy places there are to shop at here. The atmosphere is probably the best part of living in the area."
Sophomore,2,"Lesley is a very good school for specific majors and individuals. The ideas and beliefs that the school has are strong, but they often only see one side. They cater to a specific group of people, and it does not work for everyone."
Alum,2,"Professionally this school is a joke. I'm working full time within the animation industry solely off my own connections and gained the necessary skills to do so from YouTube tutorials. Socially this school is alright. Made lots of friends, and it's a college area so one can easily intermingle with nearby schools and student bodies. There's a lot of one-dimensional political philosophy floating around. Simple utopian ideals grounded in negativity void of practical solution. Preaching to the secular choir. Not recommended."
Niche User,2,"This is a small and very isolated school.  There is not a big social life at all, and the population is very very small. It is not rare to  While the small class sizes are nice, there is not much if any diversity at Lesley.  The classes are not challenging at Lesley, accommodations can and will be given for any reason at all.  This is a great school for art, but for other types of education especially Psychology this is not a challenging and beneficial program.  The professors are very kind and can become great mentors, but the courses are simply not difficult enough to cause challenge and greater thinking.  I found myself to be very bored and not motivated in the classes.  Cambridge is a great location!"
Sophomore,2,"This is a very specific environment here. Most students live off campus. Commuter life is not ideal. There is a clear highschool mentality here it is pretty sad. For a school that claims to be ""inclusive"" that only count if your either a weirdo yourself. If you are looking for any normal college experience this isn't it. Everyone is always competing with each other to see how alternative and out there they are.  The mental health at this school is just terrible. Everyone is depressed. There was a poll last semester and they found that 75% of Lesley students were struggling with depression and anxiety. There is no social aspect to this campus, if you are looking to make friends, this isn't the place to do it. Besides the few professors here being its saving grace, waste your money elsewhere or stay home and apply again."
Freshman,2,I'm currently a student at Lesley University and from my personal experience the programs are amazing. Overall the professors are understanding and the classes really help you succeed in your field. BUT the services here are absolutely AWFUL. Residence life did a terrible job pairing me with a roommate and when there was an emergency and I needed to get a new room they took forever plus they are impossible to get a hold of and NEVER answer their emails. As for health services and disability they are just as bad if not WORSE.Appointments take forever to schedule and you could be sick for weeks before getting the actual help you need. The food here is not the best and the White Hall Dormitory is absolute hell for anyone who enjoys thing clean or quiet. I WOULD NOT recommend going to this school unless you're a commuter.
College Sophomore,2,The soccer teams are good. The school plays as a D3 school and to many students the sports are irrelevant unless they play sports. This aspect is terrible. The school spirit is very low because nobody knows how to get the fields and doesn't know about any type of sport.
College Sophomore,2,Lesley is not a party school so you would need to go somewhere else for that.
College Freshman,2,"Not good, at least where I lived (Wolfard.) My room was originally supposed to be a single, but it was technically too big, so they made it a double. It's far too small for two people to live in. The building is very old and not nice at all. The CAs (Lesley speak for RAs) try very hard to facilitate activities, but most of the time the students think they're too cool for them. I lived on Doble, which is the hideous campus in comparison to Brattle, but Doble is much more conveniently located."
College Senior,2,"The majority of the student body is female. An average Lesley girl is a vegan hipster who listens to obscure bands, who constantly talks about her feelings and how everything is ironic. The male population is mostly gay, and there is a very small percentage of straight guys. Everyone is very open to all life styles."
College Senior,2,The sports teams are often over looked. The gym facilities are horrendously out dated and poorly maintained. There are very poor hours that are not conducive to most students schedules. The gym is stuffy and crowded with old machinery. A decent amount of machines are broken and haven't been fixed in years. Sports teams are not heavily supported. Most students are not even aware of what sports are available.
College Senior,2,"The school is quite small. The parties are generally equivalent to a small gathering with friends where you can chat casually, socialize and drink."
College Freshman,2,"On campus there are rarely parties going on, if anything it hosted by the baseball teams or the soccer teams in surrounding towns like somerville or Allston which can make getting to them and back home either difficult , time consuming or expensive.Even with those types of parties being hosted they are usually pretty exclusive to either just teammates or to only other athletes on campus. Being an athlete myself they can still be pretty fun. Some kids will host things in their houses or apartments but event those have a certain amount of people and noise that they will take. Most kids go to the bigger universities in the city like MIT, Harvard or Boston University if they are trying to go out. But if your 21 and over there are some great bars and clubs that the city has to offer."
College Junior,2,Parking costs so much for students. I think there should be a student discount then a regular price for the public
College Freshman,2,"It's a D-III school, and there are several sports teams. However, no one really cares about sports unless you are on the team. I've never been to a game or known where they are, or seen any school spirit, which is something I personally enjoy. If you're looking for a school with a huge football stadium and tailgating, don't go here."
College Freshman,2,im not very familiar with what it takes to get into a specific program.
College Freshman,2,I live in boston so it snows ALL THE TIME. Which makes commuting for me very difficult
Recent Alumnus,2,The Dining halls are really bad! They don't have very good options and we struggle if you have food allergies and vegan options! 
College Sophomore,2,Its New england its cold!
College Sophomore,2,Cambridge. I would not live there.
College Sophomore,2,It is always cold. If you like snow then this is the place for you!
College Freshman,2,"The drivers are insane but get you to where you need to go. The bus is rickety and creaks with every turn or bump in the road, but again, it gets you to where you need to go."
College Sophomore,2,"Public Safety isn't strict, but residence life is extremely strict. Therefore if you are doing anything in your dorm room that you're not supposed to be doing, they WILL find out."
College Sophomore,2,I feel like Lesley isn't that diverse because everyone that goes there can afford the tuition or got a scholarship. I wish it was more diverse though.
College Junior,2,"Not for Everyone – This school really isn't for everyone. A very particular kind of person thrives at Lesley. If you love to be involved, or never found you're ""place"" in high school, though, you'll probably love it here."
College Junior,2,70-30 Ratio – Until recently Lesley was an all-girl school and still seems it at times. Being an education school attracts mostly girls which means a wide variety of girls are here. Boys are really hit or miss - either here for the ratio or genuinely into helping others.
College Junior,2,"Education School – This really depends on what you are going to school for. Lesley earned its reputation as an Education school and definitely caters to that major - to the point of ignoring other majors. That being said, if you're sure you want to teach, Lesley is the place for you. Classes in the major are rigorous and the school really pushes students to do their best. Most students are student teaching by the end of their Sophomore year."
College Sophomore,2,"Art Students Will Be Art Students – Drugs are generally just part of the ""art scene"" for the AIB students at Lesley.  There's not a lot of pressure to do drugs, but they are definitely available for anyone who is interested."
College Sophomore,2,"Trains Are Most Reliable – The school has a shuttle system in place that is suppose to drive students from the Cambridge campus to their classes in Boston but it is less than reliable. Most of the time they are not on time and they come so infrequently that if you miss a shuttle, or it is too full, it may be over an hour before the next shuttle. I have been over two hours late to classes because the shuttles are too full and the school refuses to acknowledge student complaints about not having enough shuttles to fulfill their promise of a free shuttle. I suggest taking the train. It's more reliable and you will often times get to class before the shuttle does."
College Sophomore,2,"Some days are better than others, but I have found the facilities to be of far lower quality than I thought I was paying for. The dining hall on my campus is not open Friday nights for dinner or on the weekends. The building I am living in is so old that the temperature is never right. They crank the heat in the winter and then it just escapes from all the cracks in the windows immediately after entering the room. There have been several times where the power has gone out on our campus along with a false fire alarm emergency. We do not have a doorknob on our door and there are many other complaints that I have about the facilities here. To sum it all up, this school is like paying for a first class plane ticket and you find out your seat is atop the in flight bathroom. You pay too much money for the quality here."
College Freshman,2,"The food at Lesley's Brattle Campus, Porter Cafe, and, Charlie's, or the student center, tends to be really delicious, but options become repetitive/limited, mid-semester. 

White hall, the main dining commons, is home to the NASTIEST scrambled eggs,and is also very limited when it comes to options. 

Most of the time, my friends & I just use DiningIn, or go grab food at one of the Mass Ave/Harvard Sq. Restaurants. The restaurants near Lesley make up for the, ""Meh"", of the dining commons, but it stinks to have to use your own personal money to buy food, when you have dining dollars. 

CashLynx would be so much better to have, if more locations accepted them, otherwise, it isn't as great of a system that the school makes it out to be."
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you are introverted, this campus is very quiet and uninteresting. There is a severe drinking policy on this campus, so go elsewhere to drink. If you are caught, you are likely subject to expulsion, so I wouldn't try to do it. There are 19+ clubs all over the place, just hop on the T or take a taxi for a fun night out!"
College Sophomore,2,It gets COLD here. It snows a pretty decent amount - New England winters can be exceptionally rough. Classes aren't typically cancelled but professors are very understanding when it comes to commuting. Boston is beautiful once it warms up but the dorms hear start to burn up during the warmer months.
College Junior,2,"We have things sometimes, movies and performances, but no one ever advertises them. There's posters. That's it. And it's the same people coming back to perform."
College Junior,2,There is no greek life at Lesley University. I wish this would change because I would love to be a part of a sorority.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a limited number of parking spots on campus, which are usually reserved for commuters. However if you have people visiting by car, they can buy a weekend or weekday parking permit.

You really don't need a car if you live on campus, basically everything is in walking distance."
College Senior,2,"Out of Date – Lesley needs to upgrade! Some of the dorms are really nice (suites, houses), but others are basically falling apart. They are upgrading slowly: they just built a new library and gym. I think they're doing a decent job considering they are in the middle of a city..."
College Junior,2,"Too Much – The drug scene at Lesley is growing and becoming hard to live around. The students, especially the freshmen, have been engaging in smoking marijuana more often and it is jeopardizing other student's comfort levels. I live in Doble hall where it constantly smells like marijuana and I am growing sick of it."
College Sophomore,2,"In terms of the political views, sexual orientation, religion, and other intellectual diversity Lesley has a very accepting and diverse environment. However, in terms of race, ethnicity, and economic background it is relatively diverse considering that it is an expensive private institution."
College Sophomore,2,No parking...unless you pay for one of the limited parking spots OR use the parking meters on the street. But it's Cambridge...
College Freshman,2,"Expensive, I Rather Take the T – Parking is very expensive at Lesley. Many commuters prefer taking the T because the location of our school prevents students from having cars on campus."
Alum,1,Only had to do online classes during COVID  and wasn’t a fan though I liked it better then being a full time student here.
Alum,1,Before you go to this school know that Lesley has a terrible social scene. Four years going to school here and absolutely no party’s unless you were on the sports teams. The people at this school loved to play the victim and were just bizarre (not in a good way). Im a liberal but the art school here is the extreme left wing. Most of the teachers in the art department as well as basically all the students had a very black and white mindset. One could never mention any viewpoints that opposed the far left here as they would instantly be shunned and told they were wrong for thinking that way. I was silenced multiple times and literally told that my opinion was invalid because I am a “cis white male.” I can only speak for the art department when I say don’t waste your money here. If it weren’t for a few good friends I had here who felt the same way about this school I would have dropped out. Bummer college experience :(
Sophomore,1,"If I could give this school zero stars, I would. Lesley University is 110% a scam. The facilities are disgusting, rancid smelling, and infested with mice, the professors and admins are elitist jerks (especially in the history department), the people look like they came from outer space, and the food sent tons of people to the hospital. there's no school spirit at all, and the price tag is waaaay too high for what is actually provided. DON'T GO TO LESLEY. You'll regret it, like I did."
Junior,1,"From the bottom of my heart, I urge you not to attend this school. I am currently in my junior year here at Lesley University and it is an overall terrible institution. The ONLY bright spots here are a group of professors who are good people and genuinely care for your growth and development, along with some good people at the school to befriend. No one is helpful within financial aid and I have plenty of horror stories regarding lack of communication on VERY important things regarding my money. The athletic department does not care for the athletes. I am not referring to professors gifting you good grades due to athletic status. As an athlete, your life is much harder. All athletic facilities are a 15 - 20 minute drive from the campus. The students are expected to acquire a van license and drive themselves. The athletic trainer is a good person, but is hardly ever available for any kind of treatments or help needed. The food / student life / dorms / and campus are all terrible."
Sophomore,1,"Don't walk away-RUN! Average, not what you'd expect from a private university, or the cost of tuition. The administration is rude and arrogant. The dorms on Doble Campus are old, filthy and falling apart. There is a terrible mouse infestation and when you inquire about this the standard response is ""this is the city."" The disgusting smell that will smack you in the face upon entering the McKenna Student Center is from the food you will be eating every day. The dining hall food is awful, consisting mostly of rice. Expect to be living on Zantac for the entire semester. There is absolutely no school spirit. It is hard to imagine where your tuition money goes. The majority of the students at this school seem to be depressed. If you are looking for a happy, memorable college experience do not attend this school, you will regret it!"
Alum,1,"Living with mice for an entire year....... EW!!!!!!!!!! Also Lesley dorms SUCK! Unsanitary and disgusting, shouldn't have to live with this."
Freshman,1,I would like to see greater diversity and greater acceptance for commuter students among residents. I did not like the fact that I had to basically hunt down other commuter students and the fact that I was outcasted by the resident students. 
College Sophomore,1,"Lesley preaches a lot about diversity, connections and being there for the student. Yet it puts about twenty percent of that into action. If you are a female and white you are cared for and listened to the most. If you are male and god forbid a student of color then you will have a lot of things against you. If you come here you would have to be very careful on how you say things and interact with other people because you will be attacked. Sensitivity is huge here, and not in the cultural sensitivity aspect but the ""you hurt my feelings so you are an idiot"" aspect. The Financial Aid office hosts some of the rudest people imaginable and you will experience racist professors. If you want something done you have to fight, and fight hard. They are more willing to say no to the student to avoid extra paperwork then letting you fulfill your full potential. The College of Art and Design does a much better job of being there for the students, though it probably has to do with the fact that it used to be the Art Institute of Boston."
College Junior,1,There is no party scene unless you enjoy standing in someone's apartment drinking beer talking to the same 15 people every time. If you want a party scene don't come here
College Senior,1,"Not only is the administration incompetent, they are crooks who charge for non-existent courses. Fraud!!"
College Senior,1,"It's not so much that the dorms are bad--some of them are actually nice--it's the administration (i.e. ""housing process"") that is the problem."
College Sophomore,1,Horrible. You need to pay the meters every two hours.
College Sophomore,1,"The food here is atrocious. It isn't healthy for you, as their main additive must be sodium. It caters mainly to rancid, rotting, vegan food. Rice is served every night. Please send help."
College Sophomore,1,The shuttle service is very unreliable and inconvenient.
College Sophomore,1,"The Business Management Major at Lesley University is lacking. There are about 3-4 professors that teach most of the classes and you pretty much learn the same thing in each class. No one takes it seriously and its a joke. Its really sad because if you're not an education, psychology, counseling, or any of the helping professions major, you're not getting your money's worth."
College Freshman,1,Lesley doesn't offer on campus parking to non commuters or people other than faculty member. and if you are a commuter and can't use public transportation it costs $300 bucks a semester to get a permit.
College Freshman,1,"The cost to have an apartment is really outrages, extremely expensive. Not including having to pay to park your car on the street every night."
College Freshman,1,"As you can expect form most schools in the Boston area, parking is difficult. It depends on which campus you are looking to park at. University Hall has a large parking lot in the back, which costs a dollar for the first hour. Past an hour and the fee goes up, but it is still cheap compared to other lots in the area. Main campus has smaller lots, as well as brattle campus which has very small lots but they are always open. For parking on campus you always need to purchase a parking pass which is 8 dollars from the university. Because of this, the best way to park free is to find street parking (which is nearly impossible). Also, from my experience it is safe to park on brattle campus for a few hours without getting ticketed, but you are always taking a risk."
College Freshman,1,Wireless Internet – The wireless at my school is the biggest piece of s*** ever.
College Senior,1,"There is very limited parking at Lesley.  As a commuter student who uses a car, you either need to have a Cambridge parking permit which allows you to park on the street (though street parking is also limited) or you can be entered into the commuter student parking lottery.  Through this process, some people are granted a parking pass each year.  There is a new lottery every year.  I find this whole situation to be an extreme hassel, but given that public transportation is close to ever part of campus, it makes more sense not to bring your car."

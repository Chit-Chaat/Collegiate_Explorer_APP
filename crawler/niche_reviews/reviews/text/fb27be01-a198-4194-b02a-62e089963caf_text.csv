Junior,5,Millsaps provides a unique experience with small class sizes and dedicated professors and advisors. The college is its own community.
Alum,5,Millsaps College provided the best 5 (including graduate school) years of my life. At Millsaps you are a person not a number. You get consistent 1 on 1 attention from professors who care about you. The business school is incomparable and provided me a great platform for me to spread my wings and start my career right after graduation. I made my forever best friends through sports and Greek life and as I look to marry my future husband (a Millsaps alum as well) will be surrounded by all of our successful Millsaps peers.
Niche User,5,"I do not attend Millsaps College but I will the fall of 2020. I heard about them because their track and field coach reach out to me and I have been hooked ever since. The coaching staff has kept in touch with me and been there for me if I ever needed to ask questions.  My parents and I have heard nothing but excellent things about the academic programs and how in depth the professors will mentor their students. We toured the campus many times and I have met with professors, staff, and students that are extremely friendly and open minded to new things. The students at this college want to learn and want to be the best versions of themselves they can possibly become. Also, the staff went out of their way to show my parents and I around the campus and provide us with information that they had to search to find. I would recommend this college to anyone who wants to physically and mentally challenge themselves to become the next big thing."
Junior,5,The smaller class sizes have allowed me more direct learning experiences. The philanthropy makes the school unique in the giving experience. The opportunity to participate in many clubs and organizations is amazing.
Freshman,5,"I have only been at millsaps a year but it feels like forever at this school. I have made friends that will last me forever, passed tests in subjects that used to terrify me, and have already seen my overall personality shift into a more positive light. If anyone is looking for a college that will prepare them for medical school and hold them to a higher standard millsaps is the place for them."
Freshman,5,"Classes are difficult but the professors are so nice and genuinely care about the success of their students and will do whatever it takes to ensure that every student understands the course material. Wonderful school with wonderful students, professors, and staff."
Freshman,5,"I'm just starting my freshman year and I'm absolutely loving it! I am a basketball player and my teammates and coaches are amazing! Everyone makes me feel like I'm at home. Wouldn't change anything except maybe giving athletic scholarships so you wouldn't have to worry about paying for school to go here, because it's very expensive."
Senior,5,Millsaps College offers a close knit community of students and faculty that fosters growth and provides only the best education. Millsaps makes it easy to stay on top of academics while being involved on campus and in the community.
Freshman,5,Millsaps is one of the most dedicated schools to education. They are truly concerned about you receiving. The best education and graduating ready for work or for furthering your education. The campus is beautiful and I feel very safe here.
Senior,5,"Millsaps College has provided me with leadership opportunities, community engagement programs, and academic resources.  Through my time at Millsaps, I have gained confidence as I have taken on various leadership roles in student life.  Furthermore, the small class sizes allow for one on one interactions and relationships with professors that have afforded me opportunities that only a small college can offer.  In regards to its students, Millsaps works to create a diverse environment.  As a result, I have had the opportunity to make friends and meet people with different backgrounds which has expanded my world view.  Overall, Millsaps has shaped me into the person I am today."
Alum,5,"Great, tight-knit community with a strong focus on personal growth, writing and interdisciplinary studies."
Freshman,5,"Millsaps is a terrific small school. The environment is very welcoming, and you will quickly learn to meet many people on campus and have great academic relationships with professors. The work is tough, especially when you take on many activities (as many students do), but it is so worth the experience. There are also many opportunities that the school provides to advance you into your chosen field and to succeed after college. Overall, it is a fantastic small liberal arts college!"
Freshman,5,Great atmosphere and interactive classes with professors that care about your education and learning process
College Junior,5,"Jackson is not the safest place in Mississippi, however, Millsaps does a wonderful job of making students and families feel safe and secure while living on campus."
College Junior,5,Our Greek life is responsible and a great asset to the Jackson community. Philanthropy events are always a huge success for how small the school is and the people are very dedicated and worthwhile.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I only participated in the survey to write this review.  Well, I suppose it's less a review than a rant.  The fact that MSU and Ole Miss are ranked higher than Millsaps is offensive.  People are entitled to have opinions; but when they are this blatantly wrong, I had to say something. Not only is Millsaps better academically than either of the top two candidates on this list, it is better, by a huge margin, at preparing it's students in a much more profound and holistic manner for life and being a good person.  The acceptance of all races, religions and the like are so much more deeply rooted in what makes Millsaps what it is.  So in closing, believe whatever you would like.  Just know we know the truth."
College Junior,5,We have the best and most caring professors. They truly care about the success of each and every student. The class sizes are small and varied.
College Junior,5,Internships and on campus job opportunities are vast and easily available.
College Junior,5,The small class sizes and personable professors are extremely helpful. There are also many opportunities for internships and jobs.
College Freshman,5,There are so many resources and opportunities for students to take advantage of. There are also friendly people around every corner waiting to see how they can help shape your future.
College Freshman,5,the admin staff is so helpful and always willing to help. shoutout to Tye Menist in admissions! he's the best.
College Freshman,5,There are a couple of malls where you can shop and it's pretty decent. They have free people in Jackson which is a plus. The students at Millsaps participate a lot in the community as well as helping out in the community. Millsaps has a program called Wellsprings where they help out in the local public schools. Jackson is a busy city so there is always something going on and a lot of things to do.
College Freshman,5,"There are a variety of people. It is very easy to find people just like you that are your friends, people who aren't like you but are still your friends, and you have those people that are just fun to be around when you are going out. Everyone is everywhere because it is such a small school so you have those certain groups or people that you do certain things with. But no matter where you are, you will find a friend even and especially when you are not looking for one."
College Freshman,5,Security is very good at their jobs. There is not a lot of crime or problems on campus. The real crime is in the certain parts of Jackson but Millsaps College does a GREAT job of protecting its students with information and security.
College Freshman,5,"There are a lot of family owned or non chain restaurants so there is plenty variety. Sal and Mookie's is a very well owned pizza place, which is used a lot for gatherings. They also do ice cream as well and there are a lot of discounts. There is a good bit of fast food like Taco Bell, Cain's, Whattaburger, Arby's, and McDonald's. There are lots of gas stations for late night coffee runs, snacks, and drinks. There are plenty of bars and clubs to go to when you don't want to stay on campus; plus, Jackson has uber so you don't have to worry about driving if you don't want to. Millsaps College usually does a good job of advertising local businesses and restaurants; they love to promote the city of Jackson. It really is a cool place to live even if you don't go outside of Millsaps gates all that often."
College Freshman,5,"I get financial aid from academic scholarship. Millsaps College gave me the most money, but then again, it is the most expensive school in Mississippi. It is well worth it too! I also get money from a PACT. The staff at Millsaps are very helpful and easy to talk to so if you do encounter a problem, they are always on the other end of the line to help."
College Freshman,5,"The new dorms and New South are the nicest places to live. I like the new dorms because you do not have a roommate and you only have to share a bathroom with one other person. The social atmosphere is good. There is always something school related going on if you are into that. The frat houses always have something going on, even if it is low key; or people tend to just go hangout with each other in their rooms or in someone's house off campus. The food is pretty good and Reuben's is open until 2 am so you can get something late. The dorms (except Bacot) have elevators so it is easy to move in and out as long as you have boxes you can throw all the little/random things into."
College Freshman,5,We have been able to take advantage of all aspects of life in Jackson!
College Freshman,5,easy to apply and receive
College Sophomore,5,"They call us ""Chillsaps"" for a reason. The campus security--which does have some drawbacks--is typically very lenient about alcohol policy (not so much drugs). The RAs are generally pretty relaxed with most policies; visitation policies don't actually exist here. Honor Code, in my opinion, is the strictest part about the administration."
College Sophomore,5,"Greek Life at Millsaps is the optimal type of greek life. Greeks and non-greeks get along; greeks from one organizations and greeks from another get along. There is a very relaxed atmosphere--compared to state schools. Rush is not as big a deal as bigger schools. Being greek is also not very expensive. ALSO, from other comments I've seen, please note that there have been black sororities and fraternities in the past; they were closed due to lack of participation or for hazing. I hear that AKA is coming back soonish. BUT, because of this, few people of minorities choose to rush; however, there is no prejudice to those who do (they would bee very welcomed into Millsaps greek life)! Oh, and Millsaps has a very strict no hazing policy for all of greek life!"
College Sophomore,5,"I really like Millsaps because they're very accepting of different cultures and religious. I'm used to people telling other religions that they're going to burn in hell if they don't accept Christ. At Millsaps, we have an interfaith ceremony at the beginning of each year where people of different faiths come together and have a worship service. It's wonderful!! We tend to be very accepting. As for race, many ethnicities tend to be separated, and I know it's mainly because of Greek Life which I don't agree with at all."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my major so much!! We get to study the media and all its flaws. I think it's beautiful to finally have others agree that the American system is very flawed. The coursework tends to be pretty heavy since classes tend to meet only twice a week, but it's very interesting!!"
College Sophomore,5,"Registration is very simple. I do mine way before the registration process. The professors are extremely helpful and practically beg for you to see them and ask for help. The professors here are more caring than those in high school!! The library study rooms are the best. They tend to be a little warm, and you can't talk loud in them. Everybody will hear your conversations. I learned that the hard way. I think the curriculum is very do-able, but I took AP classes in high school to prepare me."
College Sophomore,5,I didn't really have any trouble getting into Millsaps. It did take a month before they told me whether or not I was accepted. That was a pretty stressful month.
College Sophomore,5,"I have an internship now. I work two days a week for $8 an hour. It's an amazing pay, and I get to use things I've learned in other classes at Millsaps other than those in my major. I think that's pretty cool."
College Sophomore,5,Our campus is so friendly and accepting of everyone.
College Sophomore,5,"Safety is first on campus, but the school just lets us enjoy college!"
College Freshman,5,"Millsaps participates in Division III athletics. Most kids who come to Millsaps play a varsity sport. The Football team wins on a consistent basis competes for the conference championship almost every year. The Baseball team made the College World Series in 2013. Both the men and women's basketball teams are competitive and have huge turn outs in the crowd and student section. Other sports that are successful include soccer, lacrosse, softball, volleyball, golf, and tennis. Fans are very outgoing and support all varsity sports year round."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are very fun and keep class interesting.  The registration process is pretty easy and your adviser is always available to help.  At points the workload can get hard, but for the most part it is always manageable and easy to keep up with social interests as well as academic ones."
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very nice.  The department is awesome and class is always a blast.  The teachers are amazing nice and love teaching students.
College Freshman,5,"Campus is extremely diverse.  We have everyone from very liberal to very conservative, and many fall right in the middle.  There are many religions on campus as well as political affiliations."
College Freshman,5,Close knit community within the school. It's a very fun place to be able to go to school and live for four years. Get to know your classmates and professors really well because of the small class size.
College Freshman,5,"There are almost always spots open all across campus.  It only gets crowded by Greek Row at night, but even then most of the time you can find a spot."
College Freshman,5,"I love Millsaps.  I thought that coming here might not have been the best choice, but now I realize that it would have been a mistake had I gone anywhere else. The people were very nice. It was easy to make friends. Everyone is polite.  There is never a dull or boring moment because there is always something to do! The education you get is one of a kind and is respected across the country.  I love Millsaps and am so happy I picked to come here."
College Freshman,5,"About half of Millsaps students participate in greek life. There are 5 fraternities (Lambda Chi/Pike/SAE/Kappa Sigma/KA) and 4 sororities (KD/Chi Omega/ Tri Delta/Phi Mu). Fraternity row is located on the south side of campus, and the sorority lodges are at the north. Greek students are very involved school activities and the surrounding community. Parties are open to all students, and has a positive impact on the social atmosphere. Greek students and non greek students get along with no problems.  Greek housing opportunities differ depending upon which fraternity you are in. All the houses have rooms available to live in, but you cant live in the sorority lodges."
College Freshman,5,"The career center really helps students find internships, jobs, and the classes they need to take to get the most out of their major.  Everyone around campus is very nice.  It is not uncommon to walk across campus and have people say hello to you that you don't know just being nice."
College Freshman,5,Campus is the perfect size where you don't rely on campus transportation to get around.  Campus is right across the street from tons of restaurants and Fondren is right down the street.
College Freshman,5,"Great weather. Spring is very pleasant with temperatures ranging from 60-70 degrees. Hot summers like anywhere else in the south, but it cools down considerably throughout the fall semester. Winter gets fairly cold, and occasionally snows."
College Freshman,5,"The Admissions and Financial Aid Offices really helped me get the money I needed to come here.  They were easy to get in touch with, very kind, and you only need a 2.0 to retain your scholarship."
College Student,5,I got a decent amount of financial aid and a ton of money in academic scholarships
College Student,5,It's easy to get into any program you want
College Student,5,I love being a History major and have a close relationship with some of my professors
College Freshman,5,"The weather isn't a huge factor in my experience. I'm from Mississippi so I am used to the crazy weather, 80 degrees one day and 40 the next."
College Freshman,5,"The food is great. There are always options. We have two places to eat other than in the cafeteria, Reubens and Kava Cafe. I enjoy both places very much when I want something other than Caf food."
College Freshman,5,There really is not anything negative about the school.
College Freshman,5,Most students that come to Millsaps generally play a sport. Not everyone does but a very high percentage play at least one sport. The athletics here is amazing. There is a good gym and a hangar dome where basketball and volleyball games are held. Our football field is nicely  located besides our cafeteria and gym. Students love to go support our football team and the other sports.
Recent Alumnus,5,"You get a little bit of everything, snow, hot, cold etc."
College Freshman,5,"The professors here are fantastic, engaging educators who want to see their students do well. They will make time to speak with you whenever you need it, and establishing connections with them leads to great internships and even friendships."
College Freshman,5,"Everything is different, honestly. You just have to go to the campus to understand."
Sophomore,4,"Due to Covid-19, all in-person classes were soon ""online' classes. Millsaps doesn't have a definite program where we can submit assignments. Completing homework and sending it via email was very difficult because we didn't have in-person contact. We couldn't ask questions and have a response right away."
Sophomore,4,"I love how small the campus is; that way it's easier to find my classes and meet new people. The student to teacher ratio could not be any better. The professors are welcoming, and will help achieve your goals."
Alum,4,"I didn't take any classes online while attending Millsaps and I don't recall having any friends that took online classes there either. There are some, but not a lot as far as I'm concerned. I'm giving them a 4 star rating like I did in-person classes, but again, I did not take any online classes."
Alum,4,"Honestly, Millsaps is a unique place. I don't mean that entirely in a good way, but mostly. While it's very expensive to attend, the food company used to serve students is sub par (the employees were great, they just weren't provided with the best resources), and has its fair share of other issues, I can truly say that I met my lifelong friends there. The friendships you'll make are unmatched, especially because it is such a small, close-knit campus. It truly is like an oasis, or bubble away from the rest of the city. This is not to say I don't like the rest of Jackson, but being on the Millsaps campus has this weird sense of charm to it. Overall, I'm rating my experience there a 4 because I made it good for myself and met amazing people, but again, college really is what you make it and every school has a LOT to improve on that you don't really realize until you're there and experiencing it firsthand. Definitely a good school, but don't fall for their ""perfect"" image."
Freshman,4,"Millsaps' educational opportunities are beyond what anyone can imagine. The professors care a lot about the individual and their path for the future. However, there are constant campus invasions, and a lack of security reinforcements. Also, administration does not listen to students concerns and desires to enhance the culture, or even work on student retention or enrollment rates. Yet, Millsaps as a whole is a good school, it just has its flaws."
Sophomore,4,"Millsaps is a one of a kind experience that anybody can ask for. Though it is a small school,  you can still get the education that you would have at a school like LSU or Ole Miss."
Freshman,4,Millsaps has a fantastic environment. Because of how small the school is you feel very welcome and the people are great. Professors are high standard and form a personal relationship with their students. The campus is lovely and small. It is still very expensive. International admission is great!
Freshman,4,I'm an International student here and I thought it would be really tough for me adjust but this being a small college helped me to adjust within a few weeks. You get a chance to make personal relations with your friends and professors which may even last for your entire life. The classes are amazing and the professors are always ready to help. The campus is beautiful. Millsaps is academically rigourous and it also helps an individual built his/her personality. Overall it's a great place to study and spend your college life because you're not only going to enjoy but you're also getting a degree.
Junior,4,"The best experience of my life. I could not have picked a better fit for myself, this place has really helped me excel and find who I truly am."
Freshman,4,"Millsaps College is REALLY expensive. However, the amount of money you pay provides you with decent food, a high quality education, a one-on-one support with professors and staff, and close relations with other peers. The campus is small, so you do not need a car to get around. Dorms are moderately well managed. Security is always on the clock, and they are available 24/7. There are many resources on campus that will always be able to help you if you need it. Overall, it's a great place for a great penny."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently a student here at Millsaps College. The academics are great, but the city of Jackson is decent. I came for the accounting department here, and it has been exceptional so far."
Freshman,4,"Even as a freshman at Millsaps, I can say with confidence that this one of the best schools I have ever been to. The professors are brilliant people who challenge students to think creatively and encourage the inclusion of other perspectives to create the best experience for the community as a whole. The classes are perhaps the most unique I have ever taken, and the curriculum helps students develop skills necessary for any major they wish to pursue. I love this school, and hope that it can only get better from here!"
Freshman,4,I really love going to school here so far.  The teacher's are so helpful and really care about their student's learning.  The students are all friendly and all very involved in academics and extracurriculars.
College Junior,4,"I have loved all of my professors, however, have had issues with some professors who are not willing to be flexible with students within a certain department. Class sizes are perfect for my preference, my largest one being about 13, and I also love that Millsaps focuses on class discussion and debate."
College Junior,4,"I have not utilized these resources as much my first two years, but now that I am a junior, I will be using them more often."
College Junior,4,"I love Millsaps College. I love the friendships I've made and the experiences I've had during my time so far. My one complaint is that the school overcharges it's students and makes it next to impossible to attend all four years without crippling debt. Tuition rises every year and students are offered no additional scholarships to make up for the increases in tuition and housing. Housing has also risen in the past few years with little to no alterations or restorations. Mold grows in the dorms and the humidity is so great that the walls and floors become slick, making walking around a hazard. Not to mention that the boiler in the Freshmen girl's dorm is 15 years past its expiration date. The administration continues to ignore these problems, hiding behind our wonderful academic programs and inspiring professors/students. If not for this, the campus is amazing."
College Junior,4,We have a safe campus where I feel comfortable. The security guards are not the best.
College Junior,4,The housing options are varied but quite expensive. They are comfortable and nice.
College Junior,4,"For a small division III school, athletics are impressive and important. Being an athlete, I think the school treats athletes very well."
Recent Alumnus,4,"All of the professors are extremely knowledgeable, kind, and care about their students successes."
College Freshman,4,"pretty good choices, Midtown is very quaint but pleasing."
College Freshman,4,better hours would be nice. I'm a late night meal kind of person.
College Freshman,4,they work with you and really offer as much as they possibly can for you. the staff emails back quickly and effectively.
College Freshman,4,"all is well, but I wish there more more options for freshman girls."
College Freshman,4,"Rush is hard for everyone. No one likes having to smile the whole time and be on their best behavior. Rush at Millsaps College is tougher especially KD and Chi O. Usually in the end, everyone has found their right place and that is something Millsaps Greek is good at. They are good getting everyone in the sorority that they fit best in. The major concerns are appearance, GPA, and composure. You need to be able to hold conversation, find things in common with the other girls, smile, be nice, and be flirty (like just over do it, not fake, but look interested. you have to play the game if you want to win). because in the end, no one actually acts that way. when you are finally in your sorority thats when everyone is themselves and you start to make your best friends."
College Freshman,4,"Most students are involved in sports. If you are in a sorority or fraternity, there are a ton of options for intramural sports; even if you don't want to participate, you will find yourself at times playing. The sporting events are really fun to go to because you know practically all of the players and a lot of your best friends are on the teams so it's fun to smack talk and drink with your friends while cheering your other friends on. School spirit is pretty good. People wear Millsaps apparel all the time and all year round. It's kind of fun because I've found myself on days where I'm sitting in a classroom and everyone is wearing purple. (besides maybe the teacher). Millsaps is great! just do it."
College Freshman,4,"Party scene is good. Even if nothing is going on, you can always walk into a house and find people to hang with. At the beginning of the year, I would say has the most nights of going out. It's fun to just go to the houses, drink, dance, play beer pong, or just sit in one of the rooms and talk with your friends. There are a good number of swaps that sororities have with other fraternities on Thursday nights. Fraternities and sororities also have formals and weekend trips sometimes. Those are a lot of fun!"
College Freshman,4,"Basically if anyone is being too loud or disruptive and someone reports you then security will come check it out. Mostly they only mess with you if you are affecting someone else's studying or sleeping or living habits. As long as you are respectful, they will not mess with you. If you are outside, hide any bottles or labels. Put it in a solo cup. If you are in the frat houses, you are basically in a safe zone unless someone in your sorority can catch you with a violation. But not to scare you because everyone is pretty chill and lenient. No one is usually looking to get anyone in trouble, especially because that means more work for them too."
College Freshman,4,The school's scholarship and financial aid policy are pretty straight forward. The yearly increase in tuition needs to be taken into account when initial scholarship amounts are awarded as they do not increase with the yearly tuition increase.
College Freshman,4,The Freshman dorms are older and not that good. The lottery system used to determine placement for upperclassmen dorms is based on GPA. I like that it is based on GPA. The upperclassmen dorms are very nice and have kitchenettes. I think students living in dorms with a kitchenette should not be required to purchase a meal plan.
College Freshman,4,"Some people need a lot some don't. Some will be paying back student loans, some won't."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is great. For some people, it makes the experience at Millsaps! It's a very low key version of Greek at state schools."
College Freshman,4,"The campus isn't strict on much but the Honor Code, drugs and sometimes alcohol if you're underage. Anything else is lenient."
College Freshman,4,Millsaps is a small private school and crime isn't a problem to my knowledge. I can only recall one incident in which a guy (non student) ran through our campus avoiding the police. Campus security was all over it though. They are pretty good at handling any situation. They are there 24/7 and are always one call away.
College Sophomore,4,The school will really work with you as much as possible when it comes to financial aid.
College Sophomore,4,"The party scene at Millsaps is not very large. However, I have made some amazing memories with a small crowd in a frat house. If all you are looking for in a college is a school that rages every day of the week, Millsaps isn't for you. For the most part, students here work hard and play hard. We have a few parties every year that are absolutely HUGE, but most weekends are small-scale with heavily intoxicated people."
College Sophomore,4,A large part of our student body is made up of athletes. Being a involved student-athlete with a good GPA and social life is totally doable here.
College Sophomore,4,"The off-campus dining is pretty great. There's an expansive range of cuisine at various costs. I never have trouble finding a place perfect for me to fit my budget or appetite. Check out El Charro, Mr. Chen's, Basil's, and Aladdin!"
College Sophomore,4,"Although the campus is located in the middle of a few potentially dangerous neighborhoods, Millsaps is considered very safe. There is a general atmosphere on campus that allows many (or most) students to feel comfortable leaving their belongings in the library or their dorm rooms unlocked. For the most part, the campus security does a decent job. I've never felt threaten or in danger at this school."
College Sophomore,4,"From what I've heard about public school is they offer much better dorms for the same prices as our cheap dorms at Millsaps. So I'm jealous about that. The best dorms are the new dorms: John, Susanna, and Charles. They're suites that are singles meaning only one person lives in a room, but two people share a bathroom. Also, I've seen one they seem lonely cause you don't really have a roommate. Plus, they run you about $10, 000 a year. So if that's your thing do it. The other dorms are practically the same and run you anywhere from $6000-$9000 a year. I won't complain about Bacot which is the cheapest and the freshmen dorm. It makes it very convenient to meet people and get to know others. I would say the housing process would be hard in that everybody fights for the cheap dorms mainly Sanderson since it's right next to the Olin, the science building. So, if you want a cheap dorm, you gotta have a high GPA."
College Sophomore,4,"Well when I eat off-campus, I mainly eat at fast food restaurants. I've eaten on every Mexican restaurant on Lakeland. They're all delicious btw. Sal & Mookie's is also pretty good. It'll run you a good $15 though, but I think it's worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"These are the most beautiful guys I've ever seen in my life. They're all attractive and athletic. It's like man heaven!!! There are some creepy ones though. You just got to avoid those. There are some very pretty girls here too. Some of them, like me, are ignored and others already have boyfriends so there is some dating on campus, but not much unfortunately."
College Sophomore,4,Our football team was the only undefeated team in Mississippi until their last game against Rhodes. I'd say that's pretty great!!
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is widely accepted and most students are in Greek Life. Non-Greek make fun, but enjoy the company!"
College Sophomore,4,"Many options available. Professors have great connections with local hospitals, business, and schools. Students are usually paid during their internships and they get good recommendations from them."
College Sophomore,4,"Students can choose from a variety of classes and can even create their own majors/minors.  The workload is heavy, so you have to be willing to put in the effort. Not saying you can't survive being mediocre."
College Sophomore,4,Laid back campus with lots of things to keep you busy.
College Sophomore,4,"Our school is big on athletics. We have a good quality sports' center that is available for all students, faculty, and sometimes community. We have great counselors always available and very friendly staff in the student center. The library is large enough for anyone to find a quiet place to study. The library could have more sources though. Our bowl is a popular attraction for students to lay out and enjoy sunlight on the lawn; its used for studying, music, and frisbee. Greek Life is 80% of the student body, so hangouts and parties are mostly at the frat houses, occasionally at our own off-campus bar. Most of our students are athletes and are supported by the entire campus, so athletic events are top notch at Millsaps. Go Majors!"
College Sophomore,4,"Local atmosphere is compared to the laid back south, but very liberal and things to do within city. The dining is the best quality and second comes the shopping. Fondren is one of the best attractions, with its hipster/New Orleans feel to it."
College Sophomore,4,"so many options to choose from and they all represent original cuisine well. From Mediterranean to Southern style, the restaurants are great! Be careful, you might get the ""Freshman 15"" here..."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms here are pretty good.  Some people have commented that the Freshman dorms aren't very good, but I had a blast living in Ezelle.  The people were nice and everything is always cleaned once a day.  They just installed brand new laminate hardwood floors and brand new furniture in all the dorms at Christmas break of the 2013-2014 school year.  I will live on campus all four years because i love being on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Jackson is a great city.  It's great to have all the amenities of a capital city without the problems like heavy traffic.  There are tons of restaurants from upscale Italian to my favorite, home cooked county southern food.  There are many parks and lakes to run, walk, or fish at throughout the year.  One of the only negative things I could think of is that it is relatively crucial to have a car because the bus system Jatran is not very good.  Other than that the nightlife and other social scenes are awesome."
College Freshman,4,"There is tons of space to workout, shoot hoops, and play racquetball.  New workout equipment is very nice and has built in iPhone chargers."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very nice.  No one only hangs out with certain people or certain types of people.  Everyone is very accepting and its easy to get to know people.
College Freshman,4,"There is not peer pressure from people to partake in substances that you do not want to.  Drug use is not out in the open but it is on campus, as it is every college."
College Freshman,4,"Campus is not too strict.  It gives you the room you need to grow as an individual.  There's no policy that is put in place unnecessarily and the authority figures are not ""out to catch"" anyone."
College Freshman,4,Football and baseball games are fun to attend! Intramural sports are fun to play and attend and are always fun.
College Freshman,4,"It gets pretty hot here, but that's great because I hate the cold!"
College Student,4,I can always find a place to park
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of fast food places, but there is an equal amount of chain and local restaurants. Prices vary depending on how good of quality you want. But even nonexpensive food is still good."
College Junior,2,"The buildings need serious updating and renovations. The HVAC systems NEED to be replaced and the bathrooms have not been touched since the 60s.There are also safety concerns as the doors will often get stuck. Residence Life does all that it can. The administration, however, does not put forth the effort or money to fix serious issues."
College Freshman,2,There are not many off-campus dining in the surrounding area. You have to go quite far to get what you want.
College Freshman,2,Food in the caf is bad. They offer the same dishes and it gets really boring. The food is often too salty or too sweet.
College Sophomore,2,The security officers are awful. They're creepy and not helpful.
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few options, Ruebens has weird hours and isn't that good, and if you want to go to Kava you have to spend dinning dollars. We need another swipe lunch place, especially because the caf is often to crowded to eat in"
College Sophomore,2,"There's an apartment complex right behind the school. It's easy to get in and cheap, but it's kind of sketchy, and I'd be scared for my life."
College Sophomore,2,"Millsaps College is very expensive, and the business office and financial aid office do not try hard enough to help students get the funds and aid needed."
College Freshman,2,"Bacot, the housing for freshman, is simply awful. It's almost like a rite of passage though, but they're renovating it in a few years."
College Freshman,2,You really need a car at Millsaps. Jackson public transportation is horrible and I wouldn't recommend walking around Jackson late at night.
College Sophomore,2,"Feelin' Hot Hot Hot – Mississippi weather will be Mississippi weather. It's summer eight months out of the year and the sun takes its job seriously. You'll still see brave souls outside in the bowl (our quad area) year round, though."
College Freshman,2,The food quality and portions are definitely not worth the price of the meal plan. The Kava house serves the worst lunch sandwiches known to mankind and everyone complains about the food offered in the cafeteria. It's all extremely processed and very piccadilly-esque. Not my favorite part about the school.
College Sophomore,2,"Strictness? This Is College People – Policies about drinking and social activities in the dorms are mostly regulated by RAs, who rarely try to butt in on personal goings-on. 
I'm sure there are strict policies about things like drinking, but I just don't see it.."
College Freshman,2,Few Apartments Near Campus – Apartments are pretty scarce in Jackson.  Most of the areas around campus are more expensive houses.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is always changing and in the past semester, it snowed for like the first time in Mississippi. It was a record cold and pipe lines were affected and kept us out of school. It also rains alot here, somewhat a bummer."
Alum,1,"Administrators show little concern about the student experience, most decisions are made based on profitability. Students experience had suffered terribly. As a student, you'll be more valued somewhere else. 
Security is also lackluster, students have been beat up in their dorms and robbed by people off campus who could enter easily. 
Failing infrastructure, current students have been complaining about the inconsistent wifi throughout the school semester.
Many students have regretted their decisions and are transferring out. It was not the school it used to be."
College Sophomore,1,"You're technically allowed to live off campus but they take away a lot of your financial aid, which makes it not really and option."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't agree with Greek life because it was system based on elitism and segregation. You can pretty much tell by how many black people participate in Greek Life. There are about 300 students in Greek Life and only 4 black people. I don't participate in Greek Life because I was looked at for a potential new member in a sea of girls of colour. There was one white girl and she got the bid in a predominantly white sorority. So there's that. Most Greek students don't even get to live in the houses. Most non-Greeks won't join because either 1) they don't have the money or 2) they enjoy their freedom. If you're up for waking up early on weekends and spending study time partying and sacrificing grades for partying then join Greek Life by all means, but I don't agree with it."

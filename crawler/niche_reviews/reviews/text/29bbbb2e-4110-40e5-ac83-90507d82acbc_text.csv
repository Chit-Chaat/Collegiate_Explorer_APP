Sophomore,5,"My experience at CSUSM has been amazing and so inviting. I love CSUSM because the campus is beautiful and safe. The instructors are relatable and invested in teaching the material. The environment and other students are inviting, and ultimately leave me motivated to work hard and achieve my goals."
Senior,5,"I'm a traditional classroom learner, I find it best when I can sit in a classroom and focus on what's in front of me. I find the classroom environment puts me in the best state of mind to learn. That being said, with the pandemic going on, we've all had to shift and adapt to online learning. My experience has been mostly positive, I'm still acclimating to the zoom lectures and the increased focus on time management, but my professors have been understanding and patient."
Senior,5,"I love this campus! I transferred over last year and have had a great experience with all my professors and fellow classmates. I'm looking forward to graduating this year, if the pandemic allows, and wouldn't hesitate to continue my graduate studies here. My only gripe is that the campus sits on a hill, so there is a lot of walking up and down stairs to get from one side of campus to another, but it keeps me in shape."
Junior,5,My overall experience at California State University of San Marcos was exceptional. The student service center is organized and helpful when it comes to organizing my path towards reaching my academic goals. The degree planner is extremely useful when enrolling in courses to attain the accurate units needed to graduate on-time.
Junior,5,Loved the blend of online and on campus courses. The campus life was very inclusive to my needs. My team of advisors were exceptional in helping me pave my path towards achieving my degree. I truly felt each one of my professors take the time to help me succeed in reaching my goals because they really care and want to see their students succeed.
Senior,5,"It's a great school. Classes require a lot of writing because of the 10-page writing requirement per class. Overall, professors are very down to earth, and they care about there students' success."
Senior,5,After attending CSUSM for the past four years going into my fifth I have realized that it has became my new home. What I love the most about being a student at CSUSM is the diversity within the students. I also really love the fact that the professors are always engaged with he students and are always willing to make the extra effort helping the students achieve the goals that they have set for themselves. The campus and student life is one other thing that I love about CSUSM because there is always something to do on your spare time. Even though I love CSUSM I have to admit that I really dislike all the stairs around campus. All in all CSUSM is a great university which I have over since day one.
Senior,5,During my time at CSUSM I have taken a number of online classes. At first I was some what scared of taking a class that was online due to the fact that I am more of a person to person type of learner. After listening to my friends and deciding to take an online course with them my perspective on such class formatting changed. Thanks to the professors and all the helping attention that they bring to the students I realized that these online courses were of my liking. I was also able to learn just as much as I would If I took in person classes. I highly recommend online classes offered at CSUSM.
Senior,5,I took about three classes online at Cal State San Marcos and my experience has been great overall. The professors that were teaching online were very thorough  and every time I emailed a question they responded in a timely manner and went above and beyond on helping me understand the material.
Senior,5,Cal State San Marcos has the best educators that truly care about their students. I also truly enjoy studying at the library due to it having different levels that are made for different levels of talking. One thing I would change about Cal State San Marcos is the amount of money parking costs.
Junior,5,"The best thing that I've seen the college shows, is it is very hands on with students and want them to succeed and is very about the student if they need help."
Junior,5,"the online experience was great. many of the online classes are called ""hybrid courses"". this means that most of the coursework is online and you have one class a week. i prefer this method because i could get guidance for my studies at home. there is also plenty of aid through tutoring on campus."
Alum,5,"I'm rating this school 5 stars in relation to the AMAZING Sociology faculty on campus, and not so much the institution as a whole. The Sociology professors were incredible to say the least. They were exemplary role models both in and out of the classroom. They supported our academic learning and civic engagement out in the community. 

Something I'd like to see change is the presence of law enforcement. Campus police should be DEFUNDED entirely. They do not make students feel safe, but instead increase fear in a space that is supposed to be welcoming for all."
Junior,5,"My experience at CSUSM has been amazing since the start! The faculty and staff that works at this university truly want their students to graduate and to succeed. Professors are passionate about teaching and knowledge. Counselors are available and ready to help in any way they can. Since the classrooms are small, you have the chance to get to know and interact with your peers. The school provides so many resources to ensure their students well being."
Junior,5,"Cougar courses is a great tool that professors and students use for learning and communication. Very easy and friendly to navigate. Professors upload assignments, grades, and other content to make the learning experience better. The platform is the fastest way to reach professors if you have any questions."
Freshman,5,It was a huge sudden change to switch to online classes when I went from having all face to face classes. However most of my teachers made it relatively easy and comfortable for the switch. They took the situation into consideration and they took our thoughts and personal events in our life into consideration. They made having classes online no where near stressful.
Junior,5,"What I really like about being a student at cal state San Marcos, is that it’s a small campus and easy to navigate."
Senior,5,"I actually liked the online learning experience. I thrived in my online classes, and I felt that my teachers handled the transition to online very well. They were very understanding and accommodating under the circumstances."
Freshman,5,Super fun college. I'm currently enrolled and I am having a blast. Not a lot of greek life here and not really a party school. Has an amazing view and really cool people.
Senior,5,I extremely enjoyed attending my undergraduate at CSUSM. I enjoy how nice everyone is. All the professors want their students to succeed and all the programs on campus hold events so students can meet new people. I would highly recommend CSUSM.
Senior,5,CSUSM is a great campus that is small yet very diverse. Commuter college with great extra-curriculum programs.
Freshman,5,"So far my experience at CSUSM has been amazing. I enjoyed being able to get a starbucks and study right outside where their tables are located. Another favorite place of mine to study is the library whenever I needed a quite area that was my place to go. Overall, they have many resources available to students, one of them is the writing center which I attended a lot. They helped me when I needed new ideas to incorporate into my work or even helped me just to proof read my essay. Great school with many opportunities you just have to look!"
Freshman,5,I am an incoming Freshman to CSUSM. I could not be more happy with everything leading up to my experience. They offer so much inclusion activities for incoming freshmen. I absolutely love that the their dorms are all completely apartment style too - gives a real sense of individualism as a first time being away from home.
Freshman,5,I love this school!!! It is so great the classrooms are small and intimate. It is so close to the beach and has so many fun things to do. LA is about an hour away and San Diego is 30 minutes south!!!
Junior,5,The campus is so beautiful and very well maintained. The staff and employees there are nice and professional
Freshman,5,"I've been attending CSUSM for two semesters now and I am very comfortable to call it my loving home. Although I do not live on campus, the experience and encounters I receive on a daily basis have been nothing but memorable. Not only have I not met a disrespectful or ""boring"" professor yet, but all my peers glow with such positive vibes and that says so much to me. The campus, while small, has such a nice feeling to it as it demonstrates a perfect example of attending a school where it seems everyone knows each other. I am very excited to spend my college life here!"
Niche User,5,Overall I ave had an amazing experience at San Marcos. I have created many friends and have encountered amazing teachers. I also love the dorm rooms. They're super clean and spacious. The food isn't the best but it is good. I enjoy going around the campus and walking around trying to meet new people and join new clubs.
Freshman,5,"I like how the school provides various resources to help us out. We can get free printing, free food from a pantry/food truck, mental health counseling, clubs, police services, 1 hour free of classes on Tuesday and Thursday to do whatever, eat, hang out,(U hour) and much more. One thing I'd like to change is to make all days of the week have an U hour."
Graduate Student,5,"I like the convenience of the online graduate program in education. Professors are supportive, knowledgeable and accessible.  It is very research based and focused on educational leadership in the context of social justice."
Senior,5,"I am a Sociology major and a non traditional student who transferred in from Mira Costa College. First, the campus overall is wonderful.  Constructed up against the hills with views north and west it has some stunning places to study, relax or in my case take a nap.  Academically, the professors, besides being real people, are all extremely personable, supportive and I found my time here very intellectually stimulating and challenging.  Outside of class, I found there were many times I could not attend exciting activities of various sorts due to my responsibilities trying to balance work, family and school.  Despite this CSU San Marcos still feels largely like  a commuter school, but in fairness I'd say it does have a growing campus culture and vitality.  I have loved my time at CSUSM, the Sociology department have really been something and I can't be happier to have chosen the discipline as my major."
Freshman,5,"California State University, San Marcos gives you back everything you put into it and more. The different colleges are all well-supported thanks to passionate professors, local sponsors, and proud alumni. The university is very well rounded academically with a diverse range of well-developed programs. 

Though it's a commuter school, there's an active campus life and constant events on campus. The University Student Union is full of diverse centers, comfortable lounge places, and decent campus dining, making it the heart of the campus. The center's in the USU, such as the LGBTQ&A Pride Center and Black Student Center,  and the support they get from the staff and students help create a safe and inclusive atmosphere on campus. 

Overall, CSU San Marcos is a wonderful university that gives you everything you put into it and more. The campus is new so it is still growing, but it's only going to get better."
Junior,5,"Love the education and professors offered at CSUSM. Social life is lacking, but there if you try. The general area is beautiful, 10 minutes from the beach, two hours from the mountains."
Niche User,5,"I went to Cal state University to look at the school for myself. The Campus is very beautiful, and since I don't drive the transportation is very convenient. I would love to attend to Cal State University for those reasons."
Senior,5,My overall experience at this school has been great. The resources and the staff are all helpful and help students reach their goals.
Senior,5,The atmosphere and teachers are so friendly and reach out. The teachers check up in your mental state and know understand how some of us are far from home and are having issues. Not like other schools where teachers just teach and don’t care for a student.
Niche User,5,California State University-San Marcos is a beautiful university that is very friendly towards hispanics and that has a great variety of degrees.The people there are very friendly and they have a beautiful statue of Cesar chaves.
Graduate Student,5,I am applying to California State University San Marcos for graduate school to earn and MBA Masters of Business Administration. I haven't attended classes yet as they start June of 2020. I have been on the campus and attended the MBA Orientation. I loved everything they have to offer and I met with the Dean and the Director of the program. They were all very nice and welcoming.
Niche User,5,"So far, I really liked the faculties and the campus is really taken care of. I think they do a really good job of giving the students the best experience possible."
Alum,5,"I attended the Cal State San Marcos Extended Learning Program. Let me tell you it was fast-paced, about 3-5 classes per semester (spring, summer, fall), and once you go in as a cohort you graduate as a cohort. This has been one of the best school experiences of my life. Professors were friendly and easy to contact when related to school, taking the courses were fun and worth every penny."
Freshman,5,"Really amazing school! I love the atmosphere here. Especially the location, so nature like and the air is so fresh. I love my school. All the teachers are also so amazing they all truly care about the kids and on them graduating. So excited to be here for the next 3 years!"
Freshman,5,"My experience so far at Cal State San Marcos has been a positive one. Everyone here is extremely friendly and open minded, and there are an abundance of fun activities to do. The campus is quite beautiful, and there are many lovely places to sit and do some thinking, and perhaps read a novel in peace."
Senior,5,This is a great school with great resources and faculty. The school cares about your academics and provide the best resources to excel in school. However the school has excess fees for things that are not needed. Parking permits are overly expensive and need to be lowered to help low income students.
Freshman,5,"I have only been at Cal State San Marcos for three weeks now and I already love it. They have a very diverse and welcoming campus, and everyone is super nice. The first week of school they had booths set up around campus to help students find their way to a class, or answer any questions."
Freshman,5,"what I enjoy about Cal State San Marcos is that there's much diversity and professors want to help you succeed and they are there if you have any concerns. The campus is fairly new so everything is up to date and the dorms are exceptional compared to other universities. If you ever were to need help in a particular subject such as English, there are tutors available in the writing center and many other tools to utilize for your learning. Moreover, we have a variety of clubs and leadership opportunities that will help you in the future."
Junior,5,"I have visited nine of the CSU campuses and though I may be slightly biased, I really believe this is by far the most beautiful. Professors have all been fantastic. I've enjoyed staying in the QUAD. I have always felt safe on campus and the area around campus is nice as well. CSUSM is a very diverse and friendly campus."
Senior,5,"This school is so amazing and welcoming to everyone. The environment is safe and the teacher student ratio is great, it makes the classes much better and personal, and makes it very open to deeper conversation and debates in class."
Sophomore,5,"So far, I've enjoyed being at CSUSM. Everyone's fairly friendly and the general atmosphere of the campus is positive. I've met a lot of open-minded individuals here. My professors have all been friendly, reasonable, and dedicated to helping me with my coursework. I appreciate how clean the campus is and I can always find a space to work in if I need it."
Sophomore,5,It's barely going to be my second year and its been fun! The resources here are amazing and this school is really pushing you to try to graduate! The resources I have used has helped me tremendously and I inform everyone to utilize any help they offer!
Junior,5,Does a lot for the student! I can't believe all the programs and how inclusive this school is for all walks of life. The community that this school has created is truly a life long community.
Freshman,5,"I really like the atmosphere at San Marcos, it makes me feel right at home and I really feel like I can connect well with the other people there."
Junior,5,"My favorite part about CSUSM is the class sizes, since it is a smaller school there are less people in your classes which for me makes it easier to learn and focus. It also allows professors to get to know you and for you to ask for help in class or individually."
Sophomore,5,"I have completed my freshman year at California State University-San Marcos and it was one of the best years of my life. What the campus showed me was there were more resources that I have available to me as well as the diversity it demonstrated. I met new people and made a lot of new friends either through my roommates, people that lived in the dorms, in the classroom, or simply by running into someone by accident. Not only that, the commitment the university showed to its students to helping us make sure we succeed in the classroom was outstanding. I loved how I could simply make an appointment with my academic advisor and ask her or how my professors would recommend meta tutors to get the help I needed. All in all, this is why my overall experience at California State University-San Marcos was excellent."
Senior,5,CSUSM is an amazing option for a four year University in San Diego. The school is extremely diverse with both faculty and students from all walks of life. The resources offered are abundant and the help one may need is always available. This is a school that definitely cares about its students. I am involved in Greek Life at CSUSM and it made my experience 1000 times better. Living in the dorms was great and the living facilities are awesome. I highly recommend CSUSM.
Freshman,5,I like the diversity of the campus. I also like the new buildings and programs it has provided throughout the years.
Junior,5,"When I transferred, everyone there made sure all the transfer students felt right at home. Everyone was welcoming us with open arms and the campus is beautiful!"
Niche User,5,"I am still a high school senior but I’m attending cal state San Marcos in the fall of 2019. I visited the campus however and I really liked how diversely it was, club organizations, housing, the way the buildings are placed."
Freshman,5,Cal state san marcos is great and beautiful college. I will be an incoming freshman I am motivated to succeed and graduated with a Spanish major.
Freshman,5,I loved the campus and the environment. The dorms were very nice and cozy so it felt like if I was at home. The people were so welcoming and kind to me. It was an amazing experience and I would love to attend.
Senior,5,I enjoy attending this school. I love they have a campus close to home. They have friendly students and staff. I enjoy being in there Business program at the temecula campus. They do what ever it takes to help you achieve your goals.
Senior,5,This is a great school for students who want to attend a smaller university without going to a private school. Class sizes are small which allows students to learn better and get more direct help from professors.
Senior,4,I was in the first class of the online Accelerated Bachelors of Sociology program. It was a good experience.
Senior,4,I appreciated the regular emails on what was going on within the school. They also offered regular advisory sessions for the online students.
Sophomore,4,"I have had to take classes online during the COVID-19 pandemic. My professors have been excellent about laying out a syllabus and schedule before-hand so that I feel prepared. Their systems of communication are excellent and they get back to you quickly. Zooms rarely have any issues, and the professors get back quickly with empathy and understanding."
Freshman,4,"CSUSM is a really relaxed/chill university. The area overall is beautiful. Weather is amazing as well. Very diverse. People are friendly most of the time. I would change maybe just the overall school spirit, they’re not to big in that."
Freshman,4,Online experience is good. During the Coronavirus pandemic everything is online which is fine because CSUSM is really on top of it when it comes to online classes.
Freshman,4,"balanced, helpful teachers, safe campus. pretty much everything you need in a college. its fun too, the people there are great."
Junior,4,"The online experience at CSUSM is fairly well for a decent sized school. I have taken several classes online and I believe I benefitted from them just as much as any of the in person classes. Many of the classes online encourage interaction amongst the students through discussion forums and assignments which is something not many schools prioritize when doing online, and it works really well."
Junior,4,"What I like most about California State University - San Marcos is that the school is not very big, therefore the professors seem to give more individual time in helping the other students instead of specifically focusing on the class as a whole. The things I would change or add would be more food services to the campus."
Senior,4,"I have a very positive experience with this school, it has an inviting community, wonderful teachers, beneficial academic/career programs, as well as plenty of resources for academic assistance, financial stability, and mental/physical wellness. As a student who had a huge shift in career planning, personal goals, and healthy issues, this school had so many understanding and supportive staff, from professors to the those faculty."
Junior,4,"The whole learning online is not my thing, and with COVID hitting. Most classes are online, but I feel the professors did a good job on transferring to online and it was not that bad."
Sophomore,4,"Since Covid-19 was around we did have to leave campus and go back home, which meant having to do online classes. The teachers are understanding  with technical difficulties and try their best to find the best way for us to learn and understand the material."
Sophomore,4,"I just finished my first year in CSUSM, I enjoyed it very much. Most teachers are friendly and extremely helpful. As well any of the staff are nice and help with anything. Everyone that attends to the school go with the mentality that they know they are there to study and have big goals in life."
Junior,4,"The online classes are as any class online, you can do it on your own but at times you have to go online for some lectures and things like that. The more one on one time is a huge plus too."
Junior,4,"The campus is amazing, very open and you get more one on one time with professors because of how small the class room sizes are."
Freshman,4,My experience at California State University San Marcos has been very interesting. The staff that works here are very helpful and passionate about their jobs. This school has definitely taught me how to become independent . Being a freshman in college is already a huge change but not only is it a huge change they set up the school to where students are in control not the parents. I believe they do this to help get us on our feet and to realize that mom and dad can not take care of our business for the rest of our lives.   Overall the school is really pretty good academically.
Sophomore,4,My online classes were unorganized sometimes but it was easy enough to still learn properly. Most of my professors recorded their lectures.
Sophomore,4,The overall experience was memorable. The professors were helpful and the classes were not to stressful.
Junior,4,"My online experience this semester was very difficult. The majority of my professors had a hard time preparing for online courses, and trying to inform students what was expected for the material that was being covered."
Senior,4,"I love the school. Class sizes are perfect. Teachers are amazing. Clubs are great. The only thing I dislike is the parking available, and how classes are difficult to get into."
Junior,4,Inclusive and wonderful atmosphere for learning. Looking forward to completing my degree at this campus.
Sophomore,4,"Professors are awesome! Every instructor I've taken courses with has been amazing. They truly care about the students' learning. 

Be prepared to climb stairs. There are so many stairs. It would take more time to find an elevator than to just climb the stairs."
Senior,4,"I feel very safe at this school, I believe it is the safest school in the state. The campus is not very big and there is a lot of stair. I am math major and I feel like there is not a place for us on campus."
Alum,4,"CSU- San Marcos is a new growing campus. It has is not as big as other public universities and doesn't have as many students, but it continues to grow. I wasn't too much a fan of the campus when I first joined because it is a commuter school for the most part, but when I decided to involve myself in the campus culture, I saw a shift in feelings about the school. It has every element to a college that a college needs. It may just not stand out right away because the culture is just starting to grow. I know in a few years, this campus will be a widely popular campus and it will become less of a commuter school and more on par with bigger campuses like San Diego State. Like I said, this is a newer school, but I've seen the potential first hand. The people are awesome, most of the professors care, the student leaders put in lots of effort towards making sure voices are heard."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful and classes can range from a 30 student class size to 120. San Marcos is a peaceful city and the beach can be found at least 25 minutes away! Most professors are kind and willing to help you succeed.
Alum,4,"There are small classrooms, the professors willing to work with you, growing campus, there is a lot of resources to help students, there are many clubs and school activities to attend."
Niche User,4,"I really liked visiting San Marcos, it was a very nice and welcoming school. The campus was very clean and I think it might be the right fit for me and my future. I believe the school also has great academic programs and opportunities to grow."
Niche User,4,Cal State San Marcos is a wonderful school with a lot of diversity and tons of academic majors. Cal State is a great choice if you are looking to stay in state. Cal State San Marcos has hundreds of opportunities that suits everyone and what they are looking for. Check out Cal State San Marcos. It may be for you.
Junior,4,"I like the small campus/classes since it is easier to connect with professors. However, the lack of dining options and nothing open on the weekends creates a very high school type feel, instead of a college campus."
Sophomore,4,My time at California State University San Marcos has been very wonderful as I feel as I am part of a community I believe I belong to as an individual.
Senior,4,"As a student learning under the social sciences department, I've experienced professors who are invested in their subject matter. In that regard, this makes the school academically challenging and rewarding. The food is good but its still ""college"" priced. There are many attempts at pushing diversity and student involvement. But many, like myself, are students who commute often so there's an interesting divide between those who commute and those who live on or near the campus. The area is nice but the city is surrounded by a more vibrant greater area. Overall, it's an enjoyable university but I believe it shines academically even though it's a state university not heralded for its academics."
Freshman,4,"Cal State San Marcos has provided me with a very pleasant experience. The campus is extremely clean and all of the staff is helpful and friendly. They offer a huge amount of tutoring opportunities and make it easy to get help when needed. For me personally, I live on campus and the apartments are really nice and updated which makes living and studying here much easier."
Alum,4,"California State University of San Marcos is an excellent school for a local resident wanting to commute for a decent price. This school provided me the ability to save money and live at home. My commute was 45 minutes, but worth the savings in housing and food. The community life is great on campus. The down fall would be the degrees they provide. They have a good amount of different degrees to pursue, however, I think they could expand to provide a bigger variety of choices."
Sophomore,4,"The school is very good and the people are nice. My first year was fun since I participated in organizations, which there is a lot of on campus."
Freshman,4,"My experience at San Marcos has been filled with helpful mentors and professors. Nothing about this environment is intimidating or awful. Everyone makes me feel welcomed, allows everyone to have a voice, and contributes a lot of opportunities."
Alum,4,"Wonderful college! Beautiful growing campus, great professors. Close community with many resources for students. Parking is expensive and some science based majors are impacted. Kinesiology department is awesome!"
Sophomore,4,"My first-year experience at Cal State San Marcos has been wonderful. First off, everyone here is very welcoming. I was scared when I first arrived, but the professors made me feel like I belong here. There are many centers that welcome all kinds of students, from the Latino Center to the Cross-Cultural Center, there is a place for everyone. I also felt like I was actually learning something in my classes and not just being shown something I will probably never use again. There are also events almost weekly to get students more involved on campus, so the campus is always full of life. Overall, I really like CSUSM, and I hope to have more great experiences with them along the way."
Senior,4,"Although CSUSM can be known primarily as a commuter campus, my college experience here has been nothing short of amazing. Once you settle in and get used to the change and transition of college, it really becomes a second home. I always feel safe at campus and appreciate all of the universities efforts into making this university a secure environment."
Junior,4,"I have overall enjoyed attending CSUSM. So far the professors have been wonderful with accommodating and understanding with a full time working student as well as providing lectures that are stimulating! The only issue I’ve had is with all the stairs! There is a reason they call it Cal State University-“Stair Master”, however, I guess you get your education and exercise all-in-one!"
Alum,4,Its a great university and an event better town. There is a lot of community interactions and things to get involved with for the University. The people you will meet are some of the kindest people you will ever know.
Senior,4,"I hope to see more student involvement since it is mainly considered a ""commuter school"". I love the teachers that I have been with since you can feel and see their genuine passion in teaching. Additionally, they have always expressed their availabilities for every student. They are approachable and understanding, which helped me in difficult times of my personal life."
Junior,4,"I overall enjoy CSUSM, I like the energy and campus. I would like to see an improvement in quality of professors, unfortunately I've experienced more bad than good."
Freshman,4,I liked that the school was situated in area where everything a college student needs is really close by. I liked that it had various venues of entertainment surrounding the school
Sophomore,4,"California State University, San Marcos is an excellent university for those who wish to receive a quality education at a decent price. They employ professors who are passionate about their field of study and care deeply for their students."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is really nice, LOTS of stairs, buildings fairly close, professors are great, parking is expensive and hard to find at times, library resources are awesome."
Freshman,4,"When you make this active decision to begin your own journey of personal growth and development you’ve taken the first step towards a better and brighter future. Although, your journey is yours to travel alone, there are tools that can help you to get the most out of life."
Freshman,4,"I got accepted and I can't wait to attend! I have looked up pictures and the campus looks great. It is in the SoCal area and I am from the NorCal area so I am excited to be exposed to this new scene. The campus is too remote for my liking, but I am also an introvert so I do not mind having a little peace and quiet around the school. I am planning on studying Criminology and it is the 3rd choice for college in California. Very cool!"
Alum,4,"This is a great school for those who don't like the big public university feel. Professors teach smaller classes (30-40 students) and it allows a better professional relationship. Despite the small size, there are many clubs, organizations, and Greek life one can become a part of. The weather is in sunny San Diego so it's common to spend time not in classes outside! Best choice I've made!"
Niche User,4,CSUSM is a very beautiful campus and is very friendly and so much life is brought out at CSUSM. Once you go to CSUSM you’ll understand what I mean. And there’s always something happening I and the dorms are very apartment style and make you feel like a real adult.
Junior,4,"This is a great a school, they provide you with all the resources you may need to succeed. All professors want you to pass their classes and are very supportive. The extra curricular activities are fun to participate in, for example I am apart of Active Minds, The Pso club, and joining the Christian clubs. The campus is pretty easy to navigate once you get through your first semester. The parking is sometimes difficult due to the student population and it's growth. However there are plenty of parking spaces you may just have a long walk to get to your classes. Over all this school is a great choice, especially for local San Diegan's and transfer students."
Senior,4,"The thing I like most about CSUSM is the quality professors. 98% of the professors ive had in the past 4 years have been passionate about their job, go above and beyond to help their students and are genuine."
Junior,4,"I love the fact that this campus is on the smaller side. Average classroom side is about 25, making it better for student/professor interaction. Most professors want to see students succeed and will go the extra mile for them. Impacting majors make some difficultly when getting classes but that means that the college has good programs for the given major."
Sophomore,4,"Everyone is really nice. My professors so far are friendly and understanding. My peers are also friendly and helpful. The clubs are interesting, I am currently debating joining one! The dorms are beautiful but your experience depends on your roommates."
Senior,4,"This is a great school, with a nice campus and good academics. However, joining classes is very difficult at times, as classes are often packed with students."
Junior,4,"California State University San Marcos is a campus made up of students that are diverse and includes students from all different backgrounds and ages. I am highly active on campus, as I am a member of the Marketing Society, was an Ambassador for Campus Tours, as well as an active member in my sorority, Alpha Omicron Pi. California State University San Marcos offers a wide variety of resources where students can achieve not only their academic goals, but career goals. The counselors are always more than willing to help and will go the extra mile to make sure students succeed. I was able to land a few internships and other opportunities by reaching out and discovering what my University had to offer. As an active and successful student at California State University San Marcos, I will say there  are endless opportunities available on campus, you just have to be willing to search for it and be open to trying new things."
Junior,4,It is a very small campus so it’s easy to get from class to class. Small class size makes for more personal professors.
Sophomore,4,"I love the scenery, seeing the sunset once you get out of class. Many events offered to students and stress relief yourself. Wish the housing would be less expensive and have little more appeal for the UVA. Different color and make it more vibrant."
Sophomore,4,"What I really like about this school is the environment. The small size of the campus was great for someone like me. I like to learn in smaller groups because it offers more one on one with professors. Also the environment with the student body is great, you meet some really good and kind people. The thing I would like to see is more diversity in disciplines."
Senior,4,"My experience as a student at CSUSM has been well. The students and staffs are friendly. I like how the school is very active and supportive of different races,religion, and gender. Also, they provided free food, sweater, and etc. for their students and that they care about their students. 
The only thing I would change is to have more areas where students (that commutes) have more places to stay when they are waiting for classes or do homework in campus."
Junior,4,"The college is honestly a small college and is very accepting of religion and the lgbt community. From the tour I took,  I would recommend if you want to go to a  small college and in the desert area."
Junior,4,What I like about CSUSM is that most of the staff and students are polite. The changes I'd like to see is that the Extended Learning programs are more lenient on the students when it comes to financial aid.
Senior,2,"The school is constantly misusing funds and mishandles money that we, as students, pay. Administration does not provide adequate support or information regarding said funds. The on campus housing is completely overpriced and filled with an ant and rodent problem. I would not recommend CSUSM to students who like student involvement or are big on student life. This is more of a commuter school and you will not see the same person twice on campus."
Freshman,2,"Not many events going on at campus, and it's mostly a commuter school so there's not a ton of people at the events that due happen. It feels like a glorified community college that costs a University price"
Senior,2,"This rating is based on the accelerated Kinesiology program. It seems like the extended learning just wants to gets students into the program to take their money. The planning of the program needs A LOT of work. Most of the professors that are chosen are a joke and chosen last minute. Some of the courses are repetitive and not in the correct sequence. The program is way too much money for the education that I have received. If i had to do it again, I would not waste my money on this program."
Alum,2,"Nursing School was challenging and very difficult, the teaching staff was 50/50. Half of the teachers really cared about the students and the other half were not suppose to be teachers. Nursing school is stressful enough the teachers do not have to make students cry. They should be encouraging and not cause PTSD. The teachers that were encouraging should get paid more. Otherwise it gave me my degree and now I have a great job, very unorganized and the administration would change things up on you the day before clinicals."
Freshman,2,Really small and anti social school. Lots of the students are commuters and don't waste time socializing. The biggest Frat party I went to here was smaller than my high school parties. Academics and professors are super chill though. You have to make your own fun here but if you're looking for a fun or active school this isn't the one for you.
College Freshman,2,Housing is incredibly expensive for a lesser CSU.
College Freshman,2,The school's sports are very low ranked.
College Junior,2,"I feel like that there no special security measures on campus. For this reason, I do not feel safe in school and I try to be in group to feel comfortable on campus."
College Senior,2,"The school should invest in other sports, like football, swimming, baseball and etc. The school is very limited when it comes to sports."
Recent Alumnus,2,I'm not in greek life so I wouldn't know.
Recent Alumnus,2,Poor staff. Cleanliness of the dorms were bad. Bad all together
College Sophomore,2,I'm in Greek and I wish it was a bigger scene
College Sophomore,2,"Not too many people know about CSUSM because it's fairly new. It's less than 30 years old. Also it's a state school so a degree doesn't hold a lot of weight, unless maybe it's a business degree because I hear the business program has a good reputation. But because it is still growing and expanding there is a lot of possibility."
College Sophomore,2,"No school spirit, maybe because it's a small school"
College Freshman,2,"If you're looking for a college with a large sports presence, this is not the school for you. The most ""popular"" sport on campus is basketball, but we don't even have our own basketball gym for games on campus, we have to travel to a community college for any home games (although they are in the process of building a new basketball/volleyball stadium that looks promising). The crowd at basketball games is unfortunately small, probably because of the traveling inconvenience to the community college for games. Although the athletic teams and program are not too popular, the campus spirit is surprisingly impressive. San Marcos has done a great job at growing their school spirit and extra curricular participation, it is just not up to par with other big schools."
College Sophomore,2,"The social atmosphere on campus is bad, partly because CSUSM is a commuter school. Most students are only focused on attending and receiving their degree. Social activities are rarely popular because students are taking five or six classes and working multiple jobs and, therefore, lack the time to enjoy socializing."
College Sophomore,2,I think the fast food is disgusting. There are almost no healthy options unless I was to just get a salad every day which can add up quickly because usually salads are more expensive then entire meals. I never use the new food or go to the USU for meals.
College Freshman,2,I never seem to get any financial aid no matter what I do.
College Freshman,2,I have heard of some terrible things that have happened at these parties.
College Sophomore,2,There is really nothing walking distance.
College Sophomore,2,There are very few parties on or around campus.
College Freshman,2,"I have researched some off campus housing and its not that great. Of course the buildings and condos are nice to look at and even better inside, but the cost is a lot and there is almost never any spots available, plus parking is very limited."
College Freshman,2,The parties at the school are pretty much filled with drunk people playing beer pong. People just sit around. I'd much rather go to downtown San Diego and go to a club than a school party.
College Freshman,2,They only offer certain sports. They have almost no female sports. There is no football and this is a big problem for football fans! They should make a team and I can assure that the school would be more connected.
College Freshman,2,"it is expensive, small, and there is no liberty to have fun."
College Freshman,2,Its big everyones in it and its easy to get in. A majority of people in greek are rude and think they're better. All they do is party.
College Freshman,2,Way to expensive and not affordable for the average college student
College Freshman,2,"Off-Campus dining isn't a problem if you have a ride to get to them. If not, there are limited choices in walking distance."
College Junior,2,The town is really boring and doesnt have much life in it. A quiet boring town.
College Freshman,2,D2 basketball team. Football is always the best sport to watch in my opinion. Disappointed they had no football team because I wanted to do college cheerleading after high school. Not much a variety in sports to join. Not advertised.
College Freshman,2,"I  didn't receive anything,"
College Junior,2,We need our own gym!
College Junior,2,"Greek life isnt all that big, most people arent in a frat or a sorority."
College Freshman,2,I have not received any financial aid whatsoever.
College Freshman,2,"There is not really school spirit at this campus, which makes me really sad. It is so much fun to go to a school with a lot of school spirit it's somewhat depressing that the fan support is so dull."
College Freshman,2,The social atmosphere reads as being about independence.
College Freshman,2,"Parking is a major flaw at CSUSM. The campus is tucked in the hills of San Marcos and the closest free parking is a mile downhill from the campus. A parking permit costs over $600.00 for an academic year. It is completely outrageous and unfordable. Once you buy your permit, parking is scarce and requires maximum effort by the student to find one. "
College Freshman,2,I don't have a car but my friends that drive always have a difficult time finding parking at the parking lot at the dorms. There are other parking lots close to the dorms but there is always a lack of space. The permits are also very expensive there are about 600 dollars or more for the who year. The parking lots are convenient for the students as they are close to classes and both dorms.
College Junior,2,the dining hall has very few options and poor variety.
College Junior,2,Varsity sports are not very celebrated at CSUSM. Except for basketball. Its huge on campus.
College Junior,2,You cannot enter many clubs because most of them are for ages 21 and over. I would rather just go with friends to just watch a movie or explore San Diego.
College Sophomore,2,Parking permits are very expensive. You can buy a Sprinter pass and that isn't too bad if you live near a Sprinter station. Once on campus it is nothing but stairs.
College Sophomore,2,There are a few restaurants within walking distance of the school.
College Sophomore,2,everything shuts down at night. Most people stay in their dorms all night.
College Sophomore,2,It is not hard to find a place to live.  But the consequences may be that it is a long commute to school.
College Sophomore,2,"There is 22 places to eat on campus and not open late at all.  Quiet on weekends and after classes.  Feels like nothing close to 10,000 people go there because there are so many commuters."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I did not dorm or party around campus much, but as far as the strictness on policies on the actual campus, I would say it was average. It wasn't too overbearing where I felt like I was in jail (like they don't really enforce the 'no food or drink in computer labs' policy) and there is no dress code. They did uphold to some policies, however. The only policies i feel were really enforced were Tuition and Fee deadlines."
College Junior,2,It is difficult to get internships at CSUSM especially for graduate programs.
College Sophomore,2,Small athletic facility. Has a nice disc golf course and track field though.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't any Greek housing available. You really have two main frats, TKE and SAE. As for sorority there are a few more options, but it is still very limited. TKE throws some pretty decent clubbing events in San Diego, but other than that they are not really active on campus"
College Freshman,2,"California State University, San Marcos is currently trying to expand their on campus living. University Village Apartments and The Quad are the only on campus selections. Both options are nice, however The Quad is more new and obviously is nicer because it is more recently built. The prices are not really reasonable for students who are struggling financially. It might be more convenient to commute if a student is close enough to the university. They both do not have very good dining options available to the students but there is a local grocery store plaza right down the street walking distances."
College Student,2,San Marcos is a suburban neighborhood. Much more exists a good half hour drive away in downtown San Diego.
College Junior,2,"Because this is a commuter school, there is not many activities going on on campus. There are also not many bars/clubs in the area close to the school so your own transportation is pretty necessary."
College Senior,2,Terrible/no help with financial aid. outrageous tuition. parking is terrible. not a good place to study.
College Freshman,2,There is a parking structure which is I think 5 levels or 6 but they fill up pretty quick during the day. The parking permits are costly but much needed. There is also other parking lots that are availible but you should make sure to get to school about 30 minutes earlier just to make sure you get a spot.
College Junior,2,"There is a cafeteria, a snack stand, and vending machines on campus. Only other option is off campus and there's a handful of option there."
College Freshman,2,"If you want a night life being 18 helps. Also having friends, lots of friends, helps. There are many clubs to go to or many people do bomb-fires at Ocean Side"
College Freshman,2,"The only time I hear of people getting in trouble is those who live on campus. Most of the time it is because of party's, drinking, or smoking. I believe it is a three strike and your out type of thing. Most students move out into apartments with friends and live happily ever after."
College Freshman,2,"It's very lively to live on campus. Most people here are freshmen, and they are around 18-19. There are some events that help out with entertainment and free food and networking. The amenities are great, there is everything from internet to free cable, but the high cost of the dorms account for this. The dorms range from 600 to about 900 per month. The social atmosphere ranges from which dorm you live in and the people. I became brothers with all my roommates and we get along very well. The dorms provide coed and single gender housing. I found that living in a single gender would have some ease, but now I am thinking of going coed if I decide to come to the dorms/apartments next year. The housing process is limited, so I would suggest to turn in your lease agreement as soon as turning in your application, it has become mandatory to live on campus. I applied and because of some problems my information was being sent to the wrong email, and within two days before the move in for the dorms. I received a notification for a room. I was lucky, however other people had to find a place to live outside of campus facilities."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking places are not that far away from the classes. The first two weeks are usually hectic, but it all flows nice afterwards. The cost of the parking permits are very expensive for just one semester."
Junior,1,"I am a currently student at Cal State San Marcos and I wish I never went to this school. I choose San Marcos over a few other schools because of the low tuition and it is fairly close to my home. This was definitely a mistake. I have had nothing but issues with the administration. One of the issues is that I never received a  grade for one of my classes. I brought it up with my professor, multiple academic advisors, and the registers office back in May and now it's almost September and I still don't have a grade! Plus it's extremely hard to get in contact with anyone. Academic advisors never answer the phone and take about 5 days to respond to an email. Classes are extremely hard to get and there is no school spirit and Greek life is barely a thing here. No one goes to sporting events and hardly anyone lives on campus. I made a mistake coming here and I don't think it's worth it. There are so many Cal States better than this one, so don't make the mistake of coming here."
Alum,1,"I did not take any online courses at CSUSM. However, colleagues mentioned they were adequate. Most students prefer attending in-person classes."
Alum,1,"I was bullied and discriminated against by a professor at CSUSM, reported the incidence and no actions were taken. On the contrary, I was treated as a culprit. I will never forget the psychological tournament that I went through during the process. I was considering to do my masters there but changed my mind after the incident. I would never support a corrupt institution that tolerates discrimination."
Niche User,1,"I applied and was accepted to the university however I also applied for the Cal Grant that would have aided me with paying for college. I qualified for the grant and was approved to use it by the state of California however Cal State San Marcos did not approve of my grant until months after I sent a call explaining the situation. I was given excuse after excuse why it was not going through such as there was miscommunication of tax forms, which were sent, and some situations are complicated to process. My situation was very simple and easy to get done so that the grant was approved but it was not approved until months later, at which point I had chosen to go to another college. I had received the phone call that it was approved but I had all ready began attending. I had a terrible experience with Cal State San Marcos and would not recommend going there, there is a reason why it is such an easy Cal State to get into versus a Cal State like SDSU."
Niche User,1,"Honestly, the amount of unprofessionalism amongst the staff of the Global Education (Dealing with international students) is appalling. They expect you to stay in a homestay because all the dorms are filled. Then why would you accept new international students if you did not have a place for them to go? Just because every international student decides to stay in a homestay doesn't mean I want to. 

Honestly, having the audacity to accept new students without informing them of WHERE THEY ARE GOING TO LIVE is disgusting. If you're an international student, do not go here. Instead, go to Long Beach, any Poly university, Fullerton, or Fresno. These are the universities that have had enough respect for me ."
College Freshman,1,I don't see any of it at works.
College Freshman,1,"So hard to get into classes, and to top it off, it's so expensive."
College Freshman,1,"Horrible parking, in addition, the permit is too expensive. ""Keep cost to a minimum"" is false."
College Sophomore,1,"Financial aid is the main reason why I dislike ever going to this college. The Financial aid employees on campus lack the knowledge to be helpful. They also take weeks, and sometimes months to respond to student issues. Financial aid forgot to give me my unsubsidized loan for five weeks, and by then my account was locked by the Cashier's Office until I paid my fees. Even now financial aid promised that I qualified for a Cal Grant, which I was denied. As a result, I have to withdrawal from college because I did not receive the aid needed to finish my degree."
College Sophomore,1,Would not encourage anyone to live on campus
College Sophomore,1,"We are suppose to have noise control between 10 pm - 10 am however, this is NEVER enforced. The RA's fail to do their job. Some are even participants. Completely disappointed in every aspect of dorm living. I find it absurd to be mandated as a freshman to live on campus but have to deal with this type of living condition."
College Freshman,1,We have basketball and thats it. We have sports just no one cares about them. We really lack in sports
College Freshman,1,Extremely picky not many to choose form.
College Freshman,1,I tried to complete a business major but classes are filled all the time. I wouldn't graduate for 6 years and i was taking 5 classes a semester
College Junior,1,There have been 3 sexual assaults in JUST THIS FALL SEMESTER. all alleged assaulters have been tied to Greek life. Cliques are rude.
College Freshman,1,So far I never hear about anything. Perhaps it is because I do not hang out with many people from my school but I definitely don't hear about many options.
College Freshman,1,"Nightlife? Clearly, you have never been to CSUSM. There are no parties and only one bar within walking distance. The bar never has any of the ""Fight Night"" PPV's. The food is also very overpriced. "
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife at CSU, San Marcos is almost non-existent. Maybe due to the fact that it is a fairly new school. More dorms are being built, but nothing around the area can really contribute to the nightlife"
College Sophomore,1,There is no alcohol served on campus and there aren't any events that happen at night on campus related to the party scene
College Student,1,"The campus policies are pretty strict. The dorms offer a fun and lovely environment to live in but they can also be strict. The campus does offer many extra activities to become involved in so in my opinion, that helps reduce the strict policies."

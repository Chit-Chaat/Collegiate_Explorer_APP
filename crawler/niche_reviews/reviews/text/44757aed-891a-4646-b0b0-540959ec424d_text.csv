Junior,5,"My experience here at Cheyney University was a blessing! Professors and faculty show much love there, it is more like a family environment at Cheyney. The professors really push their students in becoming better academically, the challenges there ended in success."
Sophomore,5,"I like Cheyney because it’s small. I get the individual help from professors, I need while enjoying my college life. The campus is beautiful. The people are so nice. Everyone is so nice. Since cheyney is the first HBCU, the campus is rich with culture and learning experiences in every video."
Freshman,5,What I like about Cheyney Is how much you feel like everyone is your family. What I would like to be changed Is for my dorm ( Martin L. King Hall ) to have air conditioning.
College Senior,5,Very easy process. They want more numbers so its hard to get denied.
College Freshman,5,Never had a problem with any health and safety officials.
College Freshman,5,Alumni and career center work hard for students who put their foot in the door.
College Sophomore,5,It is for students who want to learn and succeed.
College Sophomore,5,"It has amazing academics and it is only for student who want to learn and succeed. However do not over work yourself, because teachers give a nice amount of work... All teachers."
College Sophomore,5,So many opportunities and lots of Cheyney alumni went on to do great things
College Sophomore,5,I don't have a preference so most of the off-campus dining is great in my opinion.
College Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere cant beat it.
College Sophomore,5,Gaining access to a computer isnt hard at all
College Sophomore,5,I am an early education major and i love it. They offer a lot of programs that can help you on your journey.
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is the best on our campus i love it. We have stroll offs and meet the greek nights you will fall in love.
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe on my campus. I can walk from the library at night and not think about anything happening to me.
College Sophomore,5,typical student looks is business wear.
College Sophomore,5,What set my school apart from a lot of different school is that we are a HBCU and we offer a lot of things to minority students that regular college does not.
College Freshman,5,A lot of the people who attend the school play some sport. Students attend a lot of the games and show support. School spirit is big on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Although I attend an HBCU, the people are very diverse in their backgrounds and beliefs."
Recent Alumnus,5,I am completely elated by my major and I would do it all over again at the same university because of the quality of PhD's & Professors there that all love Psychology.  When your professor has an extreme passion for their discipline you can only embrace it.
Freshman,4,I like the closeness of faculty & students. The open door policy with professors and other faculty . The dedication to keep students motivated.
Junior,4,I am currently at Cheyney University i=on a full ride scholarship and majoring in Psychology and Criminal Justice. I switched my major my last semester of my sophomore year and I couldn't be happier. My professors are really looking for you to succeed and will help you whenever you need them
Freshman,4,"Cheyney University has a beautiful campus full of teachers that are very supportive. I choose Cheyney because ot is close to home, but I get a chance to have a real college experience without being far away."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Overall, the experience was a good one.  My classmates were just as determined and focused as I.  The Professors were down to earth and very approachable."
College Senior,4,They are always making sure the males aren't in the female dorms afterhours
College Senior,4,They host great events and are always offering something to do such as cooking classes or movie night.
College Senior,4,The greek life is the roots to my school. Without greek life my school would be horrible.
College Freshman,4,The assignments are given in a timely and orderly fashion.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are accommodating to the teaching styles.
College Freshman,4,Students work hard to keep up with the program.
College Freshman,4,Because they normally get discount on programs in school but I do not really know much about them I heard they are mostly in the Keystone House where they are very comfortable because they have their own dining hall. But sometimes non-Greeks say that I wish I was a Greek but they do not really mind and I think they say it because of the discounts but they are cool together.
College Freshman,4,"Most of the professors were good because they listen to the students and understand the struggle students have been going through sometimes and they try to make time to meet students in terms of difficulties. Professors were able to handle the class and make sure everyone understood what have been covered and try to make students participate in class as well

critical thinking professor Schoenberg was a good teacher gave participations points and always available to help.

Economics 2: Dr Asuzu very great make classes fun and he gives good notes. I think he had 60 people in the class.

Health and Wellness, Professor Newton had good examples on how to control your life and socialized with everyone in class she also had like 60 students in class."
College Junior,4,Academically school is great. The food on campus could be better. There should be events for students they stay on campus for the weekend.
College Sophomore,4,The professors actually cares for the students and they're not just teaching students or showing up for work because they have to. The professors build a connection with the students. Which causes the students to be above average and not want to give up.
College Freshman,4,The strictness isn't so bad. I don't like the security rules for entering a building but I think it is necessary.
College Freshman,4,The parties I hear about are cheap and mostly sorority and fraternity parties.
College Freshman,4,I think the cafeteria should have more food options.
College Sophomore,4,The Greek are pretty cool
College Sophomore,4,Rarely any accusations on campus
College Sophomore,4,"Very much a big thing, even though we lose alot, everyone always supports the teams"
College Sophomore,4,Work is challenging only come if your ready to learn.
College Sophomore,4,"living if campus was no option for me because I am consider homeless, but while i was living there i was lucky because I receive enough money from the school my freshmen year so i was able to stay in the new dorm which was very beautiful and it had everything in it. It was very hard for me to make friends because i have a very poor skills in communication, and i am very anti-social"
College Sophomore,4,A lot of different majors is offered
College Sophomore,4,Transportation is great buses comes directly on campus to pick up students and take them to nearby cities
College Sophomore,4,Its great if i didnt like living on campus so much i would surely live in an off campus apartment.
College Sophomore,4,The drug scene isn't that noticeable. For the most part students that are 21 and older go out to town to a bar or club to enjoy themselves.
College Sophomore,4,Night life is great whether its a party on campus or you want to travel to Philadelphia city that's not that far to party away.
College Sophomore,4,I think it is wonderful to live on campus. my dorm offers you your own private bathroom and kitchen.

Recent Alumnus,4,I love my major and all of the professors in that department. they are resourceful and the majority of them are published Psychologist.  I feel blessed to have studied under them
Recent Alumnus,4,"unfortunately because the university is in a secluded area many resources are limited, yet the view and environment are peaceful.  down the street is a prison and a bus stop which allows prisoners access to our campus."
College Senior,4,"Being a early childhood education major, you are given many opportunities to help with your future career."
College Senior,4,"Academics is exactly what you make of it. Any college student or professor can tell you, it's all in what you do!"
College Sophomore,4,The campus is pretty safe and secure. There has not been any major crimes. The one incident we did have was brought under control pretty quickly.
Freshman,2,Cheyney isn’t definitely a school o would recommend to freshman or anyone that’s looking for a full on college experience meaning not all about just class wanting to explore and go to events. Cheyney definitely isn’t a school for that due to the funding problems they are having and not being to afford anything.... but I will say the faculty and staff our great !! They are very helpful and always got ear out if you need them!
Freshman,2,"The new building is the best place to live, other than people breaking the elevators and washers and dryers. DON'T live in king if you can't take traditional housing it is disgusting. Terrible food, the area of the school and student life."
College Senior,2,Teams dont hold winning records and hardly no intramurals.
College Freshman,2,"The school do not organize too many parties which is affecting the social life at Cheyney, they need to work on that as soon as possible so students can stay in school most often. But for the transportation system I really think it could be a little better because when a bus arrives it takes a long time for it to come again so there should be an improvement in both the nightlife and the transportation system"
College Freshman,2,"I do not really know how others think about it but to me I think it is bad because people do not really support the team the way it should be supported that is very bad because they always say they are going to lose so they are not going to waste time on that but actually the team needs to get better because ever since I got to Cheyney they lose more than they win, I may be wrong but that is how I feel. Factors that affect the athletics scene is that I think the good ones do not get the chance to exhibit their talent and also players train whenever they want to and there must be discipline."
College Junior,2,They never answer the phone and there is always someone new in the office every other semester.
College Student,2,I do not believe it is that important on this campus.
College Sophomore,2,Housing in the traditional buildings are bad
College Sophomore,2,I am not a big fan of the school
College Sophomore,2,"the year of 2013-2014 was really bad, sexual assault and robbery was a serious burden at my university."
College Sophomore,2,So bad!!!!!! however where getting new service in 2014 so it might get better
College Freshman,2,they are very slow and show no support
College Freshman,2,"My school is not very diverse, being a hbcu"
College Freshman,2,"There were people getting things stolen from their rooms this past semester, and the Health Center is barely ever open. It's a shame that students have to pay a fee for their services when they're not even available that often."
College Senior,2,"Athletic facilities and equipment are old on my campus, also there isn't much school spirit  because we never win. Also I believe a lot of funding is being spent on other thing besides athletic facilities because they haven't changed since my freshman year and I am now about to be a senior."
Recent Alumnus,2,There could be some improvement.  I can recall seeing crack vials in the street on my way to class.
College Junior,2,Cheyney Nightlife is very slow. Its some nights that will be epic and others that will be calm. You pick and choose the night you want to live the night life. Transportation is not consistent and never runs late enough to do much. When a good party comes a long its work teh night life.
College Junior,2,"Computer lab hours suck, there is only 2 small computer lab areas other than the library. The campus student body is pretty small, so I guess it doesn't really matter. During finals your lucky to get a computer"
College Sophomore,2,A large of student are given ticket and fines for parking. The motorcycle parking is far from the dorms so students choose to park in closer parking and they are being fined for that. A car is extremely needed on campus and with a limited amount of parking permits it becomes difficult to get around sometimes.
College Freshman,2,"There was an inccident a couple of weeks ago where there was about atleast 1,000 students, but the security was really not there and some fights broke out.  It was not enough security there for the event"
College Freshman,1,Cheyney is a terrible school I wish I would've looked at other schools before making the decision to go to Cheyney.
College Freshman,1,this place is absolutely horrible. everything about cheyney is god awful.
College Student,1,"There is no strictness, the administration refuses to enforce policies."
College Student,1,"The local area is hard to access unless you have transportation. But if you do not, then it is extremely poor. There are no attractions, activities, events, the safety is extremely poor, and the local attitude is terrible."
College Student,1,The party scene at Cheyney University is non-existent.
College Student,1,"It is extremely poor, it is very low quality and care for the athletic facilities/equipment given to players. There is an extreme lack of school spirit."
College Student,1,"It is ridiculous, they are cutting academic programs. Everything is extremely unorganized, and terribly planned. I am honestly scared to depend on this institution to provide me with opportunities because they are cutting our academic programs here."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus is boring, there is nothing to do. And the school has bad faculty overall."
College Sophomore,1,"My freshman year, even students that live on campus and went to the university had to leave other dormitories at a certain time!!!!"
College Junior,1,persistence is key you have to keep going back to them and get it done!
College Freshman,1,"Being a freshman I knew nothing and the school did not help that struggle. I was left to figure a lot of things out on my own and the financial aid i received helped, but my remaining balance is ridiculous! The payments i am expected to make monthly are impossible. There aren't many if any available scholarships offered to/for me."
College Senior,1,"There is barely any off - camping housing located around campus. No apartments, barely any houses, just road and mansions which I definitely can not afford. Most students either live on campus or commute back and forth from home either via bus or car. A lot of Cheyneys' students commute because the school is so close to Philadelphia where a lot of the students attending lives."
College Junior,1,Most of the guys and girls on campus are so worried about themselves and having little cliques that they tend to figure about the real reason they are there. There are some guys and girls on campus that are up lifting and are actually there for education.
College Sophomore,1,As a criminal justice major there's not much to participate in like intern ships or assisting
College Senior,1,"The only transportation is the Septa public bus, unless a student brings thier own car. The campus is VERY isolated. The min. drive to anywhere is seven minutes."
College Freshman,1,There are barely any other race but African Ameri.
College Sophomore,1,the only transportation cheyney university has is public transportation
College Junior,1,"Cheyney University does not promote diversity. It may be an HBCU, but that doesn't mean only black students should attend. Being a minority on campus, I receive comments that have me wondering why I even bother attending Cheyney University."
College Freshman,1,Food on Campus – The food on campus is horrible. They don't have much of a variety.
College Freshman,1,"Residence Life – The housing on campus is not good, but they are trying their best to make it better."

Sophomore,5,Excellent gorgeous campus with staff that is willing to help any students and their needs. Great counselors and many extra curricular activities and groups you can join
Niche User,5,Keystone College will truly help students feel at home. Every faculty member and staff will welcome students with open arms and treat them with the utmost hospitality.
Freshman,5,"I liked that Keystone was a small university which made it easy for the professors to be more focused on the students. If I could change anything, I would want there to be more campus activities so I can become more involved with my school."
Freshman,5,I haven't started yet. I am an incoming freshman for the 2019 school year. I am excited for the opportunities that lie ahead. So far I am impressed with the formation of the new football team and of course the cafeteria!
Freshman,5,I love that its small. I professors are always there to help and the other staff  is helpful as well.
Senior,5,I love this college. The food is very good. They have a wonderful free music program!! There are also so many afordable majors to chouise from. The students and staff are so friendly and helpful. The campus is small and has lots of walking trails. They have bee keeeping and tree classes that students can take.
Freshman,5,I love being able to get to my class easily and the activities and clubs are a lot of fun. The food is not the best but there is a campus shop with a vareity of food to buy. Overall I would say keystone college is a great 4year college to attend.
Freshman,5,I love how the college continuously holds events that bring people together. They are so big on making people feel like they belong and it really helps when you see that.
Junior,5,"The college is in a country setting,making for smaller class sizes. Great one on one from teachers. Make for a wonderful learn experience"
Freshman,5,"I loved everything about Keystone College since the first college visit. The admissions office does a lot of contacting students who either submitted their application, or is in the middle of it. And they try to connect with you in inspirational and motivational ways reassuring you that if one college didn't accept you, not to give up on college. They care about you as a person, not what you bring to the school. And they treat your family like theirs."
Freshman,5,"Since I have been at Keystone, I have noticed that they are very interactive with their students. There is always something to do on campus, and whenever you need help, everyone is eager to help you."
Freshman,5,"Iâ€™m a current student at Keystone and a few things stand out. The first is the small class sizes allows for more student-professor interaction. The second is the professors are excellent and are very proficient in their fields and take great pride in teaching the students. The final thing that stands out is the diversity on campus, which helps lead to a mutual respect among the students on campus. Overall, this is an excellent school and I highly recommend applying. I can promise you will not regret it."
Freshman,5,"Keystone is a very close knit school, you feel welcome from the start and they like to get you involved in the community. A huge benifit of going here is books are included in your tuition for full time students. They give you an iPad that is included in tuition with you books loaded onto it. Any books that aren't available online you can rent directly from the college for usually less that $10 for the entire semester. It's a small rural campus with homey dorms and down to earth professors that are willing to help you and work with you as much as they can."
Freshman,5,Keystone College provides freedom from the ordinary life of the city. Great for anyone wanting to explore the woods and see what there is in life.
Freshman,5,Attending Keystone College was one of the greatest decisions I did as a young adult. Keystone College makes me feel at home and I would recommend it to anyone. I chose Keystone because of the diversity and the academics are amazing.
Freshman,5,Tight community wonderful professors happy to have started my first semester at keystone could use some work at the cafe food is suspect also should invest in a football team
Sophomore,5,Great professors. Class sizes are good. The campus is beautiful. Received a lot help and information from the professional staff such as financial aid and business office.
Freshman,5,I love the people at Keystone. I have a very large group of friends and every single person I meet is very friendly. The professors are amazing teachers. In high school I wasn't a good student and at Keystone I have a 3.2 gpa.
Freshman,5,Keystone college has a great student to teacher ratio. The campus is safe and very nice. There are many majors to choose from. Along with great academics Keystone offers many athletic sports to choose from if you are an athlete interested in continuing your scholastic career. The college atmosphere is great and the campus is surrounded by walking trails that are near a nice creek that runs behind the campus. It has a rural family home town feeling to it.  The advisors and faculty are extremely helpful and polite and were very instrumental in helping myself while adjusting to a whole new life and experience as a resident student. One of the best things Keystone College has done was offer the Keystone promise and also enroll all incoming students into the LRAP (Loan Repayment Assistance Program).
Junior,5,"My time at keystone starting from 2015 has been nothing but great. Faculty is nice, everyone is friendly. I've acquired many opportunities through keystone whether it be from taking classes or joining a club.  The classes are hands on and most science classes go outdoors.Keystone is a green campus which also makes us appreciate it more. The campus is beautiful and not as complicated as a university. The trails on back campus can have you walking around in between classes To get your daily does of nature and learning."
Freshman,5,Keystone Is a really great college.  The professors are great. The class sizes are small and they do have a lot of activities to do throughout the year.
Freshman,5,"Keystone is very diverse and welcoming. Everyone is personable and friendly. The teachers are understanding and friendly. There are a lot of resources available to the students such as computer labs, store, and lots of food options. The Performance Band is also very dedicated and amazing."
Freshman,5,"Attending Keystone College has been a great experience for me.  The small campus allows me to get to know other students easily.  The professors are great and with the smaller class sizes they get to know the students and take an interest in their lives.  The dorms have been a great place to make friends.  Some of the girls in the dorm are also athletes and it made us a family.  If you are looking for a small school, look no further than Keystone.  "
College Junior,5,"Great classes, wonderful professors. Workload isn't terrible if you schedule your classes the right way."
College Sophomore,5,School spirit for Keystone College is greatly seen by the public and we support them through it all.
College Freshman,5,i love my campus job my only complaint is the pay
College Freshman,5,they cater to the students even if they are not involved in sports
College Freshman,5,"Local people are friendly to college students, very welcoming. A grocery store is nearby for convenience."
College Junior,5,I'm very happy with the experiences I've had and the professors I've met
College Freshman,5,"Campus life is very supportive, and you can find your way around campus easily. Most of the hangouts include the grill, and library, The gym is accessible 24/7 and has an excellent selection of workout machines. It also has a weight room, where most athletes can be found. "
College Freshman,5,"The support system is great, The professors, and other staff is excellent and is willing to help the student succeed in whatever way that they can. It is unique by the architecture of the old buildings, and the fall foliage. "
College Freshman,5,"Professors are very understanding, and ware not afraid to answer any questions a student might have. The workload as an education major, some weeks you will have a large load of work, and other weeks you might have none. However you learn a lot on time management. Popular study areas include the grill, and the library. Mostly I use my dorm as a study area, but whenever I feel I am distracted I always go to the Miller Library where it is quiet and you can count on not being distracted. "
College Freshman,5,"Even though I am not the typical out of high school freshmen, I graduated in 2011, and I am 21 years old. Before attending Keystone for the Fall 2013, I recently did 2 years of general education, since I was not sure of what I was going to do. I decided to go this year because I knew I was ready not only to finish up with my education, but to have the college experience. So far I do not regret waiting this long to go to a fulltime institution and live on campus because I knew I was ready, and I was not going to force myself to go when I was not ready, since I knew I would not have the best experience. I find that the college freshmen out of high school respect me more, and are not afraid to ask me any questions that they may have. "
College Junior,5,It was very easy to apply for the program I am in.  I had my credits transferred very fast and my application was processed within a couple of weeks.  I had to write an essay on my reasons to pursue my degree and was awarded a scholarship based on my financial needs.
College Junior,5,I enjoy the online classes I have taken and find the coursework very enriching.
College Sophomore,5,It was sufficiently easy getting into the technology program. There are no special requirements.
College Junior,5,"I am a dorming student so I don't have to deal with the parking situation . But for commuters, there are three parking lots. One is huge and fits at least 200 cars easily."
College Junior,5,I just don't know what to do in my field of study.
College Junior,5,It was pretty easy and I didnt face any challenges
College Junior,5,So many college offered scholarships along with private scholarships!  One for anyone who is in need!
Sophomore,4,So far so good Iâ€™m only a sophomore so itâ€™s going good so far. The food can sometimes be on the bland side but itâ€™s understandable and the students there are very friendly
Freshman,4,"Keystone is overall a wonderful place. All the staff is very friendly, and always willing to help. All of my professors have been wonderful teachers and Iâ€™ve enjoy all of my classes so far. The college is located in a beautiful place, I really enjoy the scenery."
Sophomore,4,"Keystone College is a beautiful, small college in La Plume, Pennsylvania. Some of the great things about the school is the small classroom sizes which is great for creating a relationship with your professors. The small class sizes allows you to get to know everyone and feel more comfortable with public speaking. There's also multiple resources on campus to help guide you with your classes like writing support, tutors, and advisers to help find ways to get help and apply yourself in the real world. What's great about the college is they want to see you succeed and you are not just another statistic to them. The only downfall I see for the school is how old it is. It needs some updating, which is something they are working on. Overall, it is a great school and they are working hard to make their students successful."
Freshman,4,The college itâ€™s self have a overall great vibe .The  factuality are very all understanding with the student and the amount of patience in teaching.
Freshman,4,I enjoy attending keystone college because of the small class room sizes which gives me a better understanding  of the work . I would to see how diverse we become. I would like to see Black teachers .
Sophomore,4,"Keystone College is a rural small college. It is great for getting to know people and networking more about your career. The majors at Keystone College are very good, they seem to fit everyone in. Keystone is all about having everyone fit in and feel at home. I enjoy the campus and the people there."
Freshman,4,Keystone College is a home away from home as everyone knows everyone.  Faculty and students are friendly and caring and invested in making sure you're prepared for a brighter future. The campus is small and not massive which I like because I feel connected to a community.
Sophomore,4,I like that it is a small school and you get one on one time with professors. I like to see that they add more clubs and organizations on campus so students especially commuters can be more involve.
Freshman,4,"im very excited about going o this school, i love the area and environment . i really feel like i could see myself living there and learning new things. the food is great and the teachers and students are so nice and welcoming. when i step onto the campus it feels like a whole new world. the classrooms are a great size and you can really get individual attention when needed, the teachers actually take them time to help you understand the material"
Sophomore,4,"It is a private school so itâ€™s a little more costly than others.Itâ€™s a good school to attend if you like a small campus with easy access to nature, there are many hiking trails students have access to. If students do not have a car on campus they do run buses certain days and times of the week that allow those who cannot take themselves transportation. It has nice benefits like providing and iPad to the students that your textbooks come on, as ebooks. But about half the population commutes, which I would recommend. There is not a lot to do on weekends especially those without a car and the dorms could be much nicer. The food isnâ€™t top notch. You also have the choice of eating at the Grill which is a restaurant on campus. Everyone here knows everyone else so it gives the sense of a close knit community within the school. My class sizes are small, the most Iâ€™ve had is maybe twenty-five students."
Freshman,4,i like it and its very spacious and lots of things to do around the school. Very nice people and really good food served on the cafe. The teachers do a great job as well.
Freshman,4,"I like how it is a small campus, small number of students in a class. I like how it is kind of in the woods."
Sophomore,4,"The professors at Keystone College are some of the best teachers that I've ever had. The campus is small but very comfortable to those who grew up in the country. The faculty was very helpful in getting me ready for school. However, sometimes it appears that they try and rip people off financially after you've already joined. A few times I have caught them ""forgetting"" to remove things from the financial statement. This can sometimes be a frustrating thing to deal with. One time they charged my tuition payment to a different student. That should never happen. They need to get better at that. That is a big concern but other than that I've had an enjoyable experience."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus with everything they have to offer. They have a band program, athletics, and several clubs to be involved in. It's like having a second family because there are always people there to help you. On the other hand some classes have timed tests and teachers expect students to get an A+ in 10 minutes with 17 questions. I feel like they don't understand that it's a lot of information to cover. In a regular classroom there aren't timed tests, you have the whole class period to take it. Giving timed tests doesn't let students think for themselves because they have to rush to get every single question. That minimalizes their capability to do well on a test!"
Recent Alumnus,4,Loved keystone for everything it was and was not
Recent Alumnus,4,Basketball games are the biggest
Recent Alumnus,4,It's not great for socializing but I love the small school access. The professors have a better chance to interact with their students rather than they would teaching at a bigger school.
Recent Alumnus,4,Small classes are great for one on on time with professors
Recent Alumnus,4,There was always security around
College Sophomore,4,What does make Keystone College so unique? The thing that makes it unique is that it is so small of a school that you know everyone and you do not feel like a number.You feel like you are important.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel really safe on campus, especially compared to the other schools I've attended. I was sexually assaulted at a previous school and didn't feel safe at all, but at Keystone, I feel so incredibly safe."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Keystone. It's my third school, but it's also where I feel the most at home. The Morning News sent to the emails detail a lot of activities that go on around campus that I never would know about otherwise. The professors I've had are all experts in their field and are very passionate about what they teach."
College Sophomore,4,Keystone cares about each individual student.
College Freshman,4,I think every student is held to a good academic standard and that professors are the right amount of strict when it comes to turning in assignments.
College Freshman,4,There seems to be quite a large variety of students in campus
College Freshman,4,"Overall, the class sizes are decent. The professors interact well with the students, always trying to bring each student into the conversation."
College Senior,4,There is a strong community atmosphere at this school.
College Senior,4,The athletic teams are coached well and compete regularly within our conferences in each respective sport.
College Sophomore,4,"Keystone is a great school. Everyone knows everyone since it's such a small school, you get to know your professors on a personal basis, and class sizes are not ridiculously large. It's a great environment to be in."
College Sophomore,4,Professors are very helpful and very approachable. They really want you to succeed.
College Freshman,4,the health office is closed too often
College Freshman,4,the school is fun and wild life is all around you but scheduling is very messed up at times
College Freshman,4,"It gives an opportunity to be independent and to reach out and discover your interests, and make new connections along the way."
College Freshman,4,"I didn't officially start my first semester or anything yet but I went to the orientation and it seems like it would be a great learning experience for me. The campus is beautiful and pretty big. Also, it seems filled with a lot of smart, unique, and determined students who want to make it in life and be successful and I plan on becoming one of those students once i start my journey to my career. I think what makes this school so unique is it's surroundings and the environment , it's surrounded by plenty of mountains, trees, and rivers and a lot of people like to be around that type of environment because it's so peaceful and away from everything distracting."
College Sophomore,4,keystone college is a great place to participate in sports and if you want that one on one help in the class room. The teachers are great and it is a great place to meet long life friends.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is nice, it makes it easier to get to know people and make new friends.  It saves on transportation expenses.  The downfall about the dorms though, is that housekeeping does not always do a great job."
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus, but I wish the dorm rooms were a little bit bigger."
College Sophomore,4,gets you ready for the real world
College Sophomore,4,"small classes, very hands on"
College Sophomore,4,"Like any college, sexual assault is present but it is not frequent. the counseling center is very proactive in stopping any problems and helping anyone in need."
College Sophomore,4,I have not looked into off campus housing. I live at home currently.
College Freshman,4,I always feel like some ones watching to make sure were safe
College Freshman,4,ill always remember my experience at keystonecollege
College Freshman,4,its always fun to hang out with others on campus.
College Freshman,4,some of the teaching mythos are strange but good...
College Freshman,4,its a clean school very sanitary. good nurse facility
College Freshman,4,the school really helps students get where they want to go
College Junior,4,"I love the mountains and the woods so being in a small remote location is very enjoyable to me. If you are use to the city or a lot of people and businesses around, you may be in for a culture shock"
College Junior,4,There is very few cases of sexual assault on campus. Noise levels can be very high at times. And drugs and alcohol are prohibited but still used by the student body
College Junior,4,Internships are required for sport and recreational management. It's an extremely easy major that most of the athletes take.
College Junior,4,"I love being in the Psychology program at Keystone. My adviser helps me whenever I need it, the professors are understanding, and the professors are wonderful teachers. The workload is not that much and the curriculum is simple to understand. I am currently in a work-study position and I love it; I just wish it paid more."
College Junior,4,"I am currently in the Psychology program at Keystone College, and I love it! The program was not hard to get into at all, you just have to sign a paper. The only challenge I have faced was the adjuncts that teach at this college. They do not care like the other facility do. Admissions was easy as well and I believe Keystone has one of the best admissions offices in the U.S. I you need help, they will do everything they can."
College Junior,4,"For this small college, there are very few drug problems. Students may drink on campus, but not enough to cause any problems."
College Freshman,4,"I feel as if your advisor is a good support system, and everyone on campus could also be supportive. The professors you encounter are also supportive as well, and are easily approachable. Tutors are great and can be easily utilized if you have a question, or do not understand a certain area of a subject. If you have an IEP Keystone is excellent at making sure you receive the proper accommodations as documented in an IEP. Keystone has a great deal of job opportunities and implements the Keystone Promise.  "
College Freshman,4,"Keystone makes sure that every student is safe, and no one is harmed. Campus crime rarely happens. I feel as if I am safe walking to class alone during the day, however during the night I always entail the buddy system just to make sure nothing happens to me. Campus Security could be better at enforcing the quiet hours during finals, and midterm week. "
College Freshman,4,"The housing is great. It is close to classes, and has bathrooms that are easily accessible. The dining hall is close by as well as the library for study time. The social atmosphere is great everyone is very friendly and easily approachable. "
College Freshman,4,"I feel as if Keystone emphasizes the athletics as an awards system. Which means you keep certain grades and a certain GPA in order to play. They rate athletics as important, however they emphasize that academics come first. "
College Freshman,4,There are a decent amount of housing off campus. You can buy homes and rent them for not just you but you can have to up to 4 other friends with you usually.
College Freshman,4,"Teachers are helpful, nicely sized classroom (Very much the size of High School classes, 20-21 kids)."
College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of computers, but during finals and exams, sometimes get booked up."
College Sophomore,2,There is no greek life on campus
College Freshman,2,for being a vegan options are slim. the majority of the food is frozen
College Junior,2,The computers are outdated and very slow. Half the time you can't log onto most of the computers without waiting 15 mins for everything to load
College Junior,2,It's absolutely ridiculous that they do not revise your package after two years of being a 4.0 gpa and a student athlete who is very involved on campus. It's horrible
College Junior,2,The food is very greasy and and there aren't many good options
College Freshman,2,At Keystone there isn't really a set Greek group. Almost everybody in keystone look at each other as equals and treat each other well. We do have a set building for upper class man who have a higher GPA average than most. You didn't really have an option to select if your school doesn't have Greeks.
College Freshman,2,it's mediocre in comparison to other college and does not provide a reasonable array of options for people with unique dietary needs.
College Freshman,2,I came from a competitive out of state high school and felt underwhelmed by the academics. I feel as if my AP and advanced high school classes made these seem rather remedial.
College Freshman,2,"They have the same food everyday. The grill is usually the best place to eat, but the ladies in the caf are always so kind."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus has a predominantly white population. There is not much diversity. There are clubs and organizations for other minority groups although, there are not many members."
College Freshman,2,Only have shuttles that come a 7 everyday if you want to go to the mall or walmart
College Freshman,2,There is a lot of drama and people tend to stay in their rooms.
College Sophomore,2,There is always a time in which weed is being smoked at Keystone. You can smell it a large portion of the time.
College Junior,2,"There aren't many things to do. There's a club, but its an hour away from the school. The nearby clubs either closed down, or are under new management. There is almost a party every week so it keeps you entertained, and the parties are in walking distance (for the most part). There are a few bars, but they're only for people 21 and over. It's good to be good friends with someone who has a car"
College Junior,2,"Some people may get caught with alcohol in their rooms, but overall, the drug /alcohol scene is pretty non-existent"
College Junior,2,"Campus transportation can cause some inconvenience at times. There is a set time for campus transportation that only runs once a day and twice on weekends. Campus transportation only makes a few selected stops, and some of those stops are only accessible on weekends"
College Sophomore,2,"Distance to Have Fun â€“ The nightlife at Keystone isn't all that great. In order to have fun, you have to drive twenty minutes to go to the club, or a lounge. Downtown Scranton is the hot spot to be at night."
College Junior,2,"In the Woods â€“ Keystone is a beautiful campus with lots of trees, woods, and rivers, however it is at least a 30 minute commute for most people and is located on a highway stretch with barely any businesses located near it. Therefore, there is not much else to do besides attending classes or going for a walk in the woods.. which sometimes has bears."
College Senior,2,"Keystone College is in a very rural location therefore you have to travel at least 15 minutes to get to any chains of the off-campus restaurants. I like to eat healthy, and most of them are fast food places which I do not eat at. I might as well just make the commute back home to eat. I do not know any of the places that offer a student discount which is very upsetting as well being a broke college student."
College Sophomore,2,I believe the campus has an average rate of diversity and acceptance. The ratio of white to black is a land slide.
Junior,1,the financial situation here is terrible 1 in 4 students struggle  to just pay for the school because they put all of there money into building stupid shopping centers and adding sports teams instead of hiring competent teachers and keeping up to date science labs. i highly recommend you attend a different school.
Freshman,1,"I would like to see Keystone actually care for their students. The food is absolutely horrendous, if you have a problem with somebody they blow you off. The RAâ€™s donâ€™t like to do their job. If you get harrassed by a student, and report it to them, they blow it off. Do NOT come to Keystone. You will hate it."
Niche User,1,I did not like how unorganized the college is and how unorganized the professors were. They seemed like they didn't really care if you succeeded or not.
Recent Alumnus,1,Really wished keystone had Greek life
College Junior,1,There is no off campus parking and on campus parking is terrible if you have a class later than 8 am
College Junior,1,Had a very bad experience using the school commuter counsel advisor. But there are a lot of nice places in Clark's summit
College Junior,1,There is no off campus dining
College Sophomore,1,"There is not much variety. You have two places to choose from to eat. The Grill where they make wraps and burgers; or the all you can eat buffet where they offer pizza and in ""homestyle"" dish as well as a small salad bar."
College Sophomore,1,This campus is in the middle of nowhere so you have to drive at lead 7-10 miles to get to a town. I feel bad for the other students who don't have cars. I would go crazy.
College Freshman,1,Nothing to do especially when you don't have a car. The nearest place is about 5-10 minutes away and walking wise its a while.
College Freshman,1,A lot of people drink and do drugs on campus daily
College Senior,1,"Last year there seemed to be an abundance of parking spots. As a resident on campus, I am guaranteed parking in a special lot. However, I notice that commuter students have a problem finding parking, usually circling the lots a few times, and then parking in spots that they aren't suppose to, or aren't even spots at all. I believe Keystone could do a better job on that."
College Junior,1,"Not Many Options â€“ The is barely any restaurants in the area. There are a few diners and one gourmet restaurant, but nothing much of interest. If you want to eat somewhere decent, but still for a higher cost you can go to Clarks Summit which is still 10/15 minutes away."

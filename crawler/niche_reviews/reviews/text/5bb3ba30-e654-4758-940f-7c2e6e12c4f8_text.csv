Junior,5,"When Anna Maria transitioned to online learning this spring semester, not only did my professors email me, but my advisors did as well. My advisors wanted to make sure that students were not overwhelmed with the workload online because even though we were home, they did not want us sitting in front of the computer screen for the entire day. My professors set up weekly zoom meetings that were personal but still academically focused. They wanted to make sure that we were handling their workload without being stressed with the situations in the world."
Sophomore,5,"Anna Maria College is a very communal college with professors part of that community. You would be hard-pressed to find someone who won't help you if you are struggling with a subject, whether it is in the student success center or another one of your peers. The professors also are helpful, most try to make accommodations for students and work with them to make the best learning environment they can."
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience at Anna Maria College has been very positive. I have learned so much in just my first semester, and the atmosphere of the school community is very welcoming and safe. I look forward to completing the rest of my four years at this school."
Junior,5,I am a college student at Anna Maria College. I am in my junior year and I’ve played football since freshman year. I have had a good experience living on campus as well.
Sophomore,5,The small classroom sizes make it easier for the teachers to interact with us. The professors are good with communicating and making sure you have everything you need to succeed.
Sophomore,5,"Anna Maria College is a wonderful school. The teachers are very understanding, and cater towards their students. All of the professors go out of their way, to help any student who is in need of help. If you are struggling in a class, most professors would be glad to help. I would highly recommend this school to anyone who is particularly interested in studying music therapy. The music therapy program is intensive, but prepares you well when you go into your clinical practicum placements."
Freshman,5,"Anna Maria College is a great community of learning and practice.  A community with great faculty and staff support, and student relationships. The academics go beyond lectures, with great integration of real life practice – which overall will prepare a student to be equipped with relevant knowledge and experience to fit in 21st century work force."
Niche User,5,"I am excited to attend Anna Maria College.  They make sure to make their incoming students feel welcome, even if it is just by their acceptance letter package.  Their teacher to student ratio is very telling by their school demographics."
Alum,5,"I love Anna Maria College so very much! It is truly a community where people are friendly and service-oriented. I have felt most comfortable being who I truly am here and I know that others do, as well. Yes, it is a college founded by the catholic Sisters of Saint Anne, but all are welcome here. I have been inspired by the campus ministry director who invites all to be who they are and practice what they believe even at religious-based celebrations. Oh, and the campus grounds are so beautiful and peaceful. I have always felt safe walking around the whole campus, including in the nature that surrounds the campus, even in the night. Be sure to visit the pond near the back in between classes."
Niche User,5,"I visited Anna Maria as a guest, and someone who is about to graduate high school. I really like how there is availability to develop a relationship with the professors due to the small class sizes. I also enjoy how close everyone usually is and how it is a perfect sized school. This school to me is really different from other state schools. It's not overwhelmingly large and it seems very peaceful."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing school. the campus is small, but everything here is clean, everyone is kind, its very easy to get involved on campus and its fun to be involved! wide variety of clubs, sports, and activities. great game nights and floor programs whether its with an RA or the office of Residence life! come visit i promise you'll find this place to be great."
Sophomore,5,"Small campus where all students are friendly and roommates are easy to find and get along with. Dorms are some great and new while others are okay and old. Rooms are medium to large, having two, four or six students. The common areas are well kept and useful for relaxing and getting together. The student success center is a plus for every student. All the classes I need extra help in it was easy to find a student tutor and to find study groups for finals and exams. As an athlete we have study groups for each sport and extra time to find help with all subjects."
College Sophomore,5,"We have a hug crowd of fans when it comes the sports, a lot of people supporting."
College Sophomore,5,I choose my school because it's a small school where everybody comes together as a family. The teachers makes learning the subject really fun and easy to understand.
College Junior,5,Very challenging there is no such thing as easy classes as a nursing major. Almost every student struggles.
College Junior,5,There are police on campus and they occasionally walk around. There is also a police dog. I feel very safe on campus.
College Junior,5,The value of a nursing degree or any degree from AMC is very high.
College Student,5,On campus we are very much protected. There are countless approachable people there to help you if you were ever in any trouble.
College Student,5,overall i enjoy my school. between the faculty and other students that attend its my home away from home.
College Student,5,Its a homely feel. i live on campus comfortably.
College Student,5,So far my school has been welcoming and helpful.
College Freshman,5,Public safety is always there for us and we have the best RA's that help us if we are upset about something. I feel very safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,I love my school. The teachers are great and the tutors really help me out with my Anatomy class. I think it is a perfect place for me to be.
College Freshman,5,There is barely any reasons to be scared on campus. There is rarely sexual assault issues. We have a sub station for the police on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Due to being close to Worcester, there are great job opportunities and things to do around here. You just need to drive about 15 minutes."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I absolutely love my major. I was always a nursing major, but then I decided to change to health science. I believe it was the best decision I could have made. I have much more of a variety with what I am studying and I will be able to fine any job after school."
College Freshman,5,The music therapy major at Anna Maria is pretty good all the professors are really nice and they are fair. The advisor for music therapy majors is really a very nice woman and knows what she's doing.
College Freshman,5,Anna Maria is a really great school with a great music department!
College Freshman,5,It's in the middle of no where but five to ten minutes down the road is Worcester so there's always something you can do.
College Freshman,5,I didn't have any difficulties.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Anna Maria.  Due to my work schedule, I could not partake in classes this semester. I am so in love with Anna Maria that even when I was looking into other schools with more flexible hours or online classes, I could not picture myself there furthering my education like I can at Anna Maria."
College Sophomore,5,"All students, including freshman, are allowed to have cars on campus, and there is never an issue with finding a parking spot. Residents can only park in some parking lots, commuters can park anywhere. The shuttle mainly runs on the weekends. It goes to Wal Mart, and also to a near by outdoor shopping mall, which has a nice movie theater and lots of places to eat."
College Sophomore,5,"The most crime that ever happens at Anna Maria is underage drinking. I rarely hear of any stealing, and feel confident in leaving my bag unattended for a few minutes if I need to. Campus is small, so walking to different buildings is no big deal. At night path ways are lit up. I never feel scared walking alone at night, but if you do public safety is always near by to assist you at any time."
College Sophomore,5,"Anna Maria is located in a quiet town, at the end of a neighborhood type road. The campus its self is very isolated, which is nice because it gives it a small and very safe feeling. But Anna Maria is located only a few miles outside of Worcester, a city with plenty of entertainment and shopping. The Worcester area is also home to 13 other colleges, making it very easy to interact with other campuses."
College Freshman,5,"When I auditioned to become a music therapy major, I was extremely nervous because of the high standards and vigorous music program at AMC. Because of my strong work ethic and calm appearance (though I was very nervous), I was accepted."
College Freshman,5,There are many diverse students at AMC. Our office of diversity and multicultural affairs reaches out to students to grow in respect for people of diverse cultures and backgrounds.
College Freshman,5,The scool is not very strict. It is your choice to attend class and do your work.
College Freshman,5,We have Paxton police and i feel extremely safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,no need for a car on campus. All buildings are in close proximity to each other
College Senior,5,The computer are in fantastic shape. There are computer labs all over campus. The computers themselves are basically brand new within the past 1 or 2 years. Ans all the programs are up to date. There are new computer labs that have just been built and 20 brand new computers have been purchased.
Sophomore,4,"Overall the campus is nice, tucked away private. Safe to walk at night. Dorms aren't that nice and the food isn't that good but as for learning I can't complain much. The professors seem to care about the students and are very helpful as long as they put in the effort to get help."
Freshman,4,It was a great experience and I would recommend to other people as well. There are many good aspects that the school has to make the on campus experience an enjoyable one.
Freshman,4,Very engaging and still a friendly community online. The environment that was on campus was brought directly to online to help smooth out the transition to online learning.
Junior,4,"Anna Maria College is a small private school in Paxton, Massachusetts. The small tight-knit community is welcoming and feels like home. All of the professors want you to achieve your goals and are always willing to provide advice in the career path you are choosing. My advisors are amazing and consistently reach out throughout the course of the semester to ""check-in"" and make sure I am trying my best in all my classes. My professors are challenging, yet understanding of the workload of other classes. The Student Success Center is by far my favorite place on campus because there are tutors who have taken the classes you are struggling in and they are willing to help you."
Sophomore,4,Anna Maria is a very small school which is why I love it. The classes are small and the campus is easy to navigate.
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love my school and the diversity within the students and staff. Everyone here will go to the ends of the earth to make sure that your experience and academics are as good as possible.
Junior,4,I have yet to take a class with this school but the enrolling process has been very easy. They are willing to do whatever they can to make the process as simple as possible for you
Freshman,4,"This is a very small campus. One good thing about it is everything is in walking distance. So especially with it being in the small town of Worcester in the winter, nothing is more than a 5 minute walk. The food is okay. Professors are great, they are willing to accommodate to your needs which is great. Because of this school being such a small campus, the faculty is willing to get to know everyone on a personal basis. Although, there is a lack of clubs. The sports teams are decent but could be better. This school is also very pricey, so plan on applying for a number of scholarships."
Freshman,4,"The community , the activities and the type of environment that’s provided . People around you are very kind and supportive"
Freshman,4,"Anna Maria had helped me to solidify what I want to do with my future. Before I came to Anna Maria I had ideas for what I would like to do, by Anna Maria has helped my to solidify that I am supposed to be a cop and serve and protect the communities that I will get the chance to serve. College has been one of my biggest dreams, but there are a lot of side issues with coming to a school like Anna Maria. Stemming from a broken home and just being raised by a single mother, I don't have the financial opportunity to pay for school in big chunks nor pay it in full like some students I know. Scholarships are a big deal to me and my family and help me relieve stress from not only myself, but from my caring mother. Any scholarship counts and any scholarship that I am awarded I have forever been thankful for. Each scholarship gives me the opportunity to stay at a school like Anna Maria."
Freshman,4,"Anna Maria College is excellent for an education. The classes and workload are manageable. There is a great sense of community on campus and student life works hard to create events for student to enjoy. However, there is a lack of advertising for the events. Only downfall of a small community is that everyone knows everyones business."
College Freshman,4,Police is located on campus
College Sophomore,4,Drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana are strictly prohibited and will result in a fine and community service. It's not accepted on campus. People don't really peer pressure anyone. It's college so students are going to do it and have fun regardless. The students are just sneaky about it but there are consequences to face. The RA's and RD's job is to help and protect the students. They often walk around and check the hallways/rooms.
College Sophomore,4,The professors I had were very knowledgeable and they would do anything to help their students succeed. I love how much they care for the students. They are passionate about their jobs and would answer any question that is asked.
College Sophomore,4,"Everything is great. The professors would help the students get internships so they can get a good feel of the field they are in! Everyone has to earn a position in everything. I agree that if a person works hard enough, then that person should be rewarded and the staff agree with this rule. The quality of employers recruiting on campus is a great one in my opinion. The services on campus are outstanding. They offer tutors to those who need extra help! There are a few great places on campus to study. The staff/faculty are very friendly and they do their very best. There are great services there. The food is not that bad. There's a mailroom. The campus police would give any service. Overall, the quality of the school is a good one and I would recommend anybody to enroll at Anna Maria."
College Sophomore,4,The Health Services building wants the health records from every student because the staff care and are concern for the students. There's Public Safety on campus. The police officers are always checking the campus making sure it's safe. They're always watching on the cameras and will show up anywhere on campus of there's need of assistance. Sometimes the police officers would open the students' room door because they're locked out. They would help anyone who needs to go to the hospital or who is in danger. It's usually quiet and peaceful at AMC if there's no one making loud noises. AMC is very safe and it's easier to look after because it's small.
College Sophomore,4,"I finished my first year of college and have gone through so much. I made a lot of friends. Some of them are very understanding and like to be there for me. However, some are not. Some students are less social and make unnecessary comments that could hurt a person's feelings. There's always going to be some type of drama in any place a person would go. During college, I realized that certain opinions shouldn't matter and get in the way of my destination. There are so many great students, professors and staff there. My college is a small community and the relationships among people are closer than any other college. In a way you could say we're just one family. I say that because we all know each other and there's no problem of saying hi. I got a great feel on how the school work is like too. I knew before my freshman year that there was going to be a lot of work, studying and essays to do. I put aside my fear, and done it. I've written so many essays and I've studied so hard throughout one year. I stayed up late to the point where I had to force myself to stay up. I know I'm not the only one. My biggest problem, as well as others, is that I procrastinate. I have to manage my time appropriately which I will next semester because I know how it's like. I was tired all the time and I didn't get enough sleep most of the time. I managed to get every work done on time though but it was through the hard way. The essays didn't help, especially the 4+ pages. I'm already a slow essay writer. I take my time and look over so many times to make sure it doesn't sound bad. It's honestly not that bad if you really set your mind to it. What gets me going is the support I receive from the community and playing soccer. I experienced playing college soccer and it's so much different from High School but I was preparing for it. I knew there was going to be a lot more running and focus. I've grown to love soccer and after playing, I love it even more. It's great and safe place to go!"
College Junior,4,Very diverse group of students
College Junior,4,"Overall, AMC is a great school. I rated a 4 out of 5 because there is always room to improve."
College Junior,4,"Overall, Anna Maria is a great school. I am currently a junior nursing student, and it is a very challenging program but it is worth it. Roughly half of the 2018 class failed patho, which means that if you fail you have to stay back a year since the college does not have enough staff to teach during the school year. The nursing faculty are great and are highly experienced. When I first came here I questioned whether or not this was the right college for me, but this is a perfect fit. The professors care about their students and whether or not they do well and that matters the most to me. I would recommend this nursing program to any student who is self motivated and will work hard. Most students failed because they did not take the difficulty of the classes seriously and went out too much/ partied. Being a nursing student you have no social life so be warned lol. For instance one test typically covers 12 or more chapters and you are expected to know all of it. Not trying to scare anyone but that is the reality of this program and many other programs. It is a hard program and it is very expensive but I pay for what I get. I pay 23 k a year to have a quality education with great professors and I am very grateful for that."
College Student,4,Graduating from my school brings about numerous opportunities.
College Student,4,They encourage you to get involved
College Freshman,4,They want us to participate in internships and always send us emails about them
College Freshman,4,Classes are small. Teachers get to know you. They love to get you to participate in class and get you to understand materials.
College Freshman,4,I can't wait to live in a suite next year. The suites are the nicest place to live. Freshmen dorm isn't that bad. There is a lot of storage.
College Freshman,4,Our teams are the best but our athletes work very hard and try their best. Our coaches are the sweetest coaches on earth including the football coach. He is like a role model for his players.
College Freshman,4,The staff on campus cares a lot about the students and if anything were to happen to anyone on campus everyone would jump at the chance to help.
College Freshman,4,As a school we support our athletics in every way possible. At all athletic games the stands are packed with people
College Freshman,4,My time here at Anna Maria College has been very beneficial for me. I have made many new friends and experienced things that I never thought I would. The professors are very knowledgeable in their fields of study and I feel I can learn a lot from them. I cannot wait to spend the next three years here.
College Freshman,4,My overall experience is great. There are definitely some things that need improvement.
College Freshman,4,"It is good for a small school. The dorms are average, the freshman dorm is old but the other dorms are new and really nice."
College Freshman,4,"Due to the small school size, most people turn out for games. It is a big part of the school and the support is huge. I would not have gone here if the sports were bad and not supported."
College Freshman,4,I love it her so far but there are a few things that they are working on to make it better.
College Sophomore,4,My school had a strong music program that was also backed up by a state senator. We have opportunities for many different music styles and it's so diverse.
College Senior,4,i love the experience of living on my home . i have matured a lot.
College Freshman,4,They do a really good job.
College Freshman,4,It's really clean and the food is good.
Recent Alumnus,4,There isn't really a specific criteria.
Recent Alumnus,4,Campus safety is great at my school. There is always someone on duty and if they are in the office they have the number you can call for assistance. All the officers are very friendly.
College Freshman,4,Whe I got all my taxes on I got the financial aide I needed but I still have student loans that I have to pay off.
College Freshman,4,The labs have  a lot of computers and thir is always somewhere to print things.
College Freshman,4,If you want anything it's nearby. You just need a car to get there.
College Freshman,4,I received a lot but I still need more.
College Freshman,4,There are tutors whenever you need it. There's really no excuse to fail.
College Freshman,4,There's not a lot of problems. Like very other college
College Sophomore,4,I wish they had kept the teachers for Paralegal until all Paralegal majors had graduated though.
College Sophomore,4,"It is fairly decent, but you should get there early that way you don't have to walk across campus to get to your classes."
College Sophomore,4,The sports are an amazing way for everyone on campus to come together.
College Sophomore,4,I tend to get confused fairly easily.  The financial aid faculty is willing to help.
College Sophomore,4,"I do not live on campus, but if I could afford it and if it wasn't so far away for me I would not mind it at all."
College Sophomore,4,"I do not really eat at school, so I am not really one to know for sure."
College Sophomore,4,I love Paxton.  The small town charm makes you feel safe to spend time in.
College Sophomore,4,They are great at knowing when enough is enough.
College Sophomore,4,I live in Auburn so I am not really one to know for sure about housing that is local to Anna Maria College.
College Sophomore,4,"Before they re-did the library and the student success center my rating would have been much lower.  

These buildings and computers have come a long way in the past year or so."
College Junior,4,I am doing art therapy and there are a lot of required courses
College Junior,4,Anna Maria offers both music and art therapy which is pretty unique
College Junior,4,there is a great campus ministry. there is a lot of school spirit for the teams
College Junior,4,the information commons is open 24 hours now. the athletic center has machines and weights.
College Sophomore,4,"I am a Nursing major.  I am a sophomore and just started the nursing courses in a four year bachelor degree program. So for all the nursing professors are awesome! The work load is a lot, but its all about learning hour to manage your time, and it wont get stressful. Be prepared to take a lot of science courses as a nursing major!"
College Freshman,2,It's okay I just don't think its for me
College Freshman,2,No one attends events but that partly due to the fact we don't win many games
College Freshman,2,It's a very small school where kids still act as if their in high school.
College Junior,2,I would say many people here drink way too much. There have been many times when an ambulance has been called due to over drinking.
College Freshman,2,The amount they give doesn't help much because it's so small.
College Freshman,2,"everyone acts the same. they are either an obnoxious jock, music nerd, or just very generic"
College Freshman,2,"The freshman dorms are very old and at times, disgusting."
College Junior,2,There is no night-life transportation and Worcester clubs are grimy.
College Senior,2,It snows a lot. It is also very windy and cold. Bring lots of layers!
College Senior,2,There is a lot of alcohol use and poor alcohol control. Students are also known to smoke marijuana in the bathrooms of the suites.
College Senior,2,There is not a lot of options for off campus housing. The School also cuts scholarship money if you are not living on campus.
College Senior,2,We have a new multi-purpose sports field which is very nice.
College Senior,2,"There's a shuttle, but it only runs on certain days and to certain places. You need a car on campus for most activities."
College Senior,2,"It's mostly a suitcase school. There's not much to do, and the dorms are not great.  The walls are very thin, and you can often hear your neighbors doing many things."
Recent Alumnus,2,"When I attended the school there were only four teams; Men's Basketball & Soccer, and Women's basketball & Field Hockey.  Now the campus has tripled in size and the school has a football team and stadium.  I have no ides what the 'on-campus' life is like nowadays."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is located in a rural area but there is a fairly large town about 30 minutes away.  Worcester has multiple choices for bars, clubs, amd lounges thast welcome college students of drinking age."
College Junior,2,"I Need More Variety – I need more variety and diversity in the classes provided at my school, I really don't have many options to obtain my grade, there's no fun or enjoyment with it at all. At least there are enough classes so I can get my degree, but it's not enjoyable at all."
College Freshman,2,"All incoming freshmen currently only have the option of living in Madonna Hall, and it is literally like a jail cell. The bathrooms on my floor are the cleanest ones in the building because my floor is the smallest but generally all the others are very dirty with bugs and insects crawling around. Next year Freshmen will be able ot move to St Anna's so thats sometihng positive because St Anna's was just built."
Niche User,1,"If you want to become depressed and anxiety ridden come to Anna Maria. Awful school and most of the nursing professors are rude and non supportive. I really from the bottom of my heart urge you to not go to this school. I will regret my decision to attend this school for the rest of my life, but I transferred and am so much happier.  The main problem is that this school wants you to fail and actually sets you up to fail! Studying 14 chapters for one nursing test is insane. Don’t come here!!!! There are way better schools out there that actually care about you holistically. At Anna Maria I felt like I was just a number."
Niche User,1,"The nursing program at this school is horrible. One professor (not naming names) told me to my face when I was really struggling (with a learning disability) that I would never be a great nurse.   I worked my butt off, went to extra help, etc. The teachers just do not support you, THEY WANT YOU TO FAIL!!! SO MESSED UP!!! I take responsibility for my learning- but the atmosphere here is just toxic. The tutoring is awful- they have no experience working with students who struggle every day with learning disabilities. I am now at another nursing program and am SO much happier. The NCLEX rate at my new school is awesome, and the professors care and actually treat me like a human.  Thank you AMC nursing faculty for teaching me what I do not want to become. I am happy I went to another school, since I would honestly be afraid to become a nurse from your program. I can't wait to be a great nurse from a nursing program that CARES and SUPPORTS me!!!"
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life
College Junior,1,Actually no Greek life at all. you need to go to a different school for frat parties
College Freshman,1,"This is high school round two the kids here are stupid, the school is the size of a small village in medieval times.  The girls are disgusting. The guys heads are stuck so far up their own asses thinking their great jocks playing for the worst athletic teams in the country.."
College Sophomore,1,The Food Sucks – the food is horrible and some students actually get sick from it.
College Junior,1,"Nothing Is Good – The professors are mostly fine, but sometimes the course load is unbearable. And VERY little work study options and ONLY to students who qualify for a work study. The school really should help students find jobs on and/or near campus to help pay for the tuition."
College Junior,1,"Pot Smells Gross, the Alcohol Needs to Be Controlled – Drinking happens way too much on campus, I hate seeing and hearing it all the time. The pot HAS to go away, it smells gross and I don't appreciate the contaminated air in the residence halls that I have to breathe."
College Freshman,1,Decent but Not Enough – There is not enough stations for food and also not open enough. selection is decent though

Junior,5,I've taken a handful of courses online and enjoyed them. It's obvious the professors treat online courses with the same respect as in person courses.
Junior,5,I've attended off and on over the years and have had great experiences each time. I look forward to returning to finally finish.
Sophomore,5,"I have enjoyed being on campus at Midwestern State University. The social community is good, professors care about the students, diverse, and a academically focused school as well. The campus is beautiful and large. The only downside I have is the cost of tuition."
Senior,5,"This is a nice school with good living options and closer to affordable tuition. If I had to pick a con for the school, it would be the food on campus. I would just prefer more options but other than that the school is nice."
Senior,5,The online experience here was great! The professors did a good job responding and I was able to put PowerPoint and lecture videos side-by-side which was very helpful.
Freshman,5,"I love my school, I can’t wait to go there and be with all the new people and new friends I’m gonna make! I also can’t wait to decorate my dorm!!"
Sophomore,5,"In Midwestern State University, everyone is treated the same. There is no discrimination of race, gender, age, sexuality, etc. There are events from different campus organizations that are for everyone. Those organizations are a fun way to relax from stress and they help bring everyone together. Midwestern State University is a great place to learn and enjoy everyone’s company. The campus isn’t too small nor is it too big. The largest classes are roughly fifty people or so, and the smaller classes are no more than roughly 25 people. The professors are really nice, understanding and are very helpful. I really enjoy the classes I take. I get to learn new things everyday to help me get a better understanding of everything."

For one, MSU has a great team of staff and faculty that actually care and keep to with their students. Another reason MSU Is great, is because of the school spirit we show as a school. At MSU we are one. There is no other way of explaining it, we all communicate and help each other out. MSU is a diamond in the rough and anyone and everyone who attends will figure this out immediately."

Sophomore,5,"My experience in this university is alright, I wish it had more areas surrounding that had more of a party feel to it. There are no clubs, there are some but not suited for everybody I think. The school has a non-smoking campus which is a bummer but its manageable. It is a small university compared to others I've seen like UNT and UTA."
Sophomore,5,"The campus itself is beautiful, very open, and always teeming with life. The faculty/staff are always incredibly helpful, knowledgeable about events on campus, but most importantly sympathetic about your individual situation and will do absolutely everything in their power to help you achieve your goals.I truly feel at home there."
Niche User,5,I love that the campus is small enough to get to all of your class without having to wake up too early.
Junior,5,I love my school! The environment is welcoming and the professors are accommodating. Our campus is beautiful and WF is a very relaxed college town.

Sophomore,5,"Midwestern State University is surrounded by a diverse body of students from all walks of life. It is structured for maximum learning with a quiet environment far from distractions. Although it is a learning institution, the need for stress relieving activities are just a ride away. There are many organizations in which one can get involved in as well as healthy assistance through academic advising, counseling and personal sessions with your lectureres. If you are an incoming student, a smooth transition is provided by organizations within the university. It is a safe institution with amenities such as the pool and gym which you can use to your liesure. Midwestern State University is a school of comfort and a home away from home."
Junior,5,"I love that MSU is now so close to where I live and has many options for online classes. This has kept tuition costs down and has saved me in gas! With their use of technology and the new campus they have made that is five minutes from my house, I can complete my bachelor's degree in education. What is even better is that they have partnered with NCTC, where I received my associate's degree, and all of my credits transferred. Every single one. Not worrying about that or having to retake classes has been such a relief. My professors have been stellar and the rest of the faculty and staff has been very friendly and accommodating, despite me being a distance learner!"
Graduate Student,5,"Midwestern State University is a beautiful campus, and I can't wait for New Student Orientation. I chose this university because of its diversity, the professors mentor the students, and it isn't too far from home! While I was there I was able to walk the campus and get a ""feel"" of the environment, I was able to speak to a counselor, and any questions I had were answered with understanding and care. I know I made the right choice after visiting the campus."
Alum,5,"MSU is a fantastic school in a great college town.  The cost is very affordable, especially if you live off campus, there are a ton of rental houses available and some affordable apartment complexes as well.  The student to professor ratio is excellent, and the professors genuinely care about the student's education.  I spent 3 years here getting an Athletic Training degree and it really prepared me for life after college.  I loved my time at MSU and would highly recommend it to anyone!"
Freshman,5,Midwestern State is a comfortable and friendly environment. The professors are always ready to help any student at any time. I love the hands on learning in the Exercise Physiology department. The students are filled with life and ready to learn. The administrators always kn ow the answers and keep your best interest in mind at all times. they tell you the truth about your academic performance and make sure you are always doing the best you can.
Junior,5,The school is extremely affordable and offers a good range of degrees. All of the professors are friendly and willing to give you a break if an emergency pops up. There's also a lot of diversity due to their foreign programs.
Niche User,5,It really is an amazing school. The atmosphere alone is worth going here and it really makes you feel like family. 100% would buy again haha
Freshman,5,Such a diverse student population. If you want a taste of globalization thats where you go. Very friendly family environment and modern course work. I am not disappointed in my choice.

Senior,5,"This university is the perfect size! Not so big to feel intimidated, but large enough to have a wide range of activities and student organizations. My experience as a student here has been amazing, and I’ve met some great peers and professors."
Freshman,5,"Midwestern is a fun and very involved campus, i love it here. This is my home town and when I’m on campus i honestly feel like I’m away from home. I live on campus and there’s always activities going on around campus and there’s also lots of study group and programs to help you with your classes. From tutoring to the writing help lab, the library, all the older students are very helpful."
Freshman,5,"It was amazing at Midwestern state university. Enjoyed it very well. 
I have met good new friends around the world. Working together and cooperating each other, it was a wonderful year."
Sophomore,5,"My first semester with Midwestern State University was great. It was my first time away from my family and required me to make some adjustments. All for the good though.  With one semester down and another one to go, i’m going to continue to make the adjustments and further my education."

It's an easy school to navigate around and the classrooms aren't too big meaning that the headcount in classes aren't too big so that you're able to have one on ones with professors. The department of psychology is also wonderful and have multiple resources such as counseling, psychology clinic, and more.  I love being involved in the clubs here and being a part of student life."
Niche User,5,"I had visited many university in the state of Texas and Midwestern State has been my favorite one, whenever I apply to scholarships Midwestern is my number one choice because I hope I can attend there. I like this University because is a small size , therefore students are able to know more about theirs professors, has many majors to choose, the dorms are amazing. I also like Midwestern because its close to home. 
The tour was good they give many information and the people was very nice."
Niche User,5,There are so many resources here to help you be successful. The professors truly care about you. They want you to succeed.
Sophomore,5,The faculty and staff are the best that there is. They make your learning experience their priority. The rich cultural diversity that they students from other ethnicities bring is one that is non comparable!
Sophomore,5,The professors actually remember your name and anything that you have told them in the past. They make you feel very welcomed into class and will go beyond to make sure you pass their class.
Alum,5,Midwestern State is a great University. The campus is average sized not to big and not too small. I enjoyed my time there as a student. The staf at the Library was particularly friendly and helpful when it came time for finals and writing your papers. You will experience professors who actually care about you and not just drones. The professors are helpful but will not hold your hand they offer good advice and communicate very well when you have an issue. Student life is great as there are opportunities to join different groups fro theater to Greek life. And lets not forget a good value for your money.
Graduate Student,5,"Midwestern state university offers  a wonderful undergraduate and graduate degree program. The mathematics department is pretty challenging. The campus holds movies and popcorn every Thursdays at the moffett library. In the fall, the campus is so beautiful. So much green space and the area all around is just beautiful."
Graduate Student,5,There is nothing that I would really change about the school it was an overall great experience. I mostly enjoyed being around a group of serious like minded scholars.
Freshman,5,My experience here is great! Beautiful campus coupled with amazing professors made my first year one that was successful and memorable.

Junior,5,"Midwestern State University is a good school overall. There are a lot of opportunities on campus to get involved. These include, numerous clubs, fraternities, sororities as well as athletics and the arts. Academically, Midwestern State is excellent and its different departments offer different opportunities for its students to get scholarships as they are posted in each department. Midwestern State also encourages the all rounded education of its students as it requires each student to take classes outside of their major. The institution is also home to a variety of students from all over the world; it boasts students from the Caribbean, Africa, as well as Asia. Its diverse range of students encourages students to interact with cultures different from their own and encourages inclusivity and acceptance of everyone irregardless of their background."
Freshman,5,Midwestern State University is a great school for people who can not afford to go to a big university. The campus is very nice and the people there are respectful.
Junior,5,The students and professors are wonderful.  Staff is very helpful when it is time to figure out schedules and getting registered for classes.  There are always things to do and activities to get involved with.
Junior,5,"The Nursing Program here is spectacular! I am currently in it now and feel like the smaller atmosphere gives you an edge, as you get more 1 on 1 time with your Nurse Educators."
Junior,5,Currently I am a Junior at Midwestern State University and so far my experience is really good. I love the campus and the people they’re really welcoming.
Sophomore,5,"The staff is very helpful. I was having trouble with my application but everything was fixed with one phone call. My advisor was very helpful getting me in classes even though my application was a little late. I was a transfer student, she also set my schedule up so I could fit into the degree plan of the university."
Freshman,5,"MWSU is a great college. The professors are friendly and helpful. MWSU is a small college which helps for socialisation and small teacher to student ratio. Moreover, they have a great undergraduate research program."

In every corner you will find someone willing to help you with your problems. Overall MWSU is a campus that is like a family.
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience here has been quite great. There have been a handful of inconveniences but that could just be the effects of the pandemic."
Freshman,4,"I took one class online, the rest of my classes were face-to-face and were a bit hybrid in a sense. Professors are mostly understanding and willing to work with you to help you learn and do well in the class. Sometimes they can be a bit unorganized or explain things poorly."
Sophomore,4,"Everyone at the school is very nice - students, faculty, ad staff. The professors are very willing to help you succeed, and the small class sizes afford them this opportunity. Even though the school is rather small, they still have many wonderful teachers that even have national awards and recognitions. It is easy to get involved on campus in many organizations. There is something for everyone. The campus itself is great! The dorms are modern and accommodating. The academic buildings have a beautiful antique facade, and the campus is small enough to be trekked in less than ten minutes! The school could be improved just by continuing to add more educational programs."
Sophomore,4,"I have not taken any classes online. However, since the virus has taken place, in the last semester, we had to change the In-person classes to being online classes.  At the beginning it was strange, but then I got used to it being online and I really enjoyed being able to relax somewhat while still attending class and doing the work. Personally, I am a visual learner so I thought it would be difficult to understand what we were learning, but I understood what we were learning anyway. Online classes  were not a bad experience for me."
Junior,4,"Many will say this is a very small campus, but I find this can be a good thing. I've had many professors actually care about your work and progress. While some facilities are not top tier (like the food), the overall experience I have had has been great."
Senior,4,"I am not qualified to rate online learning experience as I haven't taken an online class, however I have heard it is great."
Graduate Student,4,"I chose Midwestern State University because of its strong academic history and the diversity of the school. The location is ideal and the cost to attend is very inexpensive when compared to other universities that offer the same level of education. The classes are small and more up close and personal with the professors. You can always hear the professors and the professors are always willing to meet outside of the scheduled class times for any discussion questions or advice. They make sure their students are understanding and learning their materials. Also, I find learning is easier in a smaller classroom environment. Student jobs are also very easy to obtain on campus."
Senior,4,Small and community orientated campus. Very welcoming to international students. There are many on-campus activities and events to keep student life interesting.
Junior,4,"I won’t lie, online classes are harder than in class. We all saw this the last few months that we switched over, but at MSU, professors and other students in the class have a great connection with each other. Teachers have tried their best to make their classes run as smooth as they normally are in class. They will attend to you when you need  no matter what."
Freshman,4,Midwestern State University is diverse with students from all over the world. Students and teacher ratio is great as they were able to get to know each other. School spirit is definitely presented through school functions and events.
Sophomore,4,Midwestern is a good school once you know what you want to do. Overall I love the campus and the environment.
Sophomore,4,"I have had good experiences with all staff. There are some white fascist groups on campus, which isn't really being taken care of. The cafeteria is awful, both lacking in abundance and seasoning. However, I enjoy my classes and love my on campus apartment."
Junior,4,"The health science advisory board is not helpful when asking about certain programs and chances of you getting in one. They will tell one student one thing and another something opposite. Other than that, MWSU is great. The professors want the best for you and with smaller class sizes you are not just another student in their class. If you show that you are putting in the effort they will help you the best they can."
Sophomore,4,My overall experience has been. I like the small classroom's that it offers and how flexible they can be with your schedule.
Graduate Student,4,"I really enjoyed going there for undergrad and I'm going back as a graduated student. I learned a lot. I loved all my classes for my major. The professors are great and very knowledgeable. I met a lot of really cool people. The campus had some diversity because we got a lot of Caribbean students. We always had fun on weekends when we went out and we went to a lot of parties, so I had a good night life experience with my college friends. I did really well in school because the professors were helpful"
Freshman,4,"In my experience at Midwestern State University I have overcame many learning issues. I am very impressed by how friendly the campus is and how lively it is. There can be no better experience than Midwestern. It is very involved with their students and always have activities available . College seemed to be stressful at first, but the resources they provide students are very helpful and makes myself realize I am not alone."
Freshman,4,I like how small the college is and everything is at a walking distance. The faculty to student ratio is one of the reasons why I came.
Junior,4,"My experience at Midwestern State University so far has been great. The facilities are in good shape, the professors are easy to work with and communicate their expectations well, and the campus as a whole is easy to navigate and well kept. The counselors/advisors are also very helpful and help you to understand what path you're on and what you need to do to continue to follow it. I also like that the class sizes are typically smaller for a better student to professor ratio. 
My only wish I have for the experience so far is that more students would attend the activities held. I have attended a few and there were just not as many students as I thought there would be."
Sophomore,4,"I am a student athlete at Midwestern State University. The school spirit is awesome there. I have a wide variety of professors so far, some better than others... Overall I enjoy the school, and I'm looking forward to future years there."
Freshman,4,"Midwestern State University is one of the most academic schools' I have been so far. It has a great variety of things to join and explore around. Though I will say the city Wichita falls have a few things to come by but people make the best out of it . The overall location the university is located at , it peaceful and a block away there is a big lake that everyone in the community share. The university's events are amazing, they are very helpful and can keep you on track. The programs they share with the students are helpful. I myself go to a program that  helped with keeping up your grades and ' do's and don'ts ' to guide you to success."
Freshman,4,"The campus is very modern and up to date. It is a bit small but that means it is convenient for those on foot. The dorms are absolutely gorgeous and practically brand new. The city is a bit on the small side but the DFW area is 1.5 hours away. I do like the small college atmosphere where you are not overwhelmed by other students and massive classes. Overall, while the school is somewhat pricey to be a smaller liberal arts college, I believe the value for the money is evident in the projects around campus and the investment the school is pouring into the university. I would like to see more ""area"" around campus for walking and/or recreation but I understand space is at a premium. One annoying thing, is just how tightly nestled this university is to the surrounding neighborhoods. You are practically feet away from neighborhoods on the edge of the school limits."
Sophomore,4,"I like MSU Texas because it isn't a large school, but it isn't a small school either. It has a great music program with great professors.  My classmates are mostly nice people, and I've made some great friends."
Sophomore,4,Midwestern State University has its pros and cons just like any other school. They have great programs depending on your major but if you’re a city person being in wichita falls can get kind of boring !
Sophomore,4,"This campus has such a homie feel to it. It is a small campus, but it feels familiar and warm. It is not overwhelming, because the professors are willing to work with you and they want you to excel. Everyone is very friendly, but getting involved in clubs is key. Even though it's a small campus, you can get very lonely."
Freshman,4,The university has many opportunities and programs to help with grades and academics. It would be nice to see more outreach for social events or things
Sophomore,4,"It's a beautiful friendly campus, has plenty of activities to do daily and food options.  The dorms are great and a fantastic way to meet new people  and begin new bonds throughout school and maybe even life."
Niche User,4,"As I am intending on applying for the Spring 2020 semester, I have yet to truly become a member of the college, but from the tour and my experience on campus, I was say my overall experience was very good."
Junior,4,"MSU is a great place to go to school, it's a big school in a small, military town so everyone is constantly rotating through. The professors are amazing, some more stringent than others. The student life in the town and on campus is great, there's always little events being put on by the town, MSU, and even different organizations. There is also plenty of apartments close to campus so you don't have to live on campus, plus there's a bus that goes to most complexes, some stores, and campus throughout the day so it's not an issue if you don't have a car."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful. The class rooms are great size with, the most kids in one class about 70 students. There's always something for going on. Very welcoming and nice."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed going here starting my college career! The campus is easy to navigate around since a smaller campus, the teachers are very good and can help one on one, and we’re the    one of the best D2 schools in  Texas at athletics !👌🏼 I recommend it"
Sophomore,4,"good community great classes, good opportunities to make friends and explore. Campus life is friendly and welcoming."
Freshman,4,It is a great school to go to and i would definitely recommend to anyone. The campus is a beautiful place and the food there is great. The professors are friendly the people are kind and everything about it makes me not able to wait to live there
Sophomore,4,Midwestern State University is a liberal arts school that is very diverse and welcoming when it comes to the campus. It's a place where friends become family and where a school turns into a home. It's not the biggest but overall academically and athletically its a great school where you get to get connected with many people on a personal level due to the brother and sisterhood of the campus. I love it and would recommend this University to other home-like people as well.
Junior,4,"My time at Midwestern state university definitely has been an exciting one to say the least. I have met a lot of interesting individuals, as well as intelligent professors. Next semester I will be starting a new chapter in my MSU career as I was assigned a leadership position. I am anxious as to what this journey awaits, however I am certain that whatever it brings it will be something to remember."
Sophomore,4,The campus is very homey. The atmosphere is also very welcoming and comforting. I enjoy how small the school is and how inviting it feels. My favorite thing to do is walk around campus and enjoy everyone's company.
Sophomore,4,MSU is a good school. Not great. There usually isn't a lot of on-campus activities that go on. Wichita Falls is a safe community
Junior,4,I really like the class size ratio. This university is a great source of education and is continuing to grow more and more popular each year. The campus is smaller than most big universities but the campus is gaining a ton of potential with brand new dorms and brand new buildings. The potential of this university is expanding and I love being apart of the friendly atmosphere here on campus.
Niche User,4,"When I went to tour Midwestern, I felt like I was at home. The tour was very interesting, and the people there are very welcoming!"
Freshman,4,"My experience at MSU is amazing.  The people, Staff, etc, is amazing. What i love about this school i show so much  diversity."
Freshman,4,They are super nice and accommodating. They are really good at responding to emails and voicemail. I will say I wish that their website was easier to use. I also wish they  had more opportunities to use technology instead of paper (like changing majors for example.)
Junior,4,"The professors and instructors are very professional, are willing to go above and beyond by helping students in their studies, and are understanding and willing to work with students."
Freshman,4,I am a in coming freshman and when you visit the campus everyone from the staff to the students are so friendly
Sophomore,4,I have grown up in this area my whole life so I know my way around. It feels good to get a great education while staying close to home and not the cost of the big name universities.
Freshman,4,"The MSU Campus is extremely welcoming , and filled with learning opportunities and fun . I can't wait to peruse my degree here at MSU ."
Sophomore,4,I'm only a sophomore but so far my college experience has just been okay I want to strive to make this upcoming semester better in all aspects.
Senior,4,I enjoy MSU. I love the small close community where we are all close and look out for one another. I like the environment and the people i have meet and become good friends. The classes are great and so far all the professors i have experience have taught me alot. I do wish MSU was more prideful and have spirit with school games and activities.
Junior,4,"Midwestern State is a fantastic school to go to. I have had a great experience with all of my instructors so far. The school has a big University feel while having small classes, making it easier to learn."
Freshman,4,Midwestern is a great school you have great support by staff and by other students. When your in class you have students helpers to come and help you at any time.People are willing to help you and make sure your successful.
Freshman,4,"I love the new dorm (legacy)! The teachers here really care about the students and give individual care to them. The food has gotten better overtime, but could still use some improvement."
Sophomore,4,"Midwestern State university is a small school in Wichita Falls, Texas. I like it here because unlike in big schools where you can't really communicate with your professor  and ask questions here you can do that since the classes are smaller. There's always something to do in campus shows, sport activities, fun events and so on. The community is always supporting the school teams and helping around the school at events."
Senior,4,"I believe the time invested at Midwestern State University helped me build long lasting relationships with my professors and classmates. My experience at Midwestern State University was unforgettable and I am so glad I attended. The one thing I wish I could change was the spirit at our athletic events. We have great teams, but the didn't get the full support the deserved."
Senior,4,"MSU was a great place for me to go because of how small it is. I loved not feeling overwhelmed by big classes and that I would see the same people everyday so it seemed even smaller and very homie. Like any place that you are at for a long period of time, it can get annoying, but it's been a great fit for me. It feels like home."
Freshman,4,"I like the comfortably fit buildings for my classes. Being so close together make it very easy to switch from class to class. 
I would like to change the school spirit here . More activities , getting more kids involved . Would better the rep on this school ."
Junior,4,"Attending Midwestern State University has been great so far, while I have not completely started classes on campus the professors have made the work online really easy and understandable. I hear nothing but good things about Midwestern State daily."
Niche User,4,"Midwestern college was very helpful. There were many professors ready to help students go the extra mile. I loved it there! The classes were a nice size, and I had no problem focusing during class. Be prepared to be challenged, when applying for this college. Not the bad kind of challenge, but the kind that you will love and be thankful for in the end."
College Senior,4,There is not very much crime that happens around campus. I have personally never had any problems with safety and have never taken extreme security measures. The police is always around campus and they are actual police. I feel really safe on campus.
College Senior,4,"I cannot speak for the rest of the colleges on the campus, but the math and science department are top notch. They go above and beyond and are seeking to prepare you to continue on in to the real world. Midwestern State University is unique because it is small and the professors have time to sit with you in their office to help you if needed. The social life can get a bit boring being that you see the same people every day/week, but it is still fun and easy to fit in. If i could chose this school all over again I would because I feel like this school has made me grow as a student more than i ever thought possible."
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had all of my classes yet, but so far my professors have been very helpful in my transition to MSU."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel that a degree from MSU is valued highly. It is the only public liberal arts college in Texas and it excels in many different areas. Their nursing program is great, and I can't wait to be a part of it."
College Sophomore,4,This school is amazing and very supportive and welcoming of its students
College Sophomore,2,"if you are not in greek life, then plan on having nothing to do"
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much to do here in town, there is like one club but its dirty."
College Sophomore,2,"They waste so much on bar bells, kettle bells and the latest fads but science lab supplies are old. The amount they spend on advertising is where I think half of my tuition went!"
College Sophomore,2,"Public transportation is spotty, time consuming, and unreliable. You MUST have a car here and bicycling is foolish. One person was already killed and most cyclists won't bother to wear a helmet and they ignore laws of the road. Housing in a roach infested old apartment is $600/month at least and utilities are high due to drought. A/C units break and the land lords will argue about repair costs.Make sure you take photographs and document everything! Break-ins and theft are very common since most thieves know which properties are rented out. The cops don't care and no matter where you live expect to be victimized by fraud, vandalism, car damage, assault, or discrimination. I was floored by how narrow minded people are here."
College Sophomore,2,Food is hyped. Vegan bar is really just a salad bar. The fees here are outrageous and just pay for Jesse Rogers' salary. Who is Jesse Rogers? The President you'll never see or get to meet.
College Freshman,2,I like the 100 extra dollars a semester to be able to spend at the coffee place and food places. The food they serve in the dinning hall is terrible though. i also like that they have to to go option. that is convenient. They also charge around 9 dollars a meal for terrible food. Its not worth it.
College Sophomore,2,"Besides McDonalds, and Taco Bell being open late your best bet is to go to Walmart."
College Sophomore,2,Its like eating microwavable meals everyday
College Freshman,2,We don't have that many places to go.
College Freshman,2,theres nothing to do here but downtown we do have the worlds smallest skyscraper
College Freshman,2,i dont have a major yet
College Freshman,2,not much to choose from especially after 9pm
College Junior,2,"The WiFi on campus is horrible! You have to have a password and sign in every time you reach campus! It would not be so bad if it was a normal one, but you have to fill out 4 or 5 questions every time!"
College Student,2,The weather constantly changes in Texas and it is often extreme and the wind?  It's always blowing pretty hard.
College Student,2,"I don't hear of any parties on campus. There are bar/club in town but most are a few miles away, and if you live on campus then you might not have a car."
College Student,2,Winters are cold... Summers are HOT.
College Junior,2,"Parking is an absolute pain! Just be ready to walk! And if you're running late, you are literally running because parking will be a mile away."
College Junior,2,Not sure about drugs but there is a lot of drinking that occurs. Dont leave your room on thursdays if you dont want to see someone whos drunk or drinking.
College Junior,2,Just dont. If you can avoid it do.
College Senior,2,Not enough for students. Too much for teachers and staff.
College Student,2,The quality of the food is very poor
College Student,2,Our wifi stinks at our campus.
College Student,2,The Financial Aid office at my school is very unorganized. My father passed away and i did not receive any financial aid. i make old grades and have never failed a class.
College Freshman,2,There is not a lot to do in regards to nightlife.
College Sophomore,2,dining is convenient because its a buffet but the food quality is terrible
College Sophomore,2,parking is absolutely annoying on campus because you can never truly find a good parking spot. but its good that campus is small so walking is convenient anyways
College Sophomore,2,it is very easy to sneak into the local bars in the town even if you are underage. 
College Sophomore,2,i wish there were more scholarships offered from the school
College Sophomore,2,"I received some financial aid for my upcoming semester but it is only from the pell grant I have tried to be in contact with the office but I can never get anyone to return my calls. working full time does not give me the luxury to be free to be available to speak with one at the drop of the hat, could use some improvement"
College Senior,2,"Greek life is present, but not a dominating factor. It's not a big deal weather or not you are in a sorority or fraternity."
College Freshman,2,the weather sucks! one day its 89 the next day its 43! you van never take your winter clothes home because you won't know when you will need it.
College Sophomore,2,They are alright. I wish they are more Asian students in our school.
College Freshman,2,"Texas is what we like to call the bipolar state. It can be sunny and nice outside and then rainy and freezing out of nowhere all in one hour. Usually it doesn't get that extreme, but don't expect to rely on the weatherman here."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is an issue at Midwestern that hopefully will be resolved soon.
College Freshman,2,Wichita Falls is a great city to visit but there is not many things to do if you live here
College Freshman,2,Im not sure if we have  transportation because i haven't seen any here because when i need a ride ill ask one of my friends that has a car
College Sophomore,2,The shopping is okay it's not amazing. They have plenty of restaurants but they do not have Panda Express.
College Freshman,2,"I have lived in Wichita Falls my whole life, we do have a variety of different bars/club to go to. But the majority of them are country bars. Fun for me, but not for everyone. I live off campus so I don't know too much about what goes on at night, but I hear if you are into frats and sororities they throw good parties."
College Junior,2,"No Warning – First time offenders are not given warning, but ticketed."
College Freshman,2,"Expensive, Expensive.............Ahhh – It is very hard to find apartments that is withing the college budget and even with a job it is hard. if you want cheap go far away from the school. some housing are accessed through programs and they are reasonable."
Freshman,1,"Personally, online was not good at all for me. My professors were fair but my work schedule and school schedule constantly conflicted. I also feel as though I’m not actually learning anything online. Just took quizzes that I could take until I made full credits. That’s it. Other people, I’m sure, did online school with no problem but it really conflicted with my learning style."
Senior,1,"If you are thinking about attending the Radiology program, don't. The clinical coordinator will literally keep making you take pointless test to the point where it becomes burden rather than a learning experience.  She makes her students feel like she has pleasure in making them fail. She doesn't believe in technology and won't let anyone type assignments. Save your money and choose another school for Radiology."
Freshman,1,"Midwestern State University is an amazing place to be. Everyone welcomes you with open arms and the most kindest attitudes. The staff make you feel right at home. There's always something to do so you really don't have to worry about ever feeling bored, alone, or scared. There's always people to talk to. No one is ever to busy to talk at MWSU. The most exciting parts are the events. The events makes one never want to leave. The energy that they being is amazing. So I love my MWSU experience. So should you!!"
College Junior,1,I really don't care for the Greek life because unless you fit a certain criteria/personality type nobody's going to want you.
College Freshman,1,"I don't party, but I hear that parties are mediocre."
College Sophomore,1,"This place is Anti-Diversity period. You must be white, or from another country (also white), conservative to where you can quote a religious text like a parrot. For a place that claims to be progressive this is not the truth."
College Sophomore,1,What Academics? Sports and gossip chatty Kathys are nothing to be proud of.
College Sophomore,1,"I'm transferring. There is no point in working towards an A only to find out that a professor will never award someone an A no matter how hard they work! Fixing points, playing with grading curves is not professional. The students who get A's are the ones who earned them, not some stupid football player who won't do his homework."
College Sophomore,1,It's all about the sports and not about the jobs or careers that will shape the future of this country.
College Sophomore,1,If you want to live in a boring place with no real job opportunities then enjoy. Anyone who is serious about having a real career or running their own company won't waste time with a first look let alone a second look at this town.
College Sophomore,1,"The immaturity of other students is unbelievable. They don't seem to realize or care about what taking out a loan even means and just skipping class is what the cool kids do. If they are actually graded and failed (not like in the local high schools), they'll throw a hissy fit."
College Sophomore,1,"A student I had two classed with was raped and she was treated like she deserved it. I'm leaving because of this and believe that if parents love their daughters they will keep them out of the religious, backwards, anti-woman SOUTH! The campus police don't care and the administrators just want to cover anything up that is remotely negative. Victims are blamed all the time and they'll lie claiming that students are safe. It's all talk and most of that talk is just flat out lying. They don't want people to realize what is going on. It's just a money making machine."
College Sophomore,1,"It's all about marketing, not about reality. Students are being robbed and the community takes advantage of them."
College Sophomore,1,"They'll pressure you to not work and rely soley on student loans. They think nothing of telling a student that a 15% interest rate on a student loan is a ""great deal"". Do NOT believe them! Most racist scholarships don't offer much and grants are only for poor minorities. You'll have to do all the work yourself since you will deal with unprofessional counselors who don't want to do their job."
College Sophomore,1,"Not worth the hassle. They're run by snobby cliquey locals whose parents live through them. Just do you work, go to class and transfer to a much better college."
College Sophomore,1,"Disgusting unhealthy fast food. ""Salads"" are a joke and have wilted lettuce drowned in dressing. If you like health food just be aware they don't clean the yogurt dispensers and turnover is high at any place you go for food. Getting sick when eating out or dealing with credit card fraud is common."
College Sophomore,1,"Drugs are present in class. Students goof off then take Adderall and Ritalin to study. This is what poor time management looks like and it's very common. Students go out and party, don't come in or are still drunk. The campus police do nothing even if there is evidence and they refuse to press charges or arrest people who commit crimes on campus. I will transfer and not waste more time on this lost cause of a university."
College Sophomore,1,They flat out lie about what they offer and then react like spoiled children when you call them out on it and complain. The community is complicit and just wants the money and cheap labor the students bring to the dying county. Their tax base is eroding and they now want to build a vocational building after they slashed more than two thirds of the programs in the past. They are doing things so backward and anyone with suggestions is attacked in public. These people are backwards and the university is not progressive at all.
College Sophomore,1,"There are no local internships. Internships have been advised against at the other two colleges I toured because it drives down wages. There have been lawsuits due to internship problems in professional industries where interns did work at the level of an expert but were not paid for it. Considering how many skills must be mastered before even graduating high school it's absurd to think that anyone here could ""intern"" (just work for free) at a restaurant or retail store. Those aren't even majors and no one wants to stay."
College Sophomore,1,Majors aren't evenly represented at all. This school advertises a progressive and expanding curriculum that creates well balanced young adults when they leave some areas to languish and push athletics.
College Sophomore,1,"Being different or labelled as such is a death sentence. Students and faculty will be cruel and if you are a dumb kid who just goes with the flow of crazy on campus you're better off than a person who can think for themselves. My car was vandalized TWICE and police did NOTHING. Why? It was retaliation for stating the erosion of our founding father/s beliefs. The separation of church and state, while factual is actually hated here. Faculty tells students they had better ""pray"" they pass a test instead of study. It's unprofessional and creepy. You are supposed to learn, work outside of your comfort zone and explore different views while working with students from other areas. Most students are white or foreign. It's absurd since so many locals won't go here anymore. Most are extremely conservative and when they attack people in debate the faculty does nothing. Threatening to harm another student is not a problem here because they are all for the ""religious right to oppress others"".  You will be harmed so keep you mouth shut. Other students have been beaten."
College Sophomore,1,"I thought they had what they advertised which was an outright lie. Some educational institutions actually stand behind their students and know that the only way they look good is because they are there for them. Job placement, starting pay, and how far graduates have to travel for work are very telling. The fact that few people stay here is concerning but not surprising since the jobs and the community is terrible. It's just a money machine and I'm going to apply to transfer to two other universities, both of which are out of state. Texas is all hat and no cattle."
College Sophomore,1,"They put far too much in MARKETING and don't deliver on the education end, which is far more relevant. They have Friday Night Lights Syndrome here and dumb athletes have their work done for them or they're just passed. Who cares about football? What about claiming that there are great STEM programs? That was a huge lie! The class size may be smaller but that's not for the basic classes at 150 students or more but instead just for specialty classes. This is false advertising. The only other school is Vernon College which can't seem to keep everything on schedule or keep instructors on. The companies here don't really hire from the university and I found a few other places just an hour or two away that are cheaper and have much higher rankings for ROI, starting salary, city stats, and community support."
College Sophomore,1,If you don't put out then you won't get asked out. The boys like slutty girls period. Girls are lazy and aren't serious. The LGBT community is nonexistent because Christian bigots whine about not being able to practice the religious freedom of oppressing others with their narrow world view due to inexperience. You will be harassed every day about going to this church or that church. You will be treated poorly for having to work on weekends and on holidays. Women are judged for not having kids or for having kids and not being married or married to a different boy than the father. The religious aspect is never mentioned but some professors fail students for not going to - and DONATING money to their church. Hint: It's the most obscene church in town.
College Sophomore,1,"Students joke about sexual assault and harass the victims. The young woman I had two classes with left out of fear for her safety and the campus police are a joke. They harass students working late even though you have to have a key card and codes for access, but call them to escort you and they gripe because you won't vote to carry a gun on campus or say you just need a flash light. Judges here do NOTHING and the paper only prints lies. Students have had cars broken into, vandalism is an issue, students are frequent victims of crime form locals, the local police/sheriff's department will not respond to complaints and say it ""is the university's problem to deal with"", meaning they don't want the high crime rate to be accurately reflected in stats."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't waste your time thinking about going here. It's a mess and no one seems to know what their job is and they're annoyed when you expect them to do their job. You are a counselor so counsel students. The administrators act as though you don't matter even though YOU pay their inflated salaries. You will not get what you are being robbed for. Just leave Wichita Falls and don't come back. My parents will not let my brother go here and I'm going to fight to get my money back. Call them on their con and they are horrific in behavior and infantile in their responses. No email response, won't answer the phone, refuse to address serious problems with sexism, religious bigots on campus harassing students, and more. Save yourself a lot of time, headache, money, and stress. Better yet just don't come to Texas if you can help it."
College Sophomore,1,"For what you get after paying tuition and frivolous fees you should expect and GET a lot more. TA's and professors aren't around. Professors will fail students they don't like no matter what. Appealing a grade even after a teacher calls you a ""terrorist"" will not work. Why? You can't talk to the people who are supposed to make sure racism and discrimination doesn't happen. What you pay goes toward pointless sports and promoting a university that consistently fails to deliver. They want to expand and build more to keep up with other colleges and universities that promise a lot but don't deliver. The ROI rank on this university is a joke and if you ask around other students aren't looking to graduate - they just want to transfer. However there are cheaper alternatives which is why I've dropped out and am looking to get my tuition back. This is theft of opportunity. Don't tell me you have the best and then hire thieves and a racist black preacher!"
College Sophomore,1,"These are local snobby kids you couldn't stand in high school running Greek Fraternities and Sororities. They're rude to anyone from out of town and think that acting like a high school brat is still acceptable. One frat had to have their house closed down not just because they trashed it, but because there were so many complaints from the neighbors. These students are here to party, not to work or do anything meaningful for the community."
College Sophomore,1,They closed down and filled in their first indoor pool and halved the size of their first gym. Tuition doubled then they had to waste money on a new multi million dollar facility at the student's expense. They housed the Dallas Cowboys camp and their fans took all the parking and completely trashed the area. They only care about sports and their sad excuse for STEM programs is evidence of this. Good luck finding jobs that pay more than minimum wage here. There are NO internships but people do expect you to work for free as soon as they find out you are a student.
College Sophomore,1,"No discounts, unhealthy mexican food or fast food. If you have to work at a restaurant don't expect a tip no matter how good you are. Students avoid these slave wage jobs like the plague. If you go out to eat they close a place down for every one they open. The food quality is inconsistent and most places are advertising for employees due to very high turnover."
College Sophomore,1,"There are bars and churches in Wichita Falls. People get stabbed and shot at the bars and you deal with nuts

in the churches. They're really rude if you don't go to church or have to work on Sunday. Very unsupportive community because they want you to work for free or dirt cheap.Employers here are Christian bigots who pay minimum wage no matter what your experience is. Don't party - just work your butt off and transfer. There's a lot of illegal drugs here."
College Sophomore,1,"They'll claim there are a lot of ways to get ""aid"". First you have to be a minority but you can't be poor. If you can't be full time or you have to work as a poor student they basically ignore you outright. The Bursar's office only cares about you paying your tuition and fees.The paperwork is redundant and the tuition is just overpriced."
College Sophomore,1,No parking but they keep expanding. Most dorms are at the opposite end of the campus where your classes are. Your rent would be cheaper but not by much in overpriced Wichita Falls.
College Sophomore,1,It's boring! You listen to the same crap over and over again.. People here are not open to new dogs or dances
College Freshman,1,no one parties here unless you know the right people
College Junior,1,It is so dry! There is no water so we constantly have to handle that.
College Freshman,1,"There is a big need for transportation on campus. Wichita Falls is a little town and i wouldn't consider it a college town. So if you want to go anywhere you WILL need a car, barely anything is in walking distance."
College Sophomore,1,Very sketchy places to live . There is no good housing it is a constant topic of conversation. We wish we had a great place to live. Do NOT live at The Grove.
College Sophomore,1,The town is really only the school. Wichita Falls is a very boring place . Luckily it's close to the DFW area.
College Sophomore,1,T he policy school is pretty week for me. I think that there is not enough strictness because most faculty or staff do not care about the students.

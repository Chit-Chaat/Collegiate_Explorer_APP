Freshman,5,"Purdue University is such an amazing school. The school is ranked #53 in the state. On campus you see a variety of people as you would expect in a diverse school. At Purdue you have many opportunities such as study abroad programs,  co-op programs and many more. Purdue is one of the best schools to be prepared for handling COVID situations on campus and how to prevent them."
Freshman,5,All of my classes were in person except Biology. I am more of in person leaner than online but thanks to the professor I was able to succeed in the class. As he would post every lesson and give us extra sources for help. He would also hold office hours where we can go and ask questions and for assistance.

Sophomore,5,"The professors respond very fast to all emails, and do their best to make things simple for us. It is easy to navigate Brightspace."
Sophomore,5,"I currently attend Purdue University which I love the campus, the courses, the professors, and the resources."
Sophomore,5,"Purdue is a very state of the art campus!  It is a great, safe atmosphere and there is not much I would improve.  I really could benefit from more scholarship money for out of state students.  My parents support me going to Purdue because it is such a great school but I wish the cost was a bit less."
Sophomore,5,I started online during Covid and did well because my professors were all very thorough.  I took an online Spanish course over the summer during a time when I contracted Covid.  Luckily I was able to keep up on my coursework.  Fall classes have begun and I have some online and some in person.  I am learing to be resilient and manuver this unique pandemic year.  Purdue has shown resilience in manuvering this situation as well!
Junior,5,Everyone is so helpful. The learning experience is great! The campus is buzzing with activities all the time.
Junior,5,It was super! Professors made it very smooth. They used blackboard learning and it was very helpful.
Junior,5,Purdue did a good job transitioning to online schooling in the spring. I personally do not prefer online classes but I did appreciate how much the professors tried to ease the transition.
Junior,5,"I really enjoy my time at Purdue. The people here are very friendly for the most part. The basketball team is always really fun to watch, and there is always other things to do. I am so happy to be back on campus, feels like I am back where I belong."
Niche User,5,"Purdue University is an overall great university. One of the best parts of Purdue I have experienced is the amount of diversity. Although Purdue is a school known for its great engineering program, I have met plenty of students within medical, business, agricultural, etc."
Freshman,5,"I have not been to classes at Purdue yet, because this is my first year. All of my visits and what I have heard from others is excellent."
Junior,5,"Purdue University is an elite school with kids from diverse cultures.  Each kid brings their own opinions and skills with them. I enjoy how the Staff always makes you feel like we as students matter. They listen to our ideas, our opinions, and our issues. They prepare us to go into the world and be world-class leaders. The Staff is an inspiration to me.  If I had to change something it would probably be to have our Academic Advisors be well versed in the area in which they are advising. Sometimes they don't seem to understand the language or issue at hand because they are not familiar with the program they are advising."
Junior,5,"I have taken numerous classes online with Purdue.  Not only during COVID but also in the summers.  The classes are well-organized online and the Professors are extremely helpful. They adapt to the online learning and try make it easy for the students to understand.  The content in the classes is the same, very hard, but at least we don't need to spend a lot of time figuring out how to do things online and we can focus on the learning. I have adapted well to the online learning as I am an out-of-state student."
Sophomore,5,My professors were awesome with the change to online learning. They all took their time to become acquainted with our changes and worked hard to make sure all of their students were working to their full potential.
Sophomore,5,"I love how open I can be about my identity as a gay transgender man here! I would say that we don't have the best ice removal, though. As I've slipped quite a few times on some polished ice."
Sophomore,5,"Being at Purdue University was an amazing experience for my first year. The professors were very understanding, approachable, and kind when it came to helping out with schoolwork and projects. The environment itself was comfortable and overall energetic with all of the various people you'd meet on a day-to-day basis. I  loved being there and cannot wait to go back for another year."
Junior,5,Purdue University is a great institution that challenges students to think critically and become well-rounded individuals.
Junior,5,Purdue University is a great institution that challenges students to think critically and become well-rounded individuals.
Sophomore,5,I like Purdue so far. there are a lot of opportunities you could get like a career fair and internship as long as you try to be involved in it. Faculties and students are friendly and helpful for academic achievement.
Sophomore,5,it was very well-organized and easy to follow. I am planning to take online classes next fall again and expecting it to be very engaging.
Sophomore,5,The students and staff are all very kind and welcoming. It's easy to see that everyone cares about each other on campus.
Junior,5,"Purdue is an amazing school filled with diversity. Their academics are taught at a level that prepares you for success. Purdue offers many services to also prepare students for their future as well as guiding then choose the right path. The atmosphere at Purdue is lively and you are always surrounded by hardworking students. While academics are a main focus of all those who attend Purdue, there are also an abundance of things to do for fun, all the from bars to an endless list of school clubs and organizations. Purdue is one of the absolute best Universities you can attend and you will never want to graduate."
Junior,5,"While going and unexpected pandemic, Purdue provided students with the utmost academic online materials as possible. Professors were available through email and zoom meeting calls. I never went with a question being unanswered. While preparing for tests were a little more difficult due to missing out on crucial face-to-face instruction, the professors did an amazing job at pointing out crucial information and topics. I felt successful in what I had learned after the semester had ended, and I received wonderful grades which ultimately boosted my GPA."
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience with Purdue has been surprisingly good. I was expecting a train wreck considering the abrupt need for the transition but I was pleasantly surprised. Of course classes were still difficult and maybe a little bit more so considering everything was open book, but I was able to get almost all A's this semester causing my GPA to skyrocket. Professors and TA's were always there to help in any way that they could."
Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed being apart of the Boilermaker family at Purdue. It has been the best decision I've ever made to attend this outstanding university. They have provided me with resources to get connected with companies that I could gain employment and internship opportunities from.  I have joined many clubs and organizations on campus that have allowed me to stay connected to the campus and make lifelong friendships and connections. It truly is an amazing school with a lot to offer. The school spirit here is above anything I have ever seen. If anyone is thinking about coming to Purdue, take the leap of faith and do it. It is an amazing school with amazing faculty that really take the time to get to know their student. Being apart of the boilermaker family has been a dream. Boiler up! Hammer down!"
Niche User,5,"I love the engineering academic program available, as well as the diverse set of majors and minors the college offers."
Sophomore,5,"Going in I didn’t know what my experience was going to be but now that I’m a sophomore I seriously love Purdue. Classes can be super tough depending on your major but if you know how to manage your time you should be fine. You’re bound to find a group of people for you wether it’s though Greek life, clubs, or just randomly meeting people. Not to mention Purdue is a big name where ever you go, anywhere I go and I tell someone I go to Purdue they’re always impressed wether it’s in Florida or overseas. We also have THE BEST UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT EVER!!!!!"
Junior,5,"Purdue University has everything I needed in a school where I am going to get my degree. From the academic resources to the athletic events, Purdue truly does have it all. To be more specific, I really enjoy taking advantage of the resources at the Wilmeth Active Learning Center (WALC). WALC opened in 2017 so it is basically a brand new building. I am able to go there to study in the Mullins reading room on the second floor, which is reserved for students who wish to study in a completely quiet environment. I also go there to study in group settings as well, as there are study rooms available to reserve at no charge on the third floor.

Purdue's athletic events are second to none. You can tailgate with your family and friends for a football game on a brisk fall Saturday afternoon or you can pull an all nighter camp-out for a big basketball game the next day.

Areas where Purdue could improve would be updating some of the older residence halls."
Freshman,5,"A great institution with excellent faculty and programs. There is no shortage of wonderful, dedicated people at this institution."
Freshman,5,"A large institution with excellent programs and faculty. An alumnus is Neil Armstrong, a personal hero of mine."
Freshman,5,"Purdue University is a great environment for learning, finding opportunities, meeting new people, and experiencing new things."
Sophomore,5,Purdue offers many resources academically which helps my grade tremendously. The atmosphere is one of the reasons I picked Purdue.
Sophomore,5,"At Purdue University, students getting their degree is the main goal by all professors, advisors, and education staff. In the classes, I’ve never learned more than I have on this campus. It is top tier education, and the experience and relationships built with other students from all over the world is incredible."
Sophomore,5,"When classes were moved online, teachers were super interactive, and always there to help. The teaching improved if anything and it was a breeze to convert to online."
Freshman,5,Prudue is a great great school the they always was nice and professional.  Helped as much as they could.  The professor are all helper. The thing i would change is the time with the seminar its to late.
Freshman,5,yes I did online.  The professor gave lots of information on the subject.  They care about your grades and help as much as they can. The online program is is to use.
Freshman,5,"Like everyone, we were forced to complete the semester online due to Covid-19. The abrupt ending of freshman year and the uncertainty of the future made it an unusually frightening prospect. But, as in every other aspect, the Purdue faculty and staff were prepared, supportive, and accommodating  without sacrificing a quality learning experience. Our president is an out front guy who communicates openly with us and everyone at Purdue followed his lead and adopted his vision. He knew we could all do this together, and do it well.
 Sadly, a professor teaching one of my classes passed away during the online learning and Purdue handled this situation respectfully and with dignity, while still maintaining the same level of teaching/learning for those of us in the class.
While nothing takes the place of face to face learning in classrooms, the personal relationships with professors and classmates, and the overall college experience, Purdue made online learning the best it could possibly be."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience has been a positive one since my first campus visit.
 I knew Purdue was for me almost immediately. They made it personal and relevant right away. I knew that it was a top choice of schools for engineering, however, additional things enhanced my freshman experience. For instance, my student organization (Purdue Varsity Glee Club) reached out/recruited me based on my high school resume. Through them, I found new friends, a sense of belonging, and developed strong sense of pride in Purdue. This brought a home-like feel to an otherwise large campus. 
My days have been filled with unique class experiences, rock climbing or swimming in the awesome student facilities, traveling/performing with Purdue Varsity Glee Club, and simply being with friends.
Purdue is a school of innovators that is nestled in a quaint Midwest town and that town embraces its students. I an an out of state student who feels at home and cannot imagine studying anywhere else. I am a Boilermaker."
Junior,5,All of my classes are online right from the comfort of my bed (sometimes). This was a great opportunity for me to continue my education and still take care of my family. The professors are very understanding that life happens and the students are amazing.
Junior,5,Great experience overall. All the instructors have been amazing and have been an inspiration. Working with the other students really helps to better understand the material. Very helpful advisors and there is a lot they have to offer.
Freshman,5,"All of my professors did a great job going remote. I never experienced any situations that could not be solved. Also, all my professors made sure to make the class very organized with new syllabuses and schedules. I was never in the dark on what needed to be done. In my chemistry course, my professors made sure to have virtual office hours and even remade the final structure to make sure it was still fair. I really appreciate how the transition went and how smooth it was."
Freshman,5,I love the big campus with the school spirit. It is so cool to see so many people go and support the sports. I also love the rigorous academics Purdue has to offer. I feel challenged all the time and like I am getting a great education. Purdue is a very STEM based campus which I like because I know that Purdue will be on the forefront of research. I did not find anything I did not enjoy. Purdue is always trying to change and better itself as an institution.
Junior,5,"Purdue is perfect for me. It’s a great size,
all the teachers really care even thought the classes are pretty big, and lots of things to do."
Sophomore,5,I take a lot of pride in being a boilermaker. There’s a culture at Purdue that just can’t be replaced.
Sophomore,5,Amazing campus with lots of opportunities. Don’t miss athletic events or other major events! Walking between classes to and from dorms might vary stress-wise depending where you’re at but generally not a problem for the general Purdue student.
Sophomore,5,"As I approached my freshman year, I did not know what to expect. With the providing of the Boiler Gold Rush program, Purdue University prepared me for life on this beautiful campus. I was able to form friendships that will continue long past our time at this university. Almost every professor is the best that I could have imagined. Although not everything I accomplished my first year was easy, it was a beneficial challenge in my development."
Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed getting to meet and work with many interesting people. The resources available to students are excellent.
Junior,5,"Purdue is a great school. Classes can definitely be challenging, but TAs and professors are usually willing to work with you. The best part about Purdue is sold out basketball games in Mackey Arena."
Sophomore,5,"The quality of education for the affordable price is something you can't get anywhere else. With a large campus, there's a variety of organizations to become involved with."
Freshman,5,"Purdue University has an amazing campus and I think that overall the professors are great. In my experience, the science department is amazing and I think that they manage to teach very well given that the class sizes are usually very large,"
Niche User,5,"I am an international student, and I will be attending Purdue University this fall. As an international student, I am still not familiar with the US college system, so I often have questions regarding the possible scholarships, logging in to my school account, signing housing contract, etc. Whenever I contacted the responsible department, I was soon answered with a helpful answer. I feel that academic advisors, as well as people working at Purdue University, care for their students and are always willing to provide help."
Niche User,5,"The whole environment is very good, the combination of so many people from across the globe is an experience I wouldn't go back and change."
Freshman,5,Purdue is a very good school and is well known everywhere I go. The staff is very nice and the campus is beautiful. The staff and teachers are undurstanding and dedicated to help students learn.
Freshman,5,"Purdue has been such a great school for me. Being involved in athletics has brought me a family on top of a team. Going to the athletic events is so much fun and one of the highlights of Purdue. The atmosphere is great and makes me feel at home. I feel so safe walking around campus and it is so peaceful and beautiful. I suggest getting involved in events to make new friends. Making friends was so great because now I have people that will be with me for the rest of my life. These people are in some of my classes and make going to class even better. The academics here at Purdue are really good, I have enjoyed almost all of my classes and professors."
Alum,5,Purdue was an amazing university to attend during undergraduate studies. The very intelligent and friendly staff at Purdue University made obtaining my degree fun and enjoyable. The campus is beautiful and offers many activities and clubs for all different areas of interest. There is truly something for everyone at this school. That is the reason why I decided to return for my Graduate studies at Purdue.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, I have loved my first year of college. Yes, it has been extremely challenging, but not to the point where I am completely struggling. Purdue is full of amazing people and opportunities!"
Senior,5,"I enjoyed attending Purdue a ton! I got to meet a lot of intelligent people and interact with very knowledgeable professors. The academic rigor of Purdue I was told about was true, but it is a very rewarding process. There is an emphasis on getting your work done but to also enjoy attending college. The balance of school and personal life is well done and overall I love going to Purdue!"
Junior,4,I enjoy how involved everybody is on campus and I also enjoy the activities that Purdue provides. The overall class experience is enjoyable and I feel like the professors try to teach to their best abilities.
Freshman,4,"You get a very reputable education here, and the campus is beautiful. Many dorms are located centrally to buildings where classes are held, so nothing is typically too far of a walk away; however, you will do a lot of walking. There are electric scooters you can rent in order to help you get around. Purdue has its own police and fire department, illuminated emergency call boxes about every 100 feet or so, and a ""safe walk"" number you can dial if you want an officer to walk you somewhere if you don't feel safe going alone. There's a tradition of throwing unlocked bikes into trees that has somehow extended to both breaking the bikes and throwing other things, like scooters, into trees. That's one thing I would change about Purdue if I could, along with not having a bigoted president representing the university."
Junior,4,"Purdue is a very rigorous school with challenging classes and professors. The degree itself looks amazing and will likely get you a good job. They have really built the campus up too. However, don't expect the most crazy and fun social party scene."
Alum,4,"Online classes have likely changed a great deal since I took them over 5 years ago. I will say that while they felt dry, and presentation heavy, I could always reach out to my instructor and get a quick response. I did take a class with Purdue Global and found them to be much more interactive with students and professor in a online classroom setting."
Alum,4,"Attending Purdue helped shaped who I am. I dealt with up's and down's there while trying to determine who I was and what career I wanted for myself, and there I felt like I could naturally try my hand at anything and to find out for myself. On such a large campus, I genuinely enjoyed the many different people I could meet, and see what different life paths everyone took. My brother and I have a great appreciation for the school."
Junior,4,"The University is a great place to be, especially from a simple academic standpoint. There are a multitude of research opportunities, extracurricular activities, and academic help services available for students. However, I cannot say just how good campus life is, because I do not live on campus. From my experiences being on campus outside of classes, there are a number of great restaurants, activities, and shopping centers available, and they are extremely easy to get to because of the number of busses driving through campus on a daily basis. Overall, this is a great University to attend for undergraduate students, but graduate students may wish to attend a university with more opportunities for them."
Junior,4,"The professors of this university and the administration were completely prepared for the transition to online learning. There were no problems from a technological standpoint, and even classes such as band and orchestra were ready for the transition with a unique experience. However, I think that with online learning should come a small amount of leniency, because online learning is simply not as good as in-person learning. The grading scale was not necessarily adjusted, and students were not given the leniency that they should have been given in this new process."
Junior,4,"I only had to do this because of the corona pandemic and  it was strange, some professors are  unreasonable and strict but in general most are accommodating and understanding."
Junior,4,Huge campus! They are many opportunities for all majors  and advisors willing to help you on your career path
Sophomore,4,"After our classes moved to online courses for the remainder of the semester, it was very unusual and kind of confusing. Not only were the professors at a bit of a loss, but so were the students; however, we were able to overcome those issues in a team effort so that we could get back to a form of ""normalcy."" Over time it become easier to get to classes and do projects with fellow students in an online manner."
Sophomore,4,"I started there my freshman year, and I am currently a sophomore at Purdue. I am rooming in Owen. Firstly, Owen is very affordable and the staff and people at Owen were very friendly. Secondly, around campus is very beautiful in the fall. To start off my freshman year I did the Boiler Gold Rush and my group leader was excellent. The Boiler Gold Rush experience was overall great. I met new people and the people in our group got to experience going around campus and getting shown things from a Junior."
Sophomore,4,I didn't initial sign up for online classes but due to COVID-19 all classes were switched over. All the professors were very understanding and the switch over made it as easy as it could be to take the online classes.
Sophomore,4,"I was forced to take some online classes at the end pf the 2020 spring semester due to covid, and a lot of teachers and classes were forced to adapt to the restrictions, and I think they did pretty good considering how crazy everything was, but I would rather have in person classes if able to do so."
Sophomore,4,"Purdue is a very large and diverse school that can offer something for everyone. The amount of degree pathways and different studies available to students is fantastic, and the variety of clubs and extracurriculars ensures that there is a club for just about everyone."
Senior,4,It went ok except some technological difficulty and some of the professors not being able to teach the way they would have liked too including no lab work
Senior,4,I love Purdue's atmosphere and all the classes are taught by experienced professors. What could improve are the living conditions. For example the dinning courts are far from academic side of campus and they are too small to fit the amount of students that relay on them. Along with that parking is bad because there are not enough spaces to fit the students who own a parking pass.
Sophomore,4,Most professors were able to adjust well to the circumstances of the 2020 spring semester and were able to deliver and teach the required material.
Sophomore,4,I took a few classes online. The online delivery didn't impeded my learning. The professors knew what they were doing and utilized the online platforms well.
Sophomore,4,"Purdue has a great balance of social and academic life- most people here party on the weekends but still study on weeknights. The academics here are top-notch, which is obvious even in the classroom. The course progressions make logical sense and the information taught is directly applicable to the working world. The campus is relatively compact, but most people live off campus."
Junior,4,"My online learning experience with Purdue was actually great. I wasn't expecting it to be amazing because teachers were put on such a short clock with Covid and were expected to make a quick turnaround, and they made that turnaround with exceptional resiliency. I felt like I was able to ask questions and get answers back in a quick and easy fashion. The teachers provided very clear instructions on assignments, projects, and exams. Online learning through Purdue was very successful."
Sophomore,4,"As I look back on my freshman year that had just passed, I can say that I am proud I chose Purdue University. The campus is the perfect size, the food is pretty good, and there is a diverse group of people that I had the chance to meet through my classes. Classes were tough and some gen-ed classes had overly difficult exams. If I had to change one thing, it would be for some courses to change the difficulty of the exams and make it more fair for the students."
Freshman,4,"My online courses at Purdue were different in nature than the on campus courses obviously, but they were still high quality courses. Only a portion of the semester was cutoff from COVID-19, so these courses were picked up where we left off with the same professors, classmates, and groupmates."
Sophomore,4,Most of my professors adjusted the course to accommodate for online learning and if it won't for their understanding I would be in a worse off position academically. No run-ins with uploading powerpoints and you did not have to attend class at a specified time on a Zoom or WebEx call.
Sophomore,4,Though I have only gotten to spend approximately 7 months on campus it was a good few months well spent. I have only had one bad experience with a professor's course layout so far and I hope it is not repeated in my remaining years at Purdue. Nice campus and but not so much to do around the area.
Junior,4,I took online classes at Purdue due the pandemic. Professors replied emails promptly and the transition to online classes was smooth.
Junior,4,"Purdue has a good reputation on academics, and professors are willing to help students succeed in school."
Junior,4,Some professors did better at communicating the changes that would be made with the switch to online than others.
Sophomore,4,Most of my professors were very helpful throughout this whole process. I felt like they really wanted us to succeed.
Sophomore,4,Lectures from previous years were provided and professors responded quickly to questions. Science based classes did not provide the wholistic experience however because of missing out on labs.
Graduate Student,4,Purdue can be a bit of a grindstone school. You're kept very busy but you do learn a lot while you're here. There is also plenty of resources if you need help and plenty of ways to reach out if you just want to have fun!
Sophomore,4,It is a academically rigorous school that pushes student to excel. It can be stressful sometime but it is rewarding after all. Purdue has nice campus with lots of study area and play area.
Freshman,4,"Purdue is a great choice for a school. Not only are they well credited, they offer plenty of programs and activities for their students to take part in. Specifically for in-state students, their prices are very fair. If you are determined to get the college experience you desire, you have a good chance at that- they can provide almost anything to their students. The professors are well-rounded, and interested in you, which is something that will really improve your college experience. However, it is a large school. While that can provide fun opportunities to try new things and make new friends, it can also be overwhelming. Before choosing any school, it is good to evaluate yourself, and the situations in which you interact best."
Freshman,4,"Purdue is an overall great school for driven students in STEM and other majors, the opportunities to conduct research, work as an intern or full time employee are endless. Purdue is also an school with interesting and challenging courses that allow students to learn in-depth about the major they are looking to pursue and the opportunities available to them later down the line."
Sophomore,4,"The engineering program is super well rounded with SO many resources. Being a Purdue engineer means that you get to be one of the most focused-on majors on campus while getting a full college experience. I think Purdue is a great school. There are a lot of opportunities that you are afforded here that you may not be exposed to elsewhere. You are also able to connect with an amazing pool of alumni that are always available to give you advice, or even connect you with others to help advance you and your career.The social environment is very adaptable. There are very studious peers (honors program) who push me to excel. However, there are also fun, laid-back peers that I can just have a good time with.I loved how Purdue has such a big campus with big classes and a wide variety of activities and academics to choose from. The professor in general are all so friendly and I feel at home every time I go back. There is quite a lot of construction going on at the moment, hopefully its done soon"
Freshman,4,It is a school that definitely aims to challenge and develop its students into experts in their fields. There are hundreds of organizations on campus that allow you to explore who you are and how you fit into the university culture. I love attending Purdue. Boiler Up!
Freshman,4,"Although I am just finishing my first year, all my professors were understanding and definitely wanted us to succeed. You can tell that the staff here are proud of its students and it feels good to be a part of such a committed and proud community. Boiler up!"
Niche User,4,A top notch research university. Well known globally. Reasonable price considering other public university's tuition.
Alum,4,Purdue was a very challenging school and it prepared me very well for life after college with the rigorous coursework. It's also a very big school with many opportunities for different majors and career options.
Freshman,4,"Purdue is a college for people to have the experience they want. I'm in the honors college, so a lot of my time is spent studying and doing work, but that doesn't mean there are not opportunities to go out and have fun. The campus is beautiful and safe, and I never have to worry about theft or violence. The college town is wonderful and creates a great atmosphere. For those without a car, there isn't much to do on or within walking distance from campus, but otherwise I love it."
Niche User,4,"Overall my experience here was very nice, full of energy and life. Nothing bad to say, just that this university is truly a lovely place either being of campus and visiting and possibly attending as a student."
Freshman,4,"I think Purdue is a great school but unlike what this report claims, Purdue is not very diverse at all. Also the local area around Purdue is very below average at best. There is not a ton to do off campus. The food from the dining courts are not very good in my opinion. Academically the school is great if not amazing, however."
Sophomore,4,"The organizations here are very well put together. Most of them, being student-led, have many devoted members that come together to put on fantastic events. 
The dorm life is good. You are easily able to talk to neighbors and make new friends.
The costs for living here and having a meal-plan are very considerate when compared to other schools.
Students immediately gain strong pride for Purdue. This is seen at sports events where students want the best for their school."
Sophomore,4,"Purdue University offers something for each and every student. As cliche as that sounds, this university has more than 1000 clubs that students can become involved in. I firmly believe each student can find their place at this campus. Even though my freshman year living arrangements were actually horrible, I am now living in a sorority house, which is definitely a step up. I would recommend that Purdue update their campus residential halls for starters. This would have made my freshman year experience that much better."
Freshman,4,The campus was beautiful and inviting. The people and staff ensured I felt welcomed and answered all my questions.
Sophomore,4,Purdue is known for its diversity. What I didn't know before coming here was how encouraging and helpful the faculty and staff are. Their goal truly is to help you succeed.
Freshman,4,"My only complaint is that most of my classes were taught by TA's (teaching assistants) and we never were instructed or talked to our actual professor. I'm paying so much in tuition I would like to be taught by the ones that have degrees to teach me. Other than that, it's great. When I am in a lecture with a professor they do an outstanding job."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is gorgeous and very scenic, the school spirit here is very big and connects the student body with one another. The campus is very safe, and the food here is amazing! The selection of food is very diverse, and you can always find something you like to eat out of our many dining courts."
Freshman,4,"Purdue is an amazing university! Great atmosphere, top-ranked professors, and just about every club or class you could think of. The only problem is that most of the administrative faculty and staff seem to care more about money and school reputation than the students. I have meet wonder people here.  Purdue is the best university to attend to."
Junior,4,"Purdue is an amazing university! Great atmosphere, top-ranked professors, and just about every club or class you could think of. The only problem is that most of the administrative faculty and staff seem to care more about money and school reputation than the students."
Freshman,4,"I really like Purdue, but I find that I strive in a large campus setting. If you are afraid you may get homesick often, or you just do better in more intimate settings, Purdue might not be the place for you."
Freshman,4,I am an incoming freshman. I love the campus and instructors that I have met. Financial aid department has been very helpful.
Freshman,4,I love it here! School is Hard and winter is rough but the building and professors are so nice!! Even though it can be really cold during the winters there is a bus system that is free to students that is very helpful. For freshman starting college there is a week long program called BGR (boiler gold rush) that is all about older students helping under peers all about campus and what life is like on camps. I love this school and I would definitely choose to come back if I had to choose again!
Niche User,4,Beautiful campus with lots of activities. The bowling alley is one of the many fun activities to do on campus. The Purdue Jazz Band is very insparational with different styles of music. The most memorable part of Purdue is the underground food court. You see business like buildings until you visit this food marked underground that also helps getting class to class on time.
Freshman,4,This campus is y home away from home! Everything here is wonderful and there is a great balance between academics and fun!
Sophomore,4,"Amazing professors, great campus, beautiful libraries and academic buildings; Purdue has everything a university can afford a student to be successful. There are so many clubs and student communities everyone can participate in (if they wanted to), it's almost impossible for one to not find a place where they belong! One downside to the Purdue Main Campus is probably that it's in the middle of scenic nowhere, meaning a car will be quite necessary if you wanted to go out into the cities once in a while. Without a car, it's slightly difficult to get anywhere, even with buses. Also, our winters are unbearably cold sometimes, but they will come and go to our ease."
Senior,4,"Purdue is a strong university in an okay town. Classes and materials are solid, though professors are hit-or-miss, though the hits are great and the misses are just okay, but not bad. West Lafayette and Lafayette are fairly dull towns, with most of the entertainment being on campus itself or just a little outside. Personally not a party-goer so I don't have anything to say on that."
Freshman,4,"Not a terrible time, but it can be overwhelming if you're use to small town vibes. As an ag student I can says that all the professors who I have meet in the department are super nice and knowledgable."
Sophomore,4,"there's a lot of opportunities here and something to fit everyone's interests. It is a big STEM school. Engineering does get a lot of spotlight. But other areas of study are great too like health/human sciences and education and nursing. Generally, the staff and faculty are nice people. You'll come to find a few professors that are really great and support you in your endeavors. 
The campus is fairly safe and housing is pretty good. Some dorms are older and have no A/C still, but livable. The weather is unpredictable, but a nice coat and rainboots are great to have."
Sophomore,4,I like Purdue's campus layout and the wide accessibility of academic support systems and career opportunities.  There is a strong sense of both diversity and community among students from across the world and of different backgrounds.  One thing that could be improved upon is the amount of construction going on on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I really love the campus at Purdue, it's beautiful all year and nearly everything you need is within walking distance. It also feels super safe; I've walked between the libraries and my dorm in the middle of the night and felt very safe. You will usually see people walking around campus at all times of the day and night, but there's very few disturbances, and not much of a party scene except on some weekends. Everyone is very academically focused, and the vibe on campus is usually pretty serious, especially during finals week. The sports are great, basketball/football are really big but volleyball and soccer are also fun and really cheap to watch. Purdue also brings great speakers and concerts to school, so there's a few big events each semester. There's plenty of great places to eat and stuff to do if you have time between studying!"
Sophomore,2,Taking online classes was very difficult. Due dates were not always made very clear. It was hard to keep myself accountable for watching lectures because we were not required to watch as if we were in a zoom meeting.
Alum,2,"Purdue University is known as a great Engineering school which is what I went there for. Unfortunately, many of the classes are designed to be difficult and in my opinion, not conductive to learning. I felt as if classes were more for a challenge of taking a test and performing than actually learning and applying subject matter to engineering situations."
College Sophomore,2,"You are required to pay so much money to live in such old and dirty buildings. The freshmen dorm buildings are small, gross, and expensive. They are community bath with small rooms and many people are thrown into triples. I hate the housing at the University and they refused to allow me to live off campus."
College Sophomore,2,It's way too expensive for the crappy living quarters. The dorms are very small and very few are available that have bathrooms.
College Junior,2,You only like Greek life if you're Greek. It's a very aristocratic system.
College Junior,2,People don't come to Purdue for our sports teams
College Freshman,2,They are trashy and rude. Except for 2 sororities GPB & AGD
College Freshman,2,You would have to pay me to live in dorms again. And I wouldn't be an RA
College Freshman,2,I live on Meredith and I think this dorm is horrible. The quiet hours aunt enforced and the people in my hall are extremely rude and inconsiderate. The building is old and there is no air conditioning. The bathrooms are gross and needed to be upgraded. The building is just too old and gross.
College Freshman,2,"Most students have to take a math course in any major and most of the Purdue math department just wants to see students struggle, with 12 question multiple choice tests, if you get 2-3 wrong you're already out of the B range."
College Freshman,2,"Our football is horrible, but basketball's interesting"
College Junior,2,"I'm a non-Greek, but a lot of Greeks here can be either nice or rude. Your choice."
College Freshman,2,very hard to get aid and be awarded scholarships
College Freshman,2,"Purdue is competitive and sets up its financial aid accordingly. They act as though they do not care if you attend or not, even if you are a strong student. Unlike smaller, private universities, Purdue offers very little financial aid to middle class students that consists of mostly loans they must repay. It has a great program for low-income students, but it is unfair. 21st Century Scholars get absolutely FREE tuition and housing with the Purdue Promise. However, middle class students have a very difficult time even landing a small academic scholarship. They do not factor in or care if their parents are not helping pay for tuition, have more important things to pay for, or work very hard for their money. It is not fair that some students get free tuition because the school determines they are unable to pay, even though they likely are just irresponsible with money or lazy. Students whose parents do not help them deserve the same financial aid!"
College Freshman,2,"The meal plan overall is an awful value. Each meal costs around $11, even on-the-go meals, which you could buy at the store for $1! I never eat $11 worth of food, and I make myself sick every time I eat just by thinking about all of my wasted money. Sometimes, dining courts have poor choices. The menus are often random and do not go together, such as only offering various types of sea food, sometimes. The worst part is that all dining courts are buffet style or on-the-go. They should be arranged so that each meal swipe is worth around $10, and items in the dining courts are individually priced. You should be able to purchase items that add up to $10, use a swipe to pay for it, then either eat it there or take it back to your room. Ball State's dining court system is a great example of what Purdue should have."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you're in a top tier fraternity, forget partying."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Since Purdue is not a party school, we will have parties but no too crazy about it."
Recent Alumnus,2,It is a safe and friendly community. but lack of museums and attractions are a down part.
College Freshman,2,"For me, being instate has not really helped me with many scholarship opportunities. I was even the top 5% of my class and applied early, but I still received no scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,If you don't have a car you cannot really get off campus
College Freshman,2,"The ""College town"" is tiny with not very many things to do except eat. There are very few bars and the town is pretty dead"
College Freshman,2,"We lose in pretty much everything all the time, so people don't really go to the games. But the tailgates are always extremely fun and people still take advantage of game day. Intramurals are hard to be part of unless you are in a Greek house."
Recent Alumnus,2,"They revamped the scholarship format.  It's great now, but it screwed some of us over."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Women's sports are fantastic, as are some of the more minor sports, like swimming and diving or golf.  However we lack the powerhouse mens basketball and football programs that would drive a stronger sports atmosphere."
College Sophomore,2,Its a small college town where there isnt much to do on the weekends and its easy to get bored.
College Senior,2,"I am frustrated that I did not get any academic based scholarships or grants from Purdue. My parents are in good financial standing, so I was unable to get any money through need based scholarships or grants even though I pay for the majority of school expenses. I worked hard in high school and if I were to attend Purdue one year prior I would have been awarded an automatic academic based grant, but they removed those and I think that was a poor decision."
College Junior,2,"There aren't a lot of good options to choose from, in terms of off campus restaurants. There are a lot of chain restaurants and fast food."
College Senior,2,Lots of bad reviews and stories about off-house
College Sophomore,2,Depending on the dorm your in it can vary from ok to very bad. Stay away from Cary South.
College Sophomore,2,West lafayette is a pretty small place and there really isn't all that much to do there.
College Senior,2,There are only dining places on one side of campus
College Sophomore,2,Very expensive for what you get. I would rather live in the dorms.
College Sophomore,2,I did not apply and get any financial aid.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't park on campus. Cary parking is terrible because there are tow warnings like every two days because of its proximity to Ross Ade and Mackey. BTFU
College Student,2,"The winters are absolutely brutal, make sure you dress properly.  Indiana's bipolar as well."
College Freshman,2,Free parking fills up fast and parking permits are costly.
College Sophomore,2,Getting around campus is easy but getting across the river isnt unless you have a car.
College Sophomore,2,I am a non-Greek and get looked down upon by Greek students continually.
College Freshman,2,It snows in April and it is insanely hot in the August - September months. Some dorms don't have air conditioning.
College Sophomore,2,"Coming from a country filled with endless variety of food, I definitely suffer from the lack of variety."
College Sophomore,2,NOt much goes on here
College Junior,2,"For a school that prides itself on its Stem majors, resources for teachers are woefully lacking."
College Freshman,2,"Living in Indiana pretty much sucks. Depending on the year, it could be a nice, quick winter with little snow such as the past couple years, or it could be a horrible, long winter that seems to never end such as this year. I am ridiculously sick of snow and below freezing temperatures."
College Junior,2,"The local weather in West Lafayette is just as weird as possible, I can't stand it but I have to"
College Junior,2,i'm still struggling on searching for funding to deal with my tuition and living expense
College Junior,2,"The apartments are fine, but they are very expensive and hard to get in to because they fill up so fast."
Recent Alumnus,2,Indiana Weather sucks. Unpredictable and annoying weather especially during the spring semester.
College Freshman,2,I would have rather gotten a single or lived in First Street Towers or Windsor.
College Freshman,2,"There is practically no diversity. Most people are white and from small towns in Indiana, but you will find many international students."
College Freshman,2,"Be careful before committing here, keep in mind it is in the middle of nowhere in Indiana. Nearest shopping mall is in Indianapolis which is over an hour away and there is not much to do off campus."
College Freshman,2,The busses get overpacked when it's cold outside; the sidewalks are sometimes icy and very dangerous to walk in.
College Sophomore,2,I've heard it is not the best
College Junior,2,"The winter is awful, summer, spring, and fall are great!"
College Freshman,2,Right now I hate it since it has been such a long winter. In the spring and summer it is great though.
College Freshman,2,Purdue is the only thing keeping West Lafayette and Lafayette alive.
College Freshman,2,I have no idea when it comes to parties.
College Freshman,2,The cold and the packed down ice can keep me from getting to class some days. The campus maintainence is not the best
College Sophomore,2,I have received no financial aid after application
College Freshman,2,This has been the worst winter ever.
College Junior,2,The local atmosphere get tiring after a couple of years
Sophomore,1,not exactly sure where all these stellar reviews are coming from. do NOT make the mistake of coming here. everyone i knew here was SEVERELY depressed whether or not they already were coming into college. this place literally sucks the soul out of everyone here. the counseling service (CAPS) is a complete joke and this is common knowledge on campus. Purdue does not give a damn about you or your well being. they only added 6 more counselors because in recent years they have been flooded with more and more student desperate for their services. their counselors are booked months in advance. they have to turn students away at some point. it’s awful. do not take this lightly as your mental health can very negatively impact your academics and there are plenty of other cheaper options in better places that don’t make you want to kill yourself. i wasted thousands and thousands of dollars and 2 years of my life at this place before i finally transferred. best decision i ever made.
College Freshman,1,Owen is a dump. I would never recommend it to a friend or enemy.
College Freshman,1,"Personally, being out in the middle of nowhere is the worst thing a student can submit themselves too. With no way to remove yourself from being a student you're stuck in a zone of stress. The school is seriously geared toward the science/technology side and doesn't really allow room for exploration at all; you don't come to this school without knowing what you want to do."
College Sophomore,1,"They rarely give out aid + scholarships in a great amount, and now that my parents aren't paying for part of my tuition anymore, I don't think I can go back."
College Junior,1,"The parking at process at Purdue is the absolute worst. The only reason you should not want to come to Purdue is because of parking. You can't park for more than 2 hours in one spot any time between 7am and 5pm. It's miserable to walk to class when it's cold, but parking is even more miserable. Just walk to class. You most likely won't find a close spot."
College Freshman,1,"Weather is horrible, considering I'm used to the Texas heat."
College Sophomore,1,The winters are horrible I grew up in Indiana wether and I still hate it. The side walks cannot unfreeze because it is often to cold for the salt to work. Some times the off campus side walks are better than on campus just because they are used less. Other times while walking into campus students have to walk on the roads.
College Sophomore,1,The avaliable parking garages are not open to general public exept for M-F 5-7 and weekends the fact that you have to pay so much for a pass that would let you park in them the other times is crazy! Parking off campus is not very bad exept for some places only have 2 hour parking exept for M-F 7-7 and weekends
College Freshman,1,"The most of the students that go to Purdue are narrow minded, but that is what you get when you go to school in Indiana. It is a place that is very judgmental and very segregated."
College Sophomore,1,"So expensive, a terrible experience"
College Freshman,1,Is Indiana so the weather is always changing.
College Freshman,1,Beyond hot in the fall and many dorms have no A/C. This winter was the coldest and snowiest in decades. The walkways turn to ice with so many feet pressing the remnants of plowed snow down. This makes getting around very difficult. It's often just easier to walk thru the snow. Then there's the wind. The weather is NOT the reason anyone goes to Purdue.
College Junior,1,My school does not have very many options for scholarship. Most of my financial aid can be attributed to loans.
College Junior,1,Getting into my program was terrible. There was much competition and backstabbing involved in getting into the program.
College Junior,1,I am very unmotivated to walk 20 minutes to class when the weather is terrible. So I basically do not leave my room when the weather is terrible.
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely nothing to do outside of the school
College Freshman,1,"personally, i applied for financial aid and all i was offered was something with a lower interest rate....and we did not take it. i can only hope we will be able to pay for me to stay here all four years. based on my grades and home situation i found this ridiculous. especially going to such a big school that is so expensive. it is clear that they have money for tons of other, not always necessary things so i don't see why absolutely no reasonable help could be faced my way."
College Freshman,1,Most of them are not high quality and expensive.
College Sophomore,1,"Off campus housing can be a hassle. Leasing starts very early and by the time you are ready to find an apartment or any other form of off-campus housing, they are all usually full. Not to mention that some of the places near campus are very expensive."
College Junior,1,"It is really hard to find spots normally. Especially if you do not get a parking permit. However, even if you get a permit, there is still a lot of competition for parking spots and the lots aren't even close to the academic buildings."
College Junior,1,"I would rate Purdue's parking as a D. I believe that they could offer a lot more free parking for people who do not live on campus, and for those who do but do not have set parking spots. It is extremely annoying to run to the doctor and come back to no open spots. I also think that the cops are ticket hungry when it comes to parking tickets. They will find a way to ticket every car on the road if possible."
College Sophomore,1,"There are definitely not enough general parking spots-- they are all consistently taken up by the ""A"" and ""B"" parking passes. On top of that-- the spots aren't very well marked, so getting parking tickets is incredibly common. Last year they changed the status of the lot next to my dorm but didn't tell anyone in the dorm to move their cars-- most people had two or three tickets on their cars because the university AND the police department didn't see fit to let anyone know this was going on. Receiving ridiculous parking tickets are very common here."
College Sophomore,1,Purdue University contains many people of different ethnic background. Some backgrounds are very slim in amount though.
College Freshman,1,I missed scholarship application by a week and they didn't meet my financial aid nor give me any scholarships despite my much higher scores and qualifications that many other students.
College Freshman,1,It's freezing here. Winter weather lasts from October to March with a lot of heavy snow and ice.
College Junior,1,"I do plan on having an internship because it's a requirement.  I do have many concerns about finding one because they are very competitive and you have to be matched with one in order to get one.  People don't always get one on the the first and second try, so it can be difficult."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is a nightmare for most students. Parking spaces are very limited and fill up quickly. The more available parking spaces are much further away and can pose a huge inconvenience. The parking patrol is extremely strict; if you're one minute late in getting your car out, they ticket you."
College Junior,1,"Purdue basically fails for on campus parking. There is no where to park on campus. You can essentially not drive a car to campus. there are two streets with free parking, but they are ALWAYS filled and aren't even that close to campus. There are a few parking garages but they are full 90% of the time. 
There is parking near the campus, but a 5 to 10 minute walk will be a result."
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is terrible.  Off campus students can either buy a very expensive parking pass for inconvenient parking lots or find 2 hour parking that it difficult to find.  Parking police will ticket cars immediately if rules are broken.
College Sophomore,1,"There is hardly any parking for non-faculty or non-staff on campus. If students live in a residence hall, they can buy residence hall parking permits, but these only allow parking on the west part of campus. Otherwise, students have only the option to buy C permits for the extreme north and south ends of campus. There are a few 2h parking spots near classes, yet don't expect them to be empty during the day. Visitors can park in the visitor parking garage on Northwestern Ave. Fortunately, parking at night improves when many of the A, B and C designations no longer apply."
College Freshman,1,"We have quite a bit of students with diverse backgrounds. We have a lot of whites, but Asians populate quite a bit of the campus. And that's what are campus is known about."
College Junior,1,"Lafayette is the most boring place alive in the middle of nowhere. This is absolutely no shopping, cultural events, or anything to do. There is no downtown area."
College Freshman,1,There is little to no creativity in this city. I sense very little culture and the only thing appealing is the shopping mall which is still about 20-30 minutes away.
College Freshman,1,"Purdue is located in the tiny town of West Lafayette. There are approximately 32,000 undergrads and the town/ city has a population of about 60,000 and that's including the students. There are things to do on campus but no really anything to do off campus, unless you want to some how find a way to get to Indianapolis. There also isn't much outdoors things to do, i.e, hiking, canoeing biking."
College Freshman,1,"The food on campus is pretty bland. Everything is either really salty or really sweet. Salt is like their only spice used... ever. Each of the dining halls has something that is unique, however it gets pretty old after awhile. The meals are also repeated frequently. Much of the food is processed and not good, there aren't really any fresh produce of any sort, and I'm pretty sure it's not free range chicken. However if I had to say the best place to eat I would say Hillenbrand, it is small and has different options than most of the other dining courts."
College Freshman,1,"If you are living in any of the residence halls you have about a 10 minute or greater walk to class. In the winter when it snows it's pretty cold and miserable. Also with ice walking can be a bit dangerous, especially if you're walking such a long distance"
College Junior,1,"Parking permits are very expensive here. They give out as many as people want, but that never garuntees that you will get a parking spot. All non-permit parking spots are for one or two hours, which causes a hassel for many students. On top of all these problems, they hand out hundreds of tickets each day, and they increased the fee on the ticket. Lastly, when basketball season starts, they tow parked cars with permits out of a parking lot they are alowed to use if it is not moved at a certain time before the game starts, which is unfair to the students who are in class and having a parking pass."
College Sophomore,1,The cost of a parking permit is $150 if you live on campus. If you live off campus you pay $100 but wherever you live has to be 1.5 miles away or further to even get a pass. There are never any spots close to where residence halls or classes are. On good days you might find a spot but the spots are so close together it takes too much time and effort to park. Visitor parking is scare and what visitor parking there is you have to pay for. Parking at Purdue is awful.
College Sophomore,1,"Could Have Offered More – I did not receive any scholarships or grants, it was all FASFA loans that Purdue had to offer.  Leaving it to me to take out student loans separately to pay for college which is a hassle."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is a pain. Good spots are open at certain times and miles away.
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus is awful. There is very little parking space for students and the spots are expensive. Don't drive in campus if you want to save money.
College Sophomore,1,"I like Purdue but I have to be real and say there is not that much diversity. Coming from Atlanta I am used to white, black, hispanic, asian everything. At Purdue though the majority is white and after that its like peanuts of blacks and hispanics. We do have the 2nd most international students in the country which is cool but besides that we got nothing next to diversity. This is one thing I would change about Purdue."
College Freshman,1,Don't Be Surprised – If you are planning on bringing your car to school there are a lot of things you need to know.  The permit costs too much and once you get a ticket you will wish that you got it because they ticket very regularly.  If you bring your car its only really useful for getting off campus and not walking through the rain
College Freshman,1,"Very Few Bars – There are very few bars or clubs. There is one club called ""MUSE"" at the downtown Lafayette and yet there are rarely any parties throughout the year. There are like 2 bars and 3 hookah lounges. Since there is rarely any bars, these places are always packed with people. However, despite the size of the bars and places to hang, people seem to enjoy them."
College Freshman,1,"You Think You Know Cold – It sucks. Thats the best way to describe it. It is completely random. May be cold one day, and warm and sunny the next. Never know when its going to rain/storm. Ofcourse tornadoes are a concern but not too often. Wind is the worst part. You can never escape it, ever. It varies between light wind and strong wind but seems to be strong wind more then it is light. Durring the very long cold seasons the wind is miserable. Bundle up so much that you are sweating before you leave because it will be COLD. As far as the warm weather goes it is very pleasant. Gets very hot but not too bad. Overall you never know what your gonna get with Indiana weather."
College Sophomore,1,Drug Screen – There is not a whole lot of drug and or alcohol education at Purdue.
College Freshman,1,A Lot of Drugs – my bud OD with marijuana and ecstasy and got caught and kicked out of school
College Sophomore,1,"Technology School Falling Behind – Be a university know for its technology school I expected Purdue to be more technologically advanced. It lacks sufficient wireless access, good printing services and there is a great need for more computer labs."
College Freshman,1,"ENGR 131 – If there's one thing that I hate about Purdue, it's definitely the ENGR 131 class. It is so annoying, it doesn't matter what you do in order to get an A, you'll never get it. Furthermore, The class makes no sense at all, and unfortunately it's not an elective, every engineer has got to take it. Believe me when I tell you that I've seen students quitting their engineering majors just because of this class. It has no order, the professors don't know what they're talking about, and I could easily describe that class in one word: DUMB!!"
College Sophomore,1,Some of the people are attractive however most are not.
College Sophomore,1,"If you are going to try and park on campus you must get a permit or get ready to get A LOT of tickets. The West Lafayette Police give parking tickets at 59 minutes if it's 1 hour parking. Also, if the Purdue Police give you a ticket it goes as a hold on your account and you cannot register for classes until it's paid. The longest parking you'll find during the day is 2 hour and it's on random neighborhood streets. Unless you work at Purdue or pay a ton of money to get a good parking pass you should probably just walk or ride the bus."
College Freshman,1,"bad parking,some slots are restricted to juniors or seniors. For a freshman, you have walk a long way to get your car."
College Junior,1,No Help at All – This university gives no help for international students at all. The internships offered are very few as well and they don't return the taxes either.
College Junior,1,"Most of the professor, if not all of them highly encourage students to not use someone else's work. The repercussions are very strong and can even lead to expulsion. They put a lot of pressure into quoting and acknowledging other people's work. If they say to work individually, you better not let anyone peek at your job."
College Junior,1,"Dull Atmosphere – I have to say that West Lafayette is one of the most unattractive places I've been. The infrastructure is all the same, the roads keep getting potholes, not a lot to do. There is a constant need from the university planner to always keep building new sites and creating new master plans. So there is always construction sites and they are an eyesore."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Very Strict – As far as rules go at Purdue, one would think they're made to be broken.  As far as drug and alcohol policy in the dorms, its very lax.  I've heard of many people that had drugs or alcohol in their possession and had to do little more than attend an alcohol awareness lecture if even that.  Partying occurs every night of the week for underaged students and very little seems to be done about it."
College Freshman,1,"Ethnic/Racial Backgrounds – I would say that on campus it is prodominately caucasian, and there are not too many other ethnic groups."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is absolutely terrible! You have to have an A pass to get close to anything on campus, and you can only obtain one of those by being an employee. B passes are really expensive, and so are C passes for as far away as they are. My advices, find an apartment with parking passes, or don't have a car."
College Freshman,1,"We only experience about two months of warm weather at Purdue: September, and May. In between it is either rainy, cold, snowing, or storming! It's always so cold and when it's cold all anyone wants to do is lay in bed and sleep. Sometimes the snow will be so bad in the winter that classes are cancelled and then the whole schedule for the class is thrown off. When it's cold and there's lots of snow out, I'd rather stay inside than go to class, and sometimes I do."
College Freshman,1,The Process Was False Hope – I received enough aid to stay off campus but if I had wanted to stay on campus I would have not been able to afford the payments. They told me that I would get more money then they gave me and it took almost a month for them to put the money in my account. They sent me many notices threatening me with me being dropped from my classes when they still hadn't processed my student aid.

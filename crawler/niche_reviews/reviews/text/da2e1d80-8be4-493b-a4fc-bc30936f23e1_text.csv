Junior,5,Yes my whole semester is online. All the turn around for the teachers responses are really within 24 hours. Its very well explained.
Sophomore,5,The online/HyFlex model of teaching here at Tarleton has been fantastic. Professors are adaptable to the changing environment and are open to learning new methods of teaching online.
Sophomore,5,This school has been amazing at adapting to the changes that had to occur due to the pandemic. We are able to still attend events safely whether it is through Zoom or socially distanced. I feel very lucky to attend this university.
Senior,5,"Tarleton State University, has been something greater than I could have ever expected. When I came here, I did not think I would enjoy it because it is in a small town which I am not used to. Once I got here I realized it was so much better than I thought it would be. I have met so many great friends, I have enjoyed the education professors I have had the last year, and the community as a whole is very welcoming."
Freshman,5,I have not yet been able to experience this but I have heard many people that are attending Tarleton say it was great! Not much to worry about here.
Senior,5,"Though I'm currently located at one of the smaller branches of the Tarleton campus, the professors I've had for each semester have made me feel like they're truly invested in my success. They've helped me develop a knowledge base for Psychology and have also helped me grow as a person. The fact that they treat the students not from a position of power but from a point of respect and regard for us has made this experience so enjoyable."
Freshman,5,I did not take any online classes. I am going to be a first year college student this coming fall. I will start Tarleton in August and plan to take all my classes face to face.

Alum,5,Tarleton State University is available to many campuses. The Waco campus has instructors that work with students to assist in guiding students without pressures to choose on their paths. The instructors develop teaching tools that are effective and challenging. They open their students up to research opportunities that are often taken by students from more prestigious schools.

The best thing about Tarleton is that it has great traditions for everyone to participate in. The work is challenging but the professors are truly here to push students to be better."
Sophomore,5,"Tarleton State has felt like home since my very first step on campus. Tarleton State has also brought me my very best friends; people I did not know I needed in my life but, now, I couldn't imagine my life without them. The university has also provided me with an ample amount of opportunities to enhance my learning.  They provide tutoring services, clinics and supplemental instruction for subjects and it is all included into your tuition, which has helped my grades for the better. Since freshman year, I have never second-guessed if Tarleton State University was my home away from home. It never fails to remind me that I belong here and that I am here for a reason, with a specific end goal."

Sophomore,5,I enjoy being a member of such a studious and hard working student body.  We take pride in our schoolwork as well as the various traditions and core values each student upholds on a daily basis both in the classroom and off-campus.  The atmosphere is positive and the teachers are student-focused because our education is the most important aspect of our college experience as a Tarleton Texan.

Junior,5,Am currently attending the Midlothian campus. The courses and professors are fantastic. And the advisor is very helpful.
Junior,5,Tarleton is very diverse and despite it being in a small town there is alot to offer. You meet people that maybe went to the same school as you and while you never talked to them before you end up doing so. I meet my best friend there who i never talked to before and they became my rock during college. It is a great school and i could not be happier with my choice.
Senior,5,Tarleton is a sacred university with endless opportunities. The professors go out of their way to get to know you. Tarleton professors want to see you succeed and it shows.
Sophomore,5,Tarleton State is a great University everyone is very connected with each other and it is a very organized school.
Sophomore,5,"Tarlton State is a school that really wants their student to succeed. They have free tutored in the library for all class, and a math clinic in the math building with tutors to help you with homework you may have due. Not to much through events to help students let loss when they need a break."
Sophomore,5,Tarleton has been a great experience. All staff is super friendly and always willing to help. Your professors care about you and are always willing to help or give you advice if you talk to them. The campus is so beautiful and is always so welcoming and actives are always present. I would highly recommend Tarleton to anyone that doesn't know where they want to go.
Freshman,5,"I love it here, The people you meant, your classes, the campus, it's all amazing and it grows on you if you dont like it at first, you will eventually. The staff here (not professors) are not the best, everything housing, academic, post office, they're greatly unorganized and makes you not want to deal with them ever again."
Freshman,5,"My mom is an Alumni there and I loved the over all feeling that the campus possesses. The campus made me feel at home. I like the way they are connected with the town of Stephenville,Tx and how they support each other."

Alum,5,"I originally decided to go to Tarleton on a volleyball scholarship. After playing for two seasons, I was forced to quit after back surgeries and contemplated transferring to a different school. When it came down to it, I couldn't leave the precious friendships I had made along the way. The school is small enough to have classes of good size, while it's still big enough to have the opportunity to always meet new people. The professors truly care for your well-being, which is something you won't find at many schools."
Niche User,5,The thing I loved the most about Tarleton is it is a very small hometown feel. the students and faculty member make everyone feel very welcome and they are very helpful with questions.
Niche User,5,I like the campus a lot.   It has a close-knit feel.  The campus is closely put together making it very easy to access building quickly.  There are a lot of things to do off campus as well.  I attended a leadership camp here and really enjoyed the experience.  The staff were very friendly and helpful as well.  I am looking into attending this university upon graduation.
Junior,5,"I am attending Tarleton State University  through the University Center at Mclennan Community College (MCC) in Waco, Texas.  I am able to stay at home and work in Waco, by attending Tarleton classes at the MCC campus and on the internet.  I have found this to be the most affordable method to get a quality 4 year degree in Business.  I have had excellent access to timely educational and career counseling.  My older sibling graduated Summa Cum Laude from Tarleton using this same college plan.   I recommend this college highly to any student in the Waco area.  Thank you for the chance to offer my comments."
Senior,5,I have been at Tarleton since 2017 and I love it. I will graduate with my Bachelors in Social Work in 2019. Class sizes are small and intimate and professors really try to work with you to make sure you succeed.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman here at Tarleton and just the short amount of time I have been here it has been the best time of my life! The school is so focused on their students, and the President is the coolest man you will meet! Momma T is just about famous, and if you haven't been to Tarleton's homecoming you are missing out on life. That is another thing about Tarleton is that this school is all about tradition. Yah, maybe the big school traditions are cool, but there is nothing like the purple poo, the beating the drum, snake dance, Purple Pancakes at midnight, and obviously the L.V. Risinger Bonfire!! If you choose this school you will never regret it! You will bleed purple till the day you die! Go Texans!"
Junior,5,"Overall, Tarleton provides a really high-quality education along with awesome student support and traditions! It's always easy to get into contact with someone and resolve issues quickly whether it be regarding tuition, or simply homework."
Junior,5,"The professors and staff act like they really care about the students, which really surprised me. They appear to interact well and develop relationships with the students. The staff are available for assistance, and if unable to  provide answers, they are quick to provide direction for the students. The instructor's are really good about reviewing for tests and quizes, thus promoting a good learning experience.  Tarleton appears to provide stable building blocks to build upon for a future promising career"
Freshman,5,Even as a freshman you have smaller classes than at LARGE universities. Also more personal approach to you as an individual instead of just being a number.
Junior,4,I love that Tarleton advisors are very open and willing to reach out and talk to you whenever you need assistance.
Sophomore,4,Most of my classes are online and the university has set up the programs very well for online learning in my opinion.
Sophomore,4,"Overall all of the staff and students I have dealt with have been very helpful and friendly, which was very important to me during my transfer process."
Senior,4,"I took online classes my first year at Tarleton, as well as the second half of last spring semester (2020) due to COVID19.  The first year was rough for me to adjust to the discipline and schedule of the online courses, but it was flexible enough to allow me to work full time around my classes which benefited me a lot."
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed my on-campus classes this past year at Tarleton.  My professors were knowledgeable and helpful with coursework, and I enjoyed the people I got to interact with in class.  Each class made me more excited about my major in management, and I look forward to graduating with my bachelors in the spring of 2022."
Junior,4,"Most of my classes so far have not been live.  However, it is very easy to get hold of your professors when you have a question about the material."
Junior,4,"They have a lot of online programs and the culture is decent.  Lots of church groups if you're into that, and there are some good groups on campus.  Most majors have a student organization attached.  The Rodeo team is fantastic!"
Freshman,4,I am currently in rolled and excepted to the University of Tarleton. I am an incoming freshman and so far my experience has been great.
Freshman,4,well experience it‚Äôs Tarleton state university was great the people there to greet you as if you belong.
Freshman,4,This will be my first year attending Tarleton. So far I love every bit of this school. My father attended many many years ago and he loved his experience there. Hoping the same goes for me also.
Senior,4,"The communication with the online professors was acceptable. Grading never took too long in these classes. Especially during the first wave of COVID cases, the online interface as well as communication with the faculty and professors made the transition slightly less difficult."
Freshman,4,The school is amazing and the professors are awesome! The students are helpful to one another and they are very welcoming.
Junior,4,"Although the professors I have had in online learning classes are not as forthcoming as my professors at the junior college level, they are still helpful.  I was successful in earning a ""B"" avg in my online classes.  I just wish they would be more helpful in posting the schedule of assignments and keeping it updated with changes regarding Covid-19."
Junior,4,"This a great institution! They offer classes on a variety of campuses in a variety of formats.  I have succeeded at both online and in person classes.  My only trouble is the cost.  Although, it is lower than a private university, it is still expensive and college should be free for all who wish to attend."
Niche User,4,"I would love to see more diversity. I love the atmosphere and love the traditons. I hope that being a part of this school will make me more social but overall seems like a good place to start off, especially if you have never been to a big school or are transferring from a smaller school this would be a good option."
Freshman,4,It is a very friendly and helpful campus! I have never had any major problems with anything and I‚Äôve loved all of my professors so far.
Freshman,4,Tarleton State University is a great school to consider if you are a person that does not like to have big classes and would like to get to know there professor is is a great choice for you
Alum,4,"I was able to complete my entire degree with Tarleton on the Waco campus. 
TSU helps students receive their degrees without going into debt. My instructors were all well informed and cared about my well being - I briefly faced homelessness, but my professors helped me receive independent student status so I could apply for financial aid without my parents' information and find a place to live. I didn't have to take out any loans and was able to graduate debt free and on time thanks to their help."
Freshman,4,"So far, being at Tarleton has been such a wonderful experience. I have made so many genuine friends along with supportive professors. The campus is so beautiful and clean, and the people make it feel like one big family. I can count on one hand how many times I Actually held the door for myself, everyone is so polite and generous. I would highly recommend Tarleton to every senior across the country, it would be your home away from home."
Niche User,4,Incoming Freshman.  Was impressed with Tarleton during visit.  Like the fact that there is 1 professor to every 19 students.
Freshman,4,"Tarleton State University is a small campus in which is nice because it easily enables to walk to and from class. Everyone on campus is relatively friendly and welcoming. Tradition is also very abrupt at this school which is nice, many other colleges don't have the involvement of the whole school like Tarleton does. The professors are all very friendly and helpful, if a student puts in the effort, so will the professor. Tarleton is also a very safe campus, there is constant service with police and on campus counseling."
Sophomore,4,"An amazing school with awesome traditions. Homecoming week is one of the most memorable thing you will ever be apart of. Most professors are extremely passionate about what they teach and are more than willing to help you. Unfortunately, this school can be very money-hungry, and that is why I will not be graduating from here."
Freshman,4,Tarleton State University is a great diverse University with great professors that are willing to go over and beyond if your showing effort as a student . This is a public University with a private University fell students are very helpful and kind. The campus is beautiful with limitless activities to indulge in and many clubs to join.
Freshman,4,"Tarleton is great at academics especially in the agricultural field, but the housing situation is not the best because of the maintenance department."
Sophomore,4,I love the small town feel of Tarleton! It's not too small and not too big. There are many resources available for students! I'm excited to keep pursuing a BSN from this university! Tarleton has great traditions and I'm happy to have joined the Texan family!
Niche User,4,"I attended a choir camp here during the summer of my freshman year of high school. from experience, the staff members I interacted with seemed very well put together and overall very friendly and personable."
Sophomore,4,"I like how small the campus is and how most of the people have school spirit. The things I would change is the diversity, we need more diversity in this community. The teachers and staff for every building does a very good job with everything they do."
Junior,4,"I am a student at Tarleton State University. I commute 30 minutes everyday and think its a great university. It is filled with one-on-one interaction, very big on student life and is a great place to get educated."
Junior,4,"I enjoyed my time at Tarleton State University because it has a very family friendly atmosphere. It is one of the safest campuses in Texas, and has wonderful traditions to keep the students involved in all of the activities since there is not a whole lot to do around the Stephenville area."
Senior,4,Tarleton State University is a relatively small liberal arts university.  I transferred in my Junior year as a chemistry major.  I enjoyed the small class size that my upper level chemistry courses offered.  It allowed me to build a good rapport with my professors.  It allows plenty of undergraduate research opportunities for chemistry majors.  The two larges things that require improvement are the parking and the system that tracks your degree progress.  There is simply not enough parking and the degree management system consistently has issues tracking transfer credits.  Overall Tarleton is a very affordable and quality university.
Sophomore,4,"What I most love about Tarleton is how i feel so at home with the people around me, and how encouraging the professors are to their students."
Freshman,4,Tarleton is a beautiful and organized campus. The school spirit is through the roof and people there are super nice. Anytime I need help or have questions there is always someone happy to help.
Junior,4,I love the small and family feeling that this uni has. So far my professors really care about my success. I am a nursing student! The only downside is that there is not great diversity on this campus. A very conservative school.
Freshman,4,I would like to see more improvement when it comes to housing and learning skills. It has been amazing be here but there is always room to grow!
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Tarleton State University has been good so far. Everyone here is so welcoming, and the campus is beautiful and kept up with daily. The traditions and the core values is one thing that makes Tarleton stand out from other Universities. The only downside that I would want to change it that Stephenville is a primarily small town so there aren't much job opportunities unless you decide to work on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I really like attending Tarleton, but lately some of my professors have been a bit difficult. My advice to students looking to come here is to try and talk to students that have been in their program for a while and see how the professors are after a few semesters."
Freshman,4,Tarleton has been very beneficial to reaching my career goals.  It is a great place to meet people from many different backgrounds.  They are very helpful and always try to fix problems immediately and are always interested in expanding the campus.
Junior,4,"More opportunities for extra curriculars
Extra tutoring opportunities 
Smaller class sizes 
Lab research opportunities 
More clubs"
Freshman,4,"Both the staff and students are all very kind in making sure that students have a great college experience and have all the resources they need to succeed. The location is a bit far from everything else thus making it a bit isolated, and the facilities may need a bit of renovation in some places, but it is overall a place that has everything needed within reach."
Freshman,4,Tarleton is an amazing university  with a smaller campus that makes it easy to navigate and the tuition price is like no other.
Niche User,4,"It's a great smaller size college out just west of Fort worth but east of Abilene. It has a great athletics program with some school records being broken recently. It also has a great campus life and has a great deal of school spirit. The food is one of the best things on campus. They have an all you can eat food court that you can eat at every meal. There is also a Chick-fil-a on campus too as well as some other restaurants with Mexican, Italian. There is also a thing called Texan Bucks that you get when you buy a meal plan that you can use at the campus book store, Chick-fil-a and other restaurants around campus as well as restaurants in the community."
Junior,4,"Tarleton is a relatively on the smaller side.  The size can lend itself to a more direct interaction with the professors.  As a chemistry major, the class size definitely decreases the further along you progress."
Senior,4,Everyone is so nice on campus and there are many different organizations on campus that you can join.
Niche User,4,"It's beautiful, the staff and students are happy and glad to be there. I think it would be a very appropriate place to go to school. The campus is nicely spaced out due to the wide open country side."
Niche User,4,"As a senior in highschool who is interested in pursuing a career in physical therapy the school has a very good Kinesiology/Physical Therapist school. Some undergraduate students are allowed to work with therapy patients to get the ""real"" world look on what they will be dealing with when they graduate from school. They have good equipment and the students who are working with the patients are very understanding and responsible when helping them with exercises."
Niche User,4,"The campus is really insightful and helpful. Tarleton really keeps students going. Their student dorms are amazing. Also, their sports recreational center is gorgeous. Very new and updated."
Junior,4,"I love how at home I feel here, but the parking situation and constant construction seems to always be in the way of the best possible college experience I can get."
Niche User,4,i went on a avid trip in the 10th grade and i fell in love with the campus and food. I went on a trip with my class and at the place we went to all the dorms and classrooms to see what and where everything is.
Sophomore,4,"The overall atmosphere of being on campus is very welcoming. It is a nice community to be around and apart of. There is always something going on to help you get involved and to help you do better in classes. The only troubles I‚Äôve run into include; parking being tight and most of the time hard to find and not having enough housing for the freshman they have accepted for fall 2018. The more envolved you are with campus events, the better your experience will be (as long as the events do not interfere with your classes.)"
Sophomore,4,I like the friendly enviorment that they have on campus. I just wish there was more diversity in professors and students.
Sophomore,4,"Tarleton is a very interesting school. This will be my only second semester there, but I love it. All the professors are very understanding and easy to work with. The only complaint I have is some of the professors are foreign so they are hard to understand. All in all, Tarleton has every resource you could ask for. you just have to be willing to speak up and ask. Very good school."
Sophomore,4,so far my experience at this university has made the educational process easy to deal with as well as feeling like a home.
Senior,4,One thing that has helped me out a lot is their affiliation with the McLennan Community College University Center program here in Waco. My Fall 2017 semester I was spending $100/week in gas just driving back and forth to Stephenville to attend a class that was shorter than my drive. Once the papers were signed to hold Agribusiness classes online or have them on campus at MCC then it felt like a whole bunch of stress was lifted off my shoulders. By doing that it allowed me to still be a part of the MCC Ag Club and save me loads of money in gas.
Sophomore,4,"Tarleton State University, is a beautiful school that has a great Nursing and Business program. Diversity is still being worked on but has potential to be better in the future. I would like to see more praking but overall that is the only complaint."
Senior,4,I am a senior at Tarleton State University and I have really enjoyed my experience. Each year it has gotten better and I would recommend it to anyone. There was a while that the campus was hard to get around but they did a great job of fixing it and making it very beautiful for its students. The professors have all been very helpful and nice as long as you show up to class and get work done. I have meet some of my best friends and life long friends at this university and I would not trade any of the memories for anything.
Junior,4,"The quality of the education that you receive at Tarleton State University is very good and well worth it. The people there are really nice and friendly, showing genuine Texas love. However, something I would most importantly change is adding more diversity and showcasing it a lot more throughout the school. This would help the school seem proud of its diversity instead of just seeming to cater to specific ethnicity racial groups."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the campus life, including the student activities. The campus food is pretty good as well. I would definitely recommend this school to anyone."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love TSU. 
The only negative I have is that we are still trying to build our diversity, but we are getting there.
It is perfect for someone that is looking for a small school feel, but still wants the extra curricular things like football games, and greek life. 
The dorms are pretty new and updated with lots of options. There is just something about TSU that warms your heart, that is why we are called the ""Best kept secret in Texas."""
Junior,4,It is a very homey campus. There are great resources here. The professors here are very helpful and available.
Junior,4,"Very nice people, The campus is new and the nursing building is equipped with many high fidelity mannequins"
Freshman,2,The college was just not right for me. The professors were not very helpful when asking about questions for tests or homework.
Freshman,2,Was not able to learn properly during online courses. Some teachers would not have sufficient internet to give a proper online class.
Sophomore,2,"I thought it was going to be a wonderful school, but it turns out it didn't meet my expectations. I thought it was a safe campus to attend, but it didn't matter if you reported the situation to the police, they would just blow it over.  From having my truck to being damage and have trash thrown in it to even being spat on when walking. Another problem was the dining hall and it had to deal with some of the food is not cooked all the way and students getting sick. I got sick so much from food poisoning from there that I had to end of cooking my own food and it was a waste of my dining dollars that I had to pay.  Another thing is when your sick the wellness center at the university had turn students away when it was flu season and sent us somewhere else where we had to pay extra when the school was supposed to cover for it. The only good thing that was there was the faculty and staff and some friends."
Niche User,2,"The only main thing that I liked about going to Tarleton State University, was the class sizes. The class size at Tarleton allowed for each student to have a one on one conversation with the Professors."
Junior,2,"It's a college with good housing and open gym to exercise in, but terrible financially. The financial aid do not help much to paying college or giving back refunds when a student fails to turn in paper work when they were endangered with a seizure at the time of fulfilling what they needed to do. Also the teachers for my major of computer science are difficult to understand on what to do with the programs. I have decided to transfer from this college after the Spring semester of 2018."
Freshman,2,"very specific people may like this school depending on your major and personality. i personally didn‚Äôt like it because the town is tiny, coming from a large town where everything is within a 15-20 minute drive, to get to any nice restaurants or even a target is a 45-50 minute drive. resulting in nothing to do on the weekends and even some food places on campus are closed on saturdays. could be fun if you find your group of friends to hang out with. classes were okay. just not the school for me."
Freshman,2,"I liked that it was very traditional,but would like to recieve more one on one attention from teachers."
Freshman,2,"The campus is small and pretty. They have a decent biology department as well. However the chemistry department is awful. Very unorganized and detrimental to learning and grades. The tuition here is cheap, but that is only because you are charged for everything else out of pocket. Very few things are included in tuition and board. The attitude of students on campus ranges from ""I am only here to transfer to A&M""  to ""This is the best school ever!"" And there is no in between. The parking here is the worst I've seen. You pay $100+ to never have anywhere to park. They have actually destroyed more parking spaces to make more dorms. I have since transferred from this school."
College Junior,2,Every semester I receive at least 2-3 emails about an occurrence of sexual assault.
College Freshman,2,"After experiencing Greek life at another university, Tarleton Greek life doesn't even compare. I rushed a sorority at tarleton and ended up not going through with it. Greeks here aren't very active and don't do nearly as much as in other schools."
College Senior,2,I do not care for Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"Having originally come here because it was cheap, I was very unhappy with how often I had to spend more money on campus. All too often I have to purchase food off campus because the dining hall closes very early. This school barges you extra for everything. There are a lot of hidden fees you don't know about for almost everything. They don't label their parking lots well at all. The parking it's self is atrocious, there is not enough parking for the number of students attending. When taking a chemistry class, you are required to borrow materials from the chemistry department, and are not told that you will be charged for every little thing. I was unknowingly putting the wrong tote box number on my papers, and they charged me money for it. They don't warn you when these things happen or try to help you prevent it. Overall, everything here is very limited and often pricey."
College Student,2,I wouldn't recommend this school to anyone who enjoys city life as there is nothing to do around here. I wouldn't chose this school again because the class sizes are not as small as they are advertised. Some of the teachers here do not seem qualified for their jobs or the courses are not as challenging as expected.
College Freshman,2,"Even though they say no hazing goes on, it does. A huge part of greek life here is gossiping about your sisters and brothers, and only some of the greek societies treat non-greeks like actual people and not inferior beings."
College Freshman,2,"I started when a lot of people quit. So everyone who stayed had a lot of things to handle. But the attitudes that came with the ""help"" was not nice ."
College Freshman,2,I stayed in Ferguson which was community styled restroom & shower. Horrible cleaning. Cleaning lady use to hide from me when I asked her to clean the mold out of the showers
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many options for off-campus dining. We have two McDonald's and two Sonics which could've been replaced with other restraunts. I do not eat gluten and there is only one place that I can go to grocery shop and it is outrageously expensive. Walmart and HEB have a few gluten free options but not many at all. Most of the places give student discounts which is nice, and they are mostly close to campus."
College Sophomore,2,The closest thing in walking distance is your average McDonald.
College Sophomore,2,"The town is very small. Besides your grocery store, the town mostly consist of fast food places."
College Freshman,2,Getting the financial aid wasn't that hard. Dealing with the people in the financial office was the problem my parents and I had. Those people need to get their act together.
College Senior,2,The FIN AID dept seems to have no clue what they are doing.
College Senior,2,The office works really slow and they are really rude to people who come to them. Customer Service could use a lot of work in that department.
College Sophomore,2,"Like every college, all the scholarship money goes straight to the sports programs and the rest of the students applying for academic scholarships are limited to $2000, even if the student is offered more."
College Sophomore,2,"I usually end up resorting to cereal or salad. Sometimes the food can be good, but rarely."
College Freshman,2,"Almost every person in the financial aid building is new, which caused many problems for a lot of people. Hopefully it will be better next semester."
College Junior,2,"I do not get financial aid at all due to my parents income & all of my tuition is taken out of their pocket. It is very very hard on them because, even though TSU isnt as expensive as other colleges, it is getting more and more expensive by the semester by them adding fee's and crap that most of us that commute or take onlline classes dont even use."
College Freshman,2,I'm still waiting on mines .
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is terrible. We pay for it and sometimes students cannot even find a place to park. Also, there is no other option. The campus does not offer transport."
College Sophomore,2,"As far as places to eat we have a few locally owned restaurants but other than that the only chain eateries are McDonald's, Sonic, Taco Bell, Chili's, Whataburger, and Subway."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is so unpredictable it makes it very hard to plan more than two hours in advance for anything. Also this December the school had to close down for 3 days during finals due to snow, ice, and altogether unsafe weather conditions."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of white people on campus, while there is some diversity, there isn't noticeably a lot"
College Student,2,The drug scene at Tarleton is very bad. Students and teachers come to classes hung over all the time. It is ridiculous and in my opinion unacceptable.
College Student,2,The financial aid office is very difficult to deal with. They do not let most of the students know when deadlines are and are not very helpful when questions are asked.
College Student,2,"I know the bar scene on Tuesdays and Thursdays is the worst here, at Tarleton, but I do not know what goes on at these events. I do know there is an organization called TAT that gives free rides to people who have been drinking and are unable to drive home. The latest I stay out is 10 at night because I do not have anything to do past then but sleep."
College Senior,2,"They call it the ""quack shack"" for a reason."
College Senior,2,Usually use my own car.
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many things to do around campus. If you want to go shopping for clothes there are only about 5 stores to choose from. There isn't really anywhere close you can drive to either. The night life is average. Tuesday and Thursday nights are college nights so thats when most people go out. The bars are always packed, and the alcohol is definitely flowing. There is a police station on campus, but they don't really do much disciplining. They love to write tickets though. The only sports are the ones that are on campus, and depending on the sport people don't really show up."
College Sophomore,2,Tarleton lacks diversity in almost everything
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is not very struck as a whole. People drink in the dorms, and people stay over on the weekdays when they aren't supposed to."
College Sophomore,2,"The greeks are very clique like, but they are somewhat interested in getting to know you. They usually try to get you to join."
College Freshman,2,"There are never enough parking spots available, but construction is being done to fix the problem."
College Freshman,2,"I received some financial aid, but not enough to cover my tuition. I was only able to attend the fall semester. I'm stuck trying to find ways to cover my tuition. "
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid process is a dreaded one for me just about every semester. The office is impossible to get ahold of via telephone, but when you go in person there are plenty of people to answer to the phones, they just choose not to. I literally had to call over 100 times in less than an hour before anyone answered. We also do not have enough lines available for such a busy office. During the busiest hours such as the summer before school starts again in the fall a majority of the phone calls go directly to an automated voice saying the have a high volume number of calls and to call back again. "
College Junior,2,"In Stephenville, Tx, it is nothing but a college town with some farmers and cows about 20 miles outside of the town."
College Sophomore,2,There is way too little parking for as many students that are on campus. 
College Sophomore,2,We live in a small town so getting to campus isn't difficult. There is not much need for transportation of those needs. 
College Sophomore,2,I really wish my town had more options when it came to food places. Sure McDonald's is cheap and convenient but it is also extremely unhealthy. Chili's is one of the best places to eat in my opinion but it is a bit pricey. 
College Sophomore,2,Parking at my school has been a huge issue since I started attending college. Not a day goes by that someone doesn't complain about the parking. The ticket lady should be more lenient on students because if they can't find a place to park that shouldn't cost them 50 to 100 dollars. They are trying to get an education and it is highly difficult to do when there aren't enough parking spots. Recently we did start up a shuttle service and that has helped a little bit but not enough to satisfy the entire student population. 
College Sophomore,2,Spots fill up quick and the meter maid is very mean.
College Sophomore,2,There are the same restaurants that we see everyday which is fine because they have cheap prices. It would be nice to have different restaurants that we can sit down and eat at. 
Recent Alumnus,2,When Tarleton was in Killeen the classes were a joke. Luckily the new school A&M University Central Texas is showing an improvement.
College Junior,2,"The surrounding area of the school has no special dining offers for college students/ No student discounts or study friendly facilities are offered. The convenience is ok, since there are many, yet, the choices are limited to the typical chain restaurants and fast-food chains. The cost is ok since all of these chains usually have value menus but the health aspect is very poor."
College Junior,2,"Drinking and drugs really aren't tolerated. If you get arrested you have to go see the Dean and write a paper over an assigned topic. If you have multiple offenses, you can be put on probation and possible be kicked out."
Recent Alumnus,2,Sometimes hard to acquire being a military town. Availability can become an issue.
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive much money at all. They've been rather slow with the whole experience. They were not that helpful when it came down to my questions. Most of the people who helped me were students themselves.
College Senior,2,"It is a pain!!! They are always busy and you can hardly get in contact with them unless you go to the office in person. When you do get in contact with someone however, they are very helpful."
College Senior,2,"Unless dining at fast food restaurants, options are limited."
College Freshman,2,Park is bad. There is not enough parking places. If you want to get a good parking place you must get to school early in the morning!
College Sophomore,2,"We need more parking! Instead of building it as a priority, they are building a residence hall. There have done lots of construction projects lately which close off one or more parking lots for months at a time."
College Freshman,2,"me, personally, I would say there isn't a whole lot to do since we're a small town, but they do have a few things to offer. We have places to go dance and a bowling alley and I believe a skating rink"
Niche User,1,Worst school for transfers. Never could get in contact with staff and I even had an advisor tell me to stay at my current college.
Sophomore,1,"I was super excited to go to Tarleton at first! I was a transfer student from the local junior college. The first day I was confused about my schedule so I approached my teacher and asked for help and he simply told me to drop his class if I couldn't even figure out my schedule. At Tarleton they do not care about you, you are simply a number not a face. They just want your money and did not have many programs helping transfer students get acclimated to the new school. I was planning on getting my BSN there but the teachers are subpar and not very willing to help. I am choosing to take my education else where and  I am extremely disappointed with my experience. I have attended one semester and the whole time I have been there it has been the most frustrating experience ever. Would not recommend. If I could give them 0 stars I would."
College Freshman,1,Everyone in the frats and sors are douchebags
College Freshman,1,"I'm saying its bad not because the parties are crappy and boring, but because of the amount of dangerous activities going on. No one seems to understand safety, and then you get about 50 people from so said party complaining about rape, accidental pregnancy, STD's, and overdose because its just a free for all. LJT season? Horrible, kids come to class hung over and on the verge of immensely vomiting in front of the whole class. Finals are skipped, and then people complain about failing. Its called planning and knowing how to put the darn bottle down so you're not seriously sick the next day."
College Freshman,1,"I did not personally apply for financial aid, but most of my friends did and hearing all of the stories of their attempts at receiving their financial aid were awful."
College Freshman,1,I'm not the party type person so I really don't care about the parties that everyone talks about. It's a waste of time.
College Freshman,1,There isn't a way to get around town unless you have a car or know someone with a car.
College Freshman,1,I hated living on campus!
College Junior,1,The financial aid office at Tarleton is not helpful at all. The students working at the front desk are rude and do not supply you with any information. The students have bad attitudes when I am trying to get help on how to apply for financial aid/loans. I have been in to the financial aid office over 10 times and EVERY time I come out miserable and more confused then before.
College Senior,1,Stephenville lacks a lot of dining and night life for a typical college experience.
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is AWFUL! It is impossible to find a parking spot anywhere close to class. Most people just park at the Football stadium and walk to class without even looking. They are in the process of building more dorms so they tore up a parking lot. They really do need to do something because I don't think it could get any worse.
College Sophomore,1,"We just recently started making small shuttle cars accessible for students. I have never seen any form of public in town except for an incredibly small bus that transports around town, but I believe you have to call it and it not commonly used by students. A car is needed mainly for going out purposes or fast food that is not available on campus, other than that, just about everything a person could need is in walking distance."
College Junior,1,"Our Financial Aid Office is always a mess and fails to properly deal with students, parents, paperwork or answer phones. Worst part about this school."
College Junior,1,"There are less parking spots for students than there are for professors, as well as little to none for commuter students who then receive tickets. There is also absolutely no around-town transportation for those of us without a vehicle. I have often had to change my classes because they required off campus meetings for Labs."
College Junior,1,"I try to live a very healthy lifestyle, and Stephenville's off campus choices offer little to nothing as far as that goes."
College Sophomore,1,There is really no where for us to have fun and go out to. There needs to be more places for us to go.
College Sophomore,1,There really isn't that much transportation so if you do not have a car you can't get around like you need to. 
College Junior,1,"Tarleton State University has a terrible sports program, but that's okay because I didn't come here for the sports. I came here for an education."
College Junior,1,The facilities are currently being decided on. The school is still in its construction stages.
College Sophomore,1,"There is basically no transportation in Stephenville besides City and Rural Rides (CARR). However, it only runs 8-5 Monday through Friday. You will need your own car or bike. There are plenty of bike racks at every building on campus. We do not have any taxi services or really any bus services unless you want one that goes to Ft. Worth or Dallas."

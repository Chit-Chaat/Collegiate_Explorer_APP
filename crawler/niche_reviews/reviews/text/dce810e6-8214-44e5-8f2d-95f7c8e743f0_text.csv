Sophomore,5,"Brigham Young University is a great return on your investment, and the professors want to help you pass rather and being indifferent to your success."
Junior,5,"The online platform is amazing, very user friendly. It has a great reminding system and a great way to talk with other students in your class."
Junior,5,"The campus has a very calm atmosphere and helps people through their education career. The teachers are amazing and teach from the heart. I love it so much I've gone back twice, once for my Associates, now for my Bachelors."
Junior,5,"It is a very student-focused school that works to help students succeed. It is a school founded on solid moral and educational principles, with many, many resources that are free to the student body, including free tutoring, advising, and recreation facilities."
Freshman,5,"I have not yet gone down in person to the campus yet, but while preparing for classes, they have kept in contact with me and made sure I understand the process for preparation to sign up for classes. They are always there to answer any of your questions, they have calmed down my worries and I am now more excited then before! I would recommend going to BYU-I!"
Freshman,5,"I have not started my classes yet, but the classes I have scheduled for the upcoming semester I am very excited! I have heard so many good things about BYU-I and can't wait to experience it myself."
Freshman,5,"The school is very welcoming, and so far it has been very accommodating towards the students during this pandemic. The overall attitude found here is very bright and positive despite the circumstances."
Junior,5,"Some professors are great at leading online classes, some aren't. I assume this is the case everywhere. I used Rate my professor to avoid the ones that seem to think they are getting paid to grade coursework and nothing else, and I have really enjoyed my time taking online classes. Personally, I prefer them to their on-campus counterparts. If online classes are something you are looking for, then I think taking them through BYU-I could be a solid option. The price per credit is also very solid, so if you are going to take online classes and not be getting the benefits of the campus anyway, that maybe something to seriously consider. There are more certificates and degrees available online than when I started too, which is great for any new/future students."
Junior,5,"With coronavirus, this school was ahead of the game in online classes and the school did not hesitate with the transition. It offered classes and majors online for some time now, and now is better than ever. I usually don't like online classes, but I am impressed with how it is now."
Sophomore,5,"The learning experience was actually really good! I was nervous when everything turned online, but the school did a wonderful job with such a difficult transition! I have never been confused as to what my professors expect from me, and the assignments and curriculum is clear and easy to understand!"
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Brigham Young University-Idaho! I have learned so much in my short time as a student here! I am excited to continue my education here! I was very shy and nervous when I started, but I have so many new friends and have had the most wonderful experiences here!"
Freshman,5,So far in my schooling at BYU Idaho I have learned many things. The classes teach respect and punctuality. The school is respectful to beliefs but also provides a strong backbone of principles for life. The students and staff are all primarily friendly. Great School!
Sophomore,5,There is a different spirit on campus. I feel blessed for being able to go there. The teachers care about us not only academically but spiritually as well.
Junior,5,My overall experience with Brigham Young University of Idaho has been wonderful. There are numerous experiences to put yourself out there and meet new people. The classes are on the smaller side which makes it more personal between you and your professor.  Great university!
Junior,5,My online learning experience with BYU-Idaho has been great. The classes are easy to follow along and understand when the deadlines are. The teachers are super involved as well.
Freshman,5,"From my small online experience I have to say I love it. The instructors are knowledgeable, supportive and care about your education. I look forward to finishing by degree with BYU-I."
Freshman,5,"From my small online experience I have to say I love it. The instructors are knowledgeable, supportive and care about your education. There are free tutors and many other ways to get the help you need. I look forward to finishing by degree with BYU-I."
Freshman,5,"The teachers I have met have all been great. They really want to ensure us students understand the material they're teaching us, and they're very understanding. They know their fields well. The tuition is also very affordable.

For me personally, I love that Brigham Young University--Idaho is a place that reveres and teaches about God and Jesus Christ. The university combines secular learning with spiritual learning, and the two work in tandem wonderfully."
Freshman,5,"It's a good school, good campus and better teachers! They want you to graduate at affordable prices, and give away lots of scholarships to help you do so!"
Junior,5,Great school with low tuition. So many opportunities to grow and so much help is given to those who seek it out.
Sophomore,5,I have been taking online classes throughout my college experience. Professors are knowledgeable and helpful. Professors are also very responsive.
Sophomore,5,"BYU is not just a school, it is a community! Staff and Professors help build your confidence and hold you to high standards. I love going to a college where morals and values count!"
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved my time being at this school. It was definitely inclusive to all! The tuition was rather affordable and they even had free tutoring for everybody, whether you were an online student or not, so that was really nice! The gym was phenomenal and the people were quite friendly. I have nothing bad to say about this school. The professors were very competent and most have their PhD. The library is one of the best of ever been to and the store was great as well. No complaints at all!"
Alum,5,"I was on campus and I took classes online and in both cases I was rather pleased! The online courses were very straightforward and easily accessible. If you read the syllabus in each course and put forth the effort, you're guaranteed to succeed!"
Freshman,5,"BYU I is incredible. There is a consistent push to achieve your best, not only regarding academics but in your personal life. The professors show great, personal interest in you and are always willing to help. School is affordable and of a high quality. I feel that I have invested in my future by attending here."
Senior,5,"I love BYU-I. the campus is beautiful, the professors care, the classrooms are small, you get a great experience learning and making friends."
Senior,5,I had a great experience! The online teachers do a fantastic job helping the students along and showing that they care.
Sophomore,5,"During our lifetime there is a moment that students must stop doing anything and start thinking about which college they should apply. College has a big influence on our lives.  I am a sophomore at Brigham Young University Idaho. Although I did not spend to much time in school because of the Coronavirus, I would say that Brigham Young University Idaho is one of the best colleges that a student can find. Brigham Young University is a college where most students are members of  ""The church of JESUS CHRIST of latter-day saints""  The school helps students to follow the right path for their life. It does not pressure the students and teachers are very kind. The environment is amazing and comfortable. Everything is provided and easy to find, so students would focus only on studying and doing a good job to graduate. there are a lot of activities, there are tutoring centers to help students with studying and advising centers to help them to find what they want to do with their career life."
Senior,5,"I am not a huge fan of the online experience of any sort, but BYUI has an exceptional program. You can tell that BYUI has invested a good amount of effort into providing a program that has a natural but still challenging progression. Furthermore, the online programs are set up in such a way as to keep students on task throughout the duration of the class."
Freshman,5,I loved the Pathway program that they offer. I was able to get college classes for a discounted price by going through Pathways. I love the teachers and the curriculum. Everyone is so helpful and make you feel loved.
Freshman,5,"I took all my classes online through Pathways BYU-I. I start my freshman year through BYU-I this fall. I loved learning how to be a better online student, as well as learning good study habits and the teachers were great at making you feel important and loved."
Junior,5,This school is focused on helping their student succeed and provide countless resources to do so. There is a uniquely kind and cheery atmosphere on campus.
Junior,5,"The school has adapted very well to online learning for COVID-19. I still prefer in-person, but I felt that my online experiences were very high quality."
Freshman,5,"Brigham Young University- Idaho is a very organized facility. You are treated well and the housing options are great! There are many stores and restaurants to check out and for you to work at. There are also jobs from the school such as in the student cafeteria. The cafeteria food is very diverse and very enjoyable.  The counselors are very helpful and you are also provided with a professions’ counselor, which is very helpful to those who already are aware of what they would like their career to be in the future. Brigham Young University- Idaho’s website is easy to navigate through and also very simplified. Applying to the school and registering for classes was super easy."
Freshman,5,"My experience with Brigham Young University- Idaho was very good and the online experience was even better. I took all my classes online for the semester, and it was very easy to set up and register to those classes. The website for Brigham Young University- Idaho is very organize and easy to navigate through. All my professors are very good people and are very willing to help make my experience a good one. There's a big variety in what classes you can choose and also for the electives. I also had appointments online with counselors and also professions counselors who were very helpful in giving me insight and directions on what I should do and what classes I should take."
Sophomore,5,I loved studying at BYU-Idaho. The professors of my major were very in tune with the needs of their students. They knew each one by name and were willing to meet with and help students at any time and in any way they could. The class sizes were smaller and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of education I received.
Sophomore,5,"What I appreciate most about BYU-Idaho was the opportunity that I had to attend a quality university at an affordable price. At first the class scheduling can be confusing, or which classes to sign up for can be frustrating. However, by the end of my time attending BYU-Idaho, I was fortunate to graduate without any debt, and to qualify for the graduate program of my dreams."
Sophomore,5,"The portal, Canvas, is well organized. The teachers are generally clear with the guidelines, rubrics, and deadlines. Each online class allows interaction with other students and the teacher. 
Before attending BYU-Idaho, I took online classes at various other universities as well as my public high school. My experience with online learning has been the best so far at BYU- Idaho."
Sophomore,5,"I love Brigham Young University- Idaho because the professors truly care. It is a smaller school, which allows each student to receive the mentoring that they personally need in their education."
Freshman,5,"The idea of college can be terrifying, but BYU-I makes that worth it. I won't say that school here is easy, because it's not - but getting the help you need from teachers, and tutors, and fellow students is. Everyone wants to see you succeed, and will do their best to help you get there."
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere of BYU-I. This is a place I feel comfortable and uplifted. The price is also great compared to other universities that cost more than an arm and a leg. The education is also worth all the time, effort, and costs that I have invested in my education there. Overall it's a great place to be."
Sophomore,5,"You can beat the price! I only pay $73 a credit hour because I went through the Pathway program and do school online. However, you will pay $173 credit hour on campus but I love being online student! The instructors are great and the education is very good. I feel well prepared for MSW graduate school"
Sophomore,5,"You can beat the price! I only pay $73 a credit hour because I went through the Pathway program and do school online. However, you will pay $173 credit hour on campus but I love being online student! The instructors are great and the education is very good. I feel well prepared for MSW graduate school."
Freshman,5,It is an amazing university that is very diverse and has a lot of opportunities to excell. Professors are very qualified to teach their fields
Freshman,5,I have not taken any online classes so this does not apply to me at all. I have no idea why i have to type this.
Alum,5,BYUI was so great! Definitely had fun! Housing was easy to find. Cafeteria food was great. The whole town was so fun to live in
Sophomore,5,I love the staff at BYU-I cause they make you feel cared for. There's always fun social activities going on and there's a lot of diversity in the student body.
Junior,5,It's a school where I feel safe on campus and am given every opportunity to advance my education. While I am also being given a profuse education I am strengthened in my faith in taking classes and devotionals that reinforce my religious affiliations.
Junior,5,I have taken a few classes online through the BYU-I and can safely say that online teachers are very helpful and efficient in helping in whatever questions I had about their class. I prefer to take students on campus to stay accountable but every once in a while I do prefer to take an online course depending on my life circumstances.
Freshman,5,This on experience is a hard learning curve but BYU-Idaho really made it do-able. I loved the gathering class we had once a week and we had the same group for the whole year.  You really got to know each other and gained some wonderful friendships.  The classes are really helpful for real life and helped you learn to become self-reliant.  I didn't feel like it was a waste of time or money.
Freshman,5,I started with their Pathway's program to get into BYU-Idaho.  It really helped me to prepare for online schooling.  It's an amazing program!
Freshman,5,"When you enter, you get a feeling that people care, and listen. There are several opportunities to learn and grow. It is easy to find a place there that can make you feel almost at home. One issue that I have seen is they have a required course on time management and college success. While this sounds good, the class itself is fairly useless. They can definitely make it a more useful class, or make better use of that time."
Alum,5,I have taken BYU Pathway online courses which are administered by BYU Idaho-I attended on campus 1988-1990. I loved the courses I have taken. The instructors are there to assist.
Alum,5,I really enjoyed BYU-Idaho and BYU-Pathway online courses. I love the campus and the student-oriented faculty.
Freshman,5,"I am stoked to attend school here after my mission. I have been accepted already! 
This school is EXTREMELY affordable. I am DETERMINED not to go into debt in school. The grounds are beautiful and the culture on campus is encouraging and friendly. Never demeaning or competitive.
Can't wait to attend!"
Freshman,5,I have not personally taken online classes with BYU Idaho. I would however consider it if the campus did not open after Corona.
Freshman,5,"The rigid winter wind no longer matters when you have genuine professors like the BYU-Idaho staff. These learned professors exhibit passion for their courses and students through their enthusiastic lessons and check-up emails. The professors at this university are very understanding and are willing to help you reach your highest academic potential, as long as you are willing to put in the work. The LDS church-inspired honor code, ensures a professional, clean, and safe environment on campus. Students are a mix of members and non-members, but there is no tension. BYU-Idaho is perfect if you like small town life with a hint of city. The classes are also fairly small, so you have more personalized classes. (It's also one of the top 10 cheapest universities in the country!)"
Freshman,5,"The online professors are just as learned as the on-campus professors, but they are not going to hold your hand. Online classes are usually taken by those who are busy during the normal class hours, so you have to be good at time management. With the current pandemic, all classes are now being held online/remotely. The professors are very understanding (especially right now),  and I have not had too much trouble switching from in-person to online with any of my classes. If you want to take a language class, I recommend taking it in person because it is easier to communicate with your teacher and tutors in person, but it is doable online."
Sophomore,5,Brigham Young University-Idaho is very familiar with and excel at online schooling. A wide and diverse group of students are associated with BYU-I. They allow a flexible schedule and offer amazing material and academic resources like free tutoring. Teachers and student are kind and understanding and encouraging. Great experience.
Sophomore,5,My overall favorite thing about the school is the learning atmosphere. Every student and teacher (on and off campus) want to see you succeed and do well. Teachers know you by name and will willingly offer their help. Various courses are offered. I have learned so much already and want to continue doing so!
Senior,4,This campus is a great campus! The people are very kind and friendly! This is a lot smaller campus than most which is can be very beneficial! Tuition is also a lot cheaper here than most places and the environment is a pretty positive one!
Senior,4,My online experince has been pretty positive! My major can be done online so I have always had a few online classes which I really enjoy!
Freshman,4,"I took many courses online.  The professors know how to use the internet very well, and almost all classes are available online if that is your preferred way of learning.  The professors know how to assign enough materials to help you learn without overwhelming you with too much at once."
Freshman,4,"The professors are great, and you learn a lot.  Although it is a university from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, they are extremely open and understanding of people of different faiths.  Many classes, do open and close with a prayer, though, but none are required to participate.  The tuition is extremely cheap, being less than $5,000 per semester for nonmembers of the Church of Jesus Christ, and less for members.  Although there is no on-campus housing, there are many apartments within walking distance of campus, and the city of Rexburg is very nice.  The school does lack on a few fronts, however.  There are few, if any, official sports teams, so if you want to play college sports professionally, this might not be the college for you.  It does, however, have sports clubs and competitions between BYUI students.  Also, as it is a church school, there is a very strict code of conduct, and many might find that it is overbearing or excessive.  Rexburg also gets very cold."
Alum,4,"Going to Brigham Young University- Idaho was such an amazing experience! The teachers were always willing to help and the education I received was incredible. There were times where I was frustrated with things that happened at the school and often the grading wasn't always fair. However, I always felt peace at the school. The teachers always held the students to a higher standard which made going to the school a very encouraging and safe place to be. I loved that the school was heavily grounded in religion and that made the the atmosphere different from other schools. I would highly recommend."
Alum,4,"I got an opportunity to take both online and in classroom classes, and I found that both were equally matched in level of challenge and ability to reach out to the teacher. Every week I would have a meeting with the teacher in a group setting and I would have the chance to ask the questions I needed to ask and received the answers promptly. The online classes would sometimes be a little more difficult in terms of homework, however the homework would balance out with multiple projects we would do in groups."
Junior,4,"The online classes here are very interactive for the lost part, and the instructors are very responsive and helpful."
Freshman,4,"Most of my classes are hybrid courses, so even though I can’t be on campus all the time I still get something. As a music major I get to have in person ensembles too so that is a huge bonus."
Junior,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my overall experience with Brigham Young University-Idaho. They employ students in their help centers, which has made it difficult to deal with any issues (registration, financial aid, tax documents, etc.), but any real issue (stuff that is not resolved by them just telling you the stuff that is on their FAQ page, but over the phone) usually gets worked out once they send your case over to an actual staff member.

As far as education has been; I have taken both on-campus and online courses, and think that it has been a great experience in both settings. I feel as though I have learned and become more prepared to work within my field of study. Some classes definitely feel like it could just be a textbook and some links to YouTube videos and I am just paying for someone to proctor the tests, but the learning is still quality (I am just not sure that is particularly at the hand of the university, but they pick good materials most of the time is what I mean)."
Sophomore,4,Participating in online classes through BYU-Idaho was a good experience. Professors have all begun using the I-learn (Canvas) platform. Allowing students to view uploaded content by teachers and view all assignments. Most teachers are very familiar with the platforms and use it to upload helpful videos and information for their students.
Sophomore,4,"Brigham Young University-Idaho is a wonderful school to attend! It is a bit smaller than other universities, and I find it lovely.  This school has a wonderful atmosphere and amenities for it's students. Smaller classes allow more student interaction with teachers. And free tutoring for any student allows one on one help anytime. There are many activities that students can participate in in most every area. It is a great school with many opportunities offered to its students!"
Junior,4,"Personally, I love this school. It offered an amazing undergraduate education with teachers that are usually great to work with and learn from, and the school does a great job blending faith and beliefs with the various fields of study. I feel prepared for my future. The location offers a more laid back experience full of adventure, and there are many great people and students."
Junior,4,BYUI is a very good school of you are looking for a Christ centered education. You meet a lot of people with your same values and it can really help take away some of the stress you get from classes. I don't give 5 stars because sometimes I feel like they can miss the mark and don't listen to what the students are actually saying.
Junior,4,I have never had a problem with classes that are ran by teachers that are used to doing online classes. They have always gone smoothly and it can be very convenient to have a few classes online every semester so I don't have to be in a classroom all the time. It was harder when all the classes were online and my grades took a bit of a hit but I think everyone had that problem.
Freshman,4,The professors look for ways to keep the class active and learning! They do a tremendous job in teaching and giving equal opportunity to all and are constantly looking for the comments of students on zoom.
Sophomore,4,They added a lot more busywork to the online classes. That being said I did get a lot out of the classes online and most of the online teachers are incredible and very helpful.
Junior,4,"I love more than anything the smaller classes. I feel the classes are big enough where there is diversity but small enough that you get one-on-one time with the professor & a more personal learning experience. I also LOVE the teachers. I have never had one professor that hasn't loved me, cared about my success, or taught reasonably well. They all have worked with me so much & I loved that."
Freshman,4,"The way in which the university handled the COIVD-19 pandemic has been fantastic. In the Spring semester, all of our classes were online, either through traditional online classes or through virtual meetings over video chat. The teachers handled this change well, and the virtual classrooms provided a good environment for learning. If a student needed to talk with a professor or a tutor, online schedules helped transition office hours over quite nicely. 

This upcoming Fall semester, the university is offering some on-campus classes as well, following safety guidelines, while retaining online options for those who do not wish to go on-campus just yet."
Junior,4,"The only complaint I have about this University is the location. Rexburg is a nice town, but its too small and doesn't have much to offer in terms of entertainment or variety. Not having access to things like Asian/Hispanic grocery stores is always a struggle for me. If you can make the trip to Idaho Falls then it isn't all that bad though."
Junior,4,"While some of the professors in the online courses may sometimes feel like they are not even there/are just posting a predetermined set of information to students every week, the content and structure of the online courses are very clear, concise and helpful. I find that I rarely need help from professors because most of the needed information is already given to me."
Sophomore,4,My experience has been that online class is good. It's opened up the possibility of staying home and safe during the pandemic while allowing me to continue my degree. I've been able to make connections with classmates and it's been a valuable experience for me.
Freshman,4,I took some online classes and some of the teachers are hit-and-miss. Some treat a one credit class like a 5 credit one and some 5 credit ones give you work like a one credit class. It's just about whichever teacher you get
Junior,4,"We went online when coronavirus Hit and no one was prepared for going online. It was a bit rocky, but it was good overall."
Freshman,4,"The online program is professional and simple. The professors try to make things as interesting and interactive as they can. The work is meaningful and not just ""busy"" work."
Freshman,4,I love BYUI i would like to see some change in the student resource center. It can be very difficult to get answers to simple questions.
Freshman,4,"I had taken some college classes while in high school to earn both college and high school credits. The online experience was great, plenty of help while taking the classes. The professors were more than qualified to do their job, some more excited than others though. If it weren't for family business, I would have passed by first semester of online classes. This really gave me a good insight for what college life and expectations were like."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning is not one of my favorite way of learning, but the teachers made it easy for us students to understand the lessons. They answered any questions I had and always ready to help me in every difficulty. I found it easy to understand the material and to complete the assignments given as homework. Online lessons were not too much overloaded, but sometimes there were times that I could not understand and that was because I am an international student due to that my English is not that good.  Brigham Young University made me love online classes. The biggest benefit of online classes is that I am able to complete school while being at home. What I do not like about online learning is that you do not interact with other students sometimes is very challenging to be all by yourself. You can ask for help or create groups to complete the lesson and help each other. Often other people's opinion matters too. Online lessons can be helpful but sometimes it makes you feel lonely."
Senior,4,"This is a great university, and there are lots of opportunities to succeed here if only because the professors act like they want you to succeed. Rexburg is a wonderful area if you like snow. There are some really great ski-hills all within a reasonable vicinity to the school itself. Beyond this, Heise Hot springs is very close and provides year around swimming."
Freshman,4,"The only online classes I took, were due to the COVID-19 pandemic, otherwise I choose to avoid them because they are not my favorite learning style. However, for something I don't usually emjoy, my professors did an excellent job at helping me through my studies."
Sophomore,4,Learning online is definitely harder for me than in class learning because of the extra time it seems to take. It requires a lot more reading than in class learning. I have enjoyed doing class Zoom meeting as part of the online experience this time around though. 2020 has made that a must for most places.
Junior,4,The instructors are great. They allow students to collaborate with one another in tackling the most intriguing problems
Junior,4,"The campus is very clean and beautiful. The area is gorgeous. BYU has very high standards, which added to the great experience. The co-eds were also beautiful and friendly.A great atmosphere and extraordinary academic level .The teachers really care about their students."
Alum,4,Online learning was awesome and professors were easy to reach! Just find a few classmates to keep you accountable and responsible! I loved that there were so many choices for online classes.
Sophomore,4,"BYU-I is a great school. Professors and faculty work hard, buildings and classrooms are up to date and well kept, the library and study rooms have everything you need to get work done, the community and extracurricular activities and groups are great."
Sophomore,4,"The student portal and all online communications are pretty outstanding and great with easy accesibilty. They provide many options for classes, homework, studies, group work and communication, along with many other things all that can all be accessed online through their sites and systems. Along with that they provide almost all of their classes and courses online including labs, allowing students to study off campus and abroad year round. I would recommend attending Brigham Young University - Idaho and their online programs as the best option to students looking for an online studies, courses and or degree options from a full fledged university."
Sophomore,4,"Online courses are a new experience for me so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the thing I loved was attending lectures from the comfort of home."
Senior,4,I love the atmosphere here! The people are friendly and there are so many fun outdoor adventures to participate in.
Freshman,4,BYUI has done a great job transitioning online for Covid-19. I think this is because they have already been doing such a good job with their online courses. I'm not the best at learning online but I was able to enjoy the semester even though it was online.
Freshman,4,"I really love the school! There's so much to get involved in, the professors are super nice and willing to help. All my classes have been so much fun. There's so much to do around the town and making friends has been so easy. It's been a great experience going to this school. (:"
Junior,4,"Brigham Young University-Idaho's online classes are set up to help you succeed. Platforms are quick to grasp and easily accessible. Teachers are only an email or video call away, and are happy to attend to your questions and/or concerns."
Sophomore,4,"I started college at BYU Idaho as an incoming freshman, as soon as I entered the campus I was greeted with warm smiles and friendly faces. I've been a student here for over a year and that still hasn't changed"
Sophomore,4,This school is awesome because most of the students have the same values which makes making friends easier which helps when you need help in classes. Most teachers have time to help out when needed and will take the time to explain things to you. Some classes require what seems like an inhumanly possible amount of reading especially for those who are ADHD.
Freshman,4,"I took a online class my very first semester and Spring 2020 was all remote or online learning. I thought online learning would be difficult and no professor help, but I was wrong. Even with online classes professors are always there to help. If you need help professors will set up a time to meet with you either by email, phone, zoom or skype whatever works best for you individually. They are willing to go out of their way to make sure you get the education you need. If you feel you are not getting enough education for your pay many professors will add or change their teaching styles"
Junior,4,"I have taken a few classes online, and they been excellent! The professors are experienced in teaching online classes, and the content is easy to access. I would take a couple so that I had more time to complete assignments for my on-campus classes."
Junior,4,Online classes aren't that bad. The teachers have experience with technology so there's rarely a problem. Most of the time I had a good understanding of what we were learning.
Junior,4,I like that it is a safe environment with little partying. I wish that it was a more comfortable place to openly talk about topics frowned upon by the church.
Sophomore,4,Brigham young university - Idaho is a great school if you’re looking for an inexpensive option that is very gospel centered.
Sophomore,4,BYUI is a very good university that I have enjoyed attending. They have some amazing professors who care about your success in the class and will help you to do well.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed my time at BYU-Idaho! I loved the community and overall small town feel that accompanies Rexburg. Small class sizes are the norm, along with passionate professors who are always willing to assist you in anyway possible to achieve. The campus is small, so it's pretty easy to get to your classes. The only negatives I would have associated with the school is the lack of clubs & organizations that the school endorses (MEChA, College Dems/Republicans, etc.) and also, specifically for non-religious individuals, the fact that the school is a based on Christian ideals, as the school is associated with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Overall, I would say that BYU-I is a really great school for its affordability and dedication for students to achieve in academically."
Sophomore,4,Taking classes online is very good! They do prepare vey well and the curriculum is taught well. The ability to speak to the teacher whenever is very convent and pleasant for us students.
Sophomore,4,This is a great school with great academics! However I am African American and it is not diverse at all. I don't appreciate it.
Junior,4,Some online classes are great. My favorite online class has been Econ 150. I feel like it was straight forward and easy material. It wasn't hard to understand the information or my teachers expectations. Some classes on the other had are awful. Some assign tons of pointless busy work and some assign things that are simply impossible to understand without instruction.
Sophomore,4,"I loved most of my professors; I prefer face to face learning, but I haven't taken a full semester of online learning."
Niche User,4,The teachers and the staff are very friendly and are very willing to help answer any of your questions.
Niche User,4,"I took several online classes and it was very nice to work at my own pace, and the instructors were very nice and helpful"
Sophomore,4,"I wish that credits from AP tests or classes would transfer better. I wish that their were more degree options. I do love that it is easier for students to receive help from their teachers, because most classes are smaller. Students are less of a number and more of individuals who are cared about. The music program is great. There are great professors who care about the students and helping them to be successful. There is a great feeling at that campus and great opportunities for learning."
Junior,4,"The online program is great, the classes are just as rigorous as they are on campus. But all the resources that someone on campus has, you have access to it. Except for the labs that require materials. The teachers still are, they will reach out to you to see how you are doing in the class."
Junior,4,"The school is great, the teaching style is more group learning which has been proven to be more effective in the long run. The professors make sure that they are available to you beyond the class time, make sure that you understand and not just know the material. They are great. The campus is very pretty and brings a sipirit peace and safety that benefits your learning excperience overall. I have to say that the school exepects you to liveby the honor code on campus, and if broken and reported to the honor code office the consequencs can be ugly."
Freshman,4,"I don’t love having online or remote classes, but the professors have definitely made the transition easier. I haven’t had a professor yet who didn’t know how to best format/navigate remote classes."
Sophomore,4,"I've only been online due to the coronavirus pandemic. The classes have been adjusted for remote settings and online courses. Teachers have been accommodating and class loads have been according to abilities due to online. There has been a challenge for lab classes, as they have not been able to be held, and that has affected graduation. Yet, my experience has been a positive one."
Alum,2,"Did not fit in with the culture and was threatened by an ecclesiastical leader to keep in line or lose my chance at a degree.  Academics were fine, but I was ill-prepared for a student teaching opportunity and ended up having to drop out of  education and change majors last minute."
Alum,2,"I got my education, but they are too worried about pushing people out of the school. They are in a hurry for everyone to graduate, rather than helping the student find what they like."
Freshman,2,"I think the grounds are nice, and there are good people on campus, as well as good teachers. I, however, was not pleased with the attitude of the students toward their education, nor with how the classes were taught. I also do not like big classes."
Niche User,2,"Make sure you are part of the ""IN"" crowd, or you will have a miserable time here.  The place is so homogeneous that you can never get anywhere (in the college, or the town) if you are the slightest bit different or unique.
So, if you can walk the very tight line, or Rod in this case, you are golden. Best of luck to y'all."
College Senior,2,"Very few students here are not Mormon. Given that this is a Mormon college, that is not surprising. However, those that do not live by the Mormon standards generally do not apply or do not speak about it. For example, there are not many students in the LGBTA community and if there are, they are not open about it."
College Senior,2,Everyone there is immature and whitewashed
College Junior,2,"I am not very familiar with any fraternities or sororities on campus, and if there are any, they are not very visible."
College Junior,2,"There are not parties or bars to go to, but there are a lot of night activities or dances"
College Junior,2,"There really aren't athletics at BYU-I. They have some ""just for fun"" teams. I have participated in the past and they really are fun and a great time, but nothing to go to games with friends."
College Junior,2,"Never really heard much from the athletics team. I don't even know if we have a college team to play in football. The gym was pretty stocked and people were there to help so at least that was taken care of. So the facilities for sports were pretty good and well used. While the enthusiasm for sport teams, I never really heard much but I was never a sports person in the first place. So I wouldn't know a whole lot about their sports."
College Sophomore,2,"I've never seen so many white people in one area. I'm mixed race; my mom is Asian and my dad is white. I'm from a very diverse area, so going to BYUI was a bit of a shock. First week of the semester, one of my roommates made an Asian joke. I had a white roommate that would use the n-word on occasion. There are associations for the many different ethnic groups, which is nice, but there is still a lot of intolerance and close-mindedness. Not to say that everyone on campus is openly racist, there are just small pockets of people who do it. Because of the LDS presence, there is virtually nothing about LGBT community anywhere. Students who identify as part of the LGBT community have an unspoken ""don't ask don't tell"" policy. I have never met an openly gay student on campus. I think no one has spoken out about it in fear of intolerance."
College Junior,2,"Brigham Young University-Idaho does not have varsity sport teams. I transferred here from Utah State University where sports teams were a major part of my college experience, and I really miss that. I've thought about joining an intramural team but I'm not sure how comfortable I would be in playing - I just want to watch and be involved and have school pride!"
College Sophomore,2,"Personally I don't care about athletics, so the absence of sports doesn't bother me, but somebody who does care about sports might not like the lack of teams here on campus. Some people play club sports, but from what I can tell nobody cares about these teams."
College Junior,2,There are no varsity sports on our campus and I wish there were.
College Sophomore,2,I believe we just have intramural sports so there's not a ton of school spirit or anything.
College Freshman,2,"almost non-existant, almost nothing going on most nights."
College Freshman,2,"very limited, almost nothing going on most nights."
College Freshman,2,As Brigham Young University Idaho is a satellite school they do not focus on the athletics. But they are always providing different clubs and intramural sports to get everyone involved.
College Student,2,The reason I rated this one so low is because BYU-I does not have a school team. I love athletics and would love to go watch a college game but I have to travel all the way to ISU and pay to get in. But the intramural are amazing! They do a great job with them.
College Sophomore,2,We don't have any official sports teams. We just have co-ed games that don't even last for the whole semester.
College Junior,2,It's way too expensive. There's no need whatsoever to pay for all the extra things to be added to housing.
College Freshman,2,"Well we do not have any collage level teams. It is made up for a lot of club sports and activities. So school spirit is defiantly not there, because we do not have anything to rally behind."
College Junior,2,There is no Greek life.
College Freshman,2,There really arent any greeks that i know same with fraternity and sorority.
College Junior,2,the school has cut several majors and programs without letting the students know and without any compensation or help.
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have any varsity sports here and don't compete against other schools, but everyone gets the chance to try out and play on a team if they want. It's good because anyone can be an athlete here, not just those who want to get rich off of it."
College Freshman,2,Sports...We have those at our school?
College Junior,2,I do not like cliques and am glad there is no greek life at BYU Idaho. My mom wants me to be a friend to everyone.
College Senior,2,"With the honor code, a lot of blame gets put on victims in cases of sexual assault. Needs reform"
College Sophomore,2,"I've known of a person getting kicked out for sexual orientation, even though they followed the honor code."
College Junior,2,"It's a small town, so there isn't much. There's pizza pie cafe, fast food, pizza places, and a few Chinese and Thai places."
College Freshman,2,"They are horrible at financial aid, and their scholarship system is really lame and biased. Basically, you're never going to get a scholarship through the school because they can't afford it."
College Sophomore,2,I am having a hard time getting aid even though I am having to pay for all my college expenses.
College Senior,2,"I think that the school needs to have groups like Football, Basketball team, so we can have more activities and invited our families to come and enjoy with us. BYU-I has a lot of students with talents."
College Sophomore,2,Transfer students getting a 4.0 to not be allowed to get scholarships until they have 30 credits at BYU- I?? Ridiculous
College Freshman,2,"It's really hard to find a good party around here. that being said, it can be tons of fun if you know how to be creative."
College Junior,2,"The food in the small town of Rexburg is not the best. We have Applebee's but that really the only sit-down and date night type restaurant around here. With having an entire college with only one restaurant to go to date night, it takes forever to get a table and the service and less than ideal."
College Junior,2,Rexburg is such a small town. College students make up a majority of the population. There isn't anything special about this town that I would stay for after graduating.
College Junior,2,"I don't live on campus, but from what I hear it's the worst place to live. The buildings are out of date, crowded, and don't have as many amenities as off campus housing."
College Senior,2,This school is VERY strict.
College Freshman,2,there are no buses for campus or the city because of size
College Freshman,2,parking is bad. costly and is hard to find. Pretty difficult
College Freshman,2,"I don't like it here. The events around campus are good but just outside it is dull. There aren't too many parties, there isn't too much to do (there is some), and worst of all, everything goes out of business after a few years it feels like."
College Freshman,2,Not like there aren't parties. But they are pretty mild. The worst that ever happens at a party that gets out of control is shorts shorts and grinding
College Sophomore,2,"There's a dollar cinema that's only $2.50 for a afternoon showing, $3 for night. There's stuff to do more on campus. Rent a court in the MC and play wally-ball. Tons of FHE activities, like roller skating, which is also on Saturdays. The ropes course. In the winter, sledding, ice skating, snowboarding, skiing, etc."
College Junior,2,"I don't really know of any parties going on outside of ""campus sponsored events"".  Usually the most interesting events, on  campus, are closely followed an attendance fee ranging anywhere from $2-$15.  I don't usually attend these events, so I cannot say if the price is worth the event."
College Junior,2,"I would say that the majority of the parties are in off-campus apartments and obviously void of alcohol and drugs, but full of mountain dew drinking games (why, I don't know) and kissing random people because that's what Mormons do for fun apparently. The lamest parties happen on campus. But let's be honest, they're all fairly lame."
College Junior,2,They are really strict with the honor code at BYU-I.  You break it and you are out; honor it and you will be fine.
College Junior,2,"There aren't really sports at BYU-I except for intermural sports, which are played by a lot of people."
College Sophomore,2,It is way too small of a town for me!
College Sophomore,2,Since Rexburg is such a small town the food is pretty bad. To get any good food you have to drive about 30 min to the next town.
College Senior,2,"There is a whole lot of nothing in Southeast Idaho, and Rexburg is right in the middle of that. Rexburg doesn't have a lot going for it, but there are some cool spots. A lot of the time you will only see other students, so there isn't a lot of interaction with the locals. Idaho Falls is about a 45 minute drive and there is more to do there, a lot more to do there. If you love the outdoors, you would be in heaven. Idaho has a lot to offer there, and BYU-I is pretty close to Yellowstone."
College Freshman,2,It is pretty strict and there is not that much to do unless you want to drive over a half hour to Idaho Falls. If you have a car and people help with gas it is tolerable if you do not have a car it kind of sucks.
College Freshman,2,"Our school does not have competitive sports, only intramurals and club sports. Our student body lacks heavily in school spirit, there is close to none. That is something I wish would change."
College Sophomore,2,"Basically, if you don't have a car, you live on campus. The college is the town, and the nearest city is Idaho Falls, half and hour away. The college itself isn't bad unless you enjoy traveling and scenery."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much to do around here. It is very small town with not much to do. I come from a big city with a lot to do and places to go. If you want to do anything you will have to drive to go and do it. There are a lot of outdoor activities... such as the dunes, ""R"" mountain, the caves (etc)."
College Sophomore,2,We do not have Greek life at BYU-I
Recent Alumnus,2,my family doesn't get a low enough income
College Senior,2,"My school bases their scholarships on who needs it the most and although they believe I do not need help, I am in desperate need to finish my final year of college."
College Senior,2,"I live in the middle of nowhere in Rexburg, Idaho and although I love my school, I would never live here after i graduate because it is very slow paced and not my style."
Niche User,1,"You're better off attending Utah Valley University if BYU Provo isn’t an option. Many students go to BYU-Idaho expecting it to be similar to Provo. The Honor Code is much more strict than any other BYU Campus. I had the worst roommates and the worst Bishop during my 2nd semester! They were constantly criticizing me for my lifestyle and the things I do. It drove me insane. As a member of the church still, I would never attend BYU-I again. I still believe in everything the church teaches but I don’t believe BYU-Idaho is a great place to be. Nobody understands you here whether it’s for your academics or your spiritual well-being. You’ll receive the least amount of support. Most people here are fake and make you think they’re trying to help you but in reality they’re against you. If you have no choice but to attend this college, I would recommend only going for your associates degree before transferring to a different University. BYU-Idaho is a joke"

Senior,1,Personally I do not like online classes and I just don't learn that way. I feel like it was just busy work. I get A's in all my online classes but I feel like I did not learn anything from them.
Graduate Student,1,"IF:
1. You are looking for 10 times a day prayer and spiritual singing
2. You want to emerge into the ""brainwashed"" community where everyone follows the rules of the terrifying  ""office X""
3. You are looking for a highly unprofessional academic advising and horrifically ""dull"" financial aid that would give you a grant and then would  take it back for no reasons
4. You are just tired of normal, refined and simply structural school

Then you've found a real treasure! BYU-I is your best choice among the worst. The #1 ranked as the most bizarre, governed by a bunch of brainwahsed students and faculty members educational institutions. Belive me-this place like no others."
Niche User,1,"I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED in BYU-Idaho. 
 
ONLY able to speak to students running the office when I call with a question or need information.

CHARGED for a course that was dropped AND told from the main office there would not be a charge because it was within the time limit. 

CHARGED for Mandatory BYU-I Health Insurance but nobody will give information on using the medical insurance. I call many times and never get help. I had to pay 100% medical expenses. BYU-I never provided a policy number/group number or anything. Doctor's offices complain nobody will answer the phone at BYU-I.  (Must be students lunch time)  

TRANSCRIPTS are withheld by BYU-I, until their Fake Health Insurance fee is paid.

My worse mistake thinking Brigham Young University–Idaho would be honest."
Freshman,1,"It's a very friendly school. However, the amount of homework is ridiculous. They are proud that they give out twice as much homework as other universities."
Alum,1,"Clean spiritual university. However, DON’T GO HERE. Academically, BUI-I is unorganized, VERY strict, & teachers are less knowledgeable. The lack of understanding extenuating circumstances and that rules sometimes need exceptions, screws MANY students who attend. Unwilling to work with students, too picky over little things, & instead of advocating for the students & helping them, they are inflexible & stick to the rule book, especially academically: substituting & retaking classes, changing majors, transferring, approving internships, sick, emergencies, etc. I recommend a University that stands behind their students more. Ironically, BYU in Utah is much more flexible- go to Utah before Idaho! Out of every experience I know of, I need to call out that their new nursing head ""Brother Sanders"" is a complete jerk to the students...he's an ex-military sergeant and treats the students horrible. Def don't do nursing there if he is still the nursing head."
College Senior,1,We don't have a greek life
College Senior,1,"There are no school sports, only intermural and even those have really strange rules."
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at this campus. I dont know what else to write.
College Junior,1,We do not have Greeks.
College Sophomore,1,Not a huge party-person but I've heard that parties are lame.
College Sophomore,1,"Parties, bars, clubs...? What are those?"
College Sophomore,1,Greek Life is non-existent at BYU-Idaho.
College Junior,1,Because they don't really have popular varsity spots. I was hesitant to even attend when I found out that they didn't have a varsity football team.
Recent Alumnus,1,No fraternity or sororities are on campus. This school doesn't participate.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have Greek life, so this part does not apply to this university."
College Student,1,"I am planning to take online courses, so this doesn't apply to me"
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life
College Freshman,1,We do not have greek-life on our campus. Which I actually really like. their isn't any separation between the students which helps our campus be more unified and focus on what is really important.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life here at BYU-Idaho.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have it so it isn't a big deal to me or anyone else.
College Sophomore,1,"BYU-Idaho offers classes, club sports, and gyms to play in, but sports are not a focus or concern with the higher ups. Academics and spirituality are the primary focuses."
College Freshman,1,We don't have any Greek life at out school.
College Student,1,We do not have Greek life here at BYU-Idaho. I do not think we need it.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life BYU-IDAHO
College Sophomore,1,We have no athletic programs that are on the variety level.. There is sports that you can join for fun so its not an actual event that everyone in the school knows about.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have one, but if we did, we wouldn't."
College Junior,1,"As far as I know, it's non-existent. I haven't heard of any sororities or fraternities on campus, and honestly I don't find that to be a bad thing. Depending on where you live, you will have roommates you can bond with and spend time with just like how you would with a sorority or fraternity. It's just less-formal."
College Freshman,1,There are no clubs or bars near campus.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have any fraternities or sororities here. I'm not even sure if we have any greeks here.
College Freshman,1,I don't think there is a greek life in Rexburg. Maybe though...
College Junior,1,We do notbhave sport now
College Senior,1,We do not have Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,This school does not have a Greek life. I don't think that it really matters to the school or students.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I come from a divorced family bad background and physical and learning barriers. When I go to school, I feel like everyone is looking down on me regardless of the greetings and compliments I give."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Transportation in particular is the worst, you have to be careful because of reckless driving. If you don't have a car like myself"
Recent Alumnus,1,My first semester on campus was more stressful than any year of schooling I ever had. I was a online student for my first year to get in to the school to prove I would be valuable to their student body.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have been trying to get some things done to move into the field of work. It costs money I don't have, I think that when your in a school you should have acesss to a school resources."
College Sophomore,1,"WE do not have greek life at our school; therefore, I have no opinión."
College Sophomore,1,"The intramuros are very popular, but there are no sports teams at the school."
College Junior,1,School does not have a Competitive program.
College Junior,1,We don't have fraternities or sororities.
College Senior,1,My school doesn't have an athletic program
College Sophomore,1,There is no greek life as far as I have heard of.
College Freshman,1,We don't have fraternities or sororities.
College Freshman,1,They don't have any idea what they're doing.
College Junior,1,"BYU-Idaho is very strict on where the students are allowed to live. Off campus housing has to be approved by the school or you can't live there. Your address is linked to your student account that is verified by the management of your complex and if your information doesn't add up, you get blocked from registering! The unapproved housing is so much cheaper, but as a student you are forced to live within the approved housing places which jack up the prices because they know that you can't go anywhere else."
College Junior,1,The Greek Life does not exist at this school.
College Freshman,1,"I hate off-campus. The best food is only OK. There are a few restaurants that I like off-campus but they are chains. Non-chains are almost always bad (or there okay but you can find better elsewhere). I hate sammy's. I hate New Fongs. Da Pineapple Grill is OK. New York Burrito is OK. The point is, every non-chain is at best, OK."
College Freshman,1,There are no varsity sports. Only intramural. We all pay attention to BYU Provo instead. I think they got rid of varsity sports to decrease rivalry between us and BYU provo
College Sophomore,1,"There is no Greek housing on or off campus. Kind of like beards, they just aren't allowed."
College Junior,1,"Painfully remote is the perfect way to describe Rexburg. There is literally nothing to do except go to FatCats to see a movie or bowl. The next main city (Idaho Falls) is 30 minutes away in a car, and there's very little to do there as well. The best thing to be if you go to BYUI is an outdoorsman, but even then you have to travel far and wide."
College Senior,1,"There are not any Greek societies, at least that I am aware of, here on campus."
College Junior,1,"We don't have the Greek societies at our school, so it would be non-existent."
College Sophomore,1,"They base your financial aid off of your parents income, but the only problem is my parents do not pay for my school, i do!"
College Senior,1,"BYU-I does not have professional sports, so that whole culture is lacking from the school. So school spirit isn't really a thing here. BYU-I does have intramural which are popular but don't have a huge following."
College Senior,1,"Rexburg is a very small town. You have Applebee's, Wingers, and Costa Vida and Pizza Pie Cafe as you're dine in options."
College Senior,1,Campus dining has always been a bad joke on campus. Food is pretty gross but it is the only option when you're stuck on campus all day.

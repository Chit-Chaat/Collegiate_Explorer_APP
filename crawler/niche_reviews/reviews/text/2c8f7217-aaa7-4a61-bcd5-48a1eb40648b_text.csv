Sophomore,5,Everybody is easy to approach and just overall friendly. Big campus but very easy to navigate through.
Sophomore,5,Very easy and clear instructions. If you need any help or don't understand what to do email the professor and they will be more than happy to help.
Sophomore,5,SC State has always been a school of excellence. I’ve learned so much from just being on campus and I’m just grateful
Freshman,5,The school and it administration officials are determined to support and help students not only to gain knowledge and obtain a degree but also to develop and become a better persons.
Alum,5,"I absolutely love my Alma Mater!  There is a strong sense of family around the campus.  Even after you graduate, you will always find someone you know from the bulldog family in your area.  I can say that the professors genuinely care about your education and success as a student, as well as your future.  You will find that you are more just “a student number” at this wonderful institution of higher learning."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at South Carolina State has been nothing short of great ! I enjoy being a bulldog , and representing my school to the best of my ability on and off campus.  As soon as I got to State I met so many great people , people who are family to me now . Soon as I got to State I decided to get involved , I didn’t know what I wanted to do but I knew I wanted to be a leader . I decided to run for Miss Freshman . I’m glad I did . I won ! Being Miss Freshman the past year at such a great university has taught me so much . I’ve gotten better at public speaking , at being my self , learning how to be more confident. I hope that you consider me for this great scholarship."
Sophomore,5,i love my hbcu it’s has its flaws but what college does but overall it’s what you make it the friends you keep the work you do. how you get involved on campus
Niche User,5,"What I personally liked about South Carolina State University was its hospitality. Being there just felt like I was at home with just a couple of different faces. When I visited the Biology department, you can tell that they are a family. No student is left behind and the professor knows you by name instead of by a student number. The staff works very hard to make sure that you become the person that you aspire to be. Yes, the school isn't one of the biggest, but they are very strong academically."
Freshman,5,I am currently a SC State Freshman. Adjusting to a new environment is pretty hard but overall I like HBCU. I am majoring in Business Accounting and SC State has the best Business program. SC State had many outstanding organizations/activities/sports to choose from. I have joined SC State Bulldogs ROTC. This is a challenging program but also an amazing program. SC State have many fun events its never a dull moment here. I truly look forward to graduate as an SC State Bulldog.
Alum,5,"Honestly , I enjoyed SCSU. I think it prepared me for the real world. The professors are qualified and the work is challenging. I think the school get a bad rep because of the location and the fact that its an HBCU. With all that being said, If you think you can just show up and SCSU will give you a degree , you are sadly mistaken your going to have to work for it."
Junior,5,Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!Overall great!
Junior,5,"Overall great!
Being an international student-athlete, i really like it here. I am in a tennis team and we won MEAC last year. Professors are really friendly and will always help you. A lot of majors, so you choose!"
Freshman,5,"I feel as though South Carolina State is a wonderful school, its like a place to call home. You have welcoming administrators"
Sophomore,5,SCSU is great school. Being on campus is like being surrounded by family. It's your home away from home.
Sophomore,5,"I love this HBCU, i wouldn’t trade this experience for anything in the world ! I appreciate every memory and moment at this institution !"
Sophomore,5,I love the family Enviroment. Of course the fact that it is a Historically black college. The classes are easy to handle as long as you are keeping up.
Niche User,5,"I applied. The people are nice, friendly. Waiting to hear back from financial aid. I had to submit parent’s financial information. Located in the South so I like that. Great people at the college tours. I like what they have to offer. I believe would be a good experience."
Senior,5,"Throughout my tenure here at the the illustrious South Carolina State University, many opportunities have been bestowed upon me. It is because of the many people around me at this school that I have been able to connect and network with others in my career field. This allows me to reach out and obtain more knowledge on my career choice and brings me closer to acquiring internships and jobs. The love for one another and everyone around the campus thrives and shows in many ways. Groups and organizations give back tremendously to our community, for example, by giving out clothing and food to the less fortunate. They also tutor young children within our community and work with the elderly in any way they can. South Carolina State prides itself on the history behind the school and preserves every fact of history possible with the upmost respect. As I have gone through my academic journey, this university has taught me how to become an adult and prepared me for the world that waits for me."
Freshman,5,I love this place ! The students are kind and the professors are really helpful. It’s impossible to be bored because a lot of activities on campus.
Junior,5,Great university! I’m in women’s tennis team and i love it here. The professors want to help you whenever needed.
Sophomore,5,South Carolina State University is a historical HBCU that I'm proud to  attend and call my school South Carolina State is where I call home the staff on campus is welcoming to all where ever you go there's a smile on people face the school help their students succeed in life pushes you to farther your education they have a lot of programs to choice from along with a lot of internships that helps you with future jobs colleges.
Freshman,5,My overall experience here at the magnificent South Carolina State University was and is still amazing. When I came here last semester as a shy freshman I felt a sincere welcome from the upperclassman and the staff all throughout the University. Being at South Carolina State University made me literally feel like this was my other home away from home. I'm thankful that I decided to further my education here at South Carolina State University.
Junior,5,"My experience at SCSU has been amazing. I’ve learned so many things while being at the school with wonderful, helpful, and caring professors."
Senior,5,"Love the HBCU atmosphere...........................................………
Great athletics 
Great academics"
Sophomore,5,"Once I step foot onto South Carolina State University campus, I knew then and there it was the right college for me! The professors take their time out to assist you with any work and student activities are amazing! It is always something going on around campus. You’re never bored, lots of entertainment, new people, and new environment. I love State! It’s an outstanding school and I would love to be an Alumni of this University!"
Sophomore,5,"I love attending SC State. The atmosphere is very much like home, but academics and safety are certainly at the forefront of the campuses focus. With the various things to do on campus, it doesn’t seem like there’s much to do off campus. Though that may seem unattractive to some, I think it allows the students to be closer knit with one another and forced us to make connections with people outside of our majors and graduating class. SCSU is the place to be, and with over 30 successfully maintained majors, it can be for anyone that would want to become a Bulldog!"
Sophomore,5,South Carolina State University has a great family environment. I enjoy everything about this school. The only complaint I have is the Gym is not always open to students.
Junior,5,I honestly love my HBCU. The staff there makes you feel like you're a child of their own. The whole school feels like a family away from home and it's such a good feeling for those who get home sick. I promise you will love it and never look back.
Freshman,5,"My experience here at South Carolina State so far has been good, classes is good the professors is cool and good helpful teachers. Campus life and school spirit is good and energetic. I’ve met so many people that live in so many different places, I’ve even met people that live in Charleston, SC with me I just didn’t know them till now. I’ve built so many good relationships here. I like the fact that South Carolina State give you a chance to come an education even if you don’t meet some requirements like for example I didn’t have the act score that they asked for, but they saw my GPA and they let me in. They expect everybody for who they are they don’t judge people."
Freshman,5,GREAT change food they service cann Tovar lenient at times needn’t need to get noce workers not be close be closeibg cafe so eaely I like how teachers give more access to grades and allow not make up work give multiples chance so we can Ben best abilities
Sophomore,5,SC State University offers the perfect environment and atmosphere to learn and excell all while enjoying the fun student life.
Senior,5,"South Carolina State University is  a environment rich with scholastics, diversity, and community based morals. Before becoming a student, I encountered the excitement of a football game at this historically black college. Students, alumnus, and even parents were all there with the same positive energy and enthusiasm. After becoming a student, I was able to fully experience what the university has to offer. The staff and administration work tirelessly to ensure the wellbeing of all their students academically, professionally and even emotionally. The curriculum and field based experiences are all set to better aid students in beginning, continuing, or changing their career.  Resources that are offered, such as the career center, help in this process as well. South Carolina State University is definitely a university I would recommend to any student no matter what background they come from."
Senior,5,"The cultural experience you will have at South Carolina State University is phenomenal! It’s full of opportunities, diversity, & success, you just have to go out and seek it!"
Freshman,5,My experience here is great. This the th best schoolto be for anybody that wants to further their education. It’s a lot of opportunities that you can have just by coming here and meeting all types of good people.
Freshman,5,Being involved on campus and making friends in school can make the transition from high school to college a lot smoother. One piece of advice is to use your free time wisely.
Freshman,5,"Since I've been a student at SC State my experience has been great I've met a lot of new people and have made many new friends I'm comfortable in my schools environment, and feel very welcomed. What I would like to see change though is the schools spirit I want it to be more fun like it was the past two years ago."
Freshman,5,"South Carolina State University is one of the best HBCU’s to attend! The people are great ! The food is good ! The professors are wonderful , however i would change the security system."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at SCSU is going great so far, classes are excellent. Working hard at this school will definitely pay off . You  Get to know people, have fun, and get your work done all at the same time . One thing that I would love to see is a change in food, or to open new dorms /close the old ones and clean!!!!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the fact you can come to South Carolina State University and feel apart of the family. I also love the way people make you feel welcomed. Also, I love how the teachers and staff care about the students. I love the fact I can have fun and learn during the day. I love Sc State university and I love being a bulldog."
Freshman,5,"The things I like about South Carolina State University is the social and learning environment.  However, I do not like how unorganized it is when it comes to events."
Alum,5,"Great school.  Professors are excellent and experienced in their prospective fields. Campus as a whole is kept clean, manicured with excellent green space."
Freshman,5,So far so great! I have t had an bad experience yet and I'm not looking for any. Our SOLS are nice and everyone is very helpful.
Freshman,5,"Growing up in a small town with little to do ,one have a tendency to  dream through the eye of their older role models. It was never a vision to choose SCSU and become an educator, however  seeing the enjoyment desire and the love through the eyes of my brother prepared me come to terms that this as well has been my hopes and dreams.    My journey now is to make sure that SCSU would be the another chapter of my life dream that will become a reality. I  know now that there is  no other university that can prepare me more for future endeavors. It is now up to me to reach my goals, display and embrace my interest ,enjoy my hobbies during  what will be amazing years at SCSU"
Senior,5,"I love South Carolina state university so much ! This school was a very great experience, and I lovr my professors even more for pushing me to become a better student and person ! Go bulldogs !!!"
Freshman,5,very lovely staff. They are very humble and motivated. They make wanna experience college life in the fall of 2017.
Junior,5,"South Carolina state University is a great school, on my visit it felt very family oriented. The student leaders were a great help and the campus is beautiful. There were golf carts for those who needed it, the university offered water and snacks for us while we were given a tour. This is a great campus overall."
Junior,5,"SCSU is a home away from home. It's become my second family. The professors, administrators, and sercuity all become your family once you step foot on campus. They take you in and make you feel at home. Most professors become more then just your professor they become a mother or father figure in your life. My decision to become a member of the SC State family was one of the best decisions I could have made, I wish I would have made the decision earlier."
Senior,5,"I absolutely love it. HBCU experience is definitely one of a kind. College in general is what you make it, and if you take advantage of the opportunities available then you won't regret it. I've been able to build strong relationships with my professors. The attention I needed, I always got because I was consistent in their offices making sure I stayed on top of my curriculum in each of my classes"
Freshman,5,"My freshman year I found out that attending a college was so much bigger than what I originally thought. 
     Not only does attending college get you one step closer to being qualified for a career of your dreams, but college also allows you to have fun while you work hard. Now, going to college can be fun because you get to meet new people who have the same interests as you. Having professors that care about you and want to see you excel inside and outside the classroom. You could even take an array of classes that peak your interest and meet your wildest desires, of course all along with work hard towards that degree in the end which will help you ensure a job after you graduate. Therefore going to college is not only seen as a fun place but as a place that teaches any individual responsibility and independence."
College Freshman,5,"My teaches do a great job with enter acting with students even though the class sizes may be a little large. I walkways feel like I'm obligated to participate in class, and I am always engaged in the learning."
College Freshman,5,Graduating is the most important thing here. Everyone that I have spoken to encourages great ways to make sure you graduate on time and also make the experience easier. Many organizations here at school are designed to push us into internships and better equipt us for life past college.
College Senior,5,"Greek life is huge here on campus! It is one of the things that make an HBCU an HBCU. Everyone is still viewed as equals so need to worry for ""non-Greeks."""
College Sophomore,5,Athletics at SC State aren't bad everyone supports.
College Freshman,5,"The Athletics is a really good winning program. they won many championships, drafted many players to the NFL, had Hall of Famers Coming from that school. That's why I will be playing for the South Carolina State Bulldogs this Fall in Football"
College Freshman,5,"South Carolina State University is the best university I've ever been to. the Campus is beautiful, the teachers and staffs are outstanding and very hands-on to get the Job done. I like South Carolina State because it's so much potential and peace when I'm on campus, it's like I been there my entire life, because I never been to a place where I can show off my skills, but also progress to know better things dealing with my Major. If I could ever start over again, this will definitely be the school for me, because I know I will be able to do extraordinary things at this school"
College Sophomore,5,Athletics at my school  has a ban fan base and support system. Our school spirit for our basketball games and football games are nearly soled out. SCSU school spirit is out of this world. My HBCU maintains a high standard for our atheltic division .
College Freshman,5,There are cops on campus 24/7 always on the look out
College Freshman,5,The class are a fair size of people and the classes are really easy
College Freshman,5,Its pretty easy to meet people on campus and the dorms are pretty cool
College Freshman,5,The greeks are always performing at the school and they give back to  the community all the time
Junior,4,"My online experience was honestly much easier because I was able to actually take my time with everything, study more , and actually understand the assignments."
Junior,4,"My experience was good , I enjoyed the parties and activities the camp holds. The campus is not all that bad it’s a nice scenery and it’s always taken care of. The dorms makes you feel like home and it’s very private."
Freshman,4,Definitely wasn’t completely smooth transition at the beginning but with the help of teachers and the school administration who were organized it became a success.
Senior,4,I would recommend South Carolina State University. The school has a great Army ROTC and band program. The campus is a small close community and the class sizes allow for student to be able to reach their professors.
Freshman,4,South Carolina State University really opened my eyes up to the grand thing about college and I am glad that I have another 3 years to experience the comradery and love.
Freshman,4,"Ultimately, I actually love South Carolina State University. I’m a freshman, majoring in criminal justice. So far I can say I enjoyed myself, the semester just ended so I’m hoping I can go back next semester. College life there is fun. There’s a lot of organizations and activities you can get involved in. The parties are fun but of course academics comes first. Overall I loved my professors that I had they showed me how college really is. Being at SCSU u will want to come back especially for HOMECOMING. That whole week is filled wit parties and fun organizations! Housing/dorms are okay, it’s decent because it’s a good portion size for 2 roommates well only for the one I stayed in. Football/basketball games are also fun, free admission for students are great so that’s also something I enjoyed while I was there I definitely hope to go back next semester."
Junior,4,"The one thing I can say that I enjoyed most while my matriculation here at SC State, would be the sense of family. Upon moving to South Carolina I knew absolutely  no one in the entire State. Once I started school everyone opened their arms instantly. Professors talked to you about the real world, they genuinely care about our futures and our present lives. The staff there are always there to help, they always have the schools best interest at heart. This tenure has been one of the most fulfilling and rewarding things I have experienced in my life, and if anyone asked me where they should attend school, South Caroline State University will forever be my first suggestion."
Freshman,4,"I've only been here for about a week and a half, but I can easily tell that the professors and instructors are really dedicated to giving proper information. The students are very fun and welcoming also."
Sophomore,4,My experience at my HBCU was honestly one of the best experience of my life. I got the chance and opinion to learn more on my culture and also had the chance to meet different individuals from all over. The classes were easy and the professors were helpful in every way possible and they were every flexible with their office hours. The campus itself gives off the great home atmosphere and the staff really treat you as one big family who wants nothing but success from you.
Sophomore,4,"I'm a current student at SC State University and I thoroughly enjoy my matriculation since being here. I am a 3rd generation college student in my family and a second-generation student of SC State University. My professors are helpful, I'm involved in many campus activities and the atmosphere is very inviting."
Sophomore,4,"Transferring to South Carolina State University was a very easy process. They have a great administration system and there finicial aid counselors are very easy to communicate with . When I took the tour of the school it was a very nice community and the people there where very friendly , I really did enjoy the tour guide and all his recommendations towards my education."
Sophomore,4,"I loved the environment of an HBCU, seeing my kind and others who aren’t the same color as me integrated in a school together is a wonderful sight to see. There’s great people that go here, the teachers and staff and nice people and the school itself is fun to be at!"
Freshman,4,The school is great and wouldn't be glad to be anywhere else. From the beginning from just applying and dealing with the patient admissions and financial aid staff the University shows its hospitality through those here to guide us.
Sophomore,4,I like the school as a whole only because it is where it can feel like a family. But i do not like the fact that there is no accommodations for single moms/dads. Dorms for example or professors who have understanding about situations that may come up regarding children.
Sophomore,4,I’m a sophomore here at South Carolina State University and I enjoy being here. Everything I expected to be my dream college.  I wouldn’t change anything about this college because I think everything is perfect.
Junior,4,"i feel as though my academic professors really do lookout for my best interests, and help me when I am in need. Student life is amazing and there are so many students that are active in the politics that our school intels. There are an endless amount of student organziations that one can join."
Junior,4,"My experience here at South Carolina State University  has been a great one. SCSU is a very historic school and the history seen all through out campus. SCSU is a very proud school; you can't come to Orangeburg SC and not fell the Bulldog pride. Us students might complain about a lot of things; such as the lack of excitement on campus, the parking tickets, and the lack of food choices on campus but this is still home."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about South Carolina State University is that it is an HBCU. What I also like about it is that we don’t have very large classes. Having a smaller classroom setting helps many be able to interact more with others and the professors. Some professors work very well with students if help is needed. Something I would like to see change is how certain professors choose to grade their students. For example, this Spanish class I am currently taking. I understand her goal is to try to get us fluent and to be sure that we are actually learning it. I don’t feel as if we should get a question wrong on a test or quiz if it is spelled wrong but close enough to the actual word. I also feel as if they need to improve on their food. However, the main thing I feel they need to work on is the parking situation. There are more student drivers than staff drivers.  The staff has more parking than the student drivers making many have to walk a long distance due to limited parking spaces."
Junior,4,At first I really didn’t like this school but I came to love it as I got to know more about the school.
Niche User,4,I visited this campus i fell in love with the campus it is very nice and neat the scholars are amazing!
Freshman,4,"I believe that south Carolina state university has given me a great experience so far. The school has a lot of clubs and organizations going on throughout the year, and always have activities going on. Their dorms are perfect for incoming freshman and they had a lot of people helping out. And being that sc state university is an HBCU they always have programs going on to help students excel and further themselves in their field of study."
Freshman,4,I love the fact that South Carolina State is a HBCU because I’ve always wanted to experience what one was like since college became a option to me. SCSU may not be the most diverse nor most fancy but the vibe is not like no other. This may not be the school I’ll be graduating from but I would not change my decision about starting my journey as a college student. I don’t think there is one thing I would change about the school not even the run down dorms. Everything about my school is authentic and I love my HBCU!
Sophomore,4,"I loved the overall experience of the school, the homey feeling and all. Though there are some negative like how slow and lackadaisical Financial Aid department."
Sophomore,4,"My current experience attending South Carolina State University is a blast. There can be a lot to be change but as long as SCSU is up and standing, I’ll always love my HBCU. GO BULLDOGS!!!"
Junior,4,"I really did enjoy my first year at this university. The thing is that you have to have a group of friends that will make your time here fun. Yes, Orangeburg doesn't have much to do, but that's where your friends come in at.  Y'all can get together and do work and then take a break and have fun. They do focus a lot on your education so, stay focused and don't lose track especially during homecoming.  Many people won't tell you, but it is up to you on whether you will get the best or worst college experience. I enjoyed both years here, and my junior year will be nothing short of amazing."
Niche User,4,"Based on my experiences at SCSU, i feel as if this is a great college and it is very welcoming to freshmen. I feel like they can change the way the space is on campus because it can seem very cluttered at times. Otherwise, it is a very good school and when i go to college i plan on enrolling into the ROTC Program. As i know, the college has one of the best ROTC Programs in SC. Therefore, SCSU is a great college."
Junior,4,"While attending South Carolina State University I have had very little bad experiences. As far as academics, SCSU has proven they have one of the top Criminal Justice Programs. The staff here are always welcoming and willing to help with anything. SC State curriculum requires us to participate in internships (field experience) before graduating that often lead to good careers."
Freshman,4,This is a great campus and its very easy to meet new people and make friends. SCSU also has areas on campus where students can relax and have fun. However it is easy to become sidetracked on campus as there is always a party going on somewhere. It is best to come here with a mindset that you wont party until your work is done. Other than that i can say i really like it here. Its a beautiful HBCU with alot of historical value.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, South Carolina State University  is a very great school. The only things that could be better, would be the officers at the front gates. If they were to have more sports for the guys there it could be better. The young ladies have many more options to be active and it makes the young men on campus feel limited to what they can participate in. The academic curriculum has a lot to offer. I appreciate the student teacher ratio where I can go to my classes and my professors actually know my name. I'm not just a number, I matter."
Junior,4,"I love Sc State University, because of its rich tradition, and history which  the university is known for. Today there are nearly 5000 students majoring in a wide range of programs that include agribusiness, accounting, art, English, and drama as well as fashion merchandising, physics, psychology, and political science. As well as the family atmosphere the people at Sc State has to offer, anyone who decide to come here to enrolled in school, or to become an employee here will definitely enjoy nice caring people that is apart of the bulldog family."
Junior,4,"Updated campus and buildings to be cleaned daily! Not just the new building but the old buildings as well! There should be no reason to see roaches daily and if somebody kills one, on a Wednesday, when we come back it’s still lying dead in the classroom that following Monday!!"
Junior,4,"As I write this paragraph, this is my third year at South Carolina State University. My overall experience has been great.  For example, I love the down-to-earth feeling that I get when I'm here. It feels as though I'm at home even though I'm miles away. Over the past year and a half i lost both my mother and my older brother. SC state showed me nothing but gratitude and support during this difficult time. If I'm honestly speaking, I would have to say I don't have any complaints about my institution. I love my wonderful university. I would even like to see my younger family members attend SCSU."
Senior,4,"I love the cultural experience I received from attending an HBCU. However, I would like to see more diversity. My school offers many programs to help the students learn academically and grow as individuals. I feel more prepared to go into professional school because of the learning environment provided."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see the financial aid department be more helpful for the students . For the most part the teachers are wonderful. The school is very peaceful and there are lots of wonderful people who attend and work there
Senior,4,South Carolina State University has that nurturing atmosphere. Most of the students on campus are friendly and try to help each other out. Most of the staff such as the professors are very helpful when it comes to assisting students. Everything on campus is in walking distance thats not too far. The only changes I would like to see on campus is more parking spaces for students near class buildings.
Freshman,4,"My experience at South Carolina State University has been a little more than expected. When I was a senior in High School, I honestly didn't have my eyes on South Carolina State until the second semester. I thought I made my college choice well before graduation creeped up on me and South Carolina State was really my last choice. However, after experiencing my first semester at South Carolina State, I can honestly say that if I had to make a choice while having the prior knowledge about SC State this would have been my first choice. Since day one, the people I encountered has made my transition to college from high school a whole lot easy. I've been guided from the students, the administration, and all the way to my professors in the right path. The people at this institution proves that the youth of this generation will do great things."
Freshman,4,"South Carolina State University I must say is a school that has a lot of school spirit. Its one university that has welcomed me with open arms, love and unity. They have multiple programs and organizations for students to get into the time they are attending the college. It is quit Satisfying."
Niche User,4,"I started at the University in 2006, and absolutely loved it. The only thing I would change is the easy access to anyone being able to get on campus."
Freshman,4,I like that it is an HBCU and the environment on the campus. the students are very friendly and nice. the classes are a good size. the teachers are willing to help you with what ever you need help or struggling on a subject. you have free tutors if you need it. you have campus activities all the time. There are plenty parties that goes on campus and off. I don't really like the food that they have to serve.
Freshman,4,i like south carolina state university because they take the time to show you the school and where everything is located and how to get from place to place.
Freshman,4,"My experience at South Carolina State University has been great so far. What I really like about the University is the great opportunities that the school has to offer for my major. I also found that university did a great job having the upper class men teach us under class men about what we would experience during the school year. The only thing I dislike about the university is that freshman are not allowed to have a car, the reason for my dislike is that the area the university is located is not really close to any stores in the area."
Junior,4,"I love South Carolina State University.  However, there could be a little improvement. But all in all this is going to be my Alma Mata. "
College Freshman,4,"I have not ran into an issue on campus with any sexual assualts , but I'm sure it's important. Many of the housing assistants and teachers warn us about underage drinking drinking and such activities that may result in sexual assault."
College Freshman,4,"Even though I am hours away from Atlanta , I feel at home! I was surprised of this because this is definitely a smaller city with less access to things I have back home. My roommate is awsome, and so are my suit mates. We have very funny hall meetings , that are just as much fun as they are important."
College Freshman,4,"I am not yet ellegible to apply to be in a sorority, but based on word around campus most of them have high standards. there is talk of how they participate in many community activies, and of course how amazing it is to be apart of a brotherhood or sisterhood."
College Freshman,4,"My teachers waited for students to have books to teach heavy material. By them doing so I noticed that our success in the class meant something to them. Everyday I come to class my teacher remember what she taught us , then does a quick review to make sure we remember the information and continued to teach a new lesson. because of this and it's alone I am passing all my classes without a single text book!"
College Freshman,4,"Housing is good, good walking distance from university"
College Freshman,4,The teachers are willing to help
College Senior,4,"The biggest part of sports here on campus is the football games. It is not only the football team that make it a great time, it's the Marching 101 Band, cheerleaders, crowd and fan reaction that makes the game unforgettable."
College Senior,4,"I've had an awesome experience here so far.I wasn't so sure my freshmen year, but I am glad I stuck it out, stayed and continued my education at one of the best HBCU's in the nation."
College Sophomore,4,The greek life on our campus is pretty outgoing and involved with the students a our school. Nobody is left out.
College Sophomore,4,My experience at SC State was great I loved it there.
College Junior,4,The Greek life is great on our campus. They support many community functions.
College Sophomore,4,"Alot of my friends are apart of greek life, but they never pressure me to join there organizations."
College Sophomore,4,sc state athletis is one of the best in the country when it comes to division 1-AA. Sc State is apart of the MEAC  conference and has won over 16 conferance titles in football.
College Sophomore,4,"I love South Carolina Stae University, because it have a rich traditon and the history of the school is really interesting."
College Freshman,4,"The student involvement is great especially when you get into conference play.Football and track teams perform the best out of all the sports, but others are on the rise. It's great to see the alumni support and the spirit that they bring during the games."
College Sophomore,4,I lived on off campus housing and it was decent great staff. It's convenient to class especially if you have a car. The apartments could use some upgrading. The dorms I've seen or good sizing and the bathrooms or located inside not down the hall which is a plus. The housing process was not difficult at all for me. The cost a little more than inspected but the social atmosphere is great.
College Sophomore,4,We have a lot of student involvement as was a great fan support.  The overall team performance is strong with great school spirit.
College Sophomore,4,My overall all experience this far as been wonderful. I have met some great staff and who are resourceful and available when needed.
Freshman,2,Registration have very nonchalant attitudes. Nobody never picks up the phone when you need help with something it could be  about the sutdents. Professor always canceling classes.
Freshman,2,Being at South Carolina State for my first semester was great. There is a big campus and many majors. My major is biology and it's quite hard but the teachers there help you a little on anything you need help with.
College Junior,2,Drug use and alcoholism I believe is at every college and university because that is what some college students partake in especially those who are underage drinkers. That is a big issue today and should be taken more seriously and more repercussions for it. It is very easy to get it and is seen everywhere which is not good because that gives the impression that it is ok to use. A lot of students are pressured because they want ti fit in and have friends that they feel are cool since they are doing it with them.
College Sophomore,2,"every body smokes and gets high at my school . thats the norm. everybody drunks at my school thats the norm. theres no peer pressure besides the people who call you scarey if you dont but nobody forces a drink uo to your lips. policy is enforced if ur not 21 and up u get in trouble,"
College Freshman,2,There has been a few opportunities granted by this school to different students.
College Senior,2,Never there when you need them but quick to kick people out.
College Freshman,2,They don't care about us.
College Sophomore,2,if you don't have a car you should get one because orangeburg doesn't have a good shopping center you're better off gong to Columbia.
College Freshman,2,I could never get a straight answer about scholarships and the availability of other funds
College Freshman,2,You generally have to go to Columbia for nightlife
College Freshman,2,No real transit options in Orangeburg
College Sophomore,2,There really aren't many options unless you go off campus in which case you cant use your meal plans 
College Sophomore,2,Teams are subpar and student support is even more so
College Student,2,I could get it but I do not want to take out a loan.
College Student,2,A car is really necessary to go into town.  If I need something from Walmart or a local store I have to find a ride to get me there.
College Junior,2,There is nothing really in the town (Orangeburg0) that my school is located to discuss.  
Recent Alumnus,2,"The drug scene of course is going to be very hidden because you can't just walk around campus smoking illegal drugs so they sometimes smoke in their rooms, off campus, or do things at night. i don't think that there is a lot of peer pressure I feel as though everything you do is a choice but the usage of drugs on campus I feel maybe slightly low not too high"
College Freshman,2,The weather affects my campus experience because it will rain one minute and by sunny the next. This causes me to change clothes very often. Another way the weather affects my campus experience is because when the campus board have things planned it may go through by the changes are very slim.
College Senior,2,It is always a struggle but I have gotten money. The people could be nicer. 
College Freshman,2,The weather here at South Carolina State University is very unpredictable it says one thing and then It does another.
College Senior,2,Sometimes I do not feel as safe on campus because it is an open campus. My freshman year I would be hesitant to walk on campus around night time because anybody is allowed to enter the campus. Other than that I enjoy the campus when I am on there.
College Sophomore,2,"We don't get discounts from dining places. The cost are reasonable for college students , it's not two expensive. We are mostly surrounded by fast food restaurants such as McDonalds and Cookout. They are really convent because yet aren't even ten minutes away from the school. The variety is that big , you get tired of eating the same thing over and over.  But one of the best places to check out is ""Cookout."""
College Sophomore,2,The Freshman dorms at SCSU aren't great but once you are a upperclassman you have better housing to choose from. Being a Freshman you dont have many options. The best option for Freshman dorms would be Williams Hall which is for girls and Battiste Hall is a Co-ed dorm. Truth Hall is where I dormed as a Freshman and my experience was horrible. Alot of the building at SCSU are older.
College Senior,2,"The weather is terrible, when its hot its too hot humid and dry. when it rains it pours, literally."
College Freshman,2,Greek Life at SCSU is alright ! They are not as live as they should be but parties are pretty good!
College Freshman,2,"They are not strict at all , mostly on who comes on and off campus ."
College Senior,2,"There are three levels of dress. About half the population are trying hard to fit the look (guys - cool, hanging pants, oversized shirts, etc.; girls - ready for the next party even at 8 am). A quarter (maybe more) seem to have the average expected decent college student look, and the remaining quarter (maybe less) dress very professionally constantly. This may be because of majoring in business, or some other requirement sometimes, but there is a decent enough number."
College Sophomore,2,"It is very tough.  It's hard to understand. A full scholarship is not a  3.0, but a 3.5"
College Freshman,2,Its not too bad you just have to be smart and safe with what you do
College Junior,2,The area is a quiet place with little or no recreation centers
College Senior,2,This school doesn't have as many majors as many other schools but the ones that we have are some of the best in the state.
College Freshman,2,The weather is weird. In Orangeburg it rains all of the time and the temperture changes a lot.
College Junior,2,There is a small amount of diversity at SC State. Being that it is an HBCU you will see most African Americans.
College Senior,2,Not Safe – It takes the campus security too long to respond!!!
College Sophomore,2,"Just C for Yourself – The school is going through a lot right now. The nursing program is being dropped, other majors and being cut, and things are very sticky. A lot of the teachers are really hard and foreign or really easy and don't require a lot of work. Getting in to the school is easy, and wanting to leave is the same. The people that should help you, usually provide you with false information. If you want questions answered you sometimes need to go to graduate students to get help because a lot of the staff their are all on different pages. If you just want a four year experience, a lower in-state tuition and the ability to say we have the best marching 101 band in the land, then come to SCSU. If you come here for a better education, you may be disappointed."
College Freshman,2,"We Need More – We need the buses to take us to more places. For example, if you have a project and you need to go to Walmart or Dollar General, you cannot take the bus because they don't go that far. You would need to catch a ride with a friend. If the buses could take us to stores like those then the students wouldn't have a problem with it."
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus is a hassle throughout the day and throughout the campus.  Both students and faculty pay for decals to be on the car and ever with those you can easily get ticketed or towed if you don't know the parking regulations.  There aren't nearly enough parking spaces for students at the dorms and at night if you move your car, chances are you will end up parking across campus at another dorm when you get back.  If you do end up parking on the sides you must ensure you move your car before 8 a.m. the next morning because Parking enforcement will be out and lurking.  In Hugine Suites we have 4 different parking lots, one of them holds nothing but handicapped parks and its okay to park in but if you park in handicapped parking in the rest of them, you will get towed and ticketed.  I've even seen visitors with tickets on their cars because it was said that they are supposed to have visitors passes but we have 5 gates and if a visitor doesn't come through the main gate, how are they to know they are to get a visitors pass?"
College Junior,2,"The weather is wonderful sometime because Orangeburg we have it days when it can be cool or warm, rain."
College Junior,2,The food we have at South Carolina State University it very good because most of our student can go to different eating place that is on our campus. The most place that we go to is Washington dining hall that we go too. they have the best food to eat
College Sophomore,2,"Punishment Is a NECESSITY – The campus police do not play when it comes down to breaking campus rules. If you mess up, you will have consequences. You may either get a ticket or be put on campus probation."
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly Black but Some Other Races – SC state is a black school however, some other minorities or races attend the school and also get scholarships for attending the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,Having Your Own Car Is an Wise Option. There is very limited public transportation options and to avoid the hassle it would be wise to drive your own car there.
College Freshman,2,"South Carolina State University's Nursing program is said to have one of the best Nursing programs, but is so unorganized. They change the curriculum numerous amoutns of time. They have limited staff and aren't always available during office hours. The school is great as long as your not coming for nursing or be ready for the hassle."
College Freshman,2,"The Diversity on this campus is average. Mainly because this an historically black college, however, you will still find diversity among the athletic department."
College Freshman,2,Not What It Should – They are very lenient with the rules.  Students break visitation rules religiously.  The campus tends to do the bare minimum.  That really gives freshmen that sense of freedom and self-reliance.
College Sophomore,2,Labs Get Crowded in the Middle of the Day – wireless access depends on what part of the university you stay on and it comes and goes. there are plenty computer labs around to print and use when you need them its always best to go early in the morning later in the day it gets more packed
College Junior,2,Our transportation is very little. If you do not have a car our a friend with a car you will be walking.
College Freshman,2,Go Party or Go Home – The only activities available for students during the weekend are Greek Parties or Clubs that often provide alcoholic beverages to underage teens. If the campus is not having a Home game then weekends on campus are very boring. You either go party or go home...i choose to go home LOL:)
College Freshman,2,"Maybe it's me and the people I decide to hang with but, Orangeburg is a small town. There does not seem to be a nightlife here."
College Sophomore,2,To complete Financial Aid a student has to fill out a FAFSA form and complete verification. Financial Aid at South Carolina State University is frustrating because the process of getting everything approved and posted to an account takes a very long time. The best advice is to do everything early and keep copies of everything submitted to the office.
College Sophomore,2,"Since Orangeburg, South Carolina is a small town it lacks the basic things that cities have such as public transportation, sidewalks, and walking-friendly environment. South Carolina State University is conscious of this and provides shuttle services for students to Walmart and the local mall."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Theres a number of options, but for anything above par, the student drive to Columbia, SC."
Recent Alumnus,2,There are labs but usually the computers are out of service and the wireless network is extremely slow and most dorms do not even have wireless access.
College Freshman,2,"Barely Made It – I barely made the progress i needed to make to finacially attend South Carolina State they gave a good ammount of federally funded money and the offered me loans that would help cover the exceeding expences,but i was still a couple hundread dollars short."
College Junior,2,Okay but Definitely Not Great – We have 5 choices of places to eat on campus and they are okay but we really would like something different.
College Senior,2,The nightlife at SC State University isn't very interesting maybe for ur first year but after that it's not. There's not many clubs/bars in our area.
College Junior,2,"A Shuttle I Do Not See – There is not enough parking.  If you get a ticket you pay $25 or it keeps going up.  We just got a shuttle this year, but i THINK I've only seen it twice.  We need more long-distance transportation."
College Junior,2,"Need More Security – I feel that SCSU needs more security.  In the front gate anyone can come on campus during the day time, which is ok.  All the gates close at 7pm, except for the back gate and you have to show your ID.  Sometimes there is no security guard in the booth, so anyone can drive on campus.  A positive thing is that there are some security guards that walk around and drive around at night.  Another bad note is that there is not enough parking so everyone just parks where they can which is usually a place where we cant so everyone seems to get tickets."
Recent Alumnus,2,Parking is somewhat of a difficulty on campus due to reconstruction of buildings and with the fact that South Carolina State has decided to become a pedestrian campus.
College Sophomore,2,The computers at my school are good but there very limited. Through out campus there are maybe 75 computers that the students are allowed to use. The printer barely work and wifi only works in certain areas.
College Senior,1,They don't care about it as much until you have to go to the hospital
College Senior,1,Never trust the Band Director. Cuts money too much
College Freshman,1,The people in financial aid are only there to get a check. They do not try to help your financial situations and they do not help you at all. They all have attitudes and do not answer the phones.
College Freshman,1,There are pretty much only fast food places and Walmart. If you want to go shopping you would have to drive about 55 minutes down the road to Columbia or charleston.
College Freshman,1,"Housing is terrible, things are old, things break, light fixtures fall apart. Closet space is rediculously small. Maintenance never comes in a timely manner."
College Junior,1,The people who work in that office have horrible attitudes as if their given you their personal money.
Recent Alumnus,1,I can go on and on about financial aid but I hate the financial aid staff at the school they always try and give you the run around and that's just not right especially for first year students who are new to the school and are trying to make this their home
Recent Alumnus,1,Well they university is the only university in South Carolina to have a nuclear engineering program and I think that is really neat 
Recent Alumnus,1,"Orangeburg South Carolina is the worst place to do anything!!! if you want to have fun Orangeburg is not the place to be when trying do so. Because Orangeburg is a small town the crime rate is really high so people who live there especially college students have to be careful with what they get involved in. Shopping, activities, recreational is not all that great either, I wouldn't recommend anyone to live there unless you want to retire and live some place quiet"
College Freshman,1,The campus strictness is not really enforced they let anyone on campus without really checking their ID cards and the law enforcement really do not be out when they state that they are.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is not very good. They don't have enough space for the students, and the parking authority is iffy on deciding when to give tickets.  You can park in one spot and be okay for a week and the next week have a ticket for parking in the same spot."
College Sophomore,1,"The local atmosphere around my school campus is extremely poor. It's very bland, a couple fast food restaurants, not many good shopping places or tourist attractions at all."
College Freshman,1,"its very weird, it will rain, snow, and get sunny in the same day"
College Senior,1,"They did not help me at all when I inquired about them, and I have a 3.96 GPA at the moment. I felt very put off and it was left up to me to ""find"" something. I did have a wonderful experience with the director of financial aid though, she helped me come up with the 500$ missing for me to be able to attend summer school! She was fantastic and very nice."
College Sophomore,1,To park on campus you need a parking permit if you dont have one they are very strict and WILL tow your car.
College Sophomore,1,Trying to get financial aid is kind of complicated you have to do a lot in order to get what you need
College Sophomore,1,"Campus isn't very strict at all. South Carolina State University is a public campus meaning anyone can enter. It's not really safe at night and campus police only shows up when parties get to out of hand. Basically, be safe."
College Junior,1,It's Very Hectic – Well at SC State the parking is very hectic at times and they are very big on towing your car if you in a wrong parking space.But my question to SC State is that why our parking spaces are so far from where our classes are at the time? I just don't get it. On top of that they real big on towing your car also and that can be a good bit of money to get it back out. It's just mess up and I don't like it.
College Junior,1,"Parking on SC State's campus is the worst thing to ever happen. As a resident, there is hardly any where to park where I am forced to park away from the apartment where I reside."
College Sophomore,1,I Honestly Worked Hard – Within my business calculus class i worked hard and went to tutoring every night for 3 hours all week long but for some reason i still failed the class with a F. It could be because i never even took precalculus but i still worked hard and failed worst than i have ever before in my life. Maybe if there were placement test instead of throwing me in a class might of helped but what done is done. I did my best but my best was no where near enough. Math is one of my worst subjects as well so that could also be a factor.
College Senior,1,"Dining on Campus – The food on campus has not changed since I arrived in 2007. I left and returned from deployment hoping to see a change. But there was none. Every monday this past semester for dinner, breakfast was being served. For the life of me I could not understand why. And some cafe workers are sneaking in the supply closets eating food, that our tuition paid for. Thats not right.  Smells like everything is being cooked with grease when you walk pass the Pitt. And Petes Arena needs a better selection. We are paying to much money for a meal plan, and we do not have a wide variety of foods to eat, healty or not. I moved off campus, but still bought a convienient meal plan for between classes, but still not satisfied. I'd like to see a change at SCSU. If not now, at least for the new comers."
College Sophomore,1,"Do Better – The food is unhealthy, fairly plain and to make it worse you don't have much of a selection to choose from. Couple of food locations serving the same undesirable food. Customer service is atrocious with the exception of the Caf luch ladies. We need a change."
College Sophomore,1,First  i would like to say that parking on SCSU campus sucks. I believe they should assign you a parking spot based on where your dorm is located. because i dont think its fair that we have to travel so far away from out dorms just to park our cars. & i also think that SCSU need to invest in more parking for students we have more staff parking spots then we do staff.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus Life – Campus activities are usually fun. The parties sometimes get out of control. But the library and student center are not attractive at all. A lot of students who are juniors have said that they have never bee inside the library or they didn't know the library had three floors. The school does do a lot of community service things such as HIV testing, making sure that students are registered to vote, and youth days which are usually fun!"
College Sophomore,1,The student center has some broken pool tables and sticks. The bathrooms are from the 1900's. The best place on campus would have to be The LeRoy Davis Jr. building. They have the nicest bathrooms.
College Freshman,1,Parking spaces are very limited around the campus and if you do get a park it may be a good 10 to 15 minute walk across campus.
College Freshman,1,"Lots of Black Students – The school is predominantly black, but that is to be expected because it is a Historically Black College University (HBCU)."
College Freshman,1,"Becoming a Nurse – The staff is rude. They want things done on their time. They don't attend class regulary. If your  looking for the easy way out, then this is the place to be."
College Freshman,1,"PT Squared – South Carolina State University seems to put a lot of their time and effort into enforcing two things (PT SQUARED) Paying Tuition & Parking Tickets. I see more cars towed or receiving parking tickets than I see assistance from security or academic assistance. Also freshman are not allowed to have cars on campus do to lack of parking spaces. However majority of the buildings on campus are abandoned and there is a lot of open area. The institution should use the open area and build a parking lot so that students will be able to park their car without being fined! Because they enforce the payment of tuition and the payment of parking tickets, these two PT's can only be resolved by PT...PRAYER TIME!"
College Sophomore,1,"What a Headache! I am on scholarship at South Carolina State, but getting through to the financial aid office is a hassle and a headache every time."
College Junior,1,"parking tickets are outragous, there is no where to park , and students pay hard earn money to park"
College Senior,1,the night life is very borning compared to pervious years.
Recent Alumnus,1,Limited to dorm spaces which makes it difficult to live off campus because they ticket heavily. There isn't a parking garage near for commuters.
Recent Alumnus,1,Our Greek life is very limited due to most of the fraternities and sororities being suspended and only recently coming back on the yard.
Recent Alumnus,1,Don't drink or smoke and not around the drugs scene.
College Junior,1,"No Bueno – There is no off-campus help from school, but off campus housing is a lot cheaper. The only con is it is off-campus so you have to drive back and forth to school"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Fan Support and School Spirt – As a student athlete here at South Carolina State University we do not experience a lot of fan base support at games other than football. School spirt compared to USC, UGA and even ASU is almost non existance here we do not support our sports like regular school do. Majority of the time its a fashion contest rather than a school spirit contest which I believe they left behind in high school if it even existed there."
College Junior,1,"Meal plans are very unfair.If you live on campus you have to have a meal plan;But the bad part about is we have a time limit to use each meal. I do not eat breakfas, so it is very sad that they do not roll over. The customer service is HORRIBLE."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is very limited especially to out of state students they have a hard time finding a parking spot.
College Sophomore,1,parking can be quite horrible if you have a car. then when you don't have a decal its even worse.

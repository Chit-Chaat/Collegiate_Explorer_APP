Freshman,5,Nothing everything went well. Happy that I can give my family a better future.. Thank God for this opportunity.
Senior,5,This school teaches exactly what MIT and CalTech (California Institute Of Technology) teaches at their schools.
College Junior,5,we have good internet access and computer access. the library is open for use and we can use printers and copiers if needed.
College Senior,5,I've tried going to other trade schools in the past (ex. UEI) and they were not helpful at all or just tought you the minnimum to get you by. SCIT by far has cought my attention and is where I want to stay for my education.
Alum,4,"Good technical school, fast and good hands on training on labs and equipment.
nice area, and good teachers."
College Junior,4,"professors are good and knowledgeable, the curriculum is very thorough for the degree being studied, and registration is easy as they choose all the classes for you and select your schedule. classes allow you to have a job and the work load is not unbearable."
College Junior,4,I like my major because it is a very desirable profession and it allows me to work as an electrician while I am in school so I can try to support myself as well as I can
College Junior,4,"lots of good resources such as free tutoring, computer labs, library."
College Junior,4,they are very reasonable with tuition. it is nice because all materials and books are included in the tuition. I have had no extra costs or anything unexpected. the financial aid department is very helpful and helps me through the whole process. the accounting department is very nice too because they will work with you if you have some reason why you cant make a payment or an entire payment they will work with you.
College Junior,4,"overall, a good school. they take the time to teach you what you are trying to learn and I love how all the materials are included in the tuition. very desirable"
College Senior,4,I believe tuition to be reasonably priced for the amount of time required for certification and the resources available to everyone in class. Financial aid was very straightforward and the office gave me step by step instruction.

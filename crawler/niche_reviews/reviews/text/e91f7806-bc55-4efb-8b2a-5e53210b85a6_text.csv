Freshman,5,"This university is very nice. The faculty is well put together and close to everything in the heart of Chicago, the staff is so nice and understanding and friendly. During the pandemic East-West is doing a hybrid between in class and E-learning and that is helpful especially now."
Freshman,5,The online classes are 2 days out of the week and since there aren't any classes on Friday the teachers email you the schedule for the upcoming week so that there aren't any surprises and if there happens to be a change in anything they will email you and let you know.
Junior,5,"Love how the classes are small, where youll always have a very confident and one to one conversation with your advisor  and teachers."
Freshman,5,I liked everything about the school. I feel safe and comfortable in the environment which is a big importance to me.
Freshman,5,It's a univeristy that wants to see each student achieve its goals and have a graduation rate of 100%. The focus of the school is to be successful long term once you reach your career.
Junior,5,"Friendly people, helpful staff, always there when you need help. Great professor with awesome experience."
College Senior,5,The resources to the campus is the best
College Senior,5,Everyone is nice and help is always offered it makes school a lot easier
College Senior,5,Everyone at East West is nice and helps you when needed
College Junior,5,"I like the school. It's small, which is what I want."
College Junior,5,Everything is Brand New On Campus & U To Date! Also A Plus You Don't Have To Leave The Building To Get To Classes In Te Winter!
College Junior,5,"The business program at East-West is fantastic! Before I came here I wasn't sure about being a business major, but after taking some classes I am sold 100%."
College Junior,5,Everything Was Taken – Every class that I had pretty much was taken I had no problems with this. Sometimes when trying to get my next quarter classes they try to give me a class that I have already taken at another school and that transferred over so i have to make sure i remind them that i had that already.
Sophomore,4,East-West University is a a setting to where the attention is focus on you. The professor aren’t looking to fail you but to make sure that you understand the curriculum of the course. There are staff they go out there way for the students because they believe each one of there college students is capable. EastWest unlike other colleges take attendance very seriously to show us that it is very important for us to be there. The days that you miss you we see how much you’ve lost  as soon as you walk through the classroom door.
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at East-West University, and so far I enjoy the school. The classes are very small, and that works for me because I’m not getting distracted by other things going on. The only thing I dislike about East-West is that they don’t have minors but other than that I’m really glad I chose this school to finish my education."
Senior,4,I've always liked the small class sizes and the location of the school. Many of the professors seem to care about students grades and will offer help if you're falling behind. The tuition is kind of high but they offer lots of scholarships to assist in paying for classes.
College Freshman,4,They help u with everything you need like homework and they help you understand the lesson
College Freshman,4,So far its great because the professor's dont let u fail they will find a way to help
College Sophomore,4,"Working on my major which is Business Management, the professors are very helpful when it comes to teach us the skills to have in this specific industry . For example, Mr. Gaines who is one of my business professor, and the chairman of business department; gives his student real life situation and cases that will help us with exams, the real world and etc."
College Sophomore,4,So far my school experience is going very well. I have a B average on the GPA scale and I'm proud and working harder to become successful.
College Junior,4,I love the small class sizes
College Senior,4,"The professors are nice, well educated, and help is everywhere when you need it"
College Senior,4,Everything is offered and everything is good
College Junior,4,The student center allows students to receive tutoring for their classes.  The library is open 5 days a week from early in the morning until 7 p.m. The librarians are helpful to many students asking for their assistance. I'm not familiar with the campus activities. It's easy to maneuver throughout the school if you attend orientation or just ask for assistance from a student.
College Junior,4,The computer labs have over a dozen computers which are easy to access because the labs are usually not crowded. The library has around 24-30 computers to use. Sometimes the network can be slow and but overall the computers are reliable.  It would be useful to own your own personal computer; more convenient for the student. 
College Junior,4,Applying for classes are easy. The advisors I've had are willing to work with you and give you the classes you need in order to graduate on time.  The professors are great at their jobs and students are able to learn efficiently.  The workload can be overwhelming at times if one is a procrastinator.  Usually students can meet with a professor during office hour times and ask any questions. There are also study areas  for a specific academic area such as math or writing.
College Junior,4,"It's easy to scheldule classes to fit my personal needs. Most of the teachers I've had are willing to work with their students in order to understand their needs. Sometimes it can be difficult to get a hold of a computer during midterm/finals week because everyone is busy and there are only a limited number available. Overall, it is an adequate University to attend."
College Senior,4,I will be starting this Fall.  I was referred by a current student.  My experience so far has been amazing.  The admissions staff is excellent and its seem like campus life is good.  I'm excited about starting classes this September. 
College Junior,4,"Ms. Sims does an excellent job at providing career service support and tools needed to successfully transition into the work place. She prides herself on being available to her students for that purpose. She and her team do all they can to ease you through the job-seeking process, whether it be tweaking your resume, preparing you for that interview, and/or ensuring that you and your potential employer are a great fit."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is easy accessible and is pretty easy to get around. You can get around without a problem and there are plenty of classrooms, only downfall is the size of the hallways and corridors."
College Senior,4,"Whether you prefer morning, afternoon or evening classes, the school is open. It usually offers more than one section of courses so that it can fit many students' busy lifestyle. Credits aren't always transferable though."
College Senior,4,"It's a small private institution so you are able to meet with professors one on one if you must. They try to get the student involved in a wide range of activities as often as possible. It's set in the south Loop and is easily accessible from all sides of town. They are working to make students' college careers are full of quality,"
College Sophomore,4,"Small School = One to One Time With Professors – I love the fact that this is a small school, it provides you with a family enviorment. All races joined into one family.. When ever you need help on something the teachers make the time to help you on anything that you need. My school also provides a Wellness center where you can speak about anything, and they will help you figure out the solution to your problem.( EVEERY THING SAID IS CONFIDENTUAL!!) && WITH PROFESSIONALS!"
Sophomore,2,I haven’t had a chance to experience the online schooling to be able to speak for it.  Based off the things student say I guess it is okay but needs some Improvement
Niche User,2,"The academic councilors should be engaged into each individual student's career path to ensure they are taking the necessary classes to achieve their goal.  I have made a lot of decisions on my own, in which I regret to this day, due to lack of parental assistance and guidance from the university council.  I believe I would be at my desired education level should I had better assistance throughout the process."
College Senior,2,if there are more activities associated with this university I will be more involved
College Junior,2,"We really don't have anything right now, but next school year were going to have dorms so things should be better."
College Junior,2,Some of the computers run very slow and the wifi never works. I really wish things were better.
College Freshman,2,My major is Law and my school has no classes for me to offer. I'm taking some math classes that have nothing to do with my major
College Freshman,2,I wish the professors were more involved with the students. The administration need to do their job instead of sitting and doing nothing
College Junior,2,They had a job fair but only a few of the employers were legit jobs. Quite a few of them were get rich quick jobs. They send out companies that are hiring but jobs are rarely obtained from this.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus activities varies , its not that much to do there but hang out with friends then go to class.The library is small,don't have a student center to my knowledge."
College Junior,2,"Not Much Opportunity – The opportunities for post grad services are few, many of the graduate students move on to pursue their careers on their own and usually attend another institution for post grad studies."
College Junior,2,"I feel as if the school does not utilize my skills or allows me to grow in the direction I want. I try to create an atmosphere to allow for this growth, but the school lacks the resources necessary for this to happen."
College Junior,2,"Wireless Access and Speed – The computers are new, yet they are slow. It takes time to load a page on the internet, which can delay turning in assignments and accessing the portal takes time. AS for wireless access, we yet to have wi-fi, this is a hassle when trying to access your documents when there is no computer close at hand, but your laptop."
College Junior,2,"Getting Aid from East - West – Initially I did not qualify for finicial aid at my school even though three people in the same house hold was attending. We started registrating later and later and our tuition wasn't getting paid on time because it was to much for my only employed parent. Finally after two years we got some help besides the small scholarship the school gives us. If it wasn't for that I would have to stop at my associates. As far as quality goes, I love where the school is located. Stores and restaurants are close which is great since our school doesn't really have that inside. However sometimes I feel like this school is good for teacher to get experienced rather than experience teachers teaching there. That's not to say that new professors can't teach or that they aren't any good professesors. I just wish good teachers would out weigh the not so good teachers by a long shot. If I had to do it all over again I wouldn't pick that school."
College Sophomore,2,Takes a While to Transfer – I chose this school because it was an open registration school meaning I didnt have to comply with application deadlines. They are slow when they add your transfer credits. If you need to submit any try to do it early on and dont procastinate.
College Senior,1,The courses that I've taken online are major courses and the work less for then are to much for such complex material that must be learned without any input from the professor. You only meet for times over 12 weeks and there is no room for error as three out of for meetings are for tests and your not even sure what you will be tested on until the test is I'm hand. The teacher grades harsh as well.
College Junior,1,Resources or the Lack of – The school is in the process of of building a student center. They just got wifi about a year ago and rarely works. The library is outdated with old books and the computers very slow. We dont have any sport teams either.
College Sophomore,1,Early Child Hood – There is not a specific program at the university.
College Senior,1,Really None Avaliable – EWU has very few online courses so if you are looking for this type of institution steer away.

Senior,5,"This school has been great for me. Coming out of high school I was unsure if college would be fit for me. However, after arriving to Regis I really began enjoying the college life and started to appreciate learning much more. All of the teachers I have had at this school are great and keep students engaged in the courses. This school has really made a positive impact in my life and helped me become a better person. Overall, Regis University has been a great school for me and I would recommend anybody to go there."
Sophomore,5,"I have taken online classes at Regis due to covid, and the teachers have been more that cooperative and understanding. I personally learn better in a classroom than online so it has been a struggle for me, but Regis has been very upfront about the procedures and what is expected of me as a student. I could not think of a better way to transition this year into summer given the current circumstances."
Sophomore,5,"I love my university. I am going into my second year at Regis University, and I couldn't be more excited about it. I am in the honors program and am a double major, in neuroscience and art, and have found continuous support from my professor to juggle everything that I want to do. The campus is beautiful, and it is easy to learn in such a great environment. I was valedictorian of my high school and was worried college wouldn't challenge me. I have found that not true, as I am learning things I ever dreamed I would and the programs are such a high quality and intensity that I truly am intellectually stimulated. I love my campus, and the only thing to make it better would be if they had a neuroscience grad school so I could stay longer!"
Alum,5,Regis is a great place to attend colleges. The professors all want you to succeed and the atmosphere is always positive.
Senior,5,"The smaller student to teacher ratio is just what I needed. The faculty really shows that the care. The ethics and morals of this university is one of the very reasons I chose it to finish my undergrad. I have been through a lifetime before I was even 24. Regis has been so accepting, helpful, and understanding. Because I have tried to go to school so many times, I ran out of student loans. So now I have been doing all that I can to find a way to pay for school so I can finally earn that degree! I just wish Regis was more affordable."
Senior,5,We had to move to remote classes in the middle of the semester. The transition was actually done smoothly. The professors were understanding of any hiccups along the way.
Graduate Student,5,My overall experience with Regis was very positive. Everyone was very helpful - administrators and instructors alike. I really liked the emphasis on the whole person and not just on academics.
Graduate Student,5,"I was hesitant about doing a program that was completely online, but during my first class I was quickly hooked and ended up loving it!  I did both the BSN and MSN programs online.  It is very structured and user friendly.  The way the courses are structured made it easy to know what is expected and helped me stay on track.  I loved the asynchronous format.  I could work at whatever time was good for me.  I also enjoyed meeting so many people from all over the world and getting to know them through the course.  It was great to get so many different perspectives - something I"
Graduate Student,5,Regis University was an awesome opportunity to experience college in a setting where the professors and other faculty cared about your success. There were a lot of events that took place to allow students to get connected and the smaller campus provides the opportunity to become familiar with many faces throughout campus!
Alum,5,Regis helped me to discover who I was both as a person and as a student. It helped me to grow in every possible way and everyone on the campus is there to make sure that you get the most of your education. Professors and faculty care about you as a person and as a student. Denver is an extremely cool city to live in and the mountains are super close so a hike is never too far away. Having a Jesuit tradition wasn't overbearing and nothing was pushed onto you. Everyone is always so welcoming and are willing to help when you need something. Overall a great school choice and would definitely do it again if I got the opportunity!
Graduate Student,5,"Regis has been the most accommodating, and helpful environment. Going into graduate school is terrifying, but my advisors and mentors have made the experience unbelievable, and I absolutely made the right choice. You will never be left behind and they will get you where you need to be."
Graduate Student,5,"Regis University  strives to educate their students based on the Jesuit values. In doing so, they create students who are ready to go out into the working world and make a difference and strive for excellence. Regis has been my home for the past four years and will continue to be for the next three as I pursue a graduate degree and I could not be more happy. One area of improvement would be catching up with the current technology of society and improving their communication outlets. Often times we receive messages that we should not whereas in important school crisis situations, not everyone receives the message. I think improving communication across different departments would benefit the students so much.  Overall though, due to the amazing group of professors and leaders on this campus, I definitely recommend Regis to anyone that asks and most definitely give them five stars."
Niche User,5,"I am former junior in high school and I have visited Regis University a variety of times. My experience has been very good there because the staff are kind and understanding towards each individual. Also, I love the architecture of the school how small the classes are."
Graduate Student,5,"I'm doing the online computer science bachelors and am really enjoying the classes. The program is rigorous (it requires a lot of math courses, since it's ABET certified). The instructors so far have been easy to work with and highly educated/knowledgeable. I debated between a lot programs, but chose Regis because it offered this program 100% online and was ABET certified. My only regret is I'm not attending physically because the campus looks absolutely gorgeous."
Alum,5,"I received my graduate degree from Regis and can compare it to the your large University setting. The professors at Regis were attentive and knowledgeable. Classroom size was wonderful has it allowed for dialogue and interactive learning. I am not Catholic yet enjoyed Jesuit values and the commitment to addressing the spiritual side of life. I did not feel discriminated against for raising questions respectfully. The only thing that troubled me sometimes was that a few of my classmates were very entitled and even argumentative at times - it was almost as if they did not want rules in place which was ridiculous at a academic institution. Food was decent, staff were kind. The campus is lovely and tranquil. I believe the dorms slated to be remodeled and parking can be a challenge for commuters - get there before 9 a.m. is the joke. I felt the quality of the education was worth the price."
Graduate Student,5,DPT professors are very dedicated to their job and make the experience so enjoyable and full of learning!
Sophomore,5,"I am really enjoying my time at Regis University. With such small classes I am able to get the help I need from my Professors, as well as connect with each student in my class."
Niche User,5,The campus is amazing. Everybody I met on my tour was friendly and raved about their lives here and really sold me on choosing Regis as my college. It feels like a home for me to grow in.
Sophomore,5,I think Regis is a very open space and good to find who you want to be. I really believe the content the school requires is very spiritual and helps the students form into a well rounded individual. The content also pushes you to be a part of the community and professors help build the sense of community. Regis is a high price point but it really does build a person into someone who cares for all and the world around them. The content is very immersive and the area surrounding the school is nice.
Niche User,5,This University has a great sense of community. They are often updating their programs to make sure they are staying up-to-date with the ever changing industries.
Freshman,5,"I chose to attend Regis University initially because my mom recently graduated with her masters in nursing education from Regis and loved her experience there and I felt it was where I belonged. After my first semester at Regis I have been reassured every single day that I made the right decision. Regis has a strong and caring community, the small class sizes allow each and every student to have strong relationships with their professors. I have already built life long relationships with many of my fellow students and professors. There is no competitions or turf wars at Regis, everyone is there to support each other in their goals, careers and educations. Regis University is not just an amazing community but a family."
Freshman,5,"Its a great school, not the best location, but the campus is pretty safe. Teachers are really fun and cool, campus is small enough to feel like family, but big enough to stay away from people you don't like."
Graduate Student,5,The small class sizes give an excellent opportunity for the student to really get to know professors and classmates. It also makes it feel like it is worth the money! I went to a Big10 University for undergrad and classes were never less than 300 people. Regis is amazing because of the size!
Freshman,5,I chose to attend Regis because I enjoy the ideology behind them. I am able to connect with people through serving others and caring for each other. I also enjoy the small classes as I am able to connect with my professors.
Graduate Student,5,"I absolutely love my school!   Regis is strongly diversified, culturally advanced, and sensitive to the day to day concerns of the world.  A school that is Christ, centered, they are truly about service to others and sincere in training their students to do the same.  Regis staff, across the board, are genuine and in my experience have always gone above and beyond their call of duty!!!"
Sophomore,5,"Regis is a small school, and the reason I enjoy learning there is because of the environment. I know my professors and my classmates. It's a small community, but it is nice to know people with the same interests as you. Everyone that attends Regis is friendly and determined."
Graduate Student,5,Regis is a great online university for graduate students who are working full time and wishing to pursue a higher degree.
Graduate Student,5,The data science program is very rewarding and great value for the cost of education. There is a diverse group of student of many educational backgrounds which is beneficial in class discussions.
Alum,5,"I loved everything about Regis, from the small class sizes, the incredible staff, and the beautiful campus. Regis's education program prepared me to be the best teacher, confident in my practice from the moment I graduated. I strongly recommend all people considering teaching to go through Regis's education program."
Graduate Student,5,"I have really enjoyed my experience at Regis so far. The instructors are engaged, responsive and interested in their students' lives. They are driven to help us succeed. Graduate work has been tailored to suit my own particular academic and professional goals."
Sophomore,5,I Just got accepted to Register and I am very excited! I am going for the biology bachelors program. I love science and will continue later to become a physician assistant. Register has amazing programs for the medical field and I am honored to have been accepted.
Freshman,5,"I love Regis because of the Jesuit values and how they transfer into the Nursing program. The parties aren't bad but it's not a party school, people care about their academics."
Graduate Student,5,"Regis University strives to be socially inclusive, environmentally friendly and provide students with rigorous academics in a safe environment. The campus is beautiful and the new additions and upgrades have really improved the lives of students."
Alum,5,This was the best college to have taken the Masters in Psychology. The professors had their own practices so they were able to relay real experiences to the students.
Graduate Student,5,I love this place!!! I went here to get my Bachelor's in Nursing and it was a very well rounded educational experience. The instructors are really helpful and go the extra mile to make sure you understand anything and always willing to offer support. I loved this place so much that I decided to go back and get my master's degree here!!!
Freshman,5,Phenomenal school. Compassionate in every single way. They have gone above and beyond to facilitate my needs. They offer a great curriculum. The teachers are detailed and efficient. A win-win for anyone that is considering a private school.
Junior,5,"Regis is a wonderful school. If. you want to a good quality education, I highly recommend this school."
Niche User,5,"This was the first college I toured, and I absolutely fell in love with the university as a whole! I am looking for a school that has great academics, along with the sense of a tight-knit community. Definitely my dream school!"
Junior,5,So far everyone has been so helpful in getting me back into the school mind frame. Helping me thru the application process and financial aid. They have been very welcoming and helpful. I would recommend them to everyone I know who is interested in going back to school
Niche User,5,I am a high school senior looking at colleges for my next year. I have visited Regis twice and both times it has been amazing. The campus is very pretty especially with the mountains looming behind it. The people there are very friendly and I think it would be a great place to learn as long as you can afford it. It does come with a bit of a price tag but I think it is worth it.
Graduate Student,5,"Haven't been in classes yet, but I have had a great experience going through the admissions process. They made everything so easy, and were really committed to my success."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely loved Regis the students and faculty there are amazing!

The atmosphere is great it’s a small campus and has a very close knit community!"

Not only do the smaller class sizes lead to better learning environments, they also provide better relationships between the teachers and the students. The teachers at Regis University legitimately care about each and every one of their students."
Junior,5,"One of the best schools I have attended with some of the best staff to help you navigate through the processes of a University. From the very first day when I applied to the school, to every little thing to get me where I am now."
Senior,5,"Best College experience anyone could ask for. The professor were so hands on, worked with you when it was needed, answered every question, and worked with your personal schedule. The professor really care about their students education and make education a priority. The professor are willing to meet up with you outside of class hours for extra help and accommodate all needs. There is nothing better than having a professor who cares about you and your education."
Freshman,5,"Regis has some of the best academic programs, you will get an amazing education that will put you above your peers at other schools. All students and staff are genuine people and Denver is gorgeous."
Junior,5,"The classes are small, and I truly did not appreciate this until now. I am currently studying abroad in Ireland for a semester and the class sizes are big. At Regis you truly get to interact with professors that care about you."
Freshman,5,I love the environment of the school and the amount of time the professors put into their students. It’s something that you won’t find at another University.
Niche User,5,Regis University is the school that I will be attending in the fall and I am looking forward to it so much. The staff have been extremely helpful to me and my family as we try to navigate the college experience for the first time. They are quick to respond and are very enthusiastic. They are helpful in every way they possibly can be and I am very grateful that they are. I am the first of my siblings to go to college and the experience has changed a lot since my parents went. They are just as confused about the process as I am but the University has been nothing but helpful. I really am looking forward to going to such an amazing school in the fall.
Freshman,5,I love the teachers in the English department. The food is amazing and the campus is in a beautiful spot in Denver. I am in love with the writing programs offered here and the teachers really care about knowing the students. The small classrooms allow for a more communication-based class times.
Alum,5,"Wonderful online program, thorough, helpful teachers, and flexible study program. The academic advisor was awesome, and she helped me complete my degree quickly, with the best study plan possible. They also took all of my credits from community college!"
Freshman,5,I love the academics and what the school is offering to teach. It would be nice to have more of a community in classes.
Freshman,5,Regis University has such an amazing campus that accompanies it with such joyful and kind faculty and students. Not only does Regis offer one of the best Nursing Programs but it also has tons of resources for students to take advantage off while they're advance in their college career.
Junior,5,"I love the environment and academics at Regis. The teachers at Regis are extremely helpful, they are always willing to meet with you in office hours. When office hours is not an option, tutoring centers are always available. I'm a transfer this year at Regis, and the staff and students all tend to be welcoming and friendly."
Sophomore,5,I am enrolled in an adult program. Going back to school after 5 years from graduating high school isn't easy. With Regis I found the best program to help me catch for the years I've missed. The process has been easy and the classes challenging. The classes fit well with my schedule and can continue to work and go to school.
Junior,5,The instructors at Regis are committed to your success! The school has a fabulous reputation that goes really far when graduated.
Freshman,4,"I am re-entering academia after being a working, single mom for 17 years, so far everything has been easy to understand. You are matched with a team of folks who truly want you to succeed."
Freshman,4,"Admission was very detailed, answered questions I didn't even know I had. Everyone on my on-boarding team has been great!"
Senior,4,"Overall, online courses are tough for everybody. However the professors at Regis have put an enormous amount of work into designing their online courses to be as interactive as possible to help keep students engaged. It is much harder to stay engaged in online learning in general, but the professors at Regis are very interesting and  that makes it much easier to stay engaged."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the diverse campus and the dedicated staff, along with the well-structured classes. The programs are fairly well structured to allow for students to complete their degrees with minimal struggle."
Junior,4,My experience at Regis Univeristy was great. It is a good catholic school with profesors who truly wish to see you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Regis really cares about its students, and upholds its values. I love how many resources are offered, the care behind the staff and faculty, and just the overall feel of the campus (what made me choose it as my college)."
Sophomore,4,The online experience for me wasn't that hard. I was able to adapt and Regis offered plenty of programs to help me adapt. It was a lot harder to not learn on campus though.
Freshman,4,Your first year counselor offers great help. Any question you have they can help you. The advice you in what class to take first depending on your interests. The classes are small and allow you to connect with more students as well as your professors. If  you have problems in class the office hour will benefit a lot. Your professor will see your effort and guide you in the direction you need.
Niche User,4,My experience with Regis University has been great! They are always there to help the students at my school and are always willing to let us in there campus they are a community where you always feel welcomed.
Alum,4,Flexible online classes.  Course work and schedule made it easy to work and completed classes.  There was options to attend after hours classes in case face to face was wanted or needed.
Sophomore,4,As a transfer student I have found the academics and teacher both amazing! You will find teachers that genuinely care about your success and who also want to learn not just your name but more about you!
Junior,4,"Regis University is an amazing liberal arts university. It offers a small, community like campus with smaller class sizes. This makes it much easier for students to receive help with class work from professors and fellow classmates. Students attending this university become well-rounded individuals after completing the required core courses, including ones specific only to the university. The campus is beautiful with it's many featured species of trees and famous Main Hall building, however the one aspect I believe needs to be worked on is the handicap accessibility. There are multiple parts of campus which are hard to access for handicap individuals."
Sophomore,4,Regis University has great academic programs ! The campus is very nice and well maintained throughout all 4 seasons here in Colorado !
Niche User,4,"Something that I liked from Regis University is that it gives you a broad amount of information so you can feel updated with everything that happens within the school and your academics. In addition, this school guides you through a variety of choices even before you attend the school. When you first apply to school, they keep on sending letters so that you know what you have to do next, and when accepted to college, they make you feel welcomed into a community that you don't know still. This school encourages you to look for as many choices as they have and they also ensure that you are taking the best opportunities they can provide to us as alumni."
Freshman,4,I like how inclusive it is and the many events that they hold to get people involved. The classes and programs that are offered are also good.
Niche User,4,"I liked many things about Regis. What I liked about it , is even though it did seem expensive at first, there is a small way in which you can get a lot of money from the school. Also, it has a nursing program that is great, which is what I'm interested in."
Sophomore,4,My experience as a regis student has been wonderful. I love how teachers are always willing to help and work with you when needed. Haven't has a professor that has been rude or not willing to help.
Sophomore,4,"Regis University is a great campus and I do not have many complaints, but I would like to see the diversity on campus be improved."
Sophomore,4,My experience has gone well so far. For anyone else wanting to succeed it's important to speak with your teacher often.
Junior,4,"Not only is the campus gorgeous, but I love the small class sizes and the community Regis offers. I have found some aspects to be frustrating over my two years at Regis, but overall I don't think I'll ever regret attending this school. I have already made so many friendships and learned so much."
Sophomore,4,"Regis University's Loretto Heights School of Nursing program is a great nursing program located in Denver, Colorado that has helped me develop nursing skills and supports students on their journey to graduating with a BSN."
Freshman,4,"The Regis University community is strongly built on its Jesuit values and morals, allowing you to quickly feel apart of such an inviting community."
Niche User,4,"I love the Regis campus, it is gorgeous. I also enjoy the small community the Regis offers, allowing people to better know their classmates."
Senior,4,I really enjoy the condensed courses because I can complete more classes in one semester. I really love the campus and professors I have worked with.
Freshman,4,I really liked the unique history they have and that they are a so involved with the community and nature around the school.
Junior,4,"Overall, I like Regis a lot. I am very involved (RA, Program planner at student activities) and am a really good student. The academics should be more challenging for it to be considered an intellectually stimulating experience. But then again, I find that's a hard experience to come by these days. Regis caters to student interests, so campus life is fun,and it's a good welcoming community. I like the Jesuit background. Even if you are not Jesuit the atmosphere is very welcoming to diverse beliefs. Food is great (bon appetit) and the campus is getting modernized, while maintaining much of it's Catholic architecture. I recommend this school, but like most things in life, your ROI depends on how much you continually invest."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed the educational atmosphere of the school, and the professors were excellent. But if you're looking for a good Catholic school, then you should look somewhere else."
Graduate Student,4,"Very good school. I received an excellent education here. Although I would have liked more professors who did not use group projects in the curriculum, the school respected diversity."
Freshman,4,"Excellent university thus far, still needs to iron out some things with students, faculty, and dorm areas. Academically, this university seems up to par."
Junior,4,"The students and faculty are very welcoming, and being on campus gives you an at home feeling. Everyone who attends Regis values their education, plus the campus is very beautiful to be on. Although, Regis says it is a very diverse campus, they need to give out more opportunities so minorities can attend."
Junior,4,"I like the campus and the availability of the campus. Nice location, though in an area where there could be high crime. Paying for parking isn't fun, but it does keep people from cluttering the parking lot with tons and tons of cars."
Freshman,4,"Regis University is a small school and it is super easy to make friends. It is a a beautiful campus with an overall happy vibe. Also the jesuit values are very nice, and the religious aspect of the school isn't overwhelming."
Sophomore,4,Regis is a small University with great academics and small classrooms. The professors are all great. The campus life is lacking but once you get to know people it is a lot of fun. Not a lot around the campus but downtown is close by.
Freshman,4,Regis University anyone can have a great experience socially and academically. There are many different social groups where students can make friends and volunteer to contribute their part to the community. I love Regis and plan to graduate ina few short years with my Bachelor's in Computer Information Systems.
Freshman,4,"Regis University is a great local school that is very supportive. Because Regis is a small school, there is the ability to have close knit relationships with other students and with faculty. This makes learning very convenient and much more feasible. I would like to see a change in diversity. Regis is a predominately white school. I would like to see more students of different ethnicities and different backgrounds."
Freshman,4,"I like the small class sizes,  you get more one on one with the professors.  It's a small campus and student body, making it easier to get to know others.  
The staff really care about you and your success and help if you are having any difficulty."
Junior,4,I like how the staff keeps their word in contacting you and the services offered to distance learning students.
Senior,4,"I would like to see more diversity, more international students. Tuition is rising, unfortunately. Yet, it is a pretty good community. It doesn't offer all a big state school can, but if you're not looking for that, you will at Regis find lasting social and professional relationships. Good education."
Junior,4,"2017 Summer will be my first semester at Regis, so far my experience with Regis has been absolutely positive.  This University provides everything for students needs, from having a gym, a Starbucks, Library, Music listening places and much more. Great school, and the staff are really nice, I have always been able to contact anyone I needed for help for any purpose."
Senior,4,"I like the fact they offer religious courses. I also like the online classes. However, Regis is a very expensive college."
Sophomore,4,"Regis University is a great small community to be a part of, it is easy to get involved with different groups on and off campus. The professors are great and because the school is small -- my classes are never much bigger than 25 students -- it is very easy to develop strong relationships with the professors and other students."
Junior,4,Regis University is a small college with a good community. There are strong academics and a lot of club opportunities however there are not a lot of on campus housing opportunities and the surrounding area is extremely expensive making housing difficult.
Sophomore,4,"Regis University overall is actually a nice school. The campus is beautiful and you can tell a lot goes into maintaining it. The problem with Regis is that sometimes you feel like you may be paying too much for what you're getting. On-campus housing could use some upgrades, but it's nothing terrible or unbearable. The teachers actually care about you and the small class size makes it easier to get one-on-one time with a teacher. Plus, the classes can be pretty challenging and you will be academically put the test. One thing to note is, the area surrounding Regis isn't the best. It's not the safest area, but its not all that dangerous either. Just be cautious of your surroundings. But I actually like attending Regis and I don't regret choosing this school."
Junior,4,"Most of the teachers and administrators are awesome, however there are an odd few that really make life terrible, I guess just like any school. The classes are nicely organized however there is no option to get behind, but the teachers are generally very understanding to personal emergencies. I wish that the classes were just more up to date and applicable to actually modern life and workplace."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love this school. I was worried about the transition from high school to college, however, I have never felt safer and at home than I do at Regis. As an incoming college freshmen and a member of the Women's soccer team I was worried about being overloaded with class work, studying, and trying to find time to be a regular college kid. The teachers have been amazing with working with me and my schedule as I am out of town a lot due to soccer. They give me extensions on my papers if I need it, and if I missed class while we were going over test materials then they will allow me to use the tutor center before I take the test. Not only are the teachers great, but so is the environment. There is always great activities going on around campus whether it be YoungLife, screenings of the Presidential Debate, Alcohol Awareness meetings, yoga, or just watching the football game in the pub. This is an amazing school and I would highly recommend it to any type of student. "
College Freshman,4,The entire atmosphere of the campus ion move in day is very possessive and the people are very welcoming. One of the most friendly vibes I have had the pleasure of encountering.
College Freshman,4,The services are easily accessible and very welcoming for the students who are hesitant to look for it.
College Freshman,4,The atmosphere of the residency halls are very positive as well as reinforcing to participate in communal activities to get to know the campus as well as the other students no matter which education year.
College Freshman,4,"The athletes are dedicated in their efforts to continue in school as well as achieve great feats in their teams. The attitude to achieve on and off the court is greatly felt by the athletes themselves and not so much pushed upon , rather encouraged to do so in accordance with the athletes personality."
College Freshman,4,"The University is very helpful with their undergraduate students in helping them get adjusted with college life. Although the transition has seem tough for me personally coming from 1018 miles away and 5000 feet lower than this area, the atmosphere is very welcoming and helped is always offered for those who seek it and no one seems to be given a cold shoulder."
College Senior,4,I have seen reports of a few incidents on campus with sexual assault and harassment.
College Senior,4,It is a good school and the Computer Science program is one of the best for online students. It is ABET accredited.
College Senior,4,"I school online. It has been a pleasant experience; however, not all Professors are the same. They vary from lazy to very involved."
College Sophomore,4,The athletics and the athletic facilities are a great resource on campus and while the varsity sports might not be the highlight of every one's college experience they are there still and the facilities are great for exercise.
College Sophomore,4,"So far this school has been fantastic, it has met all my academic needs and all of my needs for resources as well as giving me the access to anything that I could need to further my knowledge in my field."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is small, which makes me feel a little bit safer walking around by myself since I do not have a long way to go. There are also always people walking around, so you are never alone."
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly, my freshman year I did not go to a lot of the sport events. I can say that the ones that I did go to were always fun, there was always students filling the stands and supporting our teams, and our teams did great!"
College Sophomore,4,"I love this college and look forward to going back in the fall. The teachers listen and are very helpful and easy to speak with or contact. The students there are very friendly and super helpful. I especially love that the class sizes are small and I feel like I get to develop a relationship with my teacher due to this. Overall, this school is great and I cant wait to go back!"
College Sophomore,4,Otero was great teachers were of different calibers some prepared you for a university and others were getting you ready for college in general. I am looking forwad to regis. I have not no experience at Regis but applying was fun.
College Sophomore,4,"Regis really promotes diversity but their student selection is somewhat limited because of how expensive it is, other than that there are diverse groups of friends that appear on campus."
Sophomore,2,"Regis University has a great faculty that is invested in student success; if academics were the top priority on one's list, Regis would be the place for you! The one thing I would like to change about Regis is how the administration interacts with the student body, especially when financial aid and diversity is concerned."
Freshman,2,"Don't go to Regis if you expect a ""traditional"" college experience.  Keep in mind it's a Jesuit school, so the rules tend to be pretty strict. I found it to be boring at times. A lot of it is personal preference, but in my opinion it was too small and had a tendency to feel like high school. I did not find the school to be very diverse, just a lot of rich catholic white kids with a handful of diverse students. The parties aren't that great either, and since this is a very small division 2 school, school spirit is almost nonexistent. The area surrounding Regis is pretty dangerous and would not advise anyone to go out by themselves especially at night. Any good night life is downtown which require a bit of a drive."
Freshman,2,"Something about the school seems off, the atmosphere is whack and there seems to be a lack of space for the students (eating, parking, housing). From what I've seen a lot of the students here are very apathetic towards their academics. A lot of fake people here who like to display their wealth. Yikes. The professors are relatively impressive, however there are few, so choose wisely. So many cliques it feels just like high school, if not worse. The student body seems to bubble itself and stay relatively close to the campus (unless you want to eat at a restaurant, then you would HAVE to have a car to go anywhere). I just would not recommend this school if your looking for more opportunity."
Niche User,2,"Only stayed for one semester during which my phone was stolen on campus. Met some pretty shady people, along with some of the nicest people on earth. Most people here seem really fake. Not worth the cost of the school. Only 2 places on campus where you can use meal swipes, one of which forces you to use flex dollars on half the things they sell. The neighborhood is both a family area, as well as super dangerous. DO NOT go out on Federal past 9 pm. During my single semester, I received 2 emails about a man jacking off in his car in the lot on campus, 1 email about someone driving past a girl who was walking on the edge of campus and yelled at her ""how much do you charge?"", and 2 emails regarding a lockdown situation where a convict had escaped and had been reported near campus. Downtown is fun but expensive. Also, because of how popular Denver is becoming, housing prices are through the roof, even in the shittiest of neighborhoods."
College Sophomore,2,I have been trying to get connected with others as well as job opportunities and it is nearly impossible. There are job fairs but nothing for online students.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Applying to Regis was a great experience, but when I discovered my Junior year that Regis was not supporting me in my dreams and aspirations the expectation that I had upon them of supporting me in the hard times I was having was significantly disappointing. My choice of leaving Regis was not so much personally in the end, but health wise, thus I had no choice and the support they gave me as I looked to transfer to a school closer to my parents in California was more than atrocious. 

I got a refund back for my tuition which was good, but when I applied to transfer to San Francisco I learned that none (NONE OF MY THREE YEARS OF GOING TO REGIS CLASS CREDITS TRANSFERRED) to my new school. I am disappointed in this, because I was not a slacking student. I cared about my school work, and at the time really appreciated the professionalism Regis put on its students from the beginning. Unfortunately, now looking back at my experience at Regis, I do not know if I would recommend it to someone, not because it isn't a good school, but because of the support they give when something goes wrong that makes you leave their school. 

OTHER THINGS: 

PARKING: When I went to Regis, we didn't have to pay for parking. Everyone could find a spot pretty easily. Now with the raising admittance rate its harder to find a parking spot and Regis (from what i have heard) will/has started to charge $10 a day for parking. This is SCAM. 

FOOD: The food at Regis SUCKS. Everything is bland and boring. The cafeteria has comment cards to rate how they're doing, and every time i would give them constructive criticism the staff would always take it down."
College Sophomore,2,The rent in Denver has gone up in price and it is almost the same to just live on campus and not have to worry about parking
College Sophomore,2,You must check in all guests when entering the residence halls (even grandmas) which is very annoying and a hassle. There are also bags checks 4 times a year in all underclassmen residence halls.
College Freshman,2,This area seems dangerous to me
College Freshman,2,I think they are way too strict
College Senior,2,There really are not scholarships available for the graduate programs and that means that the only way to pay is to take out government loans.
College Freshman,2,There are a couple close chain restaurants....but nothing good.
College Freshman,2,Not the best part of town.
College Freshman,2,"The office will work with you to find out what's going on, but they have been wrong in the past and don't really know what they are doing most of the time."
College Freshman,2,"Since it is a Jesuit school, they are fairly strict about everything."
College Senior,2,"I feel the financial aid assistance is not very good. When I contacted them for assistance or ideas regarding my tuition problem, I was told to find a community college to attend or apply for scholar ships. That they could not help me. This has made me feel hopeless on trying to complete my degree."
College Senior,2,"I feel safe during the day on campus, but not right outside campus or anywhere on or near the campus at night."
College Senior,2,"Since there are so few areas, everyone knows everyone and everyone remembers you if you do something embarrassing. You also can't find too much variety in the nightlife."
College Senior,2,Diversity is lacking in the school.
College Senior,2,The weather in the state is very unpredictable. As s result activities are planned accordingly. Its always advisable to have a jacket handy because the weather can change unexpectedly.
College Senior,2,There's none. You have to go off campus for any sign of night life.
College Sophomore,2,There are not many choices for off-campus dining that are within walking distance.
College Freshman,2,I rarely get involve in such things.
College Freshman,2,There is a lot of white folks around here. We need more diversity!!
College Junior,2,"The only help for financial aid is if you have no money. There are no chances for aid and the counselors are aweful at advising and giving you extra help. No one seems to go the extra mile a Jewish person seems to, to get you to stay at Regis."
College Sophomore,2,they don't know how to diagnose
College Sophomore,2,its cold which is miserable
College Sophomore,2,"I'm apart of the athletics and all the coaches have bad reviews with the student. as well as the athletic board, they have no idea how to do their jobs. "
College Sophomore,2,There are NEVER any close parking spaces.
College Freshman,2,The accessible eating places are all fast food chains. To get any decent meal you will have to drive about twenty minutes
College Freshman,2,"The campus consists mostly of wealthy, white, conservative, catholics"
College Freshman,2,The campus safety is horrible. You are not safe off OR on campus. Some people are amazing friends and others are just mean. The professors may be hard but do care about your success
College Freshman,2,You have to live on campus for the first two years but the area surrounding the school is extremely dangerous so you wouldn't want to live off campus anyway
College Freshman,2,There is not enough to do on campus and the surrounding area is too dangerous
College Freshman,2,There are only two dining options
College Freshman,2,There are only two campus dining options and they don't have much variety when it comes to the menu
College Freshman,2,Everything i fast food. It is convenient but if you want a good meal you'll have to drive about twenty minutes.
College Freshman,2,There is very little diversity. The campus consists of almost all white students. There isn't really discrimination but it can be hard to be a minority. 
College Junior,2,Campus Safety doesn't do a very good job at responding to students. They would rather have you call PD and have you wait for PD to respond in 15-20 minutes than respond to you in 5 minutes.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are all very close to classes on campus and they are pretty clean most of the time. Unfortunately, the value of the dorm rooms when compared with the cost and the severe restrictions makes them highly unattractive. I will not be living on campus next year."
College Sophomore,2,"The amount of financial aid that Regis gives out seems generous, however they will reduce the scholarship if you do not live on campus and they charge an obscene amount of money to live on campus. Also, trying to get a change in your financial aid reward is like pulling teeth."
College Junior,2,People at this school definitely seem to be stuck in high school.
College Junior,2,"They were helpful to an extent, but there is not much available to CPS students outside of FASFA."
College Sophomore,2,"Apartments in downtown Denver are very expensive! South of the city, where I live, the apartments are nice and more reasonable, but the commute is terrible in the morning and at 5:00 pm.  If the neighborhoods around Regis were rehabbed, it would be very convenient and I would rent as soon as possible!"
College Senior,2,"Very average I suppose. Located just outside of downtown Denver, it would be nice if the school offered discounted mass transit passes. Most students work and live downtown so it would help a large part of the student body."
College Senior,2,"I think there needs to be more diversity at Regis University. Sometimes the minorities feel uncomfortable in some areas. Although I no that Regis is increasing in diversity and religion, I feel like the cost of the school shys minorities away."
College Junior,2,While I do enjoy the food here it can get super expensive for an off campus student like me which forces me off campus to buy food or make my own lunch because it's less expensive. I heard the cafeteria food gets bland after a while too. I heard we used to be able to use our flex dollars off campus but they got rid of that my freshmen year.
College Freshman,2,There aren't a variety of sports at Regis and none of them are a very big deal. They are fun to go to and the intermerials are fun to play on. overall pretty average.
College Freshman,2,"There is only a shuttle bus that drives around from the farthest lot to the actual campus, and if someone is a commuter they either take the publicbus or their own car but even then parking is a drag because there is not enough close parking spots to the campus itself."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Because of the fact that Regis has a campus in Colorado Springs, it makes transportation a difficulty if you do not have a car. One definitely needs a car in order to attend the Colorado Springs Campus, but Denver's transit is a lot better because it is in a bigger city."
Recent Alumnus,2,"This does not apply to me because I have a house, but for those looking to rent, the Denver area would be better because the city is bigger. Also in Denver they have good security with parking and housing."
College Sophomore,2,"I have never really felt all that safe on Regis Campus.  We are not in the best part of time, so there is a lot of crime around campus.  Also, our campus safety personnel don't walk around campus as much as one would like, so on will be walking across campus alone at night and not see anybody.  Campus safety also takes a bit long to respond, and they do not seem too interested in protecting anyone on campus."
College Junior,2,"It can be hard to find a place to park that is close. There is a supplemental lot that has plenty of spots,  but it at least 100 yards away on the other side of a sports field. You have to make sure you come at least 15 min early to park and walk to class."
College Freshman,2,"We're a small, D2 university. We don't have a football team and our basketball team hasn't had a positive record in the past 6 years. I would be willing to give a higher grade if events OTHER than volleyball and soccer were attended, but I can't say that they are. Our volleyball and soccer teams are pretty good so they get good turnouts, but none of the other sports get any love. The fans aren't very encouraging or cheery for any others sports either. Our field house, where basketball and volleyball games are housed, is old and gets ridiculously hot. We don't have a fancy stadium for soccer and lacrosse either, just a few rows of bleachers. Our school could definitely use upgrades to our facilities and our fans."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus security is very strict especially about checking in and showing visitors in the dorms.  they are also very strict with parking, no permit, not in overnight lot; parking ticket."
College Sophomore,2,The ratio here is 70;30 Girls to guys so it might be hard to find an available guy.  I have a boyfriend outside of school so its no an issue for me but for some girls it could be.
College Freshman,2,The food is good if you're vegan or vegetarian. It's pretty average as far as quality goes.
College Freshman,2,Lots of students at Regis like to party. There are usually keg parties in the surrounding neighborhoods Thursdays through Sundays. Drugs aren't that big of a deal here and many (if not the majority) of people use marijuana but are not pressured into doing so if they don't want to.
College Sophomore,2,"The school aims to add diversity to the school, which is a problem because the white kids are discriminated against by the ethnic staff.  A lot of sports scholarships go to foreign students who have been recruited to the University, not only to play, but to add to the diversity.  Most of the people I know have the same religion, but religion is not an issue on campus, nor is sexual orientation.  We are a community working toward riding the social stereotypes of certain groups."
College Junior,2,"i KNOW i SIGN A PLAGIARISM FORM, BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY ENFORCE IT.  I SUPPOSE KARMA GETS BACK TO YOU IF YOU'RE CHEATING.  BEST NOT TO TAKE THE CHANCE"
Senior,1,"When we switched over online the end of this last semester, it was a disaster. A few of my teachers embraced the new way of teaching and helped students succeed but many of them struggled greatly with the technology and then blamed the problems on the student. There was a severe lack of communication from the teachers, even after several attempts of reaching out. I was greatly disappointed in the way they handled online classes."
Senior,1,"Regis wants to be diverse and accepting of everyone but they are not. They cover up many problems most of them dealing with safety and health concerns of students. While there are also some good professors, many of them do not encourage different thinking and only allow they're way of thinking. Something needs to change as many people leave because of these problems."
Sophomore,1,"My experience with this University was horrendous. They had a cyber attack that disabled all of their major systems at the beginning of the year. I was not registered for my class until way after it started because they lost all my information. The administrative faculty at this institution do not communicate with each other at all and know nothing. To handle any admin issue, you will end up going through about 5 people. Their learning software is also completely out-of-date. This university went back on it's firm commitment to honor my active military tuition rate. Disgraceful."
Graduate Student,1,"Don't bother if you actually want to learn anything.  

So, I was in the MFA for Creative Writing program, which is low residency.  It was shockingly bad.  Most of the instructors didn't actually spend their time teaching -- either because they didn't know their stuff or they were too busy political grandstanding.  Instead of the promised 10 hours of class per day, there were 2-5 hours per day.  

I witnessed multiple instances of various professors kicking students out of class because the students politely disagreed or weren't enthusiastic enough -- and the administration backed them up on this!  I hate to give places 1-star reviews, but this was an appalling waste of money."
Junior,1,"If you don't already have a job in the computer programming world, do not bother going to Regis through their online computer science degree program. The program has many errors in both the content, the instructions, and even in the grading of assignments. The cost of their program is incredibly expensive, unacceptably so with the errors they have in their own coursework.

You also spend all of your time reading and teaching yourself since there are little to no videos available. This is fine if you have experience in the field already or are fine with reading a textbook, but if you are looking for someone to actually teach you this is not the location you want to go. 

Over priced, little to no help, error in the course work so buyer beware!"
Niche User,1,I felt Regis University was very deceptive in the application and financial aid process. I was also unaware that the curriculum was religious based when I registered for classes.
College Sophomore,1,Regis doesn't have Greek life
College Freshman,1,We actually don't have any Greek life. I wish we did.
College Freshman,1,Do not have greek life.
College Freshman,1,"There are few to no parties. We are a good, Jesuit school."
College Junior,1,"For the price you have to pay to go there, no body seems willing to lend support or help in any way regarding financial aid. There are no scholarships if you have a bachelors degree already and the process of getting a loan is a headache."
College Sophomore,1,they just want to steal money
College Sophomore,1,they force you to live on campus 2 years which is extremely expensive and off campus living is cheaper but the area around is so unsafe
College Sophomore,1,the tech support only helps teachers and the wifi is awful
College Sophomore,1,everyone is high and drunk
College Sophomore,1,sucks to eat in the caf and junk food in grill
College Sophomore,1,"the professor mostly suck, there are a few good teachers"
College Sophomore,1,this is a jesuit school that helps out poor mexicans mixed with snooty rich white bible loving folk and there is not a lot of mixing .
College Sophomore,1,you have to go downtown if you want to have any fun
College Sophomore,1,pretty campus but too small

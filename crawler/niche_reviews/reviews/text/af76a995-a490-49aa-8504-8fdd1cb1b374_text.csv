Sophomore,5,"I love Williams College. My first year there was the best year of my life. The people there changed my life. There's so many different people meeting and connecting that wouldn't have been able to meet outside of Williams. I adore everything about it. It's an extraordinary place. Students are intelligent, kind, hilarious, and driven. The academics are wonderful. First semester I had a big single, my largest class was 12 students (I had two tutorial-style classes with two students total and a five-person class), and professors ate lunch with me often and chatted to me everywhere. There's nothing you can't do there. Everything is provided for you in every way. It's also the most beautiful place ever. You can literally see mountains from your window!!! You will know when you step on campus if it's right for you. I often confuse my family and friends by referring to going back to Williams as ""going home"". I'm going to cry like no one has ever seen before when I leave there."
Sophomore,5,"Williams' online experience was as organized and professional as it goes. In particular, computer science was done extremely well. Of course it pales in comparison to in-person classes at Williams. This college just tosses you free money, I swear. They gave so much for relief funds. If you are on any amount of substantial financial aid you should never worry about them not giving you enough."
Alum,5,"TL;DR: Williams is one of the best schools out there, especially for economically underprivileged and/or international students. Apply even if you think you won’t get in!

Financials: I am a recent alumnus from a foreign country who had to pay less than 3K per year(!) towards my education at Williams; the rest was covered by non-repayable Williams grants. The College also pays for your medical insurance, ALL book expenditures, yearly round-trip to your home country (with all expenses). Other one-off expenses they covered: getting a visa, passport renewal, dental expenditures (over $10K). For someone who comes from a poor family whose total earnings are less than $30K/year, all this was an enormous benefit!

Academics: Williams is very strong because its professors take time to teach you the material. 1-1 teaching sessions, research work with professors is easily attainable because professors care about their students. 

Exit opportunities: plentiful, prosperous, and very accessible!"
Junior,5,Williams has been the highlight of my life! The academics are challenging but fun and you are surrounded by people who are also very interested in the courses and extracurriculars that they join. Everyone at Williams is brilliant but is also incredibly passionate and/or amazing at something else. That's what is beautiful about it. You never stop being amazed at what people (and you) do inside and outside of the classroom.
Niche User,5,"Williams College is situated in the rural area of Williamstown, Massachusetts. The staff and administration on campus are very friendly and approachable. The small class size allows students to connect with their teaches and have a fitting academic experience."
Freshman,5,"Williams College is very liberal with a very diverse group of students and expert professors. Theater, performing arts, art, dancing, and drawing are good fields to study at this college."
Junior,5,"Our son chose Williams as his first choice knowing how difficult it is to get in and how well known it is for its challenging curriculum. He has thrived on all fronts and met the challenges of the difficult curriculum and feels that he has ultimately made the right choice. His professors are engaging and available for discussion. He thrives on the knowledge that his peers are all working as hard as he is. The library is home to him many evenings and he says that he stayed to closing many nights. In spite of the rigor, he has found many friends and has time for the social aspect of college. He also says that thye food is great. We couldn't be happier that he chose Williams. He had other choices, but Williams just felt right."
Niche User,5,Williams College has an excellent campus with extraordinary facilities-based for student research and learning.
Alum,5,"Williams was extremely rewarding academically. I felt more than prepared for life after college. You are really able to take control of your education, and there are more than enough resources to ensure that you are supported."
Alum,5,"Williams College creates an environment in which students are challenged to delve deeply into their studies and grow exponentially as learners, while maintaining a supportive, collaborative culture. The school asks important questions and continuously reflects upon itself to attempt to address the concerns of its students."
Freshman,5,"The people are passionate, eager to help, and deeply intellectual. The idyllic college town surroundings make studying natural."
Senior,5,I really love Williams and how the college small is. The professors make time to really get to know you and many of them are often available for office hours.
Sophomore,5,The classes are very engaging and the liberal arts education is outstanding. I have taken classes from drawing 100 to discrete math to sociology 324 within my first year at the school and I have really enjoyed them all.
Senior,5,"Williams is an excellent school- you just have to know what you're getting into and what's great about it.
Exceptional attention from world renowned faculty (6:1 student faculty really shows-- I have a lab with 3 other students and a professor). Also faculty go out of their way to make themselves available to students outside of classes.
The other big advantage of Williams is the alumni relations. Williams beats out Harvard/Yale/etc in how committed alumni are to helping students out.
Williams has a strong athletic community and a strong artsy community. Almost everyone engages in outdoor activities in one form or another (varsity sports, hiking in the Berkshires, skiing, tennis...). Small school, so you know the names of almost everyone on campus, and enriches the experience. 
Williams is definitely a different type of academic experience, and it's def not a huge party school. 
The school is incredibly supportive and will support you in any interests."
Niche User,5,"Williams College earns its title as the finest Liberal Arts College in the nation with each student, professor, faculty member, and so on. The small college is diversified and accepting. It challenges its students to become thoughtful citizens and go into their respective fields knowledgeable, cooperative, adaptable."
Freshman,5,"In addition to the stellar academics, supportive faculty and staff, and countless extracurricular opportunities, the people you will meet at Williams make the college truly special. Everyone is there to learn and to grow, and within months you will find people you can call your family. Though the courses are challenging, every professor pushes you to be your absolute best, and to stay true to your own talents and interests, in and outside of the classroom."
Niche User,5,"I visited campus in July. The setting was beautiful, as was the outside community. This is my top choice and I would totally love to go here to continue my education."
Alum,5,WIlliams is a fantastic school full of talented faculty and students. Staff is deeply caring and kind. Academics are very strong and the level of individualized attention per student is really unique.
Freshman,5,"A wonderful place to learn and grow from a young adult to a contributing member of society. Williams provides its students with innumerable opportunities during their time there. The professors are brilliant and interested in getting to know each of their students, which is something very valuable that our bigger peer institutions don’t have."
Alum,5,"I loved the campus and the people.  Williams has a very cooperative-feeling atmosphere and grades are hardly ever mentioned--if there's competing, it's only with yourself.  While there's not much of a town around Williams, there's always more than enough things to do on campus to keep you busy."
Sophomore,5,"Williams College provides its students with a challenging academic environment where students are encouraged to engage with their professors. The student body is extremely friendly and diverse. There are always events on campus, whether its a guest lecture, film screening, or concert. The dorms are a little less exciting, but not bad. The food and party scene aren't amazing. Overall, though, it's an awesome place."
Freshman,5,"You should definitely think about what you want from a college before deciding to come here. For international students like myself, socializing could be awkward and the loneliness could seem unbearable at times. But by no means is that the case for the 90% of people who are not internationals. I am in love with the views and I even had my first snow 2 weeks ago: it was pretty cool."
Freshman,5,"Even though we are a small school in the middle of nowhere, the amount and range of opportunities you will find on campus are unbeatable. That along with the focus on community building makes this place truly spectacular."
Sophomore,5,This place is cool. I am challenged every day academically and continue to grow and enrich my mind. The surroundings are beautiful and full of a vibrant culture.
Junior,5,"Williams is the perfect combination of everything I was looking for in a college: and quirky and well-rounded student body, academics that will challenge you beyond belief, and a hyper-supportive network of peers and professors. "
Sophomore,5,"I love Williams. If you're going to college to learn and improve academically, athletically, artistically, or however else Williams is the best place in the world to do it all. "
College Senior,5,"Courses are almost invariably high-quality--interesting, educative, but very difficult. Professors are the best in their field, and most are here simply because they care about educating the next generation. There's a lot of variety among courses, though this is more true of humanities (sciences can only get so creative). Classes are typically discussion-based, not lecture, and sizes are small."
College Senior,5,"It's difficult, but so worth it. A degree from Williams really means a lot--the academics are top-notch, the instruction is unbeatable, and the overall quality of life is very high. If I could, I would choose Williams all over again--and again, and again, and again."
College Sophomore,5,"best part about williams is the people, profs and students. profs love their jobs and their students so the level of teaching is really high and other students are super bright, making collaboration less of a chore and more of an opportunity to learn from your peers."
College Sophomore,5,"Had the most amazing experience. I LOVED every class I took. I was able to get to know all of my professors personally, and I even went out for tea with my philosophy professor a few times. The students aren't crazy eccentric, like I kind of hoped for, but if you actually talk to them, they are really interesting and have some amazing things going on in their heads. For me, it was very difficult to balance my workload with my athletics at first, but Williams has many great resources to help you out when you're freaking out, wondering how you're going to get everything done, and there are a ton of fun things to do to relieve the inevitable stress."
College Sophomore,5,"Although the name isn't recognized by most of the general public, the employers you're going to want to work for and the graduate schools you'll want to go to have a lot of respect for a Williams degree. Also Williams has a ton of connections through successful alums and partners. I got an internship super easily for the summer before my sophomore year."
College Sophomore,5,"Athletic teams are a big part of Williams. The gym is great for athletes, as well as the many fields and the trainer centers for injuries, but it's not all accessable to ""non-ers""."
College Sophomore,5,"Williams is an amazing place to get an excellent education and has MANY opportunities available that make the tuition worth it. There are also some really interesting people there. However, as it only accepts the best students, it's highly skilled at breaking the egos of the fresh-out-of-high-school valedictorians who think they an do everything and be the best at everything. The workload is intentionally heavy enough that you need to ask for help to get through it, but overall, Williams really allows you to bond with your fellow students through the hard work and makes every student stronger once they make it through it's challenges."
College Freshman,5,"I always feel safe on campus because Campus Safety and Security do a great job of keeping us safe. It really does feel like a purple bubble, however that is not to say that sexual assault doesn't happen on campus. I have heard of a couple of cases of it, but that's it."
College Freshman,5,"This school is a Little-Ivy and the academics demonstrate it. I have really seen the power that comes from this level of academic rigor through my deep understanding of course materials and subjects. The alumni network is very extensive and powerful, and the career services center on campus works hard to make an idea for an internship possible."
College Freshman,5,All of the professors I have had so far are excellent because they show how much they really care about you understanding the material and doing well in class!
College Freshman,5,"I really enjoy being at my college. It is academically challenging while being engaging. The professors love teaching their subjects, and I have learned the value of a liberal arts education by taking classes in many different areas of study, which are helping me become a well-rounded scholar. I really like it here! The relatively small class sizes allow me to get to know my professors and classmates, which helps me learn better, as I can approach my professors comfortably during office hours and form study groups with my fellow classmates. I would choose my school again if I could do it all over because it has everything I want and need: small classes, passionate professors, engaging courses, welcoming atmosphere, beautiful location, and the list can go on!"
College Junior,5,"Awesome experience. Very community-oriented school. I love this place. Great people. Everyone wants to help you, the professors are amazing."
College Junior,5,"Williams has been the perfect place for me. My professors have been incredible mentors--I've gone to three professors' houses for dinner. The location is beautiful, and perfect for focusing on academics. I've been able to get very involved in all my clubs and really find what makes me passionate. But best of all is the people. They're all smart and talented and wonderful. I am so lucky."
College Freshman,5,"Campus security is amazing. They are super helpful and always offer a ride if they see you walking to class. Even better, they don't bust parties if there is no hard alcohol and most things are in solo cups."
College Freshman,5,"The Freshman housing system is unparalleled. The entry system is, in a word, immaculate. It's easily my favorite part about Williams, and I know very few people who disagree with that. I don't know much about upperclassmen housing, but I know that almost all housing is desirable; there are very few bad options."
College Sophomore,5,Love Tim at financial aid. He's great.
College Sophomore,5,"If you're intelligent/responsible about what you are doing, you can do nearly anything you'd like."
Recent Alumnus,5,Sports were a lot of fun for both athletes and non-athletes on campus!
College Junior,5,"Williams has a very welcoming culture regarding alcohol and drugs.  If you're into it, great.  If not, also great."
College Junior,5,"I would do it again.  I'm looking to go into a research career, and doing research at Williams was a great introduction."
College Junior,5,"I did research at Williams last summer.  I grew a great deal as a thinker, and had a great time doing it."
College Freshman,5,"The top notch academics, competative sports, lengthy history, and success of alumni make Williams a difficult school to compare against any other. The social scene is the only lacking aspect of life on campus when compared to a full size university, but the positives far outweigh any negatives, and most students find they have a consistently enjoyable time on the weekends."
College Freshman,5,I got a great financial aid package!
College Freshman,5,The school police are so nice!
College Freshman,5,It's amazing to be here and I feel lucky everyday.
College Freshman,5,No greek life. That's one of the reasons I applied here.
College Sophomore,5,"What you need, you will receive."
College Sophomore,5,"Williams' academics are some of the best in the world. It is not hard to find students who chose Williams over Harvard, Princeton, Yale and/or Stanford. With a 7:1 student to faculty ratio and a mean class size of 13, you don't have  to work hard to connect with your professors in any class. The workload is fierce and Williams is not the place to come and slack off. However, if you're looking for some of the best professors with the brightest students and the most resources before and after college, Williams might be the place for your. Williams is strong in pretty much all departments, but the most popular majors are Math, Art History, Biology, Economics, Chemistry, and Psychology."
College Sophomore,5,"Arguably the best overall education you'll get at any college or university in the country. Small classes, interested and expert professors, no TAs teaching classes, no grad students to distract profs, tons of summer research, huge endowment, free tutoring in any class, cooperation instead of competition among students, big workload (it's why we came here), brilliant students, job and graduate program placement rivaling the top major universities, etc. We don't need rankings to tell us that we're the best... but they do anyway :)"
College Freshman,5,"You will probably not be able to find an undergraduate education of this caliber at any other school. The professors here are, for the most part, stellar. A considerable amount of them are at the top of their respective fields. Because the college does not pressure them into doing research or field work, and they don't have any grad students to deal with, their sole priority is to teach you, get to know you, and make themselves available to interact with you. TAs are present only occasionally to grade shorter writing assignments or help with labs; all of your courses will be taught 100% of the time by professors. There are a wide variety of course offerings. The workload at Williams is infamously described as brutal, but with the amount of flexibility that most students have in their schedules it is still easier to manage than taking 4 APs every semester in high school."
College Sophomore,5,"Hard, but Amazing – Williams is the #1 liberal arts school in the country. Its hard. But teachers are always willing to help. and there are SO many resources available - tutoring, essay helpers, writing workshops, academic disabilities centers. There is no reason someone should not be thriving at williams, as long as they are putting the work in"
College Sophomore,5,"Williams' divisional requirement introduces students to a broad and diverse way of thinking. By allowing students to come into contact with all subject matter (math, sciences, english, drama, etc.), Williams truly does offer as fine a portfolio of courses as any institution in the nation."
College Sophomore,5,"Professors Are AMAZING – All of the professors I've had are extremely engaging and really care about their students' learning experiences. They love going out to coffee, lunch or dinner with students to continue the fascinating discussion in class."
College Sophomore,5,There are both Macs and PCs available. Most students have their own laptops but the library computers are great and almost always open.
Alum,4,"Professors tried really hard to deliver the material in an interesting way. For some classes -- such as languages & arts, humanities, and social sciences -- this did not work great, but STEM & Natural Sciences classes worked perhaps even better this way. The College instituted mandatory pass-fail, which greatly reduced student participation and efforts inputted. The College offered to give laptops & paid internet access (satellite) to any student that required this. Moreover, their financial support during this time was unparalleled -- they gave me about $5K with all refunds (note: I'm on 99% finaid so I didn't actually pay even a fifth of this) which has been very helpful during the school year and now in the summer."
Freshman,4,"A very small community compared to most colleges out there. The campus is nice and beautiful, surrounded by beautiful mountains. Professors are very open and approachable. Academics may be a bit intense and students often spend a lot of their time doing homework or studying for tests and exams.
If you are interested in liberal arts education then this may be the place for you. However, keep in mind that it is in the middle of nowhere and if you don't have a car, it is very difficult to get around, even to the store."
Sophomore,4,"I love Williams. I understand that's very much a topic of debate on this campus, but I love this campus for what its given to me. I've made incredible friends, met brilliant professors, and so much more. When it comes to political tensions, at the end of the day, this campus is no different from any other liberal arts college, and if anything, I truly appreciate that administration tries to work with the students to resolve problems, even if the resolutions themselves fall short. I think by the time I graduate, I will have grown more as a student and as a person, which is more than what I can say if I went anywhere else."
Alum,4,"Overall, I had a great experience at Williams. I felt that I was able to approach my professors and get the help that I needed if I needed it. Both of those factors made the academic experience less daunting. Socially, I was able to create my own niche by having multiple on-campus jobs and joining different clubs. It exposed me to a group of people that I felt comfortable being around. 

Other than that, I wish Williams could change its policies toward what is tolerated within the campus community. It seems that certain issues are addressed in a way that makes the issue look resolved at surface level, but the problem still persists in different forms."
Niche User,4,The people at Williams are extremely nice and concerned about everyone else's well being. The staff and students all work together towards the common goal of educating one another and progressing both as individuals and as a whole. The campus is absolutely breathtaking as well. The huge oak trees which line the walkways are beautiful and are a testament to the age and grandeur of the college.
Sophomore,4,I like the people I've met and made friends with. It's been very affordable. But the institution is very old. The college can too long to catch up with things that are important to the students though.
Sophomore,4,The people are great and professors care about your education. Every one is always smiling and people are so friendly.
Freshman,4,"Williams has a proper community feel to it; it's nice be able to look around you and be able to recognize a bunch of the people of around you. If you'd like some anonymity, this isn 't the place for you. 

Having said that: the people and professors are great, the academics are challenging but not impossible, and its relatively easy get into the classes you want."
Junior,4,"Great professors, they really care about their students and will go out of their way to more sure you understand the material."
Freshman,4,"This school is great if you are looking for a small-knit, college community. Everyone, from students to professors, are nice, welcoming, and available. However, the school is in the middle of nowhere, and the social scene can feel stale. At a small school like this, if you are a minority, the lack of diversity can be disappointing since you could know every POC on campus within a few months,  but percentage wise  a lot better here than a lot of other liberal arts schools."
Freshman,4,"Williams College is a great institution with a lot of generous alumni and phenomenal academics. Despite being very small and not as well-known as its counterparts, it has held the highest ranking for liberal arts colleges for fourteen years. I am only a second semester freshman, but I have felt how strong the warm and welcoming environment of this campus. The entry system, which places about 20 freshman with two JAs (junior advisors), along with the orientation activities like WOOLF, give freshmen a sort of friend safety net which they can rely on. The school does a wonderful job of introducing students to each other in such a stressful and new environment. Academically, Williams goes above and beyond with the classes offered as well as with the kinds of relationships that can be formed with professors. Overall, a fantastic and supportive institution."
College Senior,4,"Though Williams is small and relatively unknown among the general population, those who matter know what it is. The alumni network is a great resource, and the career center is very helpful--you just have to ask for help first!"
College Senior,4,Some options are a little distant--especially the more spacious ones--so this makes winter difficult. But in general the options are all very high-quality.
College Senior,4,"Williams' sports programs are some of the best in the country. Athletes are well-supported by administration, professors, and other students. However, the varsity athlete culture can be at times toxic--teams operate like frats in some senses."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of seminars and discussions at he beginning of the year and before Winter Study to train you to prevent sexual assault by being an active bystander and to know how to take care of your friends. Drinking is a big part of the social scene here. Fortunately, since it is a small campus, I usually know the people I'm partying with really well and always have friends with me, so I feel safe. But a story about a girl a few years ago who was raped by a hockey player and had a hard time because the guy was very popular and a lot of the campus turned against her for speaking out. The hockey player was kicked out and she transferred to Columbia. What was extremely appalling was that the administration reaccepted that hockey player as a student this year."
College Sophomore,4,"Everything is close enough to walk to classes, and if you're farther away, you're rewarded with bigger rooms. What I really liked was that most dorms are actually singles, which is super nice to have your privacy and not be embarrassed to fart."
College Freshman,4,"I am not an athlete myself, however, the athletic facilities of the school seem to be great for those who are athletes. I do go to the gym regularly and the equipment there is excellent!"
College Sophomore,4,Not much crime around here. No one steals anything. I leave my room unlock.
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy being in classes here, but the work gets overwhelming. People are great but very cliquy."
College Sophomore,4,The alumni network is great. Easy to use. But the career center sucks.
College Sophomore,4,"Williams offer a lot of chances to study abroad, but the social scene is very very limited."
College Senior,4,Most people will live on campus all four years. It's not a bad deal!
College Senior,4,"The facilities have everything you could need as a varsity or non-varsity athlete. With our new football/lacrosse field and track, we have it made! Still, with an active there is always competition for prime field time, and IM sports are relegated either to early/late hours or ungroomed fields."
College Senior,4,"I have loved my time at Williams! The best part of my experience has been the people here, and as a senior trying to figure out post graduate plans, I am comforted by the willingness to help and commitment to the College from alumni. Go Ephs!"
College Junior,4,Could be better but overall good.
College Junior,4,"Could have better facilities. Otherwise, great."
College Freshman,4,Having visitors is pretty easy. One of the officers is the worst but otherwise they're generally lenient about weed and alcohol.
College Freshman,4,"I like that it's not hard to get a single as a freshman, and it's pretty much possible no matter what number you draw for the rest of the years (location might be less than great though). I love the entry system freshman year and wish there was something more like that for the rest of your years."
College Freshman,4,"Some really good restaurants are in the area, and they span a pretty impressive variety of food: sushi/East Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, Mexican, American, and a few pizza delivery places to boot. The quality is pretty good, and the prices are reasonable - especially at lunchtime."
College Freshman,4,"There are options every Friday and Saturday night, especially at the off-campus houses on Hoxsey Street. These parties are all-inclusive; anyone can go. However, it's not at all the only thing to do at night. There are plenty of things to do every weekend, like Get Baked ( a baking club ), any of the infinitely many student performances, or snack bar at Paresky."
College Freshman,4,"It's honestly really good for dining hall food, and there are many options for each meal. Snack bar is a godsend, and you can get anything from breakfast food to salads to sandwiches to pizza to nachos to fried food extraordinaire. However, they do tend to repeat meals, so sometimes it gets a bit boring."
College Freshman,4,Dining services works extremely hard to provide students will quality meal options. There's pretty good variety and most dining halls are all you can eat so that's a plus.
College Freshman,4,Very satisfied with my living arrangements.
College Sophomore,4,There is limited off-campus housing but the rectory and meadow are great places to live especially if you want to be hosting parties.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a variety of room setups, and the housing process is fairly simple. The rooms are nice, most offer smaller private common areas in addition to larger common spaces to be used by the whole dorm. Dorms are clean, custodial staff is very nice, and not many students share a bathroom. WiFi is sketchy at times, but not terrible. Additionally, as it's a small school you normally end up knowing you neighbors and having friends that live near you, even if it is unintentional. In my opinion, housing at Williams is better than the housing offered at most other schools."
College Sophomore,4,"Students at Williams are generally attractive. Most students frequent the gym, whether they are athletes are not, and overall the student body is good looking."
College Sophomore,4,"Teams consistently perform well, but student support could stand to improve. Certain sports always draw big crowds, but others could use more support. Athletic facilities are good- the gym is modern, athletic facilities are well taken care of, and the new Weston field is state-of-the art."
College Sophomore,4,"I think the student body at Williams is representative of nearly all walks of life. While certain socioeconomic classes are certainly more represented than others, overall a variety of backgrounds are present on campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Computers were definitely available at school, but almost every I knew used their own laptop. School computers were good to use for running heavier programs like Stata for economics."
College Junior,4,"All in all, dorms at Williams are pretty solid.  That said, I realize that I personally would prefer to live off-campus -- most people do not feel this way."
College Junior,4,"Williamstown is a bit far from other major cities -- the closest large city is Albany, New York, which is forty minutes away.  But there are relatively good transportation options.  For local travel in the Williamstown area, Williams College has an agreement with the local transportation so that Williams College students get to ride the buses for free, which come frequently.  For traveling farther, Williams provides weekend shuttles to Boston and New York."
College Junior,4,Campus Safety is great -- they're relatively well-liked on campus.
College Junior,4,"Lots of solid computers to use, labs are never too crowded.  You get plenty of free printing.  The wireless network is okay -- it can be slow or unresponsive at times."
College Junior,4,"If you're already a math superstar (i.e., have gone to MOSP/IMO, done some research, etc.), then Williams might not be the best place for you --- liberal arts college in general will have more limited math departments.  Otherwise, the math major does a great job of being both welcoming, and challenging/comprehensive (if you want that)."
College Freshman,4,"It takes an intense adjustment period during freshman year to figure things out, but the resources available on campus are incredible and make the HEAVY workload much more managable. Nobody who goes here can afford to be above seeking help."
College Junior,4,Virtually everyone is fit at Williams.
College Freshman,4,You don't declare your major until the end of your sophomore year. The bad thing is that Williams doesn't offer minors.
College Freshman,4,Mission is the best. Avoid Whitman's.
College Freshman,4,"Mission is far from the center of campus, but has its own dining hall, which happens to be arguably the best one on campus. Frosh quad is in the center of campus and is more pretty, but has less amenities and is older."
College Freshman,4,They don't bust you; they help you be safe. They're more like your guardians
College Freshman,4,"People here generally get along, no matter their ethnic, cultural, or socioeconomic background"
College Freshman,4,"Campus security is there to help you, not to punish you"
College Freshman,4,"You will always be able to find a free computer at Williams because there are plenty of labs and free computers. The infrastructure of computers is also quite good, and the Office of Information Technology is effective. However, the network, Purple Air, is notorious for its lack of speed and patchiness in coverage, especially during crunch time."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the housing here is excellent, and although some sophomores get slightly screwed over, almost anyone can live in a single should they want to. Freshman housing is one of the best things about Williams because the Entry System becomes one of the highlights of your first year."
College Sophomore,4,"Off-campus dining is surprisingly good for such a small area. There is good pizza, sushi, thai, indian, sandwiches, coffee, chinese, ice cream and mexican all within walking or biking distance. The meals I've had are all pretty good and I don't feel like I'm missing much. That being said, there isn't much in the way of student discounts so you probably can't really eat off campus every day."
College Sophomore,4,"The three main things that set Williams apart from other schools are our entries/JAs, our tutorials, and Winter study. Entries are groups of about 20 freshmen who are picked to live together. They are designed specially to be as diverse in terms of interests, socioeconomics, and cultures as is the larger student body. These become most students' first friends and are there to be whatever the students wants them to be. JAs, or Junior Advisors, are two unpaid Juniors who opted to live with and mentor the freshman for a whole year. They do not have any disciplinary power but are there, instead, to ease the transition into college life. Tutorials are classes that are composed of only 2 students and a professor. They are offered in every subject and consist of weekly meetings where students alternate either creating a work of some sort (a paper, a song, a computer program, etc.), and critiquing that of the other student. Winter study is our J-term where students each take 1, usually unorthodox class and have a lot more time to socialize and do activities around campus than they normally do."
College Sophomore,4,"Williams is beautiful in a modernist way. Although the lack of stereotypical gothic architecture is noticeable, the fall foliage, hundreds of acres of forest, and mountains in every direction probably make up for it. Relatively new facilities include the student center, the science library, part of the athletic center, the center for performing arts, and a number of other academic buildings. Although our main library is kind of an eyesore, a new one is currently being built to replace it. Clubs and student organizations play a large role in running the school and almost everyone can find a few to get involved in if they look."
College Sophomore,4,"Williams is a powerhouse of Div III athletics. We have one the directors cup (a competition comparing overall performance of division III schools) 14 out of the 16 years that it has been awarded. About 1/3 of all students are on varsity teams and about 1/2 of all students are involved in athletics in some capacity besides PE. Students love to go out and support the teams, especially because it is very common to have a few friends involved in various teams. Williams students pride themselves on excelling both athletically and academically and it is apparent on campus. The only areas noticeably lacking are some of our athletic facilities. Although a new football stadium is currently in the works, the main weight room and the surrounding area are a little dark, small, and/or unimpressive."
College Freshman,4,"I go to Williams College and plan on majoring in studio art. We have some great professors! The amount of studio hours required can sometimes be a lot, but I know all the hard work pays off!"
College Sophomore,4,"Students declare their major at the end of their sophomore year, which means that they get a lot of time to shop around if they are unsure. Even then, the major is not set in stone and can be changed fairly easily. Williams is a liberal arts college which means that majors are going to be general. However, that doesn't stop employers from recruiting heavily from Williams in most areas, especially since most careers require grad school or on the job training anyway. The only shortcoming that Williams has is that it does not offer an engineering major. However, students can apply for a 5 year program with Columbia University to get an engineering degree."
Niche User,2,"Don't go there if you have a food allergy. There are no apartments off campus, only a few apartments on campus and they usually go to upperclassmen. But seriously, they will starve you."
Junior,2,"Younger profs are great, but some deadwood older profs for sure. Lots of opportunities to work in labs and abroad, but campus is very isolated in the winter months."
Sophomore,2,Really disappointed. Not what I expected. Good academics but shallow. Student body. More hype than anything. Turned down Duke for this. Big mistake.
College Sophomore,2,I feel completely stranded on campus with nothing to do outside of campus life.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm glad there's not Greek life but varsity sports sort of take on the role of Greek life. Many varsity athletes are snobby and look down on ""nonners"" saying you have no social life if you're not part of a sport."
College Sophomore,2,"Same party every single day, music is a lot of bad EDM always. There's no variety in the kind of music played at all."
College Sophomore,2,Most people care only about partying and are really hollow. That's the mainstream culture of the school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Since Williams is basically in the middle of nowhere, you really need a car if you want to travel anywhere off campus."
College Freshman,2,Parties are usually pretty lame.
College Freshman,2,Nothing to do off campus. :(
College Freshman,2,Not very convenient to have a car on campus.
College Freshman,2,Many students drink. Some smoke marijuana and once in a while its smell can be felt in hallways.
College Sophomore,2,"Overall Pathetic. All Parties End at Snack Bar – Nightlife at Williams is generally limited to on-campus parties because Williamstown is small and quiet. It's also high up in the mountains in the middle of nowhere. By pure observation, I would say that students spend at least an hour pre-gaming, another half an hour looking for a party to go to, and the next few hours dancing (or not dancing...) at various locations around campus. 

There's also First Fridays, a dance that's held on the first Friday of every month. Mostly a freshman hangout spot, and the music gets old after a few times.

For those not into parties, there are alternative activities, but they are severely limited/not very well attended. Have no fear, however, because you'll find friends who like to have quieter weekends- you just have to look for them.

All parties/events ultimately end at snack bar, the late-night service in Paresky Student Center that serves gelatto, smoothies, sandwiches/burgers, salads, tea/coffee, etc. until 1am. The fact that it closes at 1am also means that most parties are finished by 1am, which is both a blessing and a curse, depending on how you want to look at it."
College Sophomore,2,"Slim Pickings – There is almost no off-campus housing available, as Williamstown is a very small town.  Over 90% of students live on campus all four years and the college residences are usually pretty nice."
College Sophomore,2,"Youll find a bunch of girls who are very cliquey and they all wear the same clothes.There are some girls that stick out , but it's like looking at a bunch of the same girls over and over"
College Sophomore,2,"Williams is located in the Berkshire Mountains, about a five minute drive from Vermont. That being said, the weather up north gets cold - fast. We had our first minimal snowfall last year in November, and once it started snowing, it barely stopped until April. The snow and the scenery are beautiful, and during Winter Study one of the best parts of January is appreciating the great winter, but after a while (around February), everyone starts to get sick of it snow and the grime it causes. When packing, definitely bring a lot of warm heavy clothing for walking (and playing!) outside, but also remember to bring lighter clothing for weekend parties and for when the weather gets nicer (as it finally does)!"
College Freshman,2,"If you have a car, there are a lot more options, but without access to transportation, finding things that are off campus and fun to do is really difficult. The town of Williamstown is gorgeous and very safe, albeit super small, and if you like the outdoors, you can find a lot more to do, especially in the spring or fall."
College Freshman,2,"Williams College doesn't award scholarships for merit or need, which can be really frustrating. However, they do offer great financial aid."
Alum,1,"To whom this may concern, I wish to express my dissatisfaction with Williams College. I arrived for my reunion last summer to rekindle my relationships with fellow classmates. I was utterly disgusted with the behavior of both the students and faculty. When I graduated from Williams in 2012, the community was much friendlier. Talking to some of the students baffled me, to say the least. I felt that they were extremely arrogant and downright disrespectful. Since my time there, Williams has changed immensely. Although it has only been six years since my graduation, it has completely changed for the worse. I was shocked to see that my peers were jobless and unsuccessful. It was clear that Williams did NOT prepare them for the real world. If you're looking for a school that possesses a warm, supportive, and intellectual atmosphere, I regret to inform you that you will certainly not find this at Williams College. Do yourself and your kids a favor, and avoid this school at all costs."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,"Williams is in the middle of no where. If you don't have a car, you can't really go anywhere except some stores such as Stop&Shop and North Adams... especially on Sundays."
College Freshman,1,"White Domination – It is not very diverse at Williams College because it consists mainly of white students. It is somewhat difficult to adjust to the social scene here because I came from a predominantly Asian high school. However, the people here are generally very nice, despite the lack of racial diversity."
College Freshman,1,No one really lives off campus. It's WILLIAMSTOWN. Off campus housing consists of a couple of apartments on Spring St (above other businesses like Goff's) and a house or  two on Hoxley Street.

Alum,5,Hawaii Pacific University was one of the best decisions I made when it came to choosing college. I met so many great friends who are considered family. Hawaii Pacific was how I figured out what I wanted to do and work towards my career. Moving away from home had let me understand how to really take care of myself.
Freshman,5,They are very helpful and amazing staff that make sure you understand everything and anything to the fullest. So don’t be scared of anyone there.
Freshman,5,They are very helpful and amazing staff that make sure you understand everything and anything to the fullest.
Freshman,5,Our teachers did a really good job during this pandemic of COVID-19 it was a different thing but overall my teachers did a great job transitioning from in class to Online.
Sophomore,5,Hawaii Pacific University made my first year in college feel like a breeze. I was able to have access to lots of activities and extra circulars. The staff at HPU this past year has been nothing but supportive and helpful even in light of the pandemic.
Sophomore,5,Hawaii Pacific University offers a place to learn with excellent professors who really care about the student. The school gives all the resources to set students up for success.
Freshman,5,Hawaii Pacific is a beautiful campus and the people are so nice which makes it easy to find friends. When i first went on my visit i was really nervous to move from arizona to hawaii and leave my family for the first time. But the university made it really easy make the change and be comfortable where i was. The Acro and Tumbling team is so supportive and made the transition way easier than i thought it was going to be.
Freshman,5,"One thing I really enjoy about Hawai’i Pacific University is the amount of opportunity that is given to everyone, the clubs are all amazing and everyone is kept up to date on new events going on as well as fun activities."
Junior,5,Hawaii Pacific University is a place where I am able to experience new cultures and people than I ever could in Ohio. I am able to go and explore the land and history of Hawaii as well as study at the same time. Hawaii Pacific University allows me to feel a part of something more just by being a student. They listen to their students and feel the need to reach out and help them as much as they can.
Freshman,5,Hawaii Pacific University is a wonderful school! The only change I would like to see is HPU having their own campus with parking and all the classes in one area as a whole.
Senior,5,"HPU is a fantastic school.  The professors are excellent and the class sizes are small, so learning in this environment is much easier.  HPU has lots of student activities - there is always something going on outside of classes."
Junior,5,I love that Hawaii Pacific University's campus is BEAUTIFUL! The Kaneohe campus is the most beautiful campus I have ever been. The new HPU campus is town for the nursing program is even amazing! The professors really do help when it comes to course work.
Freshman,5,"Hawaii Pacific University gives you a comfortable learning environment that empowers each student to strive for greatness. The student life is an environment that makes everyone want to be apart of it. Even though I am far from home HPU never fails to make me feel like I am home; that I am apart of something greater than myself. Going to a 4-year university is pretty scary when first starting, but HPU gives you that never-ending feeling of excitement that makes you want to strive for more."
Alum,5,"Great college, respected by most employers and good alumni network. If I could do it all again I would would continue my further studies there. Fully recommended."
Sophomore,5,"A very diverse environment that you can not find any where else. From the student body to the professors, everything that Hawai'i Pacific has to offer is beyond exceptional. Also, not to mention that the location that it is, in pretty hard to beat."
Freshman,5,Hawai'i pacific offers good financial aid and always keeps in touch with me! I was accepted late last year and have been so thrilled to join in the fall. The professors and staff I have been in touch with have been very eager to help me join their ohana and find sufficient funding to do so!
Junior,5,HPU has a fantastic military campus program. It has been very flexible for me and the professors have all been very understanding.
Niche User,5,Hawaii pacific is the school that I want to go to. I’ve messaged for more info about their school and they sent me more. I want to be a zoologist.
Niche User,5,I like the degrees offered. I am interested in the criminal justice program. I have been interested in the criminal field for a very long time. I plan to commit to this school and complete their 4 year program. I like the scholarships they offered me because they have really helped me and made it possible for me to attend this school
Freshman,5,"I love this school. I am a freshman and this school has been great, however it is super small, so if you don't like that, this might not be the school for you"
Niche User,5,"I cannot give this college a definitive rating as I am currently in the enrollment process. However, I can say that every faculty member I have worked with has been extremely helpful, professional and polite. I am very excited to start my first semester with them."
Freshman,5,"The staff is very supportive and helpful. Campus is secure and clean. Overall, this is just a great, safe and beautiful place to live and study at."
Sophomore,5,"Love this college! They have so much to offer and the teachers are incredible.The class ration is an average 14 to 1, which I really prefer than a lecture hall filled with 100 students. HPU also has great resources for job opportunities post college."
Junior,5,"I like how small the classes. This allows for a good connection with your professors. This also allows you to receive more help when needed. The atmosphere at the school is overall positive. The student population is also extremely diverse, having students from across the globe. This university provides a unique environment for students to learn and grow."
Niche User,5,Hawaii Pacific has provided me with many outlets for expression as well as easy communication. The only recommendation I would make is easier access to their dormitory and housing applications. They provided me with many different opportunities for off campus housing though which was very helpful.
Senior,5,The professors are amazing and the online courses are taught in a way that does not make you feel like you are missing out.  The advisers and staff all make you feel welcome.
Freshman,5,Here at Hawaii Pacific University you feel the one on one attention and learning experience you have with your professors and classmates. The campus is becoming more college friendly and becoming a bigger university.
Freshman,5,"As freshmen, my first-semester experience has been beyond my expectations. the professors are approachable and are always willing to help. I have made and met friends from all over the world who decided to attend Hawaii Pacific Univeristy that is so far from home."
Freshman,5,Everything is so pretty here. It is easy to go from campus to campus on the HPU shuttle. very welcoming environment and very diverse. I feel safe in the campus(Loa campus). dorms are very spacious and good is great.
Freshman,5,"The school is beautiful and I enjoyed the atmosphere. Everyone is so kind and if you are looking for a different college experience, this is the best place to go. It is very intercultural and you learn to see things in different perspectives! It is a great university."
Sophomore,5,Hawaii Pacific University is a great place for students who are adventure and love the island living. The university is very diverse and the teachers and staff are truly amazing. They are passionate and extremely knowledgeable in their fields.
Senior,5,Walking among the palm trees to class as well as having classmates from around the world was awesome!
Senior,5,"I absolutely love Hawaii Pacific University and if I could restart my college experience, I would not have chosen a different school. I have been a student and a part time employee at the university for 4 years now and I can see the growth and the progression this school has made. We acquired more facilities, my public health program has undergone so many changes - all to improve the student experience and course rigor. I'm very proud of my school and it's preparations for the real world that it has provided me. I truly believe my college experience has aimed to GROW me as an individual."
College Sophomore,5,Our university was just recently rated as about the top 10 (or possibly THE most) diverse school on the island or in the state. People come from all over the world to attend our school.
College Freshman,5,I feel safe on campus i haven't been involved in any crime. It is more of the people you hang around that puts you in those situations.
College Freshman,5,Hawaii is hwaii my only advice is don''t try to do everything in the first year then youi will get bored. So take your time and enjoy it all and go get youyr degree.
College Freshman,5,The staff was really nice there was always one person i could count on. I enjoyed the student life and the food and hanging out.
College Freshman,5,Well i never dormed at a college but for a dorm it is nice and i will enjoy it. This is the place i live so i mine as well make use of it.
College Freshman,5,"At the Lofts the security is great, there are always multiple guards on duty 24 hours a day watching over everything and everyone. When walking downtown to campus you also see security spread out watching over the students safety as they go from class to class. The security is high quality and I always feel safe on campus"
College Freshman,5,"HPU offers a great way to look for jobs and internships through the HPU Connect website, it brings in opportunities from on and off campus. I have had great success with it, and so have many friends I know."
College Freshman,5,"The Aloha Tower Lofts are brand new and are beautiful place to live in, very convenient!"
College Freshman,5,My professors this semesters are really great. They all know who I am and are very helpful when I have questions are any concerns. The classes are very small which is great because its helps students to interact with their professors  more and it will be easy for them to learn. I am a psychology major but as of right now i am taking my general ed courses. The courses that they offer are okay not a lot to choose from. But so far my experience with my class have been great and i have been learning a lot and gaining so much knowledge on topics that i never knew about.
College Freshman,5,So far my experience has been great. My learning experience has been great and I've learned so much and was able to understand the teacher better than I did in high school.
College Freshman,5,Best teachers. Small classes. Diverse student community. Rigorous.
College Freshman,5,There are people from all over the world. Some countries I don't even know about. It is a very diverse university
College Freshman,5,"Customizable schedule allows for fertile after school for jobs or going to the beach. Hawaii Pacific University is a small school broken up into three campuses. The classes are taken downtown Honolulu and the freshman dorms are up in the Hawaii Loa mountain on the outside of a rainforest. The view from the Hawaii Loa is breathe taking everyday. The beach is only 15 minutes away from the Hawaii Loa campus and Waikiki beach is only 20 - 30 minutes from the Downtown campus. The school is small so everyone gets to know each other and become a close knit family.

I would choose Hawaii Pacific University over again because of the location of the school, internships and jobs available and the study abroad opportunities here. The class sizes are extremely small even with General Education course. There are a maximum of 30 kids in these classes, if not less. There are a wide variety of GE courses open and some even count toward your major."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I wouldn't choose any other school. I received a unique learning opportunity with so many hands-on activities and field work exercises. Be sure to volunteer with local NGOs because it looks great on resumes, can get nice references and experience, may turn into a job, and get to meet/network with awesome people doing amazing work in one of the most beautiful places."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Makes everything else worth it. The feeling of sand under your toes and warm sun on your skin,  the rush of feeling ocean trusting under your feet and the bliss of riding out of water into land. hiking up to the pillboxes or watching the sun rise from Diamond Head, cant beat it with a stick. Fresh poi, fresh fruit, mochi ice cream, Times Plate lunch, fresh gilled fish. I wish everywhere was Hawaii, then it wouldnt be so crowded."
College Junior,5,"There are so many beautiful and relaxing places to visit. You may go hiking, do some water sports, try cultural foods and people are friendly."
College Freshman,5,It's occasionally crowded with events going on. Pretty good.
College Freshman,5,"There are parties every night no matter where you are. In people's rooms, at clubs, and even some barbs are pretty good. There is never a dull night. But there are still places to study and get school work done at late hours"
College Freshman,5,The rules are followed to the t. They do random searches even if there is a whiff of drugs or alcohol and they react very fast to the issue to suppress it
Recent Alumnus,5,The housing is very spacious. Although it can be expense the housing is very good. I enjoyed having the suit styled housing. Suits are much better then regular dorms.
College Senior,5,Our school is one of the most diverse schools in the world. People come from all over the world to attend this institution.
College Freshman,5,There's food here you can get no where else
College Freshman,5,It's the most diverse school in the world.
College Freshman,5,There are so many things to do.
College Freshman,5,There are so many opportunities.
College Sophomore,5,"There are many computer labs on campus, and many of them stay open until 9pm. Also, the internet availability on campus is great, and there are many people who use laptops while on the wifi."
College Sophomore,5,"It was extremely easy to get in once I applied, which was not a very difficult process, it just required what most private schools do."
Alum,4,Online learning was very convenient for myself as I worked during school. I was able to maintain my studies while working full time. It was adjustment as it was all driven by yourself and every so often depending on the teachers that they would instruct over a platform or just check in when work is turned in.
Sophomore,4,"I like how small the class sizes are, I really feel like I'm getting the most for my money. Like the teachers and staff really care about me and want me to succeed. We are currently having class outside due to the pandemic and it is a beautiful view and the weather is perfect. I love being so close to the beach that after class it's just a brief walk away."
Sophomore,4,Great academics and professors. Lots of diversity. I wish the on campus experience was better. There aren't many activities that bring students together and its not a very social experience if you don't immediately make friends from on campus housing.
Freshman,4,Overall HPU is a very good school to attend. It is the in the center of our main city. Campus is near many malls and beaches. We have a rent a car service called Hui (need to be 18+ in order to rent). The island is so amazing as well. I love HPU's Campus overall so many things to experience while you go to school here.
Sophomore,4,Most of my teachers online were accommodating and flexible with due dates since going online was a major change for students and teachers. A couple of my professors lacked communication online which made my learning environment more difficult to handle.
Senior,4,"Hawaii Pacific University is a divers, private institution, but do your research when choosing professors."
Alum,4,"Hawaii Pacific had many ups and downs but overall the staff were genuine and cared about students and their success. The campus convenience was not the best and transportation between campuses were dreadful, but quality of teaching was great."
Freshman,4,"I have grown up in Hawai'i and debated on HPU or UH . HPU felt more welcoming and really felt like true Ohana here. The campus is very nice right near the ocean with a second location in Kaneohe near the mountains. I have had great Professors and have never had a problem with any of them, they have helped and guided me through my first year of college."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere. I like what I am learning. Although, it is pretty hectic for the staff because of moving campuses so I don't think they can be as available and helpful to the students as they should be."
Junior,4,"What I like about HPU is the small class sizes offered to students. The classes can range from 30 students to as small as 8. I personally enjoy this small of a class size because I can be personal with my professors and feel comfortable with my other classmates. Another thing I liked about HPU was the location, everything is easy to access being only 10 minutes from the mall on the bus and being in the financial district of downtown. However I did rate things as average or very good, because housing is expensive, the classes can be either very hard or very easy, and the price is expensive. Hence on why I am applying to scholarships. I rated the party scene low as HPU is not much of a party school and for me I find that to be great so I know I will be safe."
Freshman,4,"I do online college and so far it's been fine so I can't say anything about the campus but there is a lot of diversity. When I do discussions, I have classmates from around the globe (Thailand or the mainland), classmates who are married, classmates who are in the military. It shows that HPU welcomes everyone and treat them as a student. The only tricky thing about online school is that some professors are not communicative when it comes to technical difficulties or help on the subject."
Niche User,4,It wasnt bad Health Assessment may need a new teacher but the rest I loved. It was a really pretty campus though I hate that they were moving downtown but happy it was after I was leaving
Niche User,4,They have really helped me get to know the school a lot more. They are always sending information about their school and when deadlines are to apply. They also send me information about visiting the school and getting a personal tour of the school.
Freshman,4,"What I love most about the university is that its on a beautiful island. Also, at first Hawaii didn't seem like it was going to have much culture but I was very mistaken. Between the relationship the people have with the nature and the royalty that has built the government up. Although the royals no longer in control over the government the people are still very proud of it and keeps students like me very educated."
Junior,4,"I have had a good experience with this school, though I have only taken classes on military bases so I did not get to experience much of the student life.  I will start taking classes on the main campus at some point this year."
Sophomore,4,"Hawaii Pacific University is a private university. Some classes are really small which really greats because it makes the professor helps all the students in the class. HPU's tuition is really expensive but they also give good grants and scholarship. The campus is downtown is not really safe because there's a lot of homeless and some security just stand and use their phone but they also have different locations on campus like the one in Kaneohe, mostly the classes there are for Nursing students. HPU is not really a party school but they have a lot of events of sports. Lastly, the dorms are not bad, it's close to a lot of restaurants and Hawaii tourist spots."
Sophomore,4,"First of all, there are no parties. Some of the professors usually in my major are experts and really tries to teach us instead of giving us F grades. However, usually writing or other electives professors could be piece of s.... I was sad because I was looking forward to learn other subjects besides my major. However, I don't remember a single thing that I have learned, some of them are even harsh on grading too. On the other hand, I am satisfied with my major and faculty staffs."
Graduate Student,4,"I picked HPU for my  undergrad and grad studies because of the smaller teacher to student ratio.  I love the instructors and the admin (financial aid, admissions, etc) has been extremely helpful in setting me up for success."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love this school. I like the small class sizes, the people, and the professors. The professors really help you to understand the content and the people on campus are very friendly and welcoming. I also like the diversity within the school because it helps people to be more aware of other cultures."
Freshman,4,"School is good but DO NOT STAY AT ALOHA TOWER DORMS! They test alarms in the morning, often on breaks or weekends, the food is absolutely disgusting, and if you’re vegan good luck. I’ve also experienced the security ignore my phone call, hows that for safety? I recommend off campus housing if possible. Other than the dorms the school is quite good."
Freshman,4,The student life environment is very lively! All the CA's and Staff are kind and will help you with anything. They always make sure you feel like you're at home.
Sophomore,4,This is my second year at Hawaii Pacific University and I can proudly say that I've had an amazing experience. HPU is a diverse and safe environment for students. The faculty an staff members have been nothing but great.
Senior,4,HPU provides a very pleasant learning experience for its students. The campus is currently in a process of transitioning to be an urban campus. Most classes are located in downtown Honolulu.
Junior,4,"Great institution with flexible hours and varying options for courses. Student life is very accommodating with shops, study halls and most classes being within reasonable distance from living quarters. HPU is located in the epicenter of Honolulu just minutes from Waikiki beach, so good times are never far away. Professors are very adept in teaching and understanding different learning styles. Classroom sizes can vary from very large (50+)to relatively small(15-20). Overall the atmosphere is very Aloha."
Sophomore,4,"I am taking online classes with Hawaii Pacific University. I like that HPU offers degrees for Department of Defense civilian employees and not just for those who serve in the military and their spouses. I am able to continue my education with a few military benefits, without having to learn from a classroom, and still get to work full time."
Senior,4,"Hawaii Pacific University comes with many various programs. Majority of the classes are smaller, making one on one attention available."
Sophomore,4,I really liked the environment and vibe of the professors and staff and even students  all around the campuses.
Senior,4,"HPU is a great school if you are seeking diversity in the student body.  There are people from all over the world attending here and even more on short-term study abroad trips.  The food around campus is amazing and also very diverse.  The professors are very caring and helpful, and since the class sizes are small they can really get to know you one-on-one.  There is a lot to do outside if you are willing to get a little sweaty.  Hiking, swimming, waterfalls and a lot more."
Senior,4,Overall has a very pretty campus in the hawaii loa campus/ kaneohe. The other part is in downtown honolulu but shuttles are provided for transportation. Need to be a very productive student yourself to be successful.
Graduate Student,4,Hawai’i pacific university is conveniently located in downtown honololo. Also another campus is surrounded by the beautiful Hawaiian nature. It is a great school to study. The teachers and staffs advice us nicely.
Niche User,4,"Very nice people! But since its a private school, it is quite expensive. I do enjoy and admire how modernized things are. I am just wondering if they offer ROTC."
Freshman,4,"I love the campuses and the professors. They are very educated and understanding, and because of the small class sizes (all less than 40) they try to learn your name. I wish some things were a little easier to understand like the financial aid and wish the meal plan wasn't so expensive, but overall this college is awesome."
Graduate Student,4,"I've only just started at HPU but so far, I am very satisfied with my experience. As a graduate student, the class size is small which provides more opportunities to engage in class lecture and speak with the professor. The professors are well-educated and knowledgeable about the course material. The classrooms are small but equipped with everything you need. The campus is safe with security guards standing by. You must pay for parking, but there is meter parking near by that works well for graduate students with class in the evenings. But as an undergrad, parking could be an issue. The area is also infested with older, homeless people that can sometimes get awkward, but I've never felt unsafe."
Freshman,4,"The school is very goal oriented, so they focus a lot in helping each student success in their future endeavors by providing programs such as the CAS (Center of Academic Success) tutoring."
Senior,4,"I honestly love HPU because of the cultural diversity that the school offers. The class sizes are small, making the classroom environment more personable and enjoyable to be in. The professors are also really hard workers, and they put effort in helping their students be successful. 

It's an amazing school and I would recommend it to anyone."
Sophomore,4,Hawaii Pacific University is a great school with versions campouses all over the island. They have been very military friendly which has been very helpful for me personally. The professors are very knowledgeable and have always been helpful in my experience. This school much like the island is very culturally diverse.
Alum,4,"My overall experience at Hawaii Pacific University was really good. The class sizes are small and its a great environment to get close to the professors. I had to opportunity to bond with most of my professors and they set me up for success in Graduate School. It is in the heart of the city, which means there are homeless people around the campus but security does a great job taking care of the students. It was expensive to live in the city. Parking was horrible, you have to pay for public parking if you drive. Living in Hawaii was worth any trouble I had with the school. The environment was amazing and it is on of the most diverse schools. The school respects Hawaiian tradition and culture and encourages students to be involved."
Senior,4,"I am in the military, and Hawaii Pacific University is a military-friendly school. They accepted all my military training as college credits, which is awesome. That means I can take only the required classes to get a degree. I'm very close to get my Associate's degree because all my military training covered about half of my credits. Since I'm in Hawaii, the tuition is kind of high. That's my only problem with school."
Junior,4,"The close-knit English department is probably my favorite part about this college. The professors and faculty (especially the 5th floor librarians) are extremely helpful and genuinely interested in your well-being, interests, and success. The curriculum is challenging and thought-provoking--something I think current and future generations will depend on to help ask and answer questions about the coming cultural shifts. One suggestion for improvement would be on the process of advising. I personally did not know I had a recent change in advisers and would like to have been kept up-to-date on that."
Junior,4,I have been going to HPU for the last 3.5 years and I love it!!!  The class sizes are smaller and more intimate so I got the attention I needed from the teacher and made some amazing friends.
Junior,4,"I wanted to stay on the island for college, so I decided to go to HPU. The class size for my lectures were good and I was able to have that one on one connection with my professors whenever I needed help. However, I wish there are more security guards around. It makes me feel not so safe around, especially when my classes are in town. I also like how there are 3 campuses now. It's just so beautiful."
Junior,4,It has always been my dream to go to Hawaii Pacific University and it came true. I came in as a transfer students and have been in Hawaii for over a year and a half. The school in wonderful and you are able to meet a diversity of students. The experience has been wonderful so far and I would recommend going to Hawaii Pacific University.
Sophomore,4,"HPU is a 4 year university that is not only in a beautiful location, but has many other amazing attributes. The professors genuinely care for their students and care about what they are actually teaching. The school has also has a great student life system that is great at getting all students to be involved. Other aspect that is admirable is how diverse the school is. There are students that hail from all over the world."
Niche User,4,"It's an urban campus, so don't let the ""Hawaii"" let you forget that.  I guess like most campuses in a metro-city like Honolulu...you just have to get used to it.  "
College Sophomore,4,"Most people are open minded. There may be some people that don't agree, but it doesn't usually cause an issue."
College Sophomore,4,It's great. You can make friends with people that are from different parts of the world. The professors are more engaged with the students since each class is very small.
College Sophomore,4,"I have had such a wonderful experience with HPU. From the views to the classroom. I picked HPU for their small class sizes and the diversity of the students and staff. The classes that they offer are original and helpful, they teach you new things and give you a different look on whatever it is that you're learning. My time spent at HPU has been like no other."
College Sophomore,4,"I personally loved getting the chance of living at Hawaii Loa. The campus was so beautiful and I loved everything about it. Down at Aloha Tower, the view is so peaceful out by the water. Each campus gives you something different to appreciate."
College Sophomore,4,The athletics are quite a large part of my school. Athletes are from around the world and everyone has an equal opportunity to join in. They interact with everyone and help with registrations for fall and spring. They show that they are more than just athletes in the classroom and the coaches make school the number one priority.
College Sophomore,4,My time at Hawaii Pacific University has been a great experience. I have enjoyed getting the chance to meet and interact with people from around the world. My professors show that they care about the courses and provide the students with help if more is needed. The school provides the education that is needed to gain experience for the jobs we can obtain later in life after earning our degrees.
College Sophomore,4,The only complaint I have is that sometimes there isn't enough space available in the student hangouts where students like to go to study and that sometimes the workload can be a bit overbearing.
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors I have had have been great and efficient in making sure the students are able to successfully complete the course and teach the students the things they need to know. Some professors do a better job than others and a handful of professors seem unaware of the student's workload and have a habit of overloading the students with too much work. Also, some teachers lack of knowledge of technology sometimes leads to communication/ learning issues between the students and the professors. Other than that everything else is great."
College Sophomore,4,There are job fairs or tables set up with recruiters every so often advertising their business and need for employees. This presents many opportunities for the students.
College Senior,4,"I wish there was more of a greek life. No football team, lacking school spirit. But classroom sizes are small and great learning environment"
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at HPU has been great, they have a campus near to my home, application process was easy and straight forward. They really tried to make the best of my military experience and apply it towards my degree. The only issue I have had was with financial aide. I qualified for $4,400 in the Pell Grant through the FAFSA, however, I did not receive any after further evaluation from HPU. I don't believe that was HPU trying to keep aide away from the students I believe it to be more of the system of how much money you make. Which strikes me as odd seeing as millions go unclaimed every year, they should make sure that the money gets used so that the federal government doesn't take it away for that reason."
College Senior,4,Hawaii Pacific University is a really good friendly school that works with the individual. They know people have a job and life outside of class and are really good about working with your schedule and using previous credits to their fullest to help you get your degree faster. They have multiple campus' throughout the island and are very accessible. Best set of instructors and advisors I have worked with.
College Freshman,4,Well i am not in greek life and im indiffrent about them they are peopple and so are we. I feel the other students don't really care and don't make a big deal about it at all.
College Freshman,4,I think sports are a big part of the school because with out them then we wouldnt be close as a community. Yes we have classes but sports really bring people together.
College Freshman,4,I will have a great time and i already know the only thing that I kinda am not a big fan of is the tuition. it is always very high and I mean there is probably a reason i just wish it wouldnt be so high.
College Freshman,4,There are a variety of courses that are offered for students.
Freshman,2,Some decent professors. The campus around chinatown is pretty shady. It doesn't really feel like a college environment at all. Be warned. Lotta classes wont transfer so transferring out of HPU is a nightmare.
College Sophomore,2,Athletics are not a priority
College Freshman,2,"The athletic community is good for the people involved in the athletic community, but for everyone else the facilities aren't up to date."
College Freshman,2,"a lot of homeless people and in a bad part of town, scary at night."
College Freshman,2,"to many people fewer jobs, have to travel far away to work"
College Freshman,2,It is hard to get to know other people because every one is in groups
College Freshman,2,You only have to worry if you get caught by only one of the RAs. Most of them dont care.
College Freshman,2,"There are parties all the time, but only some of the RAs actually will do something about it. My view is also that we need to stop being treated like children and we need to start being treated like adults."
College Freshman,2,No one is aware of actual sporting events so no one goes to them.
College Sophomore,2,I've heard that it's difficult to graduate to begin with
College Junior,2,"Transferring to HPU was the most difficult thing ever! I had problems with EVERYTHING and anything you can think of. Registration, classes, transcripts, parking, school ID, books, etc. I feel helpless and wonder why I'm paying so much for tuition."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is Hawaii. housing is going to be expensive, small, and without things like air conditioning (why would you want it anyway?) and parking will probably be limited. A Moped is a great investment. You can put a board rack on it. check HPU's ecalssified list for housing first, because it will generally be cheaper and the people who post it are looking for students to rent. Craigs list is probably the next best option. Expect to pay much more than you would generally anywhere on the mainland outside of Manhattan. But remember that youre lucky to live in Hawaii, you shouldnt be inside anyway, just need a place to keep a surfboard."
College Senior,2,There is minimal support for our athletics. The cheer and dance team used to be nationally ranked but then they stopped giving out scholarships and it went down the tubes. The basketball team and volleyball team are probably the most supported.
College Senior,2,"There is no off campus housing affiliated with HPU. You just find your own and it is very expensive, with limited parking."
College Senior,2,"Because I live on the windward side, there are no options for off campus dining unless you go 5 miles either into Kailua or Kaneohe."
College Senior,2,There is no kind of nightlife on campus. You have to take the bus or a car into downtown waikiki.
College Senior,2,"Living on campus was an interesting experience. There is not much school spirit or activities to participate in like most other campuses. It is very expensive, the dorms are small and unclean. The housing process is difficult and for those who left after the first semester it was a nightmare for them to get out of their year-long housing payment."
College Freshman,2,"As a Computer Science major, I can honestly tell you the tech at this school is just sad. Even the professors are fed up with it. I'm currently enrolled in a class where each student just brought their own laptops in - because the school's computers would not allow us to do the tasks that were needed for the course work."
College Senior,2,"On campus dining is expensive, so the only people that eat there are students that live on campus."
College Senior,2,"Parties at are school are almost non-existent. They are busted when they begin if they are too large (30 people), and our school is very clique-y so good luck trying to get different people to hang with others."
College Sophomore,2,"There is little access to parking on and off campus, and prices are high everywhere."
College Sophomore,2,"There are two campuses, and one lies in the heart of Downtown Honolulu, which has a lot of great options nearby. However, on the other campus, going anywhere off campus is hard because you cannot walk on the highway outside of campus, and the only easy forms of transport are bus and a inter-campus shuttle. Unfortunately, the second campus is where the dorms are."
College Freshman,2,"Parking sucks downtown. I don't even have a car, and I know it stinks. Everyone does because there is no free parking downtown, and it is limited to top. We live in Hawaii- too many people too small of a space. Winward I believe generally has parking though. It cost money for a parking pass, but if you decide to do that, you can park there and then just take our shuttle down to downtown campus. The shuttle runs every fifteen minutes, and there is also a bus stop by our campus which runs at various times you can check through google maps"
College Freshman,2,"If you live in the dorms, it's f***ing awful. Its super inconvenient to get anywhere, not to mention expensive, and there is nothing to do on campus."
College Junior,2,"Since most classes are located on the downtown campus in the heart of Hawaii's main business district, parking is very limited and the school does not have its own parking structure student are left to fend for themselves for parking amongst the many businesses and their employees. Most students opt to purchase mopeds since there are three parking areas designated to students with bikes and mopeds. however, there is a very limited amount of available spots, forcing students to park on sidewalks and sometimes getting tickets from the police at the expense of the student. They are strict with the amount of mopeds per lot, yet give no other option for unfortunate students. Also the amount if homeless and drug addicts who hang around the downtown campus either begging for money or disturbing students who are waiting for classes to begin or eating in the area"
College Sophomore,2,Expensive and hard to find 
College Sophomore,2,"HPU is a commuter school, not the easiest place to meet people.  Most of the kids are foreign and the administration is frustrating to work with.  I transferred here and will be leaving next year, Hawaii is an awesome place but not the typical college experience.  If you want a community or college vibe I would not recommend HPU at all.  Night life is not the best unless you have a fake or over 21.  Visit the school before accepting"
College Freshman,2,Parking is extremely expensive and hard to find.
College Junior,2,Parking is crazy. People who live off campus usually take the public bus or get dropped off. I drove to the downtown campus but only took one class a week so I didn't mind paying. The rest was online. Every day parking is not good.
College Senior,2,I really do not notice the Greek life at school. I mean we have a Greek style place to eat at our school but i have never tried it. We mostly have people that come from Europe so that life style is sort of seen more then anything. They dress different than others so pointing them out is sort of easy.
College Junior,2,At the downtown side parking is a hassle and inconvenient due to the fact that only scooters are able to park at school and no parking lot for cars.
College Freshman,2,"The weather at the downtown campus is always nice and beautiful. But downtown is so congested, crowded, smells bad, and is full of homeless people so it is basically impossible to enjoy the weather. The Kaneohe campus is always cloudy but warm. It also rains pretty much everyday, particularly in the winter time. And the Kaneohe rain can be classified as a terrential down pour at times."
College Freshman,2,We don't really have a campus it's a open street downtown so pretty much anyone can come but there's hardly any problems
College Junior,2,"The university is very laid back when it comes to that, which I think is a bad thing because it causes problems when you are trying to get things done.  To get any official papers signed can take  a long time!  I tried to get a signature on a required document for an internship and even though I saw that the persons who needed to sign were just talking, they ask me to come back in 1-2 weeks!  And this is for a signature only, on a document that they see every semester, stating that they acknowledge that I am doing an internship."
College Junior,2,Its ok; I use public transportation because I live off campus.
College Freshman,2,"Big Rooms and suite style, but its a very isolated campus and you feel stuck most of the time. Food is mediocre at best."
College Junior,2,"HPU is D2 sports. The teams that most follow are softball, baseball and basketball. There is no football but there is a rugby club. Recently, the school has cut the Nationally ranked cheer and dance teams and many students lost scholarships. Basically, the girls softball team is the only team that actually does good nationally."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am a returning sophomore to HPU and I was not aware that we had greek life at this school.  Clearly, it must be poorly advertised."
College Junior,2,"What Strictness? There's no ""campus"" to speak of. Just rooms rented out  as class and office rooms throughout downtown honolulu buildings. That's it. No rules, no strictness. Just attend class and go home."
College Senior,2,"Downtown is pretty expensive if you want to live in a nice place and a good area. However, there are some really good deals if you keep searching!"
Freshman,1,"There is no student life. Literally no one talks to each other and the school does not make a real effort to help anyone form bonds like I know several other universities do. The campus is extremely unsafe. For example, I saw a couple shooting up heroin on our school benches where we wait for the busses to pick us from Downtown and take us back to Hawaii Loa campus. Also a homeless lady literally squatted of one of the buildings my class was in just started to pee right in front of it. Not to mention being harassed by homeless people while trying to go to class because the downtown campus is not a REAL campus. Just space the school rents out mixed with a whole bunch of other offices."
College Senior,1,"Disgusting, no air conditioning (so you have to spend 100 bucks on fans) The housing fee and meal plan is nOT worth the price. Also, no one talks to each other."
College Senior,1,"Only people who care are those in it, who act like they're the best for being in athletics. Literally no one pays attention to it."
College Senior,1,"Attending HPU was the worst decision of my life. DO NOT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL. As a senior in high school last year, I read the negative reviews and thought ""okay this won't be my experience, this person just had a bad time."" No, I should have listened. They were right. Its only September, about to be October, and I'm already applying to transfer back to the mainland. Let me start off first with the campus. Hawaii Loa has gorgeous views,  It is gorgeous but the dorms suck. There is NO air conditioning in the dorms, so you have to buy a expensive dehumidifier and spend around 90 dollars on fans. On top of that, theres roaches. Second, no one here communicates with each other or talks. Cliques form quickly and those cliques are mostly people who are rich, preppy and stuck up. Most people are super snobby, have their daddies pay for everything, and they're just really stuck up. If you're not like them they won't even look at you. Second, the downtown campus is awful and unsafe. I literally had a meth head harass me after my evening class in front of campus security and he just stood there and did nothing. He told me ""its their right to do that, I can't do anything"". I am not the kind of person who has anything against the homeless. But its literally like an infestation. One will come up to you every minute asking for money, you'll see them picking food out of trash cans, there are some who are mentally ill so theres this one lady who literally sits there screaming at you and yelling at nothing. It's unsafe, and its not even our campus they rent out office buildings. Third, the academic advisors suck. Maybe its a hit and miss but for me even if i go in person I can not get my academic advisor to do jack for me. Then the academics are super laid back and you're not even academically challenged. HPU IS NOT WORTH ITS EXPENSIVE COST. You can get a higher education much cheaper somewhere on the main land. Save yourself time, DONT COME HERE."
College Freshman,1,"The view is nice, that's about it.  The social atmosphere of the dorms is unbelievable in the worst sense.  No one really talks and communicates. It is horrendous."
College Freshman,1,"Your clothes will get moldy, there will be cockroaches, and the smell does not go away."
College Freshman,1,The athletics are only popular among athletes.  No one really cares.  It sucks.
College Freshman,1,We don't have it because this school sucks
College Freshman,1,Do we even have athletics?
College Freshman,1,"Going to this school was the worst decision of my life.  Everyone is rude and stuck up, no one socializes, and the party scene and social life in general is AWFUL. Not to mention no one is helpful and the food is not good. I would not recommend this school to ANYONE.  The classes are small, which can be a good thing due to the personal relationship with the teachers and students, but not here! The classes are dry and boring, and students hardly communicate at all.  The view is just about the only perk to this school, but you can get a good view at many schools.  Do yourself a favor: do not come here. Please."
College Freshman,1,"HPU was the worst decision of my life. I recommend you don't even bother applying. They make it seem like everything is super layed back and that you'll receive the ""hawaiian"" experience, but that is complete BS. The bus system is the most flawed public transportation service I have ever seen in my life, and cracked out uneducated, idiots, drive both the busses and intercampus shuttles. Also, keep in mind that if you come and plan on transferring, like myself, your credits probably won't. On the other hand, other than the atrocious education, finding anything entertaining to do off-campus is impossible unless you want to go pick food out of the garbage with hobos. Everything is outdated, or IDs don't even swipe. The food in inedible and looks like something from a horror movie. In summary, don't come."
College Senior,1,not a fan of it
College Freshman,1,We have no Greek life...
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life so not much can be said about it
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek Life
College Freshman,1,I have no clue if we even have a greek life on campus
College Freshman,1,I mean im not into partying so its really only if you are into that stuff
College Freshman,1,They take place mainly at Aloha Towers but sometimes they take place at Hawaii Loa
College Freshman,1,We dont have the greek system
College Junior,1,"I have seen the housing at Hawaii Loa campus and its terrible.

but the housing at Aloha tower in town is beautiful!"
College Junior,1,Im not aware of any greek clubs
College Junior,1,"Bars in Honolulu terrible, all indoors and expensive"
College Junior,1,Tried several times to have someone help me...still waiting for reply
College Senior,1,"I have no applied but I have heard that it is a terrible process and very difficult to get any aid. I know I won't be able to get any because I am white, from a middle class family, and have a job."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is usually about 15 - 20 dollars a school day downtown. No use in driving tho, the traffic is so horrible that it took me nearly 2 hours to get to and from school each day, and I only lived 10 miles away."
College Freshman,1,"School housing is only available at the Loa Campus, which is on the other side of the island from the buildings where you will take most of your actual classes.

They have just recently developed the Aloha tower ""suites"" for the downtown area. But you still need to walk thru downtown honolulu to get to school."
College Senior,1,"Housing is terrible. It is hard to find, very expensive, and hot. Parking is hard to come by and the quality of living is poor."
College Senior,1,We don't have Greek Life at HPU
College Junior,1,There is no school spirit at all when it comes to sports. I have no idea how any team is doing and I have never been to any kind of game in almost two years that have past since I came here. I would like it to be more school spirit but I think that the campus and the school facilities are too spread out to reach that high level of involvement and spirit.
College Senior,1,"HPU does not have Greek Life. While many cocky freshmen think that they'll be able to start it up, it never gets passed. HPU is a dry campus and does not tolerate violations against drugs and/or alcohol. We don't have a proper campus (as buildings are rented out) and don't have a campus police to enforce rules (it is solely Student Life that is enforcing rules)."
College Junior,1,"The parking on campus is very expensive. Also, there is an hourly fee that you have to pay."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid office and scholarship office are not helpful in assisting you in scholarship searches. They do not have scholarships on hand for a student to apply for and they do not help you search for any. It's an ""every man for himself"" operation."
College Freshman,1,"The professors have to guide lines as to what they have to teach because it is a private school. Horrible system. I did not learn anything in my year here from any of my classes. The professors are all lazy and don't care about their jobs. Also, if you plan on transferring after taking courses at HPU, it is VERY difficult. They make it almost impossible to transfer."
College Freshman,1,"Almost everyone who lives in the dorms sucks. It is a waste of time, girls just want to start drama among each other. The guys just play video games or stick to themselves. It is just not a good atmosphere to live in. However, there are way more people who have great personalities and are friendly that live off campus."
College Freshman,1,"No Greek life at HPU. UH Manoa has Greek life, but it isn't very big there."
College Freshman,1,The food is the same everyday. Always stale tasting and bland. It is clear that the people running the dining hall do not care about the students at all. It is a horrible environment. The dining hours are only open for an hour and a half for each meal. Breakfast is too early. If you're off campus you have to rush back in time for dinner. Everything about it is horrible.
College Freshman,1,"If you have any desire to ever go to a fun college party, HPU is not for you. Absolutely no night life. I lived in the dorms, there was not one party the entire year. Nothing to do at night ever. The only place to go out at night is Waikiki, most students go to Zanzabar and just spend the night dancing with creepy old military guys. Absolutely worst night times at this school. UH Manoa has parties sometimes but they're usually pretty small so HPU students don't get invited. If you're going to school in Hawaii, choose UH Manoa over HPU for sure."
College Freshman,1,I have to park at the other campus which is in the other side of the island just to catch the school shuttle downtown because parking down there is to expensive
College Freshman,1,"I do not live on campus, but I hear the cafeteria food on campus is HORRIBLE."
College Freshman,1,"I want everyone who is looking at HPU as a potential school to look at this:

Just be smart before you go here."

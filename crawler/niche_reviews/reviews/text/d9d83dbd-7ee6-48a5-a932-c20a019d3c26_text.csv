Alum,5,I love the online experience in CSUDH! I love that in a click of finger you are in your professors office hours. The Professors are really trying to be innovative.
Junior,5,I am a transfer student so this is my first semester at CSUDH and its been great so far. I hope I get to see the campus soon.
Junior,5,"All of my classes are online or remote instruction this semester. Some are structured like normal online classes, that is asynchronous, with professors uploading lecture videos and PowerPoint slides and assigning homework and exams that way. However, most of them are the kind with zoom meetings once or twice a week that we have to be present for. Some of my professors do upload the recorded lectures to blackboard as well, which I really appreciate being able to refer back to. Especially since there was a scheduling error with two of my classes and so they are held at the same time and I have to choose which one is more important to attend. So, I usually skip the one that's recorded. I do wish this had been better thought out though, because when I signed up for the classes this scheduling error did not show up. In fact, if I look at my class schedule it still doesn't show up, so I think one of the teachers probably made a mistake in how they classified the class."
Senior,5,"My experience has been great in the 3 years I spent at this school. Professors are friendly, helpful, and inspiring."
Sophomore,5,"I'm currently taking online classes because of the pandemic, to be quite fair it's good. I would have thought this was gonna be hard but, I'm actually getting use it this."
Senior,5,The professors leverage the online aspect of learning very well. They take their time and make it a point to let students know that they can reach out no matter what.
Senior,5,"I like that most of the students come from hardworking, middle-class households. And I like that most the professors seem to understand that so they make adjustments for students who maybe working full time or have kids at home."
Senior,5,"Instructors are very helpful and understanding in regards to new learning styles. Everything became online since COVID, and the instructors are very flexible."
Freshman,5,It's a great school and has all sorts of incredible majors. Professors are good instructors and care about the students.
Junior,5,I enjoy attending this school because of the diversity the school has and the amazing teachers. I also like how attentive the professors are with their students.
Junior,5,"Although I have taken many online classes prior to the distance learning, I do appreciate how the professors take their time to assist their students on zoom and via email."
Sophomore,5,With everything going on very professor has been able to give the material that is very easy to understand. Of course there are professors that don’t have much experience going online but they do make the effort.
Sophomore,5,The college is really great. They have different programs and resources that you can access. Everyone that you meet is very nice. Dominguez also has a nice little farmers market every Tuesday that you can get fruits or vegetables or snacks.
Senior,5,Everyone is getting used to it! All are being kind during theses time and willing to work to get through.
Senior,5,"It has been a great experience so far, almost all the staff is ready to help and willing which feels nice. Not a big campus but when you are on your own it benefits and there is always a friendly face near by!"
Alum,5,"I enjoyed the scheduling of classes and how the classes were offered for myself in the morning. I loved the Math department and how they had resources for students. Teachers were great and helpful to all students. There was a tutoring class that you could sign up for to get extra help. There are different sororities that you can join. They also have a great locker student union. The school has been remolded. The library is huge, and  you can check out books for classes if they are available. They have meeting rooms for sign up when you need to meet with your groups."
Senior,5,"My online experience at Dominguez hills has been overall great. Professors are really attentive to their students. I have gotten professors that whenever you have a question about anything in the class, they have been informative and will make an effort to answer your questions as soon as possible."
Senior,5,"I love going to Dominguez Hills. It is a university that is so diverse and always strives for helping out POC communities. They have many programs, clubs and sports one can become part of and through them meet people and get connections."
Senior,5,"Overall my experience at Cal State Dominguez Hills has honestly been great. The staff here are easy to communicate with and very understanding. As long as you get to know your professors and try hard; you should pass. On top of that, the campus resources are great and you can get help for all your needs. The campus overall may not be the biggest as others but is nice and easy to navigate through."
Junior,5,"My online experience has been pretty well. Almost all of the professors that I have had online courses with have been really lenient with the assignments, due dates, and just making sure each student has the proper equipment needed to access everything so we learn and understand the content that they are teaching in the best way possible."
Junior,5,"During COVID-19, I tool all my classes online. The professors have done a great job teaching us online. At first, it looks hard but later on, everyone gets used to it and it is very easy to handle."
Junior,5,"The first time I visit the school, I was amazed at how clean and safe is the campus is. Everyone is very helpful."
Junior,5,"Yes, originally I only had one online class last semester, but because of COVID it turned in to 6 online classes. It was a smooth transitions and the professors offered support."
Junior,5,My favorite thing about this school is the staff. From the beginning I felt a lot of support. They have programs that I feel were made just for me like the Thru in Two Program that makes sure you stay on track to graduate in two years as a transfer student.
Alum,5,Most teachers are very organized and the online platform is easy to understand and navigate.  Most teachers even post or link how to videos on navigating the interface.
Alum,5,This school has great teachers and honestly feel like you are part of a community. They are also very helpful and are eager to help to achieve your goals.
Junior,5,"The thing that I like about the school is that it is diverse and friendly. The people there will help you find your way to class or the library. The school is small but it feels a little bit big. The Student Body always has some type of activity to do out there like the Farmers Market on Tuesday, and Commuting Donut Day. More resources are being brought in like the nap room and the new residence building. The administration at the school really cares about our education and how we can improve by always sending surveys or talking to us on the East Walkway, which I think is cool."
Junior,5,"When I first started going to Dominguez Hills I was nervous and scared because I’m a very shy person and I don’t know how the staffs, Professors, or students will interact with me. As I was walking in campus there was so many friendly staff and students smiling and asking if we need help finding a class or anything else. There was loud and upbeat music playing, lots of fun events and all type of exotic food as well. The vibe was very nice and everyone looked happy and relaxed. I rated Dominguez Hills five stars not only because I’m a student there but because they deserve it and our Toro Mascot, he is amazing!! Our mascot is always making every single events we have so fun and hilarious. Thank you Dominguez Hills for making your University a second home for me!!"
Senior,5,"I've taken 90% of my courses online so far and every professor has been organized, clear, and concise. Great learning materials provided online. I never thought online would be so easy when compared to in person learning. But, I have actually learned more through the video interaction and materials"
Senior,5,"This school is a diamond in the rough! I wish more people knew about this school or considered it. It's not as big a campus as LB or Fullerton, but the fact that it's smaller makes it more intimate. Professors are more in tune and communicative with their students. The staff has done a phenomenal job with the programs. I advocate for the Toro Nation every chance I get. I guarantee you will not be disappointed in attending here. The education is quality and the experience is priceless"
Junior,5,My experience at Dominguez Hills has been good. I am a part time student and I honestly prefer online classes. It is a friendly campus. It is easy to get around. I have learned a lot from the time I have been here.
Sophomore,5,I love being at CSUDH. The campus experience and diversity is unmatched. Everyone of every background has a place on campus that is easy to find! All the students are easy to talk to and it's such a lively vibe on campus!
Senior,5,It is a very peaceful campus with many opportunities and help. The staff is friendly and passionate about what they do. Most professors provide great resources and are easy to approach for help if you need it.
Senior,5,Going to CSUDH was the best decision I made.  CSUDH has the most caring professors that will make the college transition ease. Students are super friendly and involved in the community.
Alum,5,"I had a Great experience as an undergrad, a lot of available resources and great professors. The school itself is a little outdated but some departments are currently under construction. There are a lot of clubs you can join and the school spirit is always high."
Freshman,5,The Dominguez Hills community is very friendly and welcoming. All the professors I've had so far are reasonable and kind. Every professor is willing to help you and they work hard to make sure you get all the information necessary and important to your education. The staff at CSUDH make sure you get sufficient help and guide you to make sure you pick the classes necessary for your major and/or minor and even check in on you throughout the year to check on your progress.
Junior,5,"What I love about Dominguez Hills is I love the diversity, I love how comfortable Dominguez Hills had made me feel in the last 3 years. Somethings, I wish can change is I really wish that overall in terms of certain dates being change with applying for housing can change and they can better accommodate students. Also, I hope that overtime we can better accommodate student resources helping kids who are not able to afford certain things."
Niche User,5,"I loved the whole atmosphere that was around Cal State Dominguez Hills. When I went to admit day, I got to explore CSUDH and it was a beautiful campus. The size of the school was perfect too. I can't wait to be a student there."
Niche User,5,I was very lucky to attend a tour to CSUDH before applying to colleges earlier this year. The atmosphere was very comfortable and motivational. The students seemed at peace and the places we went to were filled with culture especially in the campuses student center
Niche User,5,"Dominguez hills is a great school overall with its food, diversity, and professors. There is plenty of things to do at Dominguez hills that you can be there all day long! The class are small most of them but you’ll learn and the area it’s located is great."
Niche User,5,Cal State Dominguez Hills is a very diverse school and is for students who are looking for a semi small college campus in the outskirts of Los Angeles.
Freshman,5,"Very diverse, worth the income and tuition given. It has a very diverse scenein and out of the school."
Freshman,5,I have heard a lot about how wonderful California State University Dominguez Hills is. I have a close friend who attends there and and she tells me that it is a great school and gives me tips that I should take advantage of the great opportunities given and build great relationships with future classmates.
Niche User,5,Visiting this school was nice. I applied to this school and got accepted. I can’t wait to see what this school holds for me. It’s very innovative.
Senior,5,"I think Cal State Dominguez Hills is a hidden treasure. I know that it is probably the cheesiest thing to say but it's true.  At CSUDH, I felt welcomed because of the atmosphere around the campus. People are always willing to help one another wheater that shows each other where certain classrooms are or just lending a hand. The campus is growing with every new academic-school year. There is always a new club starting or new job opportunities to take hold of. I think the only thing I would like to see change is to offer more majors. CSUDH doesn't have some majors that other CSU's but I believe it is because it is a smaller campus"
Freshman,5,"CSUDH is a small diverse campus. The people there are very friendly and kind and it’s quite amazing. Currently the campus is expanding. None of the majors are impacted and you get amazing support from the school such as counseling, health care, and much more."
Senior,5,I am very fortunate for the opportunity to study in Dominguez Hills. I am enrolled in their Clinical Science program which is renowned nationwide for producing competent Medical Laboratory Technicians all over the United States. I have learned immense amount of hands on education from the professors. The major is not an cake walk and its is very hard to obtain internship after graduation but pursuing Clinical Science major as my undergraduate degree is a worthwhile endeavor for me.
Niche User,5,I still haven't attended but I have gone there and it's a good university I have gone in a field trip there and I like the whole school overall
Sophomore,5,What I like about CSUDH is that it a mid-size campus and the diversity on the campus as well. I also like that it is not an impacted school.
Niche User,5,Lots of interesting people and the professors are the bestweqhiufbwo;fbuoefboewbnfoewjmvjnrwvngroanvgrqngrleknglenlvnlandvldfknflvnfdlnvlfkeangoirngpierqg
Sophomore,5,"California State University Dominguez Hills focuses on giving its students an amazing transition from high school or community college. It was an easy and smooth transition from high school to CSUDH, thanks to their first year program and their advising centers such as Encounter to Excellence. I would like to have less general education courses that I feel are unnecessary to your overall major and that high school already covered."
Junior,5,"I have been a student at Dominguez for over a year now. I cannot imagine myself in another University. So close to home, I get there in 10 minutes or less. The professors are always so attentive and they really do care about their students."
Junior,5,"For one, the campus tours are very informative. The campus library is beautiful and very accommodating during final weeks."
Niche User,5,"I went on a study trip to California State University Dominguez Hills in my freshmen year of high school. I really love the campus and academic life here, and I can see myself being in this college."
Senior,5,The campus is small so there’s a lot of opportunity to get one on one attention from Advisors and professors . This school is very comfortable and fun
Junior,5,"California State University- Dominguez Hills is full of diversity and people from all walks of life. The staff members here are helpful and will guide you through anything you need. The campus size is small and so are the classes here. The classes have about 35 students at most, and it creates an intimate environment where you feel like you're getting a meaningful education since professors are so caring to each individual. The campus' PD is very alert at all times, and I feel very safe even when I'm walking at night. My experience here has been very great, and I'm glad I chose California State University Dominguez Hills as my school."
Alum,5,CSUDH is where I found my second home. I felt as is each of the professors and departments chairs really cared for their students as well as the counselors. Class sizes were kept at a minimum and the school offered many resources for all kinds of groups.
Freshman,5,I really like the support the professors and the tutors give. I dislike the fact that the school is small compared to other cal-states. I believe the college is expanding and will expand in the following years.
Junior,5,I love how the staff and students are welcoming and helpful. The teachers are supportive and manage to get one on one time with their students. There are many resources available for student in need of  services. I would like for the campus to have housing available for students that have children.
Sophomore,5,"Dominguez Hills is a big school with that comforting home feel. The staff and advisors are always friendly and helpful, willing to talk and listen when needed and are always looking out for your best interest. The teachers are passionate about what they teach and do everything they can to ensure you not only pass but feel confident in your work. The school makes sure to have something for everyone with activities and clubs ranging from robotics to gardening to astrology. Dominguez Hills makes you enjoy going to school."
Alum,4,The University is Great! There are new buildings currently being made. I remember watching T.V shows getting filmed there. FAFSA office is fast. The Professors are awesome. Make sure to take advantage of office Hours. Wish they can put new restaurants' in campus though.
Senior,4,My online experience has been difficult but beneficial. It has also been convenient because I work full time which allows me to have an income.
Sophomore,4,"Dominguez Hills might not seem the best from outside but, the vibe is so great. I've made some great friends and have made some great memories."
Senior,4,Good school. I mostly commute so I don't really participate in the social scene.  The professors I've had are extremely helpful and passionate about the subjects that they teach.
Senior,4,"Professors are in it with you to succceed! BIO advisor, she is amazing and very helpful. Short walks to get to your classes. Need more parking spots tho, maybe a parking building can be built."
Freshman,4,My online experience was difficult but it was manageable. I had 4 classes Mon-Thur and it wasn't much different from high school. the professors expect you to already know some of the content.
Senior,4,I have taken plenty of online courses and would say that I had mostly great experiences with them. Most of the professors are easy to communicate with and get back to you quickly. They try to provide as many resources as they can to help you with the course but there have been times when professors would not communicate with you in a timely matter and aren't understanding. Overall I had mostly good experiences and I prefer online classes since I do work outside of school.
Junior,4,"The resources available for us are great and since the campus is on the smaller side, it is easy to reach everyone and all of the clubs, resources, tutoring, etc. available to us (before the coronavirus)"
Freshman,4,"I did not know what to expect from this University, however it felt like home in a matter of seconds. The atmosphere is peaceful and although the campus is small, this makes for quick trips to where you need to be. Staff and professors are always willing to help and offer the best advice. The library is my favorite place to study as rules are respected and the view is unmatched."
Freshman,4,"My first semester was like a breath of fresh air. I juggled 5 classes a day and in the beginning I thought it would be overwhelming but as I grew accustomed to the campus and flow of campus life, things became clearer. Online classes always seemed scary to me but taking 2 for my second semester was simpler than I thought. I did have some difficulty as I am a visual learner but my professors always provided links to videos and thoroughly explained topics."
Senior,4,Online classes are good. Classes utilize Blackboard and online discussions boards. Some professors will prerecord lecture videos in order to allow students to engage the students more in the online classroom.
Senior,4,"CSUDH is a quiet, clean, and safe campus. The professors are caring and passionate. The faculty and administration work hard to put the students as the top priority."
Junior,4,I personally dont like online class unless I have to but some of the class I chose were really helpful and then this virus has gone around it kind makes everything worse but better.
Senior,4,"Came to this school as a Associates Degree transfer student from OCC & I got my bachelors degree as of May 15th. Overall, it was a pleasant experience."
Senior,4,The teachers transitioned well after the Coronavirus warranted social distancing. They let us finish the semester out strong!
Junior,4,"I love going to school so I’m more of a campus student however, when the covid-19 Impacted us in the middle of our Spring Semester we had to take the remaining of the semester online. The first month was very hard for students and professors who like me, never did or took online classes. As much as it was frustrating, the professors tried their hardest and best to help as much as they can by giving us directions step by step and even did follow up emails to make sure we got it. It’s true when they say “there is no I in team....” We all worked together and finally got the hang of online classes. Thank you to every single professors who took the time and had a lot of patience with all of the students!!"
Sophomore,4,"This small campus is a RESOURCE CAMPUS. It provides all the resources you need in order to succeed. This includes excellent financial aid, a daycare, a tutoring center, psychological services, as well as physical health services. The classes are easy for the most part if you have the motivation to succeed and take advantage of it. It is also a GREAT environment for personal growth and professional development."
Junior,4,My experience here at Cal State University Dominguez Hills has been like no other. I am a first generation college student and this has been the perfect school for me to grow and expand upon my horizon. This school prides themselves off their diversity and the faculty here puts in a lot of care and consideration into each and every individual.
Graduate Student,4,"Props to campus safety being a priority. Better resources for students for internships, personal growth."
Senior,4,"I would recommend anybody wants a quality education to come to CSUDH. This is not a party school, but instead is full of students that want to learn and dedicate themselves to their field. The school has many recreational areas for students to use to unwind and many clubs for extracurricular activities. The university also has many research labs on campus to prepare undergraduates for graduate school in research fields and guide them into graduate school."
Niche User,4,The campus is amazing full of life and the culture. It's a great family to be part with. Surprising the campus is pretty diverse and the professors around the campus care about your education and success.
Senior,4,"Overall I do love my school. There's always events, a passionate student body despite it being a commuter school, great professors and good selection of on campus dining, an awesome library and all kinds of clubs and organizations. There are some negatives, such as a disinterest in funding specific parts that may need more tlc on campus. The business college classrooms are never cleaned, I've been there almost two years now and am pretty sure the same layer of chalk dust that coated my classroom when I started has only grown since then. I've had a few professors who genuinely treat their students like lesser lifeforms and have very little interest in actually helping them. But I've also had exceptional professors who go the extra mile and make themselves as available as often to their students. Thankfully I've had more of the latter than the former, but it still sticks with you."
Freshman,4,"I have to start with the campus, it's under construction but the recent buildings are amazing and worth the waiting. The classes are an hour and fifteen minutes split between Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday and Thursday. Other classes are online or meet for 1 day for 3 hours in a class. In between classes you have a fifteen-minute gap get to your next class. My only problem is that there are not too many places to spend your gaps or to relax as it is a smaller campus everywhere is about full of students."
Junior,4,"Dominguez Hills is on the smaller side for a 4 year university, but that is what can be very appealing about the campus. it is easier to get to know fellow class mates and to interact with them on campus. I find that there is not too much traffic or any issues with parking for the most part. there are frequent events on campus and plenty of classes offered."
Junior,4,"It is a great college, and a very short drive from my house. The campus is wonderful with lots of space to enjoy. The teachers are engaging and informative. Overall a great college to attend."
Graduate Student,4,"My experience with the program was productive. However, the department secretaries sometimes make it difficult for students to feel comfortable expressing themselves or requesting and utilizing resources."
Junior,4,California State University Dominguez Hills is a small school and easy to get around. It has friendly staff and motivated Professors that only want the best for their students. They have a big range of food options that fits everyone’s preference. Even though the campus is not as large as other schools CSUDH is currently under construction and is expanding little by little. One out of three large buildings has been completed. Two of the buildings will be for instruction and one will be for brand new dorms! Overall it is a friendly school with students from all around the world.
Freshman,4,"As a first generation student and a freshman college seemed very overwhelming. During the summer of 2019, I attended a 6 week summer bridge program that helped me transition from high school to college. The environment felt very welcoming and overall safe. Some of the staff were really good to me and I appreciate their efforts into helping me transition. During my first semester which started during the fall, I felt a bit lost. Luckily, many resources came in handy like the library and tutoring center. I also took advantage of walk in therapy sessions whenever I needed to let out some steam and rant. It's been a decent year."
Niche User,4,"Dominguez Hills is like no other 4-year university, they are very accepting and though I do not attend the university my cousin really loves the school. From hearing her experiences, I truly enjoy the campus and after seeing how clean and small the campus is: I would definitely enjoy my time at CSU Dominguez Hills."
Freshman,4,"CSU-Dominguez Hills is a small school, however the staffs and faculty members know how to make the best of this school. They do their very best to make school fun and easily access able to help and other things students need."
Alum,4,"I found a lot of wonderful professors and mentors to guide me through my academic career at this school. I found a lovely counselor who was supportive and provided accurate information as well. My lack of a star is representative of the administration of this school. As it stands, the dean has changed hands and has certainly improved, but Registrar and the Admin Office provides lackluster support and had me running around campus more than once throughout my time here."
Junior,4,I like that the school is small and is easy to get used to. I wish it had more activities and was a bit more exciting. Seems too plain.
Junior,4,"The professors are very helpful when you don't understand a topic. They all have different ways of teaching, but all are great for that course. It can be hard to make friends here if you don't know anyone or if you transferred from a different city/school, but the school does have different clubs you can join within your major or interest. They also send you emails about different events that can be an interest to you. Overall it is a very good school to go to."
Alum,4,Small campus that packs a punch! there is a sense of community and everyone here has been wonderful in being helpful and open.
Freshman,4,"The professors are amazing and very reasonable on how they teach.  The campus is relatively small, so everything is in walking distance.  The campus is also expanding with new buildings for business and the science departments.  It is a shame that we do not have a football team, but our soccer teams and basketball teams are fun to watch.  The parking is never a problem due to the amount of parking lots the school has.  The school overall is a great college and I would recommend it to anyone who is deciding on what school they would like to attend."
Alum,4,It is a quaint campus. It's not too big but not too small either. People are quite friendly and there aren't any loud noises that distract you from actually studying.
Junior,4,"I love DH’s diversity among the students and staff, everybody is welcomed.
There are amazing professors that have taught me many things that I know will help me for my future. 
I’m proud to say that I’m a student at DH due to the amount of resources there are to help students of all majors. 
The communications department has knowledgeable professors to help you in your career."
Sophomore,4,"I love this school, not only because it is small but it has great professors. What it does miss is the school lack of food options, but other than that it is great."
Freshman,4,The university is smaller than most. Most professors will provide affordable alternatives for school materials if students cannot afford it.
Niche User,4,It is a really good school but they don't have a lot of clubs for Political Science majors. But it is an affordable school and the professors and students are very kind.
Freshman,4,"I’m an upcoming freshman this fall at csudh and I love the choice I made because I found a place I fit in. Csudh has many resources and opportunities for students, and they’re also very supportive. The staff & mentors care a lot for the students and have good interests. The campus is filled with resources and amazing relaxation spots. The school provides us with summer courses for freshman to get used to college life and meeting new people, which I appreciate. I would only change the process of the construction sites because I want the school to be done."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the smaller college, it feels like many of the teachers have more time to help every single student that actually needs it. Smaller class room sizes are nice too."
Freshman,4,I went to the orientation last month for Dominguez Hills. The campus is not too big and the orientation leaders are very energetic and nice. Teddy is very funny and energetic as well.
Sophomore,4,"I really like it at Dominguez Hills. I was scared of going to a new school and the change in curriculum from high school to college, but the programs that Dominguez offers such as different colleges that you are a part of and the peer mentor program really helped me have a smooth transition. The professors that I had my first year at Dominguez were attentive, helpful, and really taught me a lot. Overall, Dominguez is a good school that has programs to help you succeed, people to help you, and really cool events all year long."
Sophomore,4,"I like the campus, I’ve met so many people I can learn from there with many different personalities. Only thing I wish would be different, is adding more diversity to the school."
Senior,4,"Honestly I really like the university. There isn’t much to complain about, the usual is parking problems but other then that it’s a great school. The campus is nice and once the construction is done it will be beautiful. I have to say there is a really good  amount of professors that are passionate about what they teach, which makes the class move interesting."
Junior,4,"Dominguez Hills has a very inclusive community between the students and faculty. Most professors want students to succeed; however when it comes to appeals the school lacks to actually carry out the process and has more of a ""well it is what the teacher said so you have to go with that."" attitude. I do hope they work on exercising appeals the right way. Besides that, the courses are challenging, but with the resources given to us such as the toro learning center and the library, the challenging courses become fascinating courses."
Senior,4,"A beautiful, small campus that you can work with others to the extreme. The size and closeness of the community of students accounts for more networking possibilities than ever. The diversity of students and great athletics system is everything you can ask for in a college. The professors are beyond excellent, a lot in which take personal interest that expands more than just the classroom, but for real life highlights such as internships and careers. We are located in a beautiful area near a mall and other essentials, very close to freeways that can be accessed at all times for convenience as well. Overall this is an amazing college!"
Freshman,4,"I just finished my first year here, the experience was bumpy for a first time college student but your advisors really care to help you through it all. Take advantage of the help provided, it makes a good home for the next 4 years."
Junior,4,"The university is very inclusive and diverse. It is one of the most affordable of the Cal States. In my experience, they have dedicated professors that help and understand student life. Most of them will cater and be a little more flexible, as the professors are very understanding and non-judgemental. The only gripe I have is that the university is also one of the newest of the Cal States, but it also is the most run down. There needs to be a better implementation of technology to better engage students."
Freshman,4,CSUDH is a very good school that offers many resources to its students to make sure their experience is an enjoyable one. I would like to see more African American students represented on campus in more areas than just AA studies and kinesiology but overall its a really nice school.
Alum,4,Enrolling in courses was very easy and it was rare for classes I needed to be unavailable. The professors were pretty good as well. The only bad thing is that it is hard for alumni to obtain previous information such as transcripts since we lose access to our student portal.
Freshman,4,"Dominguez hills is a great school for those who want to go to college. although the campus is small, it gives enrolled student bigger oppurtunities to speak to professor and counselors."
Niche User,4,"My experience at California State University - Dominguez Hills was interesting. The people were very enthusiastic especially the dance team. But,it was hard for me to find a major because there is not enough to major in. I feel that its more for physical activities than for mental activities."
Junior,4,My experience here so far had its ups and downs. Starting from a lonley freshman trying to find himself while eating a subway sandwhich alone to a confident third year with connections and support from many people. The proffesors and the learning experince they provided for me were mostly interesting and created a great atmosphere for someone like me. I never really found myelf involved in school and thought it was a bore most of the time but going through college taught me that its not about passing classes but rather finding yourself and making a community of people who you connect with creating a brighter experience.
Niche User,4,I have been accepted by Cal State Dominguez Hills. I chose this school because I feel that they actually care about their students and are trying to focus on their students graduation.
Freshman,4,"The CSU Dominguez Hills is one of the best colleges. My college is far away from my home. I live off campus, I’m glad I choose this school. The library is big, there is a small cafe on the first floor. Sometimes I buy hot cocoa or Vanilla bean drink. I can’t focus studying on the first floor because the blender is loud. I usually spend my time studying on the second floor. Sometimes I do my homework using the study tables. My GE adviser helps me a lot on my classes. There are many programs help students like Toro Learning Center (a tutoring program). The school is spacious and there are tall buildings. It is easy to find college and class locations. To able to find classes accurately is to check with the help desk. 

The changes I would like to see is an extension of housing dorm. The vacant is easily get occupied by students."
Junior,4,"I like the fact that they give you plenty of opportunities to find out about your major, to find a job, to find an internship and, the career center is always hosting events to help the students."
Junior,4,I would like to see the University invest more in its maintenance. I see lots of bathrooms are dirty at times. Professors should also be evaluated on the experiences of their students because I feel like a few history professors perform their job poorly.
Junior,4,It is very easy to get into this school. They require the additional upper level math like many other Cal states do.
Freshman,2,I made the wrong decision coming here I should of went to a community college and aimed high. I don't know how I feel in this environment it doesn't seem right I believe i would be better in a different campus.
Niche User,2,"I am very disappointed with this university. There is no sense of direction when you try asking for it. When you seek help, no one is there to guide you or advise you. Office workers are also very impatient and rude. The majority of the science professors are no help at all and seemed bothered when you don't know the material the same day that they teach it."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not know how to explain athletics at CSUDH. I am not aware of students' involvement, performance or spirit."
College Junior,2,It's outdated. New Dorms need to be built.
College Freshman,2,The chemistry department chair is the worst professor out of the whole chemitry department when you ask her for her she makes you even more confused.
College Freshman,2,The athletes here are rude
College Junior,2,Advertise sports activities but no one is really interested.
College Freshman,2,The coaches are false advertising their coaching and work ethics
College Senior,2,Since I have been enrolled in college I have not been given any financial aid. It has been tough because I have taken care of the costs which can be pretty stressful.
College Junior,2,"There just mostly fast food chain restaurants, I wish there were more options and variety"
College Junior,2,There are not much parties- the only options are going to clubs with friends
College Junior,2,"What I hate about the financial aid office is that they are low on staff. Most of the times I go in, there is only one person working there if you're lucky there are two people. The people working there could be nicer too as us students are not familiar with the financial aid process as much as the workers are."
Recent Alumnus,2,because we do not have greek life on campus
College Sophomore,2,Not much going on on campus.  Have to go off campus for most activities.
College Junior,2,"Every Single semester there is an issue with my financial aid. Every single time they say I don't have any financial aid and have to find a way to pay for school and sometimes they will send me a letter saying there was a mistake and that I do actually qualify for it. Regardless of what my grants are, the school never has ""access/information"" to it."
College Junior,2,Carson is such a small city and the mall is horrible. there really nothing to do here.
College Junior,2,I have been paying for my tuition for about three years now. I stop getting financial aid because supposedly  my dad was earning to much money. I showed prove that he doesn't and still they didn't help at all. And its a hassle having to pain out my own pocket. I refuse to get loans.
College Freshman,2,It is mostly fast food.
College Senior,2,"The food court at the school is terrible. They have a taco bell, subway, pizza place, panda express, and a school cafe. All of the food is overpriced and sub-par quality. I have ordered food from panda express paying more than usual for wilted chow main and receiving less food than at other locations."
College Senior,2,The notification system for scholarships at CSUDH is sub-par at best. The due dates have not been updated several times and some scholarships have been expired for a while but have not been removed. The amount of scholarships needs to be increased as well.
College Senior,2,The area around the school is very industrial so there is not much of a night life. The StubHub center shares a parking lot with the university so I would say that going there is the closest thing to nightlife that the school offers.
College Junior,2,Most off-campus housing consists of small apartments or sublet rooms in duplex houses.
College Freshman,2,so far i enjoy the people that work at this school. everyone is very friendly and helpful.
College Senior,2,"I do not think that this school is unique. The programs are average. But, I do enjoy my classes and my professors."
College Senior,2,"There's not enough options off-campus. There is a Starbucks, but its kind of far."
College Senior,2,there is not night life or anything besides the school that will attract anybody to attend there. there is the stub hub center but nothing for the students to get excited about.
College Sophomore,2,closest city is long beach
College Senior,2,I think the campus could better with more programs and events
College Senior,2,The school waits until the last minute to let you know that something has changed 
College Senior,2,We dont have that much school spirt honestly 
College Senior,2,The internet is slow and the computer labs were reduced for teachers 
Recent Alumnus,2,Most of the area surrounding the campus are homes which most students cannot afford.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are always some sort of forms to fill out, additionally loans should not be under financial aid"
College Junior,2,Very few of the teachers are willing to work with you to actually learn and pass the class.
College Junior,2,You do not want to hang out in any of the local areas. Crime rate is off the chart and lots of gang activity. The best bet is at least head to long beach or seal beach.
College Junior,2,I understand the location of the school is in a poor area but doesn't mean the school has to be that bad. The teachers the last semester were the worst I've had in my college experience and the poor quality in labs is very disappointing.
College Senior,2,"Very strict, very costly, lot of crime"
College Senior,2,Costs too much for little to no freedom
College Sophomore,2,Like most campuses lots of partying 
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of Greek pride on campus
College Sophomore,2,Not great sports teams. Facilities could use some updating 
College Sophomore,2,Campus at night does not feel safe for a woman walking to car
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot available or safe
College Sophomore,2,Not enough staff for help and registration. 
College Sophomore,2,Over priced. No double beds available. Over crowded 
College Sophomore,2,Better to go to longbeach or la 
College Junior,2,"There is not much school spirit in athletics and we do not have great pep-rallies and not many people attend the basketball games but majority of people attend the soccer games but that is only because we have the Home Depot center (which is now SubHub) next to our campus. therefore, most visitors do not attend CSUDH when going to the soccer games."
College Junior,2,"The dining around campus is not very vegetarian friendly ( and I am a vegetarian) so therefore, I have to settle with subway or fries every day."
College Freshman,2,Campus dining is okay. There is not as much variety and I rather make something myself then waste money on campus food. Campus dining gets old.
College Freshman,2,"Campus police can be very strict when it comes to parking permits. Although I would like them to be around more often. When it comes to social events they are always around to get under age drinkers, but overall I think it is a good thing."
College Junior,2,Sports at CSUDH are not popular because students rarely attend them and we rarely win.
Recent Alumnus,2,I must say the whether recently has been far too hot for anyone to enjoy sitting out on the grassy areas of the school. Too many people are also inside the buildings. The majority of areas of the school are made of stone or concrete s it doesn't help things much.
College Junior,2,"The athletic involvement at our school is slim to none. Student involvement has goes up and down over the years, but even so new faces are often seen on the teams. The performance of each team varies greatly throughout the year; their consistency is minimal. Fan support grows when the games are properly advertised, but for the most part only a small average of students attend the games. School spirit could be improved greatly, but its hard to motivate most students into attending."
College Junior,2,"The area can be dead, but the school is close to Long Beach, and other areas that have a better night life."
College Junior,2,All of the technology is great at the school. We have multiple places where we can use computers.
College Junior,2,Lucky Star is a pretty good restaurant. Carne Asada fries a GREAT!!!!
College Junior,2,There is not really student housing around the school. It is more of a commuter school.
College Junior,2,"As a person that lives far away from the school before living on campus, there are not a lot of variety of food that is walking distance."
College Senior,2,"The nightlife at the school isn't that great. There will be some dorm parties, but if you want to do something fun, you have to go to downtown longbeach of a different location."
College Junior,2,"Its average. Standard dining hall food. I prefer to head down the street and eat at McDonalds, Subway, Fat Burger, or Del Taco."
College Sophomore,1,Terrible staff!!! They do NOT care for students!!!
Recent Alumnus,1,The school has a major raccoon infestation problem.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no campus culture so the greek life is non-existent.
Recent Alumnus,1,The gym facilities are old and out-dated. Students can't workout at their leisure.
College Junior,1,It's hard to think about job prospects when you can't get the classes you need to graduate.
College Junior,1,So far my experience at this school has been disheartening and disparaging. I'm paying a lot of money for not a lot of classes because the program I am in is impacted and I can't get into any of the classes that I need to complete the course of study that I was accepted to complete at Dominguez Hills. I've been told that classes are given to students who are closer to graduating which I guess makes a little sense to me but stops making sense when you realize that as a student you can never get close to graduating if you can't get any classes. HELP!!!
College Sophomore,1,"Sorority and fraternity wise majority of them are latina/latino based organizations. So you can imagine if you aren't a Latina, the number of diversity is slim to none in those organizations. We do have some of the divine 9 on campus. But greek life here doesn't affect your experience at this university. It's not as big of a deal compared to stronger greek life campuses like CSU Long Beach, USC, UCLA , etc."
College Sophomore,1,Don't have any knowledge of anything like this on my campus
Recent Alumnus,1,i have no seen any.
College Freshman,1,"The office loses papers, they consider loans financial aid when it is not, and even though a student such as myself doesn't qualify for financial aid does not mean my family is rich enough to send me to school without painful money struggles. The financial aid process is not fair to middle class families and does not consider struggling families like mine trying to gain some award to help get me through school."
College Senior,1,no nightlife at all.. booooooo
College Junior,1,"This is a commuter school, there is no where to party within 10 miles"
College Senior,1,The people are nice but the equipment is old 
College Senior,1,If you want to party on our campus your looking at the wrong campus 
College Senior,1,I was on campus late one day studying and a campus police officer got in my face and was questioning me repeatedly after i told him why i was there 
College Senior,1,There only one placed down the street from my school that gives us a discount and the food isnt that good 
College Senior,1,My school only offer classes that i need to graduate every other semester and it makes it hard for me to get the classes that i need specially since i work
College Junior,1,My first semester here and the teachers are terrible and the quality of labs are disgusting
College Junior,1,My parents make too much money and I have never received any financial aide
College Senior,1,"Very small, they assign too many students to a dorm and they need new kitchen & household appliances."
College Senior,1,I would never move back in
College Freshman,1,"Not to be racist or anything but there is too many Hispanics like coming from an African American girl, I wish there was more of my kind"
College Junior,1,I would agree that CSUDH does not have a drug scene well at least to my knowledge.
Recent Alumnus,1,There really isn't much of a local atmosphere especially considering the recent hot whether that has struck the state. People largely stick to their small tightly woven groups or simply leave the campus immediately after class.
Recent Alumnus,1,Not very much options when it comes to off-campus dining if you do not own a driving vehicle. The school is surrounded by housing and companies.
College Junior,1,"I give the dorms a D+ because overall because they are dirty to me, and the fact that you have to stay with other people is very annoying. When you share a room with someone you have to deal with the people they bring over, them playing loud music, and even them coming out and in when you are trying to study."
College Senior,1,California bus system. No lightrail or specific bus to campus.
College Junior,1,Traffic in the area is horrible. It can over an hour to get there from Los Angeles.
College Sophomore,1,There are not that many up close parking spots because they fill up early. Also parking is 90 bucks a semester or 4dollars a day which is too much. Also I got four parking tickets each are $40.
College Senior,1,I have only seen that the athletes that attend this school receive scholarships. I have yet to see others that are awarded scholarships.
College Senior,1,From what I have observed there isn't a night life on this campus due to most of the students who attend this school commute from various areas.
College Senior,1,Hmm It Can Be Dangerous. There has been more then one incident on our campus where women have been raped and severely hurt. Since I started attending CSUDH I had to purchase a pepper spray for my own safety. I avoid night classes. Park as close as I can. And always always have a walking buddy with me.
College Senior,1,"There is no night life, unless you count gang activity"
College Senior,1,Parking on campus during the beginning of a semester can be dreadful. Other than that parking structures located in campus do accommodate students since some lots do not seem to get full. The parking permits are ridiculously high $200 per semester i believe or $4 for a daily pass
College Junior,1,I haven't been in housing in several years but four to a room is not something I would look forward to in any capacity.
College Junior,1,Problem Labs – The computer labs need to be open later and the initial set number of free prints should till be allowed to offset the cost we pay to use them.
College Freshman,1,Hey Don't Park There!!! The Parking situation at this school is ridiculous. It really bothers me how strict Dominguez Hills is on Parking. I honestly feel that more attention is focused on the trivial things such as parking and dorm parties. It is not fair for students to be stressed out over academics an school fees and have to be met at their cars with a ticket for 38 dollars. That 38 dollars coul go towards a book or copies.
College Freshman,1,"This Year It Hasn't Filled My Expectations – I haven't yet received any type of grant only loans. I don't know why, but this year my financial aid experience has been very bad. By the deadline at my school I turned in all the documents that needed to be submitted and I was told that My awards will be processed. Midway throughout the summer I still hadn't gotten anything so I emailed the office, I didn't get correspondence from them which made me have to go personally into their office, They needed another document which I was never notified about and this happened twice more with two other documents. Overall I feel My school's financial aid office needs to notify students if they need extra documents especially if it's close to the semester beginning. For anyone going through these types of problems don't email, just walk in the offices."
College Junior,1,"the safety and campus policies on campus arent that strict. there are instances of people getting held up, getting robbed etc.."
College Sophomore,1,"Transporation Sucks! The transportation around campus is horrible. I spent hours and hours waiting for a bus that will take me 20 mintues from the campus to my stop, in which I will have to take another transporation vehicle to my house. The cost is also horrible. I'm glad I have a car."

Junior,5,"Bethel has been a great place to be. I am currently a junior mechanical engineering major and their growing engineering department has been extremely beneficial for my education. 
I have also been able to explore my faith and grow closer to others around me."
Sophomore,5,"I love Bethel! The community is great, the people you meet will be some of your closest friends, and the faculty is so welcoming and helpful. The professors are very personable. I have had a couple that invite our class over to their house for Christmas parties or an end of the year BBQ."
Sophomore,5,All of the professors were very undertanding of the circumstances were in and encouraged us to reach out if we ever needed anything. They care so much for their students and really want to see them thrive.
Junior,5,I love Bethel! It has been such a life changing place for me! Who I am as a person has been positively impacted much more than just the academic side. I am a student athlete here and it is amazing to see the community of this school! Among all the female athletes there’s a Sunday night bible study where we are able to connect with all different kinds of sports and cheer one another on! The professors are incredible and have invested so much into me and my future as an educator! I’m so thankful that I chose to come to this school!
Alum,5,"I went to Bethel for their RN-ADN to BSN program. I had 2 previous associates degrees from MNSCU colleges. Bethel was by far the best experience. The teachers care about their students and are flexible. I was very sick at the time an assignment was due and they extended the date without a problem. That never would have happened at my other colleges. Also, their main concern is student comprehension instead of temporarily remembering information for a test. The program wasn’t easy by any means but the instructors made it enjoyable by engaging students and really making us interested in the coursework."
Freshman,5,"Deciding between schools was very difficult because I knew that I wanted to go out of state but I was nervous to go to a big school.  I also wanted to make be independent.  Bethel was the perfect school because there is a spiritual aspect to the campus, but none of it is required.  The people who attend the chapels and worship nights genuinely want to be there, and are not forced to be there.  It is also located right near the twin cities so it is easy to get out and about."
Senior,5,"This school is made for the student who really wants to be known as a person rather than a number. The faculty and staff are top-notch and give an education that is second to none. If you want to become the best version of yourself, attend Bethel!"
Alum,5,"The professors are great and everyone is very inviting. The food is amazing and the dorm facilities are well kept. The campus is beautiful and up to date. The campus is very safe. The cost is a little high, but mostly everyone receives financial aid and it is very helpful it making college a joy filled experience. The buildings are connected, so during the winter it is easier to get around. I would recommend Bethel as it is a great place to attend college and get my degree. Recently, there have been improvements to the entire campus and new labs for the sciences."
Junior,5,"I love Bethel!! It feels like home and has such a great atmosphere. It's a bit smaller and it would be great to have more resources, but I wouldn't want to go anywhere else!"
Niche User,5,Bethel University is like a home when you get out of high school. After you graduate you feel like you are alone but when you go to Bethel you feel like that is your home away from home. Everything from the fantastic home food to the people you meet walking around campus you feel like it's a part of you from the very beginning.
Senior,5,"Bethel University is a great place to further your education. The professors genuinely care for you, and encourage each student to challenge their biases and expand their worldviews. Bethel advocates for spiritual, social, academic, and holistic growth and provides the resources necessary for students to mature and become their most authentic selves."
Sophomore,5,I love Bethel for the Christian liberal arts education that it provides and the caring and compassionate professors!
Freshman,5,"The professors are always willing to help you, they want you to succeed and do your best. The professors are all very knowledgeable about the topics they are teaching which keeps you engaged. The campus is beautiful, lots of good picture spots, and places to relax or do homework."
Alum,5,"I loved the atmosphere, education, and especially the people. It provides a high quality education with access to many amenities. It also has great people to connect with and has an excellent atmosphere for religion, education and self-discovery."
Freshman,5,The school brings God into the classroom and still maintains a high level of academic rigor. Everyone is inclusive and will talk with you about any topic under the sun.
Niche User,5,"I visited Bethel and I fell in love with it right away. The campus is beautiful, the buildings are welcoming and make you feel like you're at home, and their faith is easy to notice just by walking around. There are bible verses everywhere, everyone looks like they're living for Christ and applying the Bible to their classes. It didn't look like a normal college. It looked like another home. Everyone was welcoming when I visited and they had the biggest smiles on their faces. As Bethel is around the cities, there are multiple opportunities for my future occupation and I am so excited to say that I will be attending Bethel. Just after one visit, I knew this is where I was going to go."
Niche User,5,"I am enrolled to go to Bethel University in the fall of 2019.  Everything that I have seen and encountered has been nothing but top notch...i look forward to my college career at Bethel.  From the coaching staff, to worship, to admissions and financial aid advisors, I've been well taken care of and informed.  I highly recommend Bethel University."
Freshman,5,"Attending Bethel University as a Post-Secondary Enrollment Option (PSEO) student has been one of the experiences, and has made me fall completely and utterly in love with the school. All of my professors thus far have been very good at teaching and helping students, and my classes have been very enjoyable yet challenging. All of the students I have met have been nothing but kind and welcoming. As a Christian, the incorporation of faith into all of my courses has been a major plus for my college experience. One of the main things I wish to see a change in is more diversity on campus, for I am from a very diverse high school and that has always been a major part of my education. Overall, my education at Bethel has been nothing short of amazing, and I would recommend this school to any high school student looking for a good education with the friendliest classmates in a Christian environment."
Freshman,5,I like the community and that everyone is willing to help one another no matter the situation. I love that their foundation is a faith-based college because God is always number one to me and so picking a college that has somewhat of a similar moto to me is why it fits.
Freshman,5,I liked how involved the college was and the majors offered. They were really understanding when I was sending in my application and offered guidance through the process.
Niche User,5,"The administration and students have been very welcoming and accommodation throughout my visits on campus. They hold strongly to what they were funded on which is the christian beliefs and values, and I love how the professors and students are looking to make personal connections."
Sophomore,5,"Bethel University has changed me and has begun to shape me into the young woman God created me to be. From the moment I made my decision on BU, I had peace and joy about the future. I am now currently living the college life I prayed about for years. I attend classes with professors who speak and teach to me like they are a friend. They care for me as a student and a person. The community aspect fuels the people. There is a sense of togetherness, even between the people I do not know. The chapel services have rocked my world and spirit; the speakers, as well as students around me, push me to be a better person and stronger Christ follower. I am confident in the college decision I made. Bethel is authentic, it is inspirational, and it is home."
Sophomore,5,"Bethel has completely changed my attitude toward others, sports, academics, and my walk with Christ. The atomosphere here is so encouraging and positive and supportive. The academics so far have been outstanding! Bethel has given me some of my very close and forever friends."
Senior,5,Bethel has a small but beautiful campus with a variety of housing options. I've made many acquaintances here and a few close friends and my favorite experiences here happened because I joined choir and started going to the many special activities and performances out student government puts together. I love the opportunity to learn about my faith at the same time as I gain academic knowledge here.
Sophomore,5,"Bethel University provides a great professor to student ratio. The professors actually care about you too. Beautiful campus, supportive community."
Junior,5,The online program for working adults is perfectly tailored to suit my needs. I can complete coursework on my own schedule and interact with other students. The advisors and staff have also been extremely helpful.
Freshman,5,"My time at Bethel so far has been amazing! The professors really care about you and want you to succeed. The campus is so beautiful and there are a lot of things to do around campus. The dorms are pretty nice and the food is pretty good too. I have grown so much in my faith here from chapel, bible studies, and conversations with other students here.  Although this school is small, there is a lot to get involved in here. I would definitely recommend this school to anyone."
Freshman,5,"Living in the Bethel community has challenged me academically as well as spiritually. Small class sizes have given me the opportunity to know my professors, and to work closely with others."
Freshman,5,"Bethel University really has a great community, a supportive academic connection center that helps immensely with every step of any subject you can think of, and I love living on campus it has made my experience so far so much greater and better than I expected."
Junior,5,"The student body is incredibly friendly, professors truly care about their students (they have given out personal phone numbers, welcomed students into offices, allowed students to babysit children), administration is clearly caring for students. Academics are good, professors challenge students but it is well worth it. Campus is beautiful, dorms are always maintained and generally larger than at other schools."
Sophomore,5,"When I walked on campus for the first time, I knew that this was where I wanted to spend my college career. I love the atmosphere and the caring faculty."
Niche User,5,I love the Bethel community! Visiting family at Bethel has always been a highlight and love how welcoming the people are.
Freshman,5,I love Bethel University. The community is fantastic and the area it is in is perfect for job opportunities and internships.
Freshman,5,"Being at Bethel has honestly been on of the greatest experiences of my life thus far! The friends I have made,  the rigorous academic pace set to prepare you adequately for what lies ahead, the amazing staff and faculty who are more than willing to help you achieve you goals, the amazing food. To put it simply, Bethel University in an incredible school, with a great community that puts Christ at the center of everything."
Niche User,5,Fantastic school!!! Bethel offers a great faith based atmosphere where students feel welcome and comfortable to learn. The education is wonderful with many internship programs to help students succeed. May I also say the food is stellar and campus security does a very good job of keeping students safe.
Junior,5,"Bethel University is a great place for people from all backgrounds can get connected and involved with a christian community all while being encouraged and highly educated.  Bethel has a focus on community in being Christ centered, and very important. "
College Student,5,"Class sizes are very small, which makes for a great, close-knit learning environment."
College Student,5,"The campus security is very responsible and alert.  It is very easy to report anything, especially after learning from the required Sexual Assault training in the summer."
College Student,5,"Bethel University is a haven for driven, young Christians who wish to make a positive impact on their world.  I have so much pride for my school and applying was one of the best decisions I have ever made, due to the community and to all of the great opportunities I have thus been provided with so far."
College Sophomore,5,Bethel just made a whole new Wellness Center which is amazing. State of the art machines and a great space to work out! One of the best parts of campus-besides the dining center!
College Sophomore,5,The experience with courses and professors has been one of a kind. The courses are all taught by passionate and caring professors who have mastered their fields. The professors make students feel comfortable and allow them to grow in their education and prepare them for their selected fields.
College Junior,5,"Bethel works hard to get people jobs and internships. Alumni plays a huge, active role in job outlook and network and such."
College Freshman,5,"Most people at this school aren't interested in drugs and the party scene.  Some parties are rumored about, but they occur off-campus."
College Freshman,5,The people on that enroll in this school generally wouldn't be into harming anyone.  If anything the only concern would be students from other schools coming here and causing problems.
College Freshman,5,We have a 24/7 security system on campus. We have security patrolling throughout the campus at all times and are accessible at anytime they are needed.
College Freshman,5,It has a wide variety of opportunity for students. I'm in Business and I can guarantee a great help comes from the school at finding internships and jobs after you graduate.
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus. The security is remarkable, and I always see security guards at night. Some have helped me in situations before."
College Junior,5,"The worst options for on campus living are wonderful compared to several other colleges and universities. The social atmosphere is inviting anywhere, which makes up for the small spaces of some living options. Choosing housing is somewhat stressful as certain dorm rooms tend to fill up more quickly than others. After that process and people are settled in their housing, everyone is happy with their dorms."
College Junior,5,"Athletics are respected and well attended. A lot of our school spirit comes from sporting events. It's neat to see how much attention intramurals receive also. It's a way for people of all athletic backgrounds to participate in athletic activity together. Our brand new fitness center is a big hit on campus, too, for all students."
College Junior,5,My school has a community like none other. I had never felt more welcomed into a new community than before setting foot on campus. Students and professors truly care about each other; that is something I could not have found anywhere else should I have decided to choose a differently.
College Freshman,5,"So far, as a freshman after first semester I have loved Bethel!  I was more of a studies based student during high school, as well as more of a introvert.  After coming to Bethel, I was able to leave all that behind and start a new chapter.  The other new students were all super friendly and I was able to branch out and make lots of friends.  I have joined some intramural sports and clubs.  The classes have been interesting, you can definitely tell it is a Christian based school.  The professors are very approachable and passionate about what they do."
College Sophomore,5,Bethel is one of the best in the state
College Sophomore,5,"No school, outside of community college, would've been inside of my perferred budget, but I anticipated that an won't complain about what I pay. I also appreciat that Bethel cares about its communter population and it will only get better from here, which is a lot more than can be said for other schools."
College Freshman,5,I received very reasonable scholarships.
College Freshman,5,"I play Women's Basketball and it is great. I love the athletic facilities that are available to us. Not only people who play a varsity sport, but anyone who wants is allowed to use the gym or other work out equipment places when they are not being used."
College Freshman,5,It is great living on campus. There is always things to do with people. If you are bored there is a shuttle available to take people to the mall and target so that is awesome. I believe the dorm life has been a great experience so far.
College Freshman,5,I believe Bethel University's campus is very safe and I have never heard of any problems with safety.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe if I am out late at night by myself or with others.
College Junior,5,"The Christian foundation is based on marriage and no sex before marriage. There are many couples on campus, but 90% of them are married."
College Junior,5,"With the environment, it is safe and enclosed from the rest of the city. Students and faculty are Christians, there is a very low tolerance for any such issues."
Freshman,4,Great adjustment to switching to online. They did a great job making sure everyone is still able to learn remotely.
Freshman,4,Bethel has such a welcoming community and it will always feel like home. I know I am being taught by amazing Christian professors and will be successful in my future.
Junior,4,"I had to take a few classes online due to COVID 19 and I thought for the given situation that they were handled in a way that was beneficial to both the students and faculty. Most courses didn't lighten the load during these times, but since I was learning from home I had much more time to learn the information being taught. Overall, online learning is an option and can work out better because of time restraints but I recommend a physical class to experience the great attitudes and teaching arithmetic of the professors."
Junior,4,"Given the circumstances, Bethel has done its best to provide online learning opportunities, foster community, and keep students informed."
Junior,4,"Bethel University is a fantastic school. Bethel is highly accredited, has a great music program, and has an unparalleled sense of community and belonging. However, Bethel does not have much diversity and is filled with homophobia masked as Christianity."
Junior,4,Bethel University is a great place for those who want to build a community of people that are going to be life-long friends. The staff/faculty are supportive and are willing to work with students to help them be successful.
Niche User,4,"I am currently a PSEO student here at Bethel. Overall a very good school, if a little strict. The place and service was incredible, academics are fair, and the people are fantastic. Bit lacking in the placement and buisness sections, though."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience has been great. Smaller school, allows for people to see each other a lot. Faculty know just about everyone in their classes. Dining center can be a bit stingy on portion sizes but just go through the line again. Would not change my decision to come here."
Sophomore,4,The atmosphere is undeniably different and has something special about it. There is a sense of community between everyone on campus. The location is prime being right outside the city and only a short drive from the hub bub of the cities and anything you could need. The tuition of course is spendy and I would recommend having a plan for how you will afford it and making sure you are aware how much you are paying and what you are paying for. The facilities are stellar for the size of this school. The staff are top notch and most certainly some of the most helpful educators there are. Not to forget that the standards of this campus in every single aspect are very high and so much is expected of you every day.
Sophomore,4,"I love the way that this college approaches Christianity. The environment is one where Jesus' love is being spread all across campus, and it helps to make people feel more welcome on campus. I have met so many amazing people who really seem to care for one another. The class variety that is available is also very great for being a smaller school. In addition, I have met many great teachers who care about their students, and they truly want to get to know you. However, the price point of this school is a little high."
Sophomore,4,"When deciding between universities, one of the deciding factors was the theological teachings. I appreciate how Bethel gives you the tools for you to challenge your faith in a non-condescending way. It could improve in how certain teachers treat minority students. I've heard some pretty bad experiences from friends."
Freshman,4,I like bethel university because it is a beautiful campus.  The professors are super nice and they help you out to their fullest potential.
Senior,4,"I enjoy the christian perspective on typical college subjects it allowed us to think about this differently. I love the schedule of the online class, very fast paced but you are able to learn all the key takeaways with time management skills. The one thing I really disliked was the amount of group projects we were required to do, one thing about online class is, especially in the adult studies criteria is that we are all working adults, and group projects just don't work due to how we are in courses manly to fit our schedules 1 or 2 individuals always do a majority of the work."
Sophomore,4,"Bethel has high credibility for such a small school. While their size could be viewed as a negative, it allows faculty to not only connect with students while they are attending, but also work with each individual to help with the students next step in life."
Junior,4,"Excellent professors who teach with passion, genuinely care about your educational growth as well as spiritual growth.  Classes tend to be small, especially when you get to major specific classes."
Junior,4,"I love that the program I am in allows me to work full-time and be a student. The program is intensive, but worthwhile and I'm fortunate to be completing my degree soon."
Senior,4,"I’ve had a great experience academically at Bethel University. If I could change anything, it would be the social climate. You’re expected to fit the mold and be a certain type of person at Bethel. Different attitudes and lifestyle choices are frowned upon and it takes away the freedom for students to be who they are."
Junior,4,Bethel is a smaller school that has lots of great professors who will actually take the time to interact with you one on one. The STEM majors here are well backed and doing the same caliber of research as major state schools.
Junior,4,"Bethel is a very safe environment and pushes you academically and spiritually if you open up to the opportunities there. There are rules with going to Bethel and living there, but they are nothing unimaginable and make it easy to go there. The community atmosphere is incredible."
Sophomore,4,"Staff works really hard to make the student body feel welcome and find a community to settle in with (especially for Freshman). Professors are held to standards of excellence, so you will do well if you put in the effort and study hard. The student body itself tends to be clique-ish and not as diligent in living out their faith, but becomes less of a problem Junior and Senior year."
Junior,4,"I am a part of the adult online bachelor's program.  I have had a wonderful experience with how the course is set up.   Professors are kind, helpful and accessible.  The staff in the admissions and advising office are quick to respond and helpful as well.  I would recommend this program."
Freshman,4,I love Bethel and never want to leave! The campus is safe and beautiful and the teachers really care about you as a person. There are also so many opportunities to study abroad and it is a comfortable atmosphere. Although I believe this school is amazing you have to be a certain type of person to go here. Bethel is a small rich white Christian school.  I would highly not recommend going here if you do not like small clicky communities and are not a big believer in Christ or willing to become one. This is a great school for someone who has grown up relatively sheltered and does not want to change that. The party scene is also non-existant due to it being a Christian school.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy Bethel. It does have its downsides though, as it feels like they are only giving their money to the sciences - it feels like the liberal arts courses get forgotten about, which is hard because Bethel is a liberal arts school.

The classes are great and interesting, and the connections with professors and people here have been wonderful. I've experienced a lot that I never would have imagined doing so soon into my life, and its because of the connections I've made at Bethel."
Sophomore,4,Bethel's community aspect makes it feel like home. The school grounds are beautiful and I always feel safe here. I have had the experience where my professors really seem to care about their students and their success. They are always ready to help you in areas where you may need it. Bethel has an atmosphere of trust and companionship that I never expected.
Sophomore,4,"Bethel is a great place for people looking to build their faith with other people their age that find faith and academics important. The campus has so many competent professors that are willing to help you when you're struggling. The one problem that I sometimes have with Bethel is that while everyone is super friendly and there's tons of activities to go to, the authenticity of friendships can be lost. It can be hard to get close to people beyond the activities. But overall love it!"
Senior,4,"Bethel is a wonderful place to be, it may be tough if you aren't a Christian or have a relationship with God. But the profs, especially in the humanities are very open to talking to people form all walks of life."
Sophomore,4,"Bethel University is an incredible educational institution that values honest and high quality education and discussion in the classroom and the overall community. I have had the best experience at Bethel and have not only learned information that helps me toward my degree and future career, but has also taught me intrinsically valuable lessons about myself and society. The only criticism I have for Bethel is the lack of diversity in the student population, although Bethel does its best to encourage conversations from all different viewpoints and opinions within the context of Christian values."
Niche User,4,"After spending a couple days at Bethel University, I see that all the professors are friendly, with great wisdom to share. The community is great too, especially among dorm mates and dorm neighbors. Though sometimes I get confused about where I am, overall a nice campus too."
Freshman,4,"As a Christian, being at Bethel University has been great. I love that professors begin their classes with a word of prayer and incorporate Christian values throughout their teaching. The people and community of Bethel University are awesome. Most everyone is kind and genuine and can hold a good conversation even if you do not know them well. Bethel does a thing called welcome week for the incoming freshmen which is very eye opening. The upperclassmen put in hours of work to make the incoming freshmen feel comfortable and ready to grow in their academics and their faith as well."
Sophomore,4,"I love my college! The only complaint I have is that it is hard to get off of campus and feel connected to the community, but I feel as if Bethel has a great community of its own. The professors are interested in success, the students are friendly, the campus is clean, and the food is amazing.   "
Sophomore,4,"The academic scene for Pre-Medicine is stellar. The small class sizes and opportunity for research is something that cannot be found at most big schools, and the quality is something not found at many smaller schools. The food and people scene at Bethel are both adequate. If there is one thing clearly lacking, it is the surrounding scene and the absence of a ""college town."" That being said, that is usually not something found at a small school anyways. Overall, good choice. "
College Junior,4,It is a generally safe environment. I here of very few things happening on campus. Whether it is true or a cover up I'm uncertain of.
College Junior,4,"Most people I know who have graduated have a job, but whether they are working in their field is the question."
College Junior,4,There are so many different housing options that everyone tends to be pretty happy
College Junior,4,"I like the people I am now surrounded by. I also really like the professors, particularly in my department."
College Freshman,4,Bethel teams typically perform in the top half of the conference.
College Freshman,4,I am on campus early to participate in the volleyball program.  Everyone has been very friendly and welcoming thus far.
College Student,4,The alumni network is great; I know so many.
College Student,4,"I do not live on campus, but I did live in Heritage for Girls State over the summer.  It was super fun living with five other girls and getting to know them.  We are all still great friends, even though they live so far away.  The cleaning volunteers were so great to help us move in and to make everything fresh for us."
College Student,4,"I loved going to football games to support my friends.  It is a great atmosphere, and the team isn't too bad.  Also, all the girls on the cross country team are so sweet!"
College Sophomore,4,Bethel's values are amazing and our covenant is great. I would definitely send my future children to bethel if the diversity rate improves.
College Sophomore,4,There are shuttles that run around campus and in the community which keeps students safe. We also have security every day after dark. Students are able to call security to help them get from one location to another at any time of night.
College Sophomore,4,The housing is great! It's mainly apartment style and relatively close to campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are very caring, since it's a small school you would see people often and professors often as well. The campus is absolutely beautiful."
College Sophomore,4,Drinking and drug use at Bethel isn't as abundant as other schools but is definitely present. You definitely hear about people who drink in their dorm rooms and go into the cities to party but its not as if everyone does.
College Sophomore,4,"One of Bethel's best attributes is it's safety on campus. I've never felt uncomfortable or scared on campus-even at night. However, I will say that Bethel has a lot more issues with sexual assault than they will admit or know about."
College Sophomore,4,The student career prospects and the value of a degree from Bethel are all very good. There are many opportunities for students to find jobs or internships at Bethel. A degree from Bethel is a valued thing to obtain. Bethel has great programs that are quite rigorous. This is what makes the degree so valuable.
College Sophomore,4,The Bethel security is great. There are constant patrol cars running 24/7. This makes the campus feel safe and protected. Crime at Bethel is practically unheard of. Many people feel comfortable enough to even leave their laptops on a table in the library while they go to dinner.
College Sophomore,4,The housing at Bethel is very good. The social atmosphere was lacking a little in the dorm I was in. The rooms were huge and there were many ammenities for us to enjoy.
College Sophomore,4,Bethel is a school that has great academic programs and focuses strongly on preparing students to become capable in their fields of choice. A unique feature about Bethel is that it offers many opportunities for undergraduate research; which opens many doors for students to succeed.
College Junior,4,Some professors are tough but you're going to experience that anywhere you go. I like Bethel a lot.
College Junior,4,Sometimes too much emphasis on sports over academics
College Freshman,4,How hard the course work is generally depends on your major.  People usually generalize that science majors and math majors get the most work.  The professors are great and with the available help of your advisors making a manageable workload should be do-able.
College Freshman,4,"It's great, the academics are of very high quality"
College Freshman,4,The classes are very good and high quality. The professors are professionals in their field and do a great job at relaying information to their students.
College Freshman,4,They have great athletic facilities and the students are very supportive of the teams
College Freshman,4,The pros outweigh the cons.
College Junior,4,Bethel does a good job of encouraging internships and placing people in a variety of field experiences.
College Junior,4,"Bethel has a variety of dorms, some newer than others, for a variety of lifestyle choices. All are within a 10 minute casual stroll to the academic buildings. Laundry is always free so that's a plus. You can't get cable in the rooms but there is a common space in each dorm that has cable. Besides most people watch things on the computer now days anyways."
College Freshman,4,"There was only one professor that I did not resonate with, but the rest were very caring and interested in my learning experiences. They all seemed to want to be there, and they were passionate about their subjects."
Freshman,2,"The social life at Bethel has been, unfortunately, pretty poor for myself.  I did PSEO full time for my junior and senior year so I was out of the high school environment for a while.  However, since coming to Bethel I feel like I'm right back in it.  I believe the faculty is composed of genuinely nice people, however, the student body seems to be filled with more fakey-nice people than genuinely kind people.  Additionally, I oftentimes feel that Bethel students are quite judgmental as well.  As a straight, white female I feel that I have trouble feeling free to express myself.  With that being said I can't imagine what it must feel like for someone who's apart of the LGBTQ+ community or of a different ethnicity/ race."
Niche User,2,"It's simple. If you don't believe in their religion, you shouldn't go here. I know that there are lots of religious schools like Augsburg or Concordia that are affiliated with a religion but Bethel university pressures it on you even if they SAY they won't. Also there is ZERO diversity here(in race, culture, experiences,etc.). It's made up of majority rich Caucasian students that have their parents paying for their tuition. Students here can also appear to be dumb sometimes because their sooooo frikin sheltered that they literally don't have a clue what the real world is actually like. This makes it hard to connect to them because they just sound ignorant when it comes to some discussions.  As for their facilities, their food is better than a majority of colleges but their dorms suck....and there is absolutely no student life, to the point where everyone goes home every week, even if they live 3-4 hours away. That's all."
College Sophomore,2,"A big issue here at Bethel is a lack of school spirit. No one ever attends athletic games or seems to care about them unless they are on a team. The only football game anyone really goes to is the homecoming game and this year half of the students left midway through the game because of how boring the atmosphere was and how terrible the school spirit is. However, Bethel administration tends to brag about our athletics and spends a lot of money on it. Just don't come to this school hoping for a fun athletic atmosphere or school spirit because there is none."
College Freshman,2,It's not a really diverse school
College Freshman,2,"I did not like it due to it's price and quality, I only lived in a dorm for a semester and moved out on the next one."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many diverse students. Bethel is predominantly white, middle-class, and christian."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not around drinking, but may students partake in drinking. Most kids go off campus to drink and do drugs."
College Freshman,2,There is no Greek Life
College Sophomore,2,"Student involvement is very low in all but football, which is mediocre at best. Team performance is okay, but track facilities are inadequte, to the vast detriment of all athletes and community runners. There isn't much fan support for athletics. Culture within the athletic department is less than supportive within some teams"
Recent Alumnus,2,"I met some people who are my best friends 5 years later so I would be afraid to change that if I had the chance to do it over again. However, the school had little to do with that. It was just chance that I should meet those people. It's far too expensive for what they offer and the community as a whole is not one that I would want to identify with. Academic standards seem to be fairly low, the arts and humanities are underfunded, and the new buildings are ostentatious and unnecessary. They need to fix their spending problems."
Recent Alumnus,2,In 10 years student tuition has gone up by nearly 60%. The loans I have are crippling and it was not worth it.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Administration claims to desire a sense of community amongst students, but their policies perpetuate a sense of us vs them mentality. The ""good"" bethel students vs the ""bad"" ones."
College Freshman,2,Little to no parties on campus - very strict
College Senior,2,We are a dry campus
College Junior,2,"In the process of creating a health and wellness center.  Until then, Bethel is very behind."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no specific off campus housing available to students through Bethel University. It is a possibility, but Bethel does not play any role in management."
College Junior,2,"In the middle of the midwest, walking to and from classes is extremely cold."
College Freshman,2,"The school prides itself on nurturing sheltered christians who do not know how to experience the real world. I feel if I took my Bethel friends to Dinkytown or the U of M, they would curl up in the fetal position or feel so socially uncomfortable they would want to go home. The schools atmosphere equals a high school atmosphere, as most students have not grown up and are not interesting or stimulating in the least. The school doesnt mind that it doesnt encourage a challenging academic setting, and is comfortable remaining average. My personal experience, coming from a large metro suburban public high school, is that this school is more of camp than a school. If you have any reservations about this school, do not go here!! (transferring next year)"
College Freshman,2,"The campus is small and everything is average about it, from the classrooms to the paintings decorating the halls. Very boring if you want more of a lively feel to your school. "
College Freshman,2,Some facilities are good. well just the dining facility. Athletic facilities are similar to most middle class high schools
College Junior,2,Not alot of variety in the rink or party options. But it is a christian school.
College Junior,2,The summers are great but are very short and pale in comparison to the minnesota snowy winters.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is limited and it is hard to get a parking pass, and if you do have one parking spots are hard to find"
College Freshman,2,The night life is not always the best at Bethel.  It can get kind of boring on the weekend. There are tons a places to go around down town area but not always the best transportation.
College Junior,2,"Parking is very good around most of campus, but my dorm parking lot borders a Seminary housing parking lot, and college parking is very limited. There are consistently plenty of open spots in the Seminary section of the lot, but if students park there when the student lot is full, they are fined for it."
College Junior,2,The school is composed of students mainly form the area so it is predominantly the same race.
College Freshman,2,There are very few scholarships here at Bethel. Financial aid was very hard to receive and only a few special cases receive a good amount of help.
College Freshman,2,"There is definitely not a large amount of diversity on campus; I would like to see more. However, there is no racial discrimination towards the few (such as myself) who are ethnic."
College Freshman,2,Most people on campus are white and religious. Majority are baptists and express their faith freely.
College Freshman,2,There are some housing options but not a lot of choose from
College Junior,2,"There are no city buses that run within 2 miles of campus. Bethel does offer shuttles to Rosedale mall and super Target that run once or twice an hour (less frequently on weekends). It is probably half a mile to a Cub or Target, but there aren't many sidewalks so it's hard to get there. There are shuttles to local churches on Sunday, so that isn't too hard."
College Freshman,2,"Bethel University provides free wifi throughout the whole campus, however the connection is usually really slow and sometimes refuses to connect."
College Sophomore,2,"Average. There are plenty of computers in the library, but the internet is often slow. Printing is compeltely unreliable in the dorms, and printing in the library is not always reliable either. It is often hard to connect laptops to the wireless internet in dorm rooms. However, it works great when it actually works! Sometimes library computers take a VERY long time to long in, which can be frustrating when you only need to print off a paper."
College Junior,2,"Football Is King – Without football, Bethel would sink into mediocrity in all aspects of sports. Football is the only sport that consistently brings the students of Bethel out. Our football team is always good, often the best in the conference. The student body doesn't rally around any other sports team. The gym is mostly empty for volleyball and basketball, and the hockey arena is off campus, which makes it less manageable for students to attend. No other  sport can compare in talent with football."
College Junior,2,"We as a school have a vision for reconciliation, that is of races. We have an African-American chaplain at Bethel, but we don't have a large number of minority students. We are mostly white. Bethel has a club for the minorities to join, which celebrates the various cultures of Bethel in its diverse students. This club, however, creates cliques of minorities, so the very thing it tries to do in creating reconciliation doesn't work. The white people hang with the whites, and the students of different cultures remain together."
College Freshman,2,"Bethel allows junior and senior students to receive parking permits and sophomores and freshman are not allowed cars on campus unless for special circumstances. However, freshman and sophomores are allotted a certain amount of days per month that that can park their car on campus and also have the option to purchase a week, or month long parking permit. The parking lots do fill up pretty fast so, if you are getting back late at night from something, it is sometimes hard to find a parking spot and you might end up walking a good distance."
College Freshman,2,"I do not have a car, but I have heard that permit costs are relatively low. There is sufficient amount of parking, but nothing spectacular."
College Senior,2,You Have to Work for It- If You Want to Party – Tough to find people to party with at a school that doesn't allow drugs or drinking during the school year. Most students who party do so at/with those from other schools.
College Sophomore,2,"Bethel is a Christian college and they have a strict no alcohol, no drug, no partying policy that is, for the most part, highly enforced on campus. So on campus there is nothing much to do. Bethel is only about 10-15 minutes from downtown Minneapolis/St.Paul so of you have a friend with a car, I suppose you could club to your hearts content... but good luck finding someone with a car, especially freshman year. There are on campus events like dances, coffe houses, and other random events, and they are fun, but not hugely popular."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Bethel provides transportation to the a good mall and Target. Otherwise, public transportation is not available."
Sophomore,1,"Many classes would only be offered by one or two professors, and if those professors were horrible, there was nothing that you could do. This is especially an issue if you're a STEM major (physics, anatomy, and chemistry are some of the worst). The professors often spent half of the class talking about religion, so you had to teach yourself the subjects. Racism and sexism were extremely prevalent between both the professors and students. Additionally, a very large chunk of the students were on probation at any given time, even if they had not actually broken a rule. This shows up on your record if you wish to apply to a certain program like nursing, another college, and sometimes a job. Your degree also looks inferior to a degree from a more competitive school (only certain majors, probably not liberal arts). If I could redo things, I would never go here again."
Sophomore,1,"My classes switched to online last semester during Covid. Two of my professors stopped lecturing completely, so I dropped the classes so I wouldn't fail them. One stopped lecturing but took away almost all coursework so it was easy. The 4th professor lectured, but was not supplied with a proper camera or microphone so his screen was so blurry you couldn't see it and often couldn't hear him as well."
Junior,1,"Don't go to this school if you're a student of color. You would think their diversity group will be better in year 2018, but it gets worse. The students are basically made up of 90% white, and conservatives students. 

The school will tie biblical scriptures in all your classes even after making you take two theology classes and you'll be asked in all your class project to explain how the outcomes or overview of your project is pleasing to God. Only gospel music are allowed in the school, Google ""Bethel students reaction to Snoop Dogg concert""

This school will put you in bubble and most of their students only get low paying jobs at Ameriprise Financial which is also a Christian based organization. Unless, you are going for a seminary degree, Bethel is definitely not a good school for any student. It’s basically a cult, and the school will make you sign a covenant which will be used against you if you ever go against the school rules."
Senior,1,"I am currently in my senior year at Bethel, and I highly suggest that if anyone is looking at this school to look elsewhere. 

In the education program, many hours are spent in schools to gain experience;however, Bethel is very unreasonable and has made me pay over $400 in travel costs to these schools alone. They are unwilling to work with their students to find a placement that fits their schedule or even is remotely close to where they live. 

If you’re looking to go to Bethel to be a teacher, look somewhere else."
Freshman,1,Beware of this college! They have acquired a large amount of friendly staff and they are very nice to you once you apply.  When you see the bill it seems like a large amount but it seems worth it.  But if you find yourself wanting to transfer they will do all they can to take all the money that is possible.
College Sophomore,1,There is no party scene at all.
College Sophomore,1,There is no party scene or nightlife here. It's Bethel.
College Sophomore,1,"The academics here is honestly terrible and frustrating. The profs are terribly unkind and u helpful and lack the knowledge needed to assist students. Gen ed classes also make up so much of your time, people rarely take classes for their majors until sophomore year. The academics are also very vigorous and cause high stress for students."
College Sophomore,1,"Bethel has had a lot of backlash about its diversity so it is now trying too hard to fix it. They recently added a cultural connection center for only minorities to hangout at, however it actually causes a greater barrier between minorities and caucasians."
College Sophomore,1,"The professors might be the worst thing about Bethel. Since we are such a small and non-natioanlly recognized school, the only profs Bethel can find are alumni who usually aren't good at their job or profs who couldn't find a job anywhere else so they settled for Bethel. The professors are usually extremely unapproachable and simply don't want to be there teaching or help you. Many students have to drop out of classes because their professors are so difficult and unhelpful. Also, their is a serious lack of variety of courses and so many useless gen ed courses that only this school requires. More than half of the courses you'll take here are unnecessary general ed requirements. One thing many students find frustrating is that Bethel often doesn't accept credits from community colleges- even local ones. For many of my classmates, they took community college courses in high school so they wouldn't have to take so many classes here. However, Bethel won't allow them to transfer over for unknown reasons. Transferring out of Bethel is also incredibly hard because of their unique classes they require you to take."
College Sophomore,1,"A degree from Bethel doesn't mean anything unless you plan on studying something biblical. I know a lot of recently graduated students are struggling to find jobs because no one has heard of Bethel or has high regards about it. Additionally, alumni connections are severely lacking compared to other schools because of this."
College Sophomore,1,"Just as a warning, half of the dorms on campus at Bethel don't have AC which is incredibility hard to deal with. Also, no dorms have cable available in the rooms. Additionally, Bethel's housing is very old and rarely updated. People find rats in their rooms all of the time and the bathrooms are disgusting. It's definitely not worth the money you're paying for it. As for the social atmosphere on the floors, the RA's really try to make everyone bond and most of the girls hide in their rooms or go home for weeks at a time. Also, Bethel has strict visitation hours and makes it difficult for causes a lot of frustration. I know many people who have gotten fined and written up for staying past vis hours for a few minutes. Even once you become an upperclassman, the dorms don't get better and vis hours still remain. Also, housing draw is a stressful mess and this year, due to an overload of students, many underclassman were forced to get upperclassman dorms on the other side of campus."
College Sophomore,1,"I came to Bethel thinking I'd found my dream school. After touring the campus and getting financial aid, I was sure this was the place for me. However, I and many others at the school, quickly realized this wasn't true. First off, the professors and classes are useless and incredibly unhelpful. Because Bethel is such a small school that is not nationally recognized, the only profs they can find are usually alumni who don't have good teaching skills or profs just looking for a job who couldn't get one anywhere else. Also, the social atmosphere is terrible. Everyone goes home on the weekends every single weekend and as an out of state student, I found this campus to be very depressing since no one was ever there. Making this matter worse, freshman aren't allowed cars so you're basically stuck on campus alone. Bethel tries to plan activities for students but no one goes and it's more like children vacation bible school events than college age events. Almost half of the freshman class this year transferred spring semester or are transferring this year, however a lot of people feel trapped due to Bethel's classes being nearly impossible to transfer over. I think a large issue is that no one going here likes being here so there is a severe lack of school spirit and pride in the school. Bethel is just simply not a good school at all- especially for the high price."
College Freshman,1,"I have never been to a party, a lot of students haven't.  Most people just hang out without partying."
College Freshman,1,There is a ghost of a party scene at this school.
College Sophomore,1,Bethel is just like high school. Very clicky and judgmental. The campus reminds me of a summer camp and the faculty is very strict.
College Junior,1,We have no Greek life on our campus.  We are on a private college.
College Freshman,1,"Absolutely NOTHING to do. I go home every weekend because the only local atmosphere is a shoddy mini van ride from Bethel to the local chipotle and target. You will pay too much for a miserable social experience at bethel. The city isnt nearby, its a good 15 minute drive for those who are lucky enough to appeal to have cars, and if you manage to go down to the cities youll probably not do anything fun because Bethel kids are sheltered and boring. They think fun is dressing up in the kids aisles at Target. Not dance clubs or concerts. "
College Freshman,1,"Student life is terrible. Student activities tries desperately to hold ""fun"" events but the quality of the base, sheltered, and flat personalities that go there make it hard to enjoy yourself in any social setting-including the dorms. No matter how outgoing you are you will find yourself suffocated by the dull personalities at Bethel."
College Sophomore,1,"There is not much diversity here at Bethel. Sadly, being a private school with an expensive tuition, that greatly limits the opportunity for many people. The majority of students are ""rich white kids"". I do admire the efforts to make this campus more diverse by the association though. You can see effort from Bethel to educate its students on other cultures and races."

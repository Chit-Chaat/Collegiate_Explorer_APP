Senior,5,"I did not take any online classes at SWOSU. However, I had many friends who took all or some of their courses online. With COVID-19, professors were able to make adjustments to the coursework that seemed to work for both staff and students."
Sophomore,5,I am a music therapy major at this university and I love it. It is a small campus so it doesn't take you long to get to your classes and you make plenty of friends. There are many free meals provided to you throughout the week and the professors are amazing and supper supportive.
Freshman,5,i love it tuition cost less then living on the dorms i love that i can just go to school do my work and not live on campus i like the professers they help us when we need help and they are always supportive when going through rough times. I'm glad that a choose to go to a school that will help me.
Freshman,5,"SWOSU is a smaller college, but for me, attending a small college has been great. I graduated from a very small high school, and the transition from there to a college that is just a bit bigger made me feel very comfortable going out into the world. SWOSU also made me feel comfortable in anything I did, such as: simply walking to class, speaking to professor's, and getting assistance on anything from payments, to making schedules, to studying."
Sophomore,5,SWOSU is by far the greatest college in Oklahoma. The school gives you so many opportunities to get involved.
Senior,5,SWOSU is a great university. I would recommend it to other students. The professors are nice and helpful.
Niche User,5,I like SWOSU because it isn't a huge school so I feel as if I will still be in my comfort zone. The campus is very easy to get around and everyone seems to be very friendly !
Niche User,5,I am a high school senior and I take concurrent classes at SWOSU. This is a fantastic college. The professors are super understanding and the class sizes are perfect! All of my professors know me by name. There are tons of different clubs that you can join depending on what you're interested in. The sporting events include everyone and bring a sense of unity. I genuinely cannot think of anything I would change about Southwestern!
Junior,5,"SWOSU is a great institution. The only changes I'd like to see is a remodel for the music department, specifically the practice rooms."
Graduate Student,5,This is a great small town college with the professors who truly care for your well-being and the future you make for yourself. The friends and peers you meet on campus can seem as if they are family because everyone is nice and willing to help each other. I love this school and what it stands for!
Freshman,5,"I love this university. I have had excellent professors, and my advisor had been very helpful. I love the beautiful (although small) campus. However, I wish that the ITS department were more accessible for student questions."
Junior,5,"I am currently a junior at Southwestern Oklahoma State University and I love this school. Everywhere I turn there is a friendly face. It is small enough that it is easy to make friend and get to know people, but also big enough you can't know everyone. Professors at this university are the best. They are so helpful and encouraging, the want you to succeed. It is a very diverse campus. Although the campus is wonderful it does need to make some improvements on infrastructure and housing."
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere at SWOSU was amazing. The students and teachers were all so tight knit and care so much about others and the potential in everyone. In the future, I think more dorms should be built and possibly redo the older ones to have a more appealing eye to visitors and college students."
Freshman,5,"I love the community size its small to go around and know everyone. The staff and everyone are friendly for the most part. Academics are really challenging. The science courses are really rigorous as well as the course work. Overall, I am satisfied with everything except the food. I am vegetarian so there are not many options to eat here on campus and that being said you have to have a meal plan which sucks."
Niche User,5,"My parents went to SWOSU as well as many family members.  They recommended SWOSU because of the hometown feel, easy access to faculty, great location, and success with job placement after graduation!"
Sophomore,5,I   am a Radiology Technologist student at the Southwestern Sayre Campus and have nothing but good things to say about the campus and university. They take time to help you succeed. Great school environment.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman attending Southwestern Oklahoma State University, I personally believe that this is a fantastic school for the degree I am pursuing. The professors are more than generous with everything you need help with. They provide tutors for the students at a moments notice! The general education classes are very blunt and straightforward if a certain subject is not your major. They professors are very nice and cooperative."
Junior,5,"I love SWOSU! The campus is beautiful, the staff is helpful and welcoming, and the community is amazing!"
Niche User,5,"I liked the fact everything was well organized, and everyone was very welcoming to their guest. The counselors are very educated on their programs that they have there at South Western Oklahoma State University. There financial department was very helpful on giving me the best advice on which route to take with my financial situation. The campus was maintained very well. I did like that most of my classes were compatible to theirs, so most of my credit were transferred over. I do like their tutoring center and they also have tutors there for majority of the subjects. This shows me they really care about their students wanting to succeed."
Senior,5,"I think its  a great community.  The teachers are great. the place is clean. its not to big, you wont get lost. i like to eat, so theres a goos solection of food to choose from. and in the town as well"
Freshman,5,I think this school is absolutely great. They have great professors and they are always there if you need it.
Junior,5,"Overall southwestern Oklahoma state university is a good school, just some few things that need to change. Make the campus more diverse and have a more active campus life for the students."
Freshman,5,I love it here! It feels like a home away from home. I have had no difficulties adjusting to college life! Everyone is super helpful. If I have a question it gets answered quickly and correctly.
Alum,5,It has the feeling of your small hometown.  The professors care if you are having problems learning and will try to help you. Some of the professors are actually involved in the campus clubs.
Sophomore,5,I like that swosu is a place away from home that you can call home. Everyone is friendly and the professors do an outstanding job and class aren’t too big so you get more time with your professor instead of there been a 100 students in the class. The town is small and easy to learn your way around.
Junior,5,My experience at Swosu has been great. All the teachers are super helpful and are interested in the topics they teach. The campus has plety of reaources to help students succeed.
Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed spending time on Southwestern Oklahoma State University’s Campus. Because of its location in Custer County in the North West part of Oklahoma it is easier for the people located in that area to go to college. There are a lot of small towns up in that area. I had to drive from Oakwood it’s in Dewey County. The High School that I graduated from is in the town of Taloga. I had to ride a bus from Oakwood to Taloga which is thirty miles west of the farm home. The classes at SWOSU are the wort the time because they are the beast and the professors are mostly doctors. I have grown up and learned a lot from the professors, and become a pretty responsible person. I do enjoy the atmosphere and comradery of the school."
Senior,5,"SWOSU is an awesome school to attend. The campus is beautiful, the people are friendly, the professors are helpful, and the opportunities are endless for students to get involved!"
Sophomore,5,this is the best school to go to they are so helpful and will help you in anyway possible to get you through your classes.
Sophomore,5,"I came to this school not knowing anyone, I grew up in a small town 15 miles west of the campus. During my time here I started to step out of my comfort zone and have had the opportunity to make new friends and have been given the chance to participate in campus organizations."
Junior,5,"Its a great school. The classes are smaller, you get one on one interaction with the teachers. The campus isn't too big."
Sophomore,5,"I am a freshman at SWOSU so I don't have much experience yet. However, I do believe that I have made the right decision by coming here and I know that if anyone is worries about attending SWOSU, you shouldn't be. Most of all the professors are very kind and understanding. All of the faculty members are very nice as well. I've never felt more at home and I know it'll only get better from here."
Niche User,5,This is an amazing campus. But you can get lost. All teachers were very nice and caring. I went there for college night got a free seat to the football game. And they even won!!
Junior,5,"As a transfer student, I found this college not only a good place to transfer to, but superior in every way from the previous college I went to! The campus feels more inviting and open, settled in a safe environment, with great classes and professors, and getting the best education for a fair cost! Though the dorms and food are fine, they could be better, and if you're someone that likes to party, then don't be too impressed, since you either gotta go off campus, or be in some sort of academic club or nerd group to party. Overall, it's a must choose for anyone going into college!"
College Freshman,5,There are typically several parties a week on and off campus and it is a great way to relieve stress and meet people if you do it responsibly.
College Freshman,5,Love living on campus it has great people.
College Freshman,5,I love going to school here and its an awesome experience.
College Sophomore,5,"There's a variety of professors with many teaching styles. They are generally available and always willing to help. Some even make small talk or go out of their way to make sure you're doing okay when you stop by to ask questions. In two semesters, I've only had one professor who I expressly didn't like. The class sizes are appropriate, and the professors provide a nice environment to learn."
College Sophomore,5,"I've never noticed any crime. The campus is a little scary at night if I'm alone.  Swosu Police are very available if you need anything, and they'll take you across campus if you feel unsafe. All the bathroom stalls have a flier about sexual assault, including what to do/where to go if it happens and prevention methods. The Dean talks about it at the beginning of the year, and she takes it seriously and says it's very zero-tolerance. I never experienced anything that would make me feel unsafe."
College Freshman,5,Swosu police are always around and on call whenever you need them. They will even walk with you at night if you call them. There are many counselors on staff here if you need to talk to them. Safety is one of SWOSU's biggest concerns and they make me feel very safe here.
College Freshman,5,"There are many ways to advance your career on campus. There are a lot of on campus jobs, internship programs and research jobs on campus. The faculty is very knowledgeable and will help you find the perfect fit."
College Freshman,5,The professors are amazing and that really care about their students. The classes are interesting and fun. The class size is average. The most students in one class is 30.
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus. It has helped me become a part of this campus, not just a student. They have lot of activities in the dorms for the students to get to know one another while having a fun time."
College Freshman,5,I am apart of one of the sororities on campus and I love it! We do a lot for the community of Weatherford and for the school. We are super accepting of people no matter if  they are apart of Greek life or not.
College Freshman,5,The football team is great and students are encouraged to attend. Football games and tailgating with friends are my favorite memories from my first semester of college!
College Freshman,5,I love Southwestern because the faculty and staff are so nice and they really care about you and your future.
College Freshman,5,School spirit is high and students get riled up for football and basketball.
College Freshman,5,very safe here. i can walk alone at night without fear
College Freshman,5,"best professors. they are very helpful and truly, truly care"
College Freshman,5,"love the atmosphere, the people, and the teachers."
College Student,5,It is a very pretty campus.
College Freshman,5,"I have never had a problem, and I have not heard of any!"
College Freshman,5,"I love all my professors here at SWOSU! They have helped me, but have pushed me out of my comfort zone!"
College Junior,5,I have never had an internship and I don't plan to.
College Junior,5,They are strict about important things like drinking and drugs on campus.
College Junior,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus.
College Freshman,5,It's the best. I love the teachers and the curriculum.
College Freshman,5,"I'll give it for this school, they have some of the best teachers I've ever seen. The departments are so synced sometimes it's scary.  I love talking to my professors and each one seems genuinely interested in my continued education. The courses aren't too bad so long as you study and have some time-management skills."
College Freshman,5,"The officers here at SWOSU are very nice to everyone. They take a personal concern for students' safety and do their best to help when they can. Many of our on-campus officers are actually students attending SWOSU to earn various degrees. Their kind nature may make them seem less strict, but when it comes to rules, they're ""the man""."
College Freshman,5,"I'm a Resident Adviser here at SWOSU, and I make it my duty to take care of the students around me. A lot has changed since I joined the RA staff here: we've diversified significantly, and many of the hermit students who didn't usually come out can now be seen all the time around the dorms. While we may not be the most active dorm communities, we do have a sense of family that's nice to see in day-to-day life."
Freshman,4,"The online learning options provided by a college are extremely important, especially nowadays. SWOSU does a decent job accommodating students who are unable to attend class in person. However, there is always room for improvement!"
Freshman,4,"The staff at SWOSU make it a priority to help students. The facilities are nice enough, but some of the housing options are in need of a remodel.
Overall, SWOSU provides a very welcoming learning environment for all of its students."
Senior,4,"I transferred to SWOSU to complete my junior and senior years. Overall, it is a great school. The professors are top-notch and are willing to go above an beyond to make sure that you're successful. The town of Weatherford is small. However, there were plenty of food options around town. Plus, OKC is only an hour away. Although the academics are great, the weight room in the wellness center could use some improvement. I was spoiled with amazing facilities at my previous university, so maybe I'm a little biased. If you're looking for a university that is affordable, clean, safe, and committed to you as a paying student, SWOSU is definitely the place to go. I couldn't be happier with my time at SWOSU and the opportunities that were provided to me there. At roughly 5,000 students, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved and make your mark on campus. Go DAWGS."
Sophomore,4,The town of Weatherford has a great small-town feel. The professors are very helpful and want you to succeed. This is a great school!
Sophomore,4,All of my professors used our online resources very well and were still able to teach the class without being in a classroom.
Junior,4,"I love the English department. They are extremely helpful and a joy to study under.  There are plenty of opportunities to work on campus. Also, the school encourages religious freedom with many religious organizations on campus that work together to better the lives of the students."
Niche User,4,"I only went there for a year and a half but the time spent was pretty good. I decided to transfer because the location is not good at all. Weatherford is a middle of nowhere town with little to no work opportunities for the college students it holds. The housing also sucked, there was no option for individual room housing, all the dorms were shared rooms."
Senior,4,Southwestern Oklahoma state university is located in a small town. The campus is clean and beautiful with small class sizes. Professor are always willing to help students in any way they can.
Freshman,4,"Good college. Not too large or too small. Easy to get around. Can park in one place and walk everywhere.  Professors are knowledgeable and most are friendly. Has dorms and several places to live in the area. The city of Weatherford, OK has plenty of places to eat and if you need a job, there are several places to work."
Freshman,4,I like Southwestern Oklahoma State University because they are a medium size college. If you need any help their are teachers and students there that will help you through anything.
Niche User,4,"This is smaller campus making it easy to get around. Professors seem to care and easy to to talk too. Don't stay in dorms but visited them, some are older and couple of them are newer and co-ed now. town is not very big but has the basics. College is known for it's Pharmacy and Nursing schools.

College is cost effective not too expensive and off campus living is fairly cheap/"
Freshman,4,"All the teachers I have met have been very nice and some are very helpful and it is easy to get around campus, and I have gotten to meet quite a few people. However, I do wish SWOSU had more options for majors."
Freshman,4,This college is amazing. The staff is so nice and help you get on the right path to what you wanna do. The advisors know exactly what needs to be down to help your career grow fast
Junior,4,"I’ve gone to SWOSU going three years now here in Weatherford and I have to say it’s been great. I never stayed in the dorms, I always lived off campus but currently they are going through and renovating all the dorms. the admin always has plenty of student activities plan to keep you busy during your down time, and the party scene well let’s just say you don’t wanna miss it."
Senior,4,"This college is very affordable and offers a small yet robust science-based atmosphere. The pharmacy program is sought after by students from around the world. Other biology and chemistry classes are well-funded with wonderful  laboratories and friendly professors.  If you're interested in biology and chemistry, and you're looking for a small town, this is the right place for you."
Junior,4,Southwestern Oklahoma State University is a very inviting campus and environment. The professors are excellent and have their student's best interest at hand!
Graduate Student,4,I loved being here at SWOSU. All of my degrees came from here and i'm finishing my last one now. The campus has expanded over the years and  it has made it more user friendly. The professors care about you and want you to succeed. My time spent here was well worth it. I only wish that this town had more for the college kids to do on the weekends .
Sophomore,4,"In my honest opinion, I would like to say Southwestern Oklahoma state is great school. Even though it is not as big, and diverse as other schools might be. It has great teachers, and it has a conducive study environment with less or no distractions, so the students can focus. One thing I would like the school to improve on is the library. Even though the library is decently moderate, it is kind of small considering the number of students that are enrolled in school."
Sophomore,4,"I like that SWOSU takes their academics seriously. It can be challenging in the Chemistry and Biology departments.  I also like that the cost is a lot cheaper than other colleges and they give out good scholarships. Compared to other universities, SWOSU is the best option financially. I would like to see a better variety of food options."
Freshman,4,"I just recently started here, my sister has been attending for several years now and i personally am enjoying college life here and my sister deeply enjoys college life here."
Junior,4,"Small quaint friendly campus.  Class size is perfect.  Great teacher student focus.   Excellent community support.  Affordable, ample housing all around campus."
Sophomore,4,"I love the small feel of the college. The professors are very one-on-one with their students. The library hours are extremely beneficial to all college students no matter their schedule. However, it is hard to get better or necessary improvements without raising tuition. I wish this was something that could be fixed."
Freshman,4,"I love SWOSU, there are great people and it feels like home. I believe it isn't for everyone-no college is, but it was for me! Its small, but bigger than my hometown. It was kind of boring at times, and I must admit places like OU do make me envious, but at what cost? Super cheap for quality education. I am super shy so believe me when I say people here are so friendly! I even made friends, if I can you can, trust me."
Freshman,4,SWOSU has provided me with a wonderful experience as a student. I am so thrilled I chose SWOSU to continue my education.
Freshman,4,"I really like Southwestern so far. It fits my personality. I like small, but it's not too small. Since I've never been to college before, I don't know what I would change; but I really like it here so far."
Sophomore,4,"South Western Oklahoma State University is a great school if you plan on going into a science major. They have a great science program and they want to see you succeed. One thing that could change is that the buildings are a little out dated. If you plan on living in the dorms, Don't!"
Junior,4,SWOSU provides the education and experience one needs to start a career while also allowing for meaningful relationships to form between classmates and instructors for years to come. It is one community with the sole focus of helping each other to be the best they can be. There's also plenty of free food and fun activities to keep the student life interesting.
Junior,4,"This is a great college if you are looking for a homey feeling. It is small, but not too small. Just the right size if you are coming from a smaller school."
Niche User,4,The town is very comfortable to live in. The college overall is in a great community. The academics here are very challenging. The classroom size is very comfortable and their is more one on one time with the professors.
Alum,4,Great online RN-BSN Program! Professors were always readily available for questions and assistance. It was a very positive experience towards the future of my career. 
Alum,4,It is an overall great school and I had a wonderful experience there. I wish I could go back and do it all over again!
Sophomore,4,"Although schools want us to have place to eat, i don't think that you should force the resident in the dorm to have a certain amount of meal plan, and the cafeteria in school is not serving healthy food, it's always pizza, fried foods, and that is not good for the health. We are destroying the healthy body that our parents tried to build up for a long time."
Freshman,4,This is a great small town school. It can be very personalized to what you need and what you are looking for. The only advice i would give is to really look in to what professor will be teaching your class. There are some professors whose classes are much more difficult than others
College Freshman,4,"I believe that for the most part, people on our campus realize that there are all different types of people in the world. With this being said I think that those most are accepting, some can be very intolerant and that can cause an uprising of issues."
College Freshman,4,I graduated from a very small high school so it is nice that the class sizes aren't large and that they are somewhat familiar to home.
College Freshman,4,"In such a relatively small school, almost everyone knows everyone so if you feel endangered, most likely, someone you know will be around. I feel extremely safe on campus and I do not have any relevant issues regarding this topic."
College Freshman,4,I love the dorm life and the people I get to constantly be around daily!
College Freshman,4,The athletics at my school are a huge part of campus life. It keeps everyone hyped up during specific sports seasons and provides students with appropriate relief from studies.
College Freshman,4,The school that I am currently attending witholds an easy-going atmosphere. I enjoy spending time with me peers and I thourougly enjoy attending my classes because of the lack of intimidation in the atmosphere. I have an extremely strong sense of pride in South Western Oklahoma State University and I am a proud attendee.
College Sophomore,4,"The OK Hall dorms are small, but there's a really nice amount of storage.  Not many shelves though. We had our coffee maker on a shelf on the microwave on the mini fridge and it was kinda hard to work around. They don't seem to do maintenance unless it's required. If you cover any holes with duct tape, take it off at the end of the year. Also you have to clean your dorms when you move out, so be prepared to finally deal with that stain on the floor you've been ignoring for a semester. 6/10 for the rooms.

Bathrooms: The showers were full once during my entire year living there. Soap/paper towels sometimes absent. The bathrooms don't get cleaned on the weekends, so if someone demolishes a toilet it stays that way until Monday. Definitely need shower shoes too. 5/10 for the bathrooms. 

The resident advisors are LOVELY. They are kind and organize little events, and sometime they put out cookies or donuts or almond-bark covered popcorn. 10/10 for the RAs.

Also, the smoke alarms are sensitive. It takes a month before the newbies figure out how to keep from setting them off. Be prepared to run down the stairs at midnight in your bathrobe."
College Sophomore,4,"For the price, it's a good university. The biology department is funded the best. The food is amazing, and the campus coffee place serves Starbucks at decent prices. The library has computers and printers, both of which are free to use. The dorms are a little old (except Black Kettle)."
College Junior,4,"The new hall has a sink in each dorm room which is great, because I do not have to go the public dorm bathrooms just to brush my teeth."
College Junior,4,"I am still a new student so I really have not had a long experience at my college yet. I have meet some very nice and friendly people as students, teachers, and advisories. The school is small in student body but has the same environment as my small hometown. Also, it has as many opportunities as any big university which is why I choose this college."
College Freshman,4,"I feel that career prospects are strong here. SWOSU is a well respected school, and if you have worked hard to earn a degree, employers and job prospects will take notice to potentially want to hire you."
College Freshman,4,Overall the courses and professors have been fair and helpful in my first year. There is some class variety which keeps things interesting and class size variation. It's a pretty pleasant experience overall.
College Freshman,4,"I generally feel pretty safe on campus. There has never been an instance where I have felt unsafe or scared to walk around campus. Police are good about patrolling to make sure everything is running smoothly. Overall, it's pretty effective."
College Freshman,4,"Despite being a D2 school, Southwestern Oklahoma State University shows its school pride by consistently supporting its sports teams. Many students go to Friday night games when there are some. The athletic facilities are pretty cool too and allow both student athletes and regular students the ability to stay in shape. Overall, our athletics is something SWOSU prides itself on."
College Freshman,4,"SWOSU is a great down to earth college. The students and professors are mostly nice and helpful. Overall, I would choose my school again because it is a welcoming community that gives students a good education."
College Freshman,4,The campus feels really safe. The campus police are friendly and very helpful.
College Freshman,4,The school as a bulldog job board to help find employment.
College Freshman,4,My experience has been relatively good. The professors are willing to help you if you don't understand something.
College Freshman,4,pretty good could be a little cleaner. the RA's can be too strict
College Freshman,4,There are many great places to study on campus. I frequently uses the library facility and computer lab to do work
College Freshman,4,Through the career center I was able to get an on campus job. They were very helpful.
College Freshman,4,So far I have had nothing but good eperiences with professors at SWOSU. Instructors are knowledgable about their fields and have their students best interest at heart
College Freshman,4,I love the housing at SWOSU! I live in Stewart hall and it is a great environment
College Freshman,4,"I have loved my experience at Southwestern Oklahoma State university so far! I have only been there for a semester but it already feels like home. The instructors are great and very helpful, and the dorms are spacious and clean."
College Student,4,"At first I was worried, but now I really don't mind it."
College Student,4,"The spots here are making a name, and are making a path to succeed from here on out."
College Student,4,Most professors are nice and helpful. The whole atmosphere of a small town college makes it feel like a home.
Junior,2,"I am new to SWOSU and I haven't started my semester yet, but it hasn't been great so far. Almost everything is closed due to COVID, so we have had to meet with our advisors and Registrar through emails only, which is fine. However, my siblings and I are transfer students from out of state and they refuse to take our associate degrees at face value. They cherry-picked which credits count toward our bachelor degree (meaning that instead of 2 years for my sister to complete her degree, she basically still has another 4 years). 

They are slow to process financial aid documents, some advisors are not very helpful, there is very little communication between registrar and bursar, and we are still being charged exorbitant fees (almost $700!) for services we CANNOT use this semester because so many things are closed due to COVID. They also raised tuition 3% this year and didn't mention it until we were already registered for classes. 

We will see how classes go this semester."
Alum,2,I learned more in my associate degree than at SWOSU working on my bachelor's degree.  Extremely difficult to work with on simple things like transcript requests  from other universities.  Some of the professors are really awesome but overall the so called educators are in need of education.   More party time than learning time.
College Senior,2,I did not receive the amount of financial aid that I need to pay for a quarter of my school fees.
College Sophomore,2,"I get approved for loans but  not grants.  My parents make barely over the pay scale so I don't qualify for pell.  They can't pay for college with their incomes.  My parents drive vehicles that are both nearly 10 years old and they don't live above the means.  It is just hard.  My brother is still in jr. high and the schools are always wanting money for this and for that.  Being right over the income lines exempts them from everything, including reduced school lunches for my brother.  They always have to pay a full price (nothing reduced) because of that stupid income level.  My mom is a diabetic and has lots of doctor bills.  My dad is one of those people who help everybody and never takes payment.  I know he is doing what God wants him to do and I'm glad for that.  I just wish it would help them pay bills!"
College Junior,2,"Everything closes early, so there's no real convenience when you're hungry after a certain time. There aren't many restaurants either, so choices are limited."
College Junior,2,"In my opinion, there is too much of a party atmosphere there.  It really isnt that hard to find one."
College Freshman,2,There are few parties and they are usually small.
College Freshman,2,I'm rather annoyed with the financial aid area of SWOSU. They have few scholarships that are more cued towards incoming freshmen than continuing students. Getting a scholarship here is next to impossible and the financial aid department seems more cued to reminding you to pay what you owe than helping you find money.
College Freshman,2,"No means of transportation,its small,and walkable"
College Freshman,2,"The Grill is open 6:30 am to 8:00 at night. The food is alright, but after a while you'll start to hate it. I also wish they would be open a bit later, because if I'm working late, I'll either have to buy over priced stuff at the c-store or lose my meal(s) for the day. The caf is only open for a couple of hours a day, and it's either during my classes or while I'm at work, so I never get to eat there."
College Freshman,2,"Living in dorms on campus is pretty expensive because, with living in the dorms, you are REQUIRED to purchase a meal plan. I don't like that rule, and that is why I moved off campus and into an apartment. For me, it's cheaper. There are, however, ways to obtain room scholarships-- you just have to know how and where to find them."
College Junior,2,Not a lot of parking space for the amount of students who come from out one town.
College Freshman,2,The town needs more healthy options and more options in general for the college-age students. The students could benefit more from the town if the restaurants stayed open later and if there was more variety.
College Freshman,2,"Students looking at SWOSU as an option should be focused on their academics. It's a small town, so it's easy to get bored unless you keep yourself preoccupied with studies and student involvement."
College Junior,2,It changes all the time and the wind blows constantly.
College Student,2,It is always extremely windy. We are labeled the windiest city in the nation and our campus sits on top of a hill so we get the brute force of it.
College Freshman,2,Our campus dining is currently out of service.
College Freshman,2,"Being a CAB member, you would see a lot of international and out of state students. However, due to being in a western Oklahoma small town, the student body is dominated by white, republican, christian students. We have churches (branches of Christianity) all around the campus, but no other religions. Everyone is accepted and smiles at each other, but there is still the invisible barrier."
College Student,2,I'm a Pre-pharmacy student. Yes I would it all over again. My career goals are to hopefully join the peace corps or be apart of the VA pharmacy department. I just hope I'm diverse enough to be able to be apart of one of these two divisions.
College Senior,2,"SWOSU is a great school to attend. Although the majority of the people are white, there are a mixture of different ethnicity's. There are people from all over the world from China all the way to Scotland. I feel that although the majority is white, there are a mixture of different people on campus."
College Freshman,1,few parties. Cops are always crashing them. I do not even bother to go to them anymore.
College Junior,1,Its really hard to recieve a scholarship there.
College Junior,1,We have no public transportation except for Daves taxi. There needs to be one with the amount of students who don't drive.
College Sophomore,1,i dont live in the same city as my campus
College Freshman,1,There is virtually no transportation provided. The school is out in the middle of nowhere and not near anything. 
College Junior,1,There is really not any transportation at SWOSU. Mainly due to everything is in walking distance.
College Junior,1,No cute boys but plenty of pretty girls. We are forced to settle.
College Junior,1,There's only about three bars to go to and one is only open on the weekends. The cops here don't let people have any fun parties.
College Junior,1,There's not many options at SWOSU or in the whole town of Weatherford. It's pretty small so being able to cook is a must.
College Sophomore,1,party wise there isnt much unless you are hanging with friends and unless your 21 the isnt much to choose from club and bar wise.
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is awful! Between the hours of 9:00-2:00 parking is impossible! my only suggestion is to get to class really early of walk! campus it not huge but there are more students than parking so its the early risers who get the parking spots.
College Freshman,1,Its really not that bad..Its just i wish there was more during the days because there isnt enough room for all students o campus. you spend an hour looking for a parking spot and end up late for class.
College Senior,1,"The sports for the most part are horrible at SWOSU. All the other sports are completely overshadowed by football, even though they consisently do better than football. On average the football team wins maybe two to four games a season."
College Junior,1,"The School Has TERRIBLE Internet – My school has not updated the wifi in so long. We are getting more students every semester. There are so many people on the internet now that they make it ""Academic"" and made it really slow in the dorms. So for those of us who have spent the money on laptops for in our room, we can't really use them because the internet is so slow that our emails won't work."
College Junior,1,"Small Town – Weatherford, Oklahoma likes to keep the town small is what I have deduced. We do have a super Walmart but that is one of the only major places that you can shop for food. We have the regular Mcdonalds, Taca Mayo, Taco Bell/KFC(which is gross and poor managed coming from experience) and all the fast food places. The only place that stays open 24/7 is Jerrys and the only other stay open late is Taco Mayo till 2 am. We have one Coffee place called the Cup which I really like but it only stays open till I believe 8pm. Our selection of places to eat off campus is not the greatest honestly."
College Freshman,1,Uninvolved Greeks – The Greek life on campus is almost nonexistent. Neighboring schools tend to be very involved in their Greek houses. Southwestern isn't. Everyone who is not part of a Greek house is annoyed by the ones that are. They are very small and not involved in the school.
College Freshman,1,Cliche at Best – Political beliefs are mostly pro Rebuplican while sexual orientation is actually extremely diverse.
College Junior,1,"Slow Aid – they're very slow this year to do the awards for next fall, and i really need to plan ahead to make sure school is paid for"

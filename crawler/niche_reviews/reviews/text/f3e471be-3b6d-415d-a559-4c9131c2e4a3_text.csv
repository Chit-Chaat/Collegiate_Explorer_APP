Freshman,5,"As a freshman at Providence, I learned that the environment of the school was overall positive. Coming from a high school that was surrounded with drama, Providence woke me up into realizing my own personal responsibilities as a student and as an adult."
Sophomore,5,"Great environment with great people. Every day is a learning experience, not just in the classroom. We have experiential learning called Avodahs which is basically a field trip into LA or surrounding areas and learning about the culture or the art or the buildings etc."
College Junior,5,Our campus has a large range of different people from many different nations all over the world. :)
College Junior,5,"I have enjoyed living out of dorm for the last 2 and a half years. I find that I am able to get my own space and to just relax some. I love cooking for myself. I also like that we have in suite laundry, as the dorms did not have this."
College Junior,5,"I loved living in dorm before I got married. I found that it was a lot of fun, everyone loved to hang out. I think our school has a good community aspect to it."
College Sophomore,5,"Wide Range – There is a real mix between girls and guys. It is a close knit community, and people come from all over the country. It is a very social place to be for such a small school."
College Student,5,"I'm a Business Administration major and it is amazing. The teacher's are awesome, they truly care about you as a person. They are almost always available to help with school work or to just talk. The curriculum is not overly difficult but it still pushes you to do your best. You are able to work on-campus in your field during the semester and get some cash toward your tuition, which is extremely nice."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Providence Christian College has been great so far. I am a sophomore pursuing a Liberal Arts degree with a concentration in Education. Overall, I enjoy the school and the campus, but for some people, it is considered a little small. However, there are plus sides to having a smaller school such as building relationships with professors."
Freshman,4,"Pretty great school, good environment, very uplifting and a big help in my spiritual walk with God. Attending providence has taught me so much about how to walk with God and how to tell others and be a testimony"
College Sophomore,4,"My first year at Providence Christian College was an eye opening experience. Mainly due to the fact that I was for one living in the dorms.  Being on campus and not at home gave me a sense of freedom and it helped me to become more independent. Second, I am a student athlete, which kept me on my toes. I was always busy with classes, homework, and practices. Yet, I managed to maintain my grades with a 3.0 GPA. Lastly, I loved that my school was Christ-centered, either on or off the field, in or out of classes, it was always around us."
College Sophomore,4,The library stays open extra late just for students in school. It's so nice of them to do extra things like that.
College Junior,4,We have some really good teams and a lot of great coaches. The school has a good athletics department.
College Junior,4,Safety is great! The security is also really good. I would appreciate a on school nurse or something of the sort but we generally do not have any issues with security.
College Senior,4,"Pasadena is a great location for a college campus. It has many places for students to enjoy. Our school is located near one of the many metro stations that transports people in and out of LA, so we can hop on it anytime to visit cultural centers like Hollywood, Olvera Street, and Chinatown. There are also plenty of museums in the area, such as the Getty and the Norton Simon. This is an ideal place for college students to experience Southern California culture."
College Sophomore,4,"Creates a Community – It is a great place to be. The campus is nice, and the community is amazing. Very tight knit, the rooms are nice, and very convenient in relation to getting to class, finding others, etc."
College Student,4,"The nightlife is amazing at Providence. There is a variety of sports, clubs, bible studies and so much more offered to all of the students."
College Student,4,"I have always felt safe at Providence CC. It is a small, beautiful, safe place to be. The campus security does a wonderful job on keeping all of us safe."
Sophomore,2,"My experience was very bad. I was told by the coach that all but three were believers. As it turned out, I think there were maybe 3 to 5 believers on the team. I was harassed for not cussing, fornicating, and holding to biblical convictions. My coach failed terrible at creating a positive team culture. I had a couple of mental meltdowns. Despite having a great fall, which many team mates acknowledged, the coach did not play me. That was discouraging. It would have been understandable if we had a competitive team, but we did not. Despite having the best exit velo, best pop time, and one of the best arms on the team, the coach benched me... and gave me no input regarding what I needed to do to play.
There are a few really good teachers, but a few who show no care at all... very discouraging. 
There is much more to say, but I will refrain. I would not recommend the school to my worst enemy. 
My parents feel terrible for not directing me to a better school."
Niche User,1,I attended in 2006 and it was the worst decision I've made. The school is very controlling and very clicky. The school was very small as this was very early on and had its formation and of the 38 students on the campus I and my two roommates all left at the end of our first semester as the entire student body pretty much ignored us. We were not private school like the rest of the campus was so we weren't really included in the click. I do not have enough characters to explain how the school was an absolute awful experience and they treat us adults as if we're still children. We were not given any respect as the adults that we were. This is college where we are all over the age of 18 yet we're being told and forced to attend a group book reading about things that 13 year old should be learning. I had many other problems that I can't go into but overall the entire campus was very clicky and degrading. I would not recommend the school and it appears it has not gotten any better.
Niche User,1,There is no online learning and that is a disappointment. for some reason this app is making me have a response about the online learning though there isn't any.
Alum,1,"The sad thing is, this institution has white supremacist leanings and is openly anti- LGBTQ. They had a speaker from the far right wing Claremont Institute speak at commencement last year. Their board is 100% white. Black student retention is low and former black students have said they experienced racism there. 

During the international movement for black lives the college has been silent, despite 50 alumni writing a letter asking them to make a statement. This disregard of black students shows they are not valued enough for the college to even speak up for fear of upsetting their conservative donors and parents. 

Their student handbook states they can reject applicants based on their sexual orientation and EXPEL students for speech or conduct that is deemed too LGBTQ. 

I attended this school from 2010-2014. I had many good experiences and I met friends and learned from inspirational professors. But those professors have since been fired because they spoke against the president."
Sophomore,1,"What a joke. I transferred in based on recommendations from a couple graduates, they didn't say it was perfect but when I told them about the professors I had, they couldn't believe it. Classes are a joke, students are a mix of judgemental jerks and hypocrite athletes. Looking to get out asap."

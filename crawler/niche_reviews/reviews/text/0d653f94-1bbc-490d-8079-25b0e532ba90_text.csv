Sophomore,5,"During the COVID 19 pandemic, the school had to make use of learning. But the one thing that I really like about the teachers that they were helpful beyond imagination and what I first thought will be hard as a result of the sudden changes to the online platform turn out very well. I really enjoyed the experience"
Sophomore,5,Pitzer to me is like a home away from home. It is a very welcoming campus with diversity and a variety of activities to immerse yourself in. I am having a great time at Pitzer College.
Freshman,5,"I'm a first-year at Pitzer. I toured the campus 4 times and absolutely fell in love with it. I love the atmosphere, friendly faces and office hours with my professors. I'm glad to call this place home for the next 3 and a half years."
Freshman,5,"Pitzer College offers a very safe and friendly on-campus environment. The Professors at Pitzer College are very easy to approach and are always willing to help out the students. Due to this very reason, students feel valued and are not stressed out all the time. Their needs are accommodated and they are truly valued. I love the dorms and the other residence services and support available to the students. Pitzer has strong student governance and highly values the student voices."
Alum,5,"As a graduate of Pitzer I feel a strong sense of gratitude to the 5 C’s. The educational and social environment were so special, and the Claremont Consortium community was intellectual and active, but modest, hip and fun. I honestly miss being part of such a cool community."
Sophomore,5,"Um, yes, Pitzer has been amazing and I couldn't be happier as a student here. There is a ton of work but it is engaging, mind-expanding, and stimulating, no busy work. The 5C's are pretty much the coolest college experience out there - they have the best of academics, campus resources and connections, climate, social and political engagement opportunities."
Freshman,5,I love it here. People are so nice and food is great. Not far from la. If you love weed this is your place :)
Junior,5,"The 5 Cs are arguably the best liberal arts consortium in the country and kind of like a hidden gem. I feel very lucky to be able to attend Pitzer, where the professors are engaging leaders in their fields, the student body truly wants to make the world a better place, and the entire community is intelligent, open minded, and kind. The food is incredible and mostly farm to table with many veg and organic options.  Everyone is into a million things on campus, clubs are super popular, and kids are politically active and work toward social justice and environmental sustainability. We party and have fun, but academics are the priority. Some of our teams are highly ranked, like Swim & Dive which is 8th in the country. Claremont is an awesome college town. It’s just a special school - so happy to call it home. Thank you, Pitzer!"
Sophomore,5,Core values ground the school and students are bright and engaged. Incredible professors. Love Pitzer to death.
Senior,5,"Amazing faculty and study abroad opportunities. Student government is extremely robust and there is no shortage of convenience to get involved on campus. The majority of the student body will partake in internships in the summer, starting from Freshmen year. Pitzer is a dream of a school!"
Sophomore,5,loved my first year here! great academics and even better people. It definitely can feel small at times but the other schools around it makes it feel a whole lot bigger. Students are given access to many different majors and classes due to your ability to take classes at the other schools. Excited for the years to come
Freshman,5,"I'm an incoming freshmen and I'm so excited to attend Pitzer! I felt so at home from the moment I stepped onto campus-- people would hug each other when they meet and everyone is so happy. The campus really has that sunny, Californian, laid-back vibe and I absolutely love it."
Niche User,5,"I like the core values that they stand for. They stand out to me because I am personally an activist. I am motivated by one of their core values of social responsibility. Continuing off of this, I feel as an activist it is important to be on a campus where the people are just as passionate about social justice issues. From an alumni I am was to hear stories of how activism on the Pitzer campus works beyond domestic and international issues. Rather, within the five colleges there are a lot of activism. If there is something they the Pitzer students wants to see change on another campus then they will advocate for it."
Freshman,5,"My dream school! Amazing location amazing academics and environment. I literally can’t stop talking about this school with friends and family haha i’m obsessed. The core values of course are really what set it apart from the other 5cs and I feel that pitzer deserves more of a personal identity apart from the other colleges. It deserves much more individual recognition because it really is such a unique educational establishment. I am so lucky I go here and recommend it to anyone who is really looking to go to school with passionate and brilliant peers. The food is incredible of course and they’re super accommodating to vegans (my personal dietary restriction). Claremont is an adorable charming city and a comfortable distance from LA. All in all, PZ is such a special school that I love so much"
Senior,5,"Amazing professors and classes. Because it is a liberal arts college, you can take really fascinating classes and the class size is small and thus you really get to know your professors and they help you out a lot. Food is amazing some of the best. Location is good too. small town but 45 min from LA."
Junior,5,"My first two years at Pitzer College have been nothing but good experiences with amazing people. If you are looking for a small liberal arts school that you can have a close relationship with your professors and upperclassmates. Coming from Hawaii I didn't know what to expect but hearing really good thing about Pitzer, like how beautiful the school is and how they care about being sustianable and helping the communities around them improve and transition into also becoming sustainable caught by eye. I love that you can go to any of the other campuses around and eat at any dinning hall you choose. The food is incredible and the staff are awesome! Highly recommend checking Pitzer College out for amazing experiences in college! Goodluck"
Sophomore,5,"Pitzer College is truly a place I can call home. Despite some far-left tendencies that are hard to deal with at times, there are plenty of opportunities at the Claremont Colleges to get away from that and still find a community. At Pitzer, the professors are brilliant and caring educators that really are concerned with the students, rather than getting a reputation or working on research. There's plenty of opportunities to interact with professors in and outside the classroom. The food is amazing, and so are the festivals on campus!"
Senior,5,"I am currently a senior at Pitzer and have loved my experience here! The social life is amazing and inclusive, the academics are rigorous but the professors are always there to help, and the campus and students are quirky as ever."
College Freshman,5,"The colleges are making a lot of efforts to prevent sexual assault, by providing teal dot training and actively promoting support services. Campus security guys are super cool and helpful."
College Student,5,Everyone is safe on campus it is located in a really good area.
College Student,5,It is recognized wountry wide and there are a lot of good job cnnections on campus.
College Student,5,Just an amazing campus all in all.
College Junior,5,Pitzer College is one of the most unique campuses I've ever been to. Its community is based around treating each other with respect.
College Senior,5,The students at Pitzer are what make the environment so great. I have made my best friends here and that is what has made my college experience so successful.
College Freshman,5,The professors are incredible as teachers and just as people. Definitely go to office hours and talk to them outside of class. They are very receptive if you reach out.
College Freshman,5,I appreciate that there are no frat bro's
College Freshman,5,There's a ton of options in the village.
College Freshman,5,"Food at the 5C's is great. There's 7 dining halls to choose from. In my opinion, Pitzer has the best breakfast/ brunch options, and Mudd has the best dinners. Very vegetarian/ vegan friendly."
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are basically a resort. Dorms are the largest of any college I've visited, and there's only four people sharing one bathroom. The hallways are all outdoors which creates a good social atmosphere. Also, Pitzer does an incredible job pairing roommate together for freshman year (for the most part). Of course, there are some cases of people needing to switch, but a majority of roommates get along very well. Roommates are based on a survey taken the summer before freshmen year, and a team of psychologists put roommates together based on their responses."
College Sophomore,5,"I can honestly say that I LOVE the food offered at Pitzer as well as the other colleges. At Pitzer specifically, they serve fresh, local produce and always have the healthiest choices of all the schools. The Farm Bowl offered on Wednesday as well as the Pasta Bar offered on Thursday are delicious. Pitzer also has a green box service where students can take meals to go and once they are done, they simply return them to the dining hall."
College Freshman,5,"The Claremont village has lots of fun restaurants. Plus, we are in close proximity to LA with every type of food you could ever want."
College Freshman,5,"Accepting, inclusive party culture. No pressure, but plenty of opportunities to party if you want to. Red cup policy!"
College Freshman,5,"With the 5 different campuses, there is always a delicious, healthy option. It's fun to go to the other schools for meals."
College Freshman,5,Pitzer really makes an effort to build community by requiring most students to live on campus. We have suite style dorms that allow many people to hang out in a room. Rooms are spatious and we are able to redesign them to our liking.
College Sophomore,5,There are five colleges full of students that are given the freedom to plan how they want to spend their nights. There are great parties every weekend for everyone. On one side of the campuses there may be a punk rock show while on the other side there may be a ballroom dance. The options are endless
College Freshman,5,Delicious :) Always some kind of option around the 5cs. You will never go hungry.
College Freshman,5,"I have never felt unsafe walking around campus. Campus safety is around, and there are always people up and about, even at ungodly hours. The school has great resources in the event of emergencies."
College Freshman,5,"Very well rounded, educated professors. All classes are taught by teachers, no TAs."
College Freshman,5,"Major requirements are very liberal, with no GEs. Very easy to get to explore many different fields before deciding upon a major. You can also design your own major. The main thing they look for in applications is compassion and personality."
College Freshman,5,"Administration is absolutely amazing, particularly all of the staff in the Office of Student Affairs. They are consistently there to help, and love talking to students. As far as discipline, the school and campus safety are both very lenient (in a good way). They will let you have fun, and will only say something if you are sick or clearly intoxicated."
College Freshman,5,Plenty of options in the village and beyond.
College Freshman,5,"The dorms here are amazing. With the exception of mead, which is resided in by upperclassmen, all of the dorms are new construction and gorgeous on the inside and out. The freshman rooms are 2 doubles connected by a large bathroom. The rooms are very close to class and the pool. The RAs are really cool, and will only enforce the rules if there is a reason that they absolutely have to."
College Freshman,5,"I love Claremont and the surrounding area. There is always something to do at one of the 5cs. Pitzer is about a 15 minute walk from the metro link station, which takes you into LA directly. Otherwise, its about a 45 min-1 hour drive. There is a shopping center less than 10 minutes away, and students are generally respected."
College Freshman,5,"Very helpful to take classes across all the 5 Colleges of Pitzer, Pomona, Harvey Mudd, CMC, and Scripps"
College Freshman,5,Very lenient on most things!
College Freshman,5,Very helpful services to find off campus housing
College Freshman,5,You get 100% of needed financial aid
College Freshman,5,"Campus is very safe, and security does a great job"
College Sophomore,5,"We are a very diverse college in many ways, We have people of all ethnicities, socioeconomic backgrounds, sexual orientations, and religions. People are very accepting of who you are. It bothers me that there isn't any diversity in political beliefs here. You are terrorized if you are not an extreme leftist."
College Sophomore,5,"I love living in the dorms! Most of the dorms are very recently built and nice. It always keeps you socializing with other people and it's never more than a 5 minute walk to the dining hall or class. Room draw is a very archaic and stressful time of the year, however. But first years do not have to worry about that."
College Freshman,5,"All the dorms are great. There's only one dorm building that is older, but it's the cool dorm since there's a lot of art and many single dorms there plus a living room in each suite. The rest of the dorms are brand new and eco-friendly. They're open and really spacious. "
College Freshman,5,"I am currently undecided, which is totally fine since so many underclassmen are. The workload in general can be a lot or a little, depending on your professor. "
College Freshman,5,"I love the dining hall food at Pitzer! It's so delicious, especially the desserts. I really like how they have Mexican food often. There's different kinds of Mexican food and it's very good (tacos, burritos, sopes, chiles rellenos, tortas, carnitas, birria, nopales, flan, etc). The rest of the food is also really good. I love the falafel. "
College Freshman,5,"I received a lot of financial aid for this school. It's super expensive to go here, but it came out to be the same cost for me as it would be for a UC because of the financial aid I received. "
College Sophomore,5,Always a very workable environment.
College Sophomore,5,All the graffiti and agriculture on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love my school and everyone who goes here feels the same way. It is a truly beautiful, wonderful place. "
College Sophomore,5,Its so sunny and bright every day!! 
College Senior,5,SoCal Weather is always the best. How can you argue with that!?
College Freshman,5,It is almost always sunny and at least 70 degrees out!
Alum,4,"Pitzer is a wonderful place for the right sort of person; as such, I'd recommend visiting the campus, talking to students, and doing plenty of research if you're interested in going there. Some of my favorite aspects included the ability to cross-enroll in classes at any of the five Claremont Colleges and a strong focus on social justice and community engagement. There are some amazing professors there, and the environmental studies programs in particular are very, very good. I found it to be something of an echo chamber at times: the dominant ideology is very leftist, and there wasn't a lot of civil, productive discourse between people from different political backgrounds. I swing liberal, so this was more or less fine for me, but if you're politically conservative you may not be comfortable there. Overall, though, if you're outdoorsy, adventurous, and passionate about social and environmental justice, Pitzer is a wonderful place to be."
Alum,4,"I graduated in 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I have friends who took and are taking classes online. As with any school, there's been a learning curve, especially with older professors, but by all accounts they've been doing a pretty good job navigating the digital landscape."
Alum,4,"Online classes were conducted over Zoom. The transition process was fairly smooth (given the situation of COVID-19 popping up), but I don't think the majority of students were mentally prepared for video lectures given the emphasis on in-person instruction and small class sizes at the 5Cs."
Alum,4,"PZ is far from a perfect institution, but I enjoyed the diverse student body & found people with similar interests, aspirations, and personality. I'll speak from my experience as an Economics major.
Keck Science aside, the identity of PZ is rooted w/students majoring in Sociology, Psych, Poli Sci, Environmental Analysis, Media Studies, and Org Studies. However, PZ needs to gradually adapt & further support the growing # of students deciding to major in Economics/Mathematical Economics, especially on the professional end, as these students generally show interest in careers within Consulting, Finance, etc. 
The ability to take classes at PO/CMC + mingle w/students & alums at the other 5Cs help level the ""career"" playing field to our 5C peers, especially in competitive industries. However, it would be great if PZ started to hire additional faculty to our Econ department & increase career-related support for these types of students at PZ, which will be a gradual process moving forward."
Alum,4,I really loved the creative writing professors. The school does care about social justice though they talk themselves up as being more progressive than they are.
Junior,4,Amazing students and teachers that care about the community and are passionate about something. Great housing and campus food.
Niche User,4,"I like that I need not worry about where I sleep, or how I dress , and how the students are so green with envy , when I wear my MaxcEwan Kilts , and Peter Pan slippers."
Junior,4,"I was overwhelmed by the strong community of First Generation students on campus. Since then we have grown and work to make navigating college easier by accessing resources and holding workshops. Need help reapplying for FAFSA or CSS Profile? Our First-Get Club works closely with the Financial Aid Office to ensure sessions are held to offer assistance and answer questions. 

I would like to see improvements surrounding student health and well-being. Students should have more access to meeting a therapist. We are given a limited amount of free sessions for the school year, but after that students are expected to pay to continue sessions. I personally cannot afford to book extra sessions, so a lot of stresses end being bottled up until they overflow and pour out onto my roommates or peers."
Niche User,4,"The people are so friendly and genuinely care about what they do! Everyone here is for a reason, environmental conservation and ecological studies seem to be the norm here but everyone has their own niche and all of the students are really passionate. The campus is so beautiful, unique, and quirky in the best way-- Pitzer is like a botanical garden; it is full of California local plants, lots and lots of succulents, it is like walking into a lush, green, desert."
College Freshman,4,I'm not sure about after graduation but it seems like most graduates manage to find jobs that they like
College Freshman,4,Life is is great as long as you know what you are doing. It's easy to find your place even though sometimes you could feel threaten by various issues!
College Freshman,4,"Most dorms at Pitzer are newly built, two doubles share a bathroom. It could get nasty if you don't clean up your room and bathroom but overall the living quality is really nice!"
College Freshman,4,"Pitzer is good in terms of its collaboration with the other colleges. Academic things are also great, but in terms of the political atmosphere on campus, it's not the best place for moderates and conservatives. Sometimes, we could feel uncomfortable dealing with the issues on campus."
College Student,4,Really amazing people and the professors help the students on a one on one basis.
College Junior,4,Great places to study. Professor love it when you come in to their office hours. Workload depends on what you are studying and how you study. Regrestration process can sometimes be annoying and confusing.
College Freshman,4,"Most departments are small and only have a few professors. This can be great because you get very close with professors, but also a con because there can be a shortage of resources/ classes."
College Freshman,4,"Hard, but professors are accommodating if you need extra help."
College Freshman,4,"Pitzer is proactive in creating a supportive environment. They address sexual assault seriously. However, this can get complicated when students from multiple schools are involved, as each 5C has different policies."
College Freshman,4,"Many upperclassmen live off campus. You have to apply to live off campus, and the process can be difficult, but I think administration is getting more lenient due to the shortage of on-campus housing."
College Freshman,4,"I wouldn't be here without financial aid. Even with scholarships, Pitzer is the most expensive of all the schools I got into. However, I have no regrets over choosing Pitzer; the academic experience is worth the money. I'm shocked by how many students pay full tuition."
College Freshman,4,Its really nice and some good places close to campus
College Freshman,4,Very good food off campus but expensive
College Freshman,4,"It's very good, but like all college food it gets old. I shouldn't complain though because its amazing compared to any other college I have been to"
College Freshman,4,The housing is really great in PAS and East and West
College Freshman,4,"I always feel safe on campus, and people definitely speak out against sexual assault. I've never experienced a situation where I have felt endangered/threatened/disrespected at any point this past year, but I can only speak for myself."
College Freshman,4,"Compared to most other college dining halls, the food across the 5Cs is super healthy and generally there are enough options. After a few months, though, it can become monotonous and frustrating. Having flex is great because you can get really good coffee at the Motley (Scripps coffee house) and delicious sandwiches at the Grove House (Pitzer)."
College Sophomore,4,"I love it here at Pitzer. The relationships I have formed with peers and faculty, the food, the challenging academics, the culture of the college are everything I could have dreamed for. Being a student here at Pitzer has changed me for the better. If I were to be on the college search again, I would have chosen a school that was a bit older thus providing more and better services."
College Sophomore,4,Most upperclass students try to live in houses/apartments a short walking distance away from campus. It is a hassle to get administration to allow off campus housing because there is a lot of dorms available on campus. Most students live on campus all 4 years.
College Sophomore,4,There is something happening every weekend and almost every party on campus allows any student from the 5c to attend.
College Sophomore,4,"New freshmen dorms have just been built and they are gorgeous. You and your roommate share a conjoined bathroom with two people next door, which is a plus. You don't see many colleges offering a bathroom for 4 people. The dorm atmosphere really encourages a community environment with plenty of study rooms, kitchens, and living rooms in every dorm. Mead is the oldest and shabbiest dorm on campus, but living in a suite layout with 8 people (2 doubles, 4 singles, 2 bathrooms, 1 living room) is by far the best."
College Freshman,4,Pitzer Administration listens to student feedback.
College Sophomore,4,"Its a bit of a drive to LA, but the surrounding area has plenty to do. Also you can be in mountains, in the deseart, or at the beach in an hour depending on the direction that you drive in."
College Sophomore,4,The office of Student Affairs is awesome. They are always supporting students through various channels. Some polices are annoying but they are easy to navigate / work around.
College Freshman,4,"Very doable. Registration kind of sucks for second semester freshmen, but there is a PERM system to get into a full class."
College Freshman,4,"If you are into the party scene, it is easy to find parties and have a blast. Its there if you want it. If you aren't into the party scene, then there are other limited events going on. Parties occur on and off campus."
College Freshman,4,"Local atmosphere here is great, the community is very kind!"
College Freshman,4,"I have not yet had one, but have heard from others that Pitzer does a wonderful job at allowing people to get internships"
College Sophomore,4,"Most people here are pretty artsy, hipster, and hippy. That basically sums up the majority of people here. Guys are pretty cute throughout the Claremont Colleges. It's just hard to believe that a lot of these people are rich and dress terribly."
College Sophomore,4,"Pitzer has a lot of study rooms that are conveniently located in residence halls. There's a large grassy area in the center of campus where a lot of students chill, hang out, read, study for an exam. Overall, facilities are good. I don't have complaints."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the food is amazing, but there's a couple things you learn to avoid. Omelet bar at breakfast is bomb."
College Sophomore,4,Nighlife is great if you are not super into Greek life and bars. There are always parties every night expect for Sunday and Monday. There are plenty of day parties and themed parties. You don't have to drink or do drugs to feel like you are fitting in. I always have fun at all the parties.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a varsity athlete and I LOVE IT!!!! There is a huge emphasis on academic excellence. Events are generally poorly attended except when we are going up against Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. We have strong programs across the board, but less spirit than state schools. The facilities for regular students to work out are amazing, but for varsity athletes, the facilities that are used at Pomona are average, but will probably be replaced in the coming years."
College Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed most of my classes and professors here. Being able to take classes at the other Claremont Colleges is definitely a big bonus! It's great taking classes at other campuses. That being said, there are some professors that aren't that great, so ask around and check online ratings before you register for classes. Remember, take the professor, not the class. Some prereq classes are boring, but we all suffer together. At Pitzer, compared to most schools, you can essentially take whatever classes you want, there is only one required writing course, which is LOTS of fun (and I don't like writing). Classes vary in size, intro classes are larger, and some classes are seminar style and some are lecture. Usually my intro classes have been about 25 students. Once you move to upper level classes, they can get down to 5 students."
College Sophomore,4,"I love going to school and living in Claremont! I wouldn't give it up for anything. That being said, if you want to go explore LA, you definitely want to have a car or borrow someone's car. The nightlife here is not for everyone...its not Greek Life, so if you are into that, this may not be the place for you. There is always something to do every night of the week, and parties start on Tuesday nights and go until Saturday nights."
College Sophomore,4,"It's rarer than most colleges, but it still happens. Usually it involves another student causing trouble from another Claremont College."
College Sophomore,4,Most girls around campus are pretty attractive. You can be strangers with anyone on campus and be able to hang out and have it be fun.
College Sophomore,4,"As long as you go to class and do well you'll be fine. If you party, then as long as you don't get transported or make stupid decisions, you'll stay out of trouble."
College Freshman,4,"It's warm a lot, but it gets cold at night. In the winter, nighttime (and sometimes daytime) can be freezing. It snows on the mountains nearby, so it gets really cold. It's super hot at the beginning and end of the school year, but it's nice warm weather for the most part."
College Freshman,4,"I love the classes here. They're really interesting and the professors make class fun. Registering for classes is scary because you randomly get assigned a registration time. The classes you want might get filled, but you can always send in a request to the professor telling them why they should let you be in their class. 
There are many study rooms in the residence halls where people go, or you could also just study in your room. Many people actually do their work outside on the grass. "
College Freshman,4,"It's generally safe here, but there's always some worry anywhere you go. It might be a little scary walking alone on campus at night when no one is out. I feel safe in every other aspect, though."
College Freshman,4,"There are printing stations around campus where you can use printing credit. You get $15 printing credit each semester, which is a lot actually. The computer labs are really nice, too (and quiet). They have macs and PCs available there. "
College Freshman,4,I love my school! I love how small the classes are (mine were 6-15 people). I also really like the dorms; we have suites with a bathroom that we share with only 3 people. It's honestly the best school ever. We're spoiled rotten here. 
College Freshman,4,There are resources for people and there are rules against them. It's very nice because you can ask for help if something has gone wrong and you won't get in trouble. 
College Freshman,4,"The school is not that strict. Of course, you will be in trouble if you get caught, but as long as you're smart about everything, you'll be fine. It's really not that bad. The Residence Assistants are very chill for the most part."
College Sophomore,4,Stay out of my business and I'll stay out of yours
College Sophomore,4,"While it is predominately white, upper middle class kids, everyone is extremely accepting of everyone else and always very concerned with being politically correct and open to everyone. "
College Sophomore,4,"There's pretty much something going on Tuesday-Saturday at one of the Claremont Colleges. Also, Pitzer has a lot of off campus houses that consistently throw parties."
College Sophomore,4,You're never going to have a problem with administration unless you're really dumb and obscenely obvious or disturbing others.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are new and very nice and clean. They are actually pretty spacious and youll never have more than one roommate. Also, on of the new sophomore dorms is platinum lead certified! "
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is very quirky, independent, and, I hate to say it, but hipster. There's a lot of 90s fashion and environmentalism happening here, which i love. "
Works Here,2,It is sad that ACT or SAT are now optional.  Students are getting admitted on inflated GPA without submitting their below average test scores.
Niche User,2,"For the most part, Pitzer was a fun experience but I paid for the schooling and to be blunt it left a lot to be desired. There were constant problems with faculty and rigid teaching styles and very poor visiting professors on a regular basis. 
In addition, the accountability and consistency of the professors is almost none existent. When you do find a good professor often times they are absolutely amazing but finding these professors are difficult and less than likely. So in the end there are defintly pros and cons but in my opinion the cons of the schooling definatly out weigh the pros of the culture and experiance."
College Student,2,We do not have a greek life program.
College Junior,2,"Athletics are not a big deal. It is sad to watch our rival games as it reminds us of a high school football match. Come to think of it, a high school football match might be more entertaining than our games. Basketball is pretty fun to watch, but only when Pomona-Pitzer play against CMS. The other times, no one really watches sports."
College Freshman,2,Pitzer is a growing school and doesn't offer much financial aid. Work-study is hard to get.
College Freshman,2,"If you have an interest in going to sports games, and participating on sports teams or joining inter murals, the resources are available for you. However, there is not a sports feel to the 5cs, and most people don't go to games."
College Freshman,2,"not great, i woud prefer school with frats"
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much diversity at Pitzer anymore. The junior and senior classes are more diverse, due to the higher acceptance rate back when they applied. It's kind of sad how the diversity is decreasing year by year. The school is made up of mostly Whites. There are barely any African-Americans at all. The biggest ethnic minority here are Latinos. There is a big diversity regarding sexuality. Many people identify as LGBTQ, gender queer, polygamous, etc. Most people believe in some form of God, but not an institutional religion. Most people are wealthy, but there are about 1/5 of the people on financial aid. "
College Sophomore,2,We don't really worry too much about athletics.
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid department is kind of a hassle to deal with but Pitzer has a lot of money to give.
College Sophomore,2,You are only permitted to have a car your junior and senior years unless you get a special permit for your job which is inconvenient. 
College Senior,2,"Even with a parking permit, parking on any of the five campuses can be a drag. You can't even get a parking permit until your sophomore year (there are few instances where freshmen with cars can get one). Sometimes, parking is so exclusive on the campuses that certain cars with certain permits are not allowed to park there. I personally have gotten 3 parking citations this semester alone just for being in a parking space past the designated time."
College Sophomore,2,Bike It – The Green Bike Program is great you can rent bikes for the semester for free. Pretty much people get around via bike or car. Public transport is limited to a limited bus system and the train into LA. You cant have a car as a 1st year.
College Freshman,2,No Fun for the Sober One – My experience at with the party scene at Pitzer has been pretty negative. It is almost impossible to have fun unless you are completely drunk. Those who make the choice not to drink are often bored at the 5-C dances.
College Junior,2,"Biking and walking are much better options and less frowned upon. Especially taking classes at other schools, finding general non-visitor parking for class sucks."
College Junior,2,"Bikes Are Great, but It's the Suburbs of LA: Get a Friend With a Car – I bike everywhere and that works really well unless you want to go outside of the village/campus area, then you need a car... or you can spend an hour on a very infrequent and inefficient train to LA and take buses from there."
College Freshman,2,most Pitzer students aren't very interested in the sports
College Junior,2,"Car Recommended If You're Going Anywhere Far – It's Southern California, so everyone drives.  Still, you can get into LA using the Metrolink provided you don't need a car in LA (which you will)."
College Freshman,2,"Get Cozy on Campus – First years aren't allowed to have a car, so most students stay on campus the majority of the time. It is pretty easy to bike to a few standard places, but mostly you are stuck on campus. The bus system is completely pointless and not convenient at all. You can use a zipcar, but it gets pricey if you want to stay of campus for more than a few hours. There is also a $1 taxi that will take you anywhere in claremont, but you might as well bike the 1 mile it will go."
College Senior,2,"Bring a Bike – Claremont is a college town, so there isn't much around. Public transportation is quite inconvenient (although moderately priced), so most people bike around town. The village is a fifteen-minute walk away, so your legs will come in handy. If you're looking for things other than a record store, some restaurants, or the Metrolink, it's best to use a car. Most malls and movie theaters are within a twenty-minute drive. Also a warning - LA is NOT that close - it's a 45-minute drive or over an hour on the train. Late-night transportation is non-existent unless you have a personal car."
Niche User,1,"That moment when your parents are both teachers already struggling to survive in California's harsh economy, yet Pitzer admissions expect you to pay the full tuition (70,000+ dollars per year) MORE THAN HALF OF MY FAMILY INCOME)! Plus when I applied ED, they confirmed that if I applied for financial aid and did not get it I could get my $500 deposit back: ""it wouldn't make sense to not give you money when that's quite literally the reason you can't go"", yet when the time came they kept the money ignoring our multiple requests to get it back. Bottom line, Pitzer is an amazing school. However, if you are anywhere in the middle class bracket don't expect to be able to afford it. The admissions office at Pitzer was extremely nice and helpful. The financial aid office was inconsiderate and rude."
Niche User,1,"School leads students on to believe they will be financially supported. I applied and was admitted ED but was somehow completely misread in terms of financial aid. Many students can't attend because of financial reasons. School sucks with aid if you're middle class. Unless you're very poor, they won't help you. Awful ethical practices"
College Junior,1,"It's non existent, but there are small clubs or organizations that claim to be similar to fraternities. It's really not a thing at the Claremont colleges. I don't mind it but it would be nice to have them. I can understand the motive of not having them, but at the same time it's weird being the only school without one."
College Freshman,1,I can't remember the last time somebody went to watch a single sport game.
College Sophomore,1,"We technically do not have Greek Life, but there is a Kappa Gamma group that is a fratority that hosts events sometimes. If you want Greek Life, don't come here."
College Freshman,1,Nothing to do around claremont schools like lmu have better surrounding area
College Freshman,1,sucks if you play water polo. pomona is hella far and the trek back and forth in unbereable
College Sophomore,1,"Not Known for Sports – Pitzer and Pomona share sports. There is no sporting events on Pitzer's campus whatsoever. Nobody goes to the games at Pomona either, unless it is against our rival (CMC, SCRIPPS, HARVEY MUDD). There are intramural sports, but those are kind of a joke"
College Junior,1,"All Talk – The only diversity are people of hispanic background and asian foreign exchange students, but other then that, the campus is predominantly white."
College Junior,1,"Everyone Smells – People think that paying $56,000 a year gives them entitlement to not shower, brush their hair, or wear shoes. Everyone thinks they are a hippie and it is few and far between that you will find a nicely dressed person. I am curious if these people are interested in ever finding a job that isn't at a record store or a head shop. What is funny though, is that everyone's totally vintage clothing was probably purchased for lots of money, because believe me, their parent's have that money to spare."
College Freshman,1,Sports Sports Sports – nobody cares about sports here so dont even bother
College Junior,1,"Weed and Booze – Take up most all of the partying on campus. Impossible to live in any dorm without smelling weed at one point or another, even in the substance free wings of the dorms."
College Sophomore,1,"Pitzer and the 5Cs are so small that everyone just gets around by biking and walking usually. The only public transportation around is the Metrolink in the Village, which is good for getting into LA and the surrounding area."
College Junior,1,"A bit less school spirit with sports since Pitzer sort of piggybacks on Pomona's teams, which aren't that great in the first place.  Baseball is stronger than most other sports, but no one's going to the Pitzer for competitive athletics."
College Junior,1,"We have sports?? Wait we have sports here? I was a cheerleader for two years here, and lets just say that I quit because I could catch a ball better than the football team. Sorry guys."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Limited and Expensive – There are quite a few places in Claremont to eat, but most of them aren't very good and are pretty expensive. It's hard to get a meal for under $8. There are not any places that offer student discounts either."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Sunny All the Time – I'm from Seattle and love the rain so I hate the weather, but if you like sun, it's great. It is rarely rainy or even cloudy year round. The biggest downside is that in September when school starts it is between 100-110 for about three weeks."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are not enough parking spaces on campus for the total of students, faculty, staff, and visitors.  Furthermore, it is ridiculous that I should have to pay for a parking permit when I pay such exorbitant costs to attend Pitzer.  It doesn't cost Pitzer anything to let me park my car, as a student, in a campus parking lot."

Sophomore,5,this school has a great learning environment and professors are really helpful. there is a lot of helpful resources on and off campus.
Junior,5,"I love the campus, it’s beautiful to walk around. The faculty and staff really care about student success."
Junior,5,"Yes, I’ve taken a few classes online. The professors are very helpful and understanding with everything online."
Junior,5,"Being a student at CSUSB is such a rewarding experience, the teachers really value the effort that is put in by each student and even if you are struggling they will put in the effort to guide you throughout the class, which I did not expect from a large 4-year school."
Junior,5,"So far I am loving my online experience with this school, the professors are doing everything they can to ensure we are getting the same type of learning experience as we would have if it not were for the current state of the world."
Junior,5,"The professors are amazing here, rarely do I come across an educator who doesn't care about their students. I also really love how diverse the school is, despite it being in a small area (San Bernardino), you'd be surprised at how cultured the environment is."
Junior,5,"I love all of my classes online, the first quarter was difficult, but the professors here adapted fairly quickly, and we just recently converted to a semester system so things have slowed down a little and the classes are great!"
Alum,5,"Advising was excellent, student aids and teachers were all accessible and helpful. Overall great experience."
Alum,5,"Professors were well organized and kept things interactive through Zoom class sessions. Blackboard was easy and efficient for turning in work, posting assignments, taking finals, using discussion boards, accessing course materials/grade info."
Graduate Student,5,"In time that I have spent at Cal State San Bernardino I always had a good feeling that the professors I was taking the classes with, they are good quality professors. Of course there some less motivated professors here and there but I would say about 90% of my professors were in good standard and do not regret having spent my time there. There was a lot people every quarter with people having to waist list some classes, as for me it happened about twice or ended up switching my schedule or classes to make up the time I wanted to take up or units needed. I would recommend for people to take CSU San Bernardino on an offer as it really is cheaper tuition with a lot of quality behind it as I sometimes recommend my friends."
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience with California State University of San Bernardino has been a bit rough, it was something I was not used to and I am more of a visual learning, hands on kind of student but online and virtual zoom meeting did teach me many new lessons and advice, it has only made me stronger of what I thought I didn't know."
Sophomore,5,"My experience with California State University of San Bernardino has been a like a ride on a rollercoaster and in a fun experience way. My freshman year was nice, welcoming and really felt like the school for me but of course we all have those days where we feel like we're about to fail. CSUSB professors were always there for us who needed that extra lift because they do want to see us succeed."
Senior,5,CSUSB is very welcoming to every new and returning students. You can clearly see the driven passion that faculty and staff have to be able to help students in every possible way that they can. There are countless number of resources that are openly available to everyone regardless of your background.
Senior,5,I feel very safe on this campus and I love how diverse both the staff and students are. The professors genuinely care for their students and want those students to pass their classes.
Senior,5,I took many classes online and found it to be just as informative as the classes that are held in person.
Sophomore,5,Everyone is so friendly and the campus is beautiful. There are so many campus reassures to help you succeed in your education. There are also so many people on campus that would love to help you out.
Freshman,5,"So far amazing help with my accomodations for my disability. The counselor and all of the staff  has been super kind and very nice.
I was a little apprehensive because I don t know anybody there, but at least online they have been super helpful."
Freshman,5,"This pandemic has been super stressful, however the staff in the University has gone out of their way to make webinars with tons of information for the start of the school year. I feel at home even if we have not been physically together."
Senior,5,"My last quarter was all online due to Covid-19, but the school did an excellent job at helping students. All my professors were understanding and helpful and their online platform was easy and helpful. Highly recommend!"
Senior,5,I took my spring quarter online. I loved it!! The teacher where very creative and kept the students motivated. It was exciting to log on cause you didn't know what exciting thing the teacher had planned for that day.
Senior,5,I took my spring quarter online. I loved it!! The teacher where very creative and kept the students motivated. It was exciting to log on cause you didn't know what exciting thing the teacher had planned for that day.
Freshman,5,I have visited the campus many times and the vibes are always positive! I have studied in the library multiple times during my senior year of high school and I have met many new people.
Alum,5,"I only took one class online since majority of math classes are not offered online unless they are freshman or sophomore course. There are more general education courses offered online.  
    I took latino culture online and it is a lot of reading as of any other online course, but you could do the work based on your own work schedule.  I usually would set a day or two aside and try and knock out the whole weeks worth of work."
Alum,5,"I was a transferred student to California State University-San Bernardino. I finished my bachelors degree in just over a year, in that year I became the Philanthropist for the Math Club, I tutored on campus and I worked for a scholarship program on campus. The scholarship company is Louis Stoke for Minority Program which gave me a job, a scholarship, and funding to attended math conferences in California, Ohio, and Colorado. 
  The professors on campus were always willing to help and you could walk into any open door in the hallway to ask for help on a math problem or question about your future in your career. The Math Club will hold Appreciation dinner for the faculty in the math building this allowed students to talk to professors if they had a field of focus when they completed their education.  
   CSUSB became my home away from home with friends that shared similar interest and a place to get coffee on almost every corner."
Sophomore,5,The atmosphere there is really friendly and all the professors are great with making sure their students feel comfortable and feel like they can succeed.
Sophomore,5,I have taken a couple of classes online due to the quarantine and with this the classes were easier in my experience as it was more focused on making sure we got the information we needed as well as enough time to do the work.
Senior,5,"My online experience with CSUSB was something new to get used to because I didn't have to wake up that extra hour to get ready and drive to school, I was able to sleep in a bit more before my class started which was pretty convenient. The down side with online is as much resources there are online and the way the school organized its whole platform to online, the present feeling of being in class and actually learning with the professor there was missing and is what made the classes from the quarter challenging and was difficult to understand some concepts. Overall the experience from learning online was excellent and I would be happy to do it again as it allows for me to have my schedule more flexible as I can do more with school being online."
Senior,5,"I have had my fair share of experiences here at CSUSB and it's interesting and entertaining for the majority part of the time being here. Although college bring anxiety and stress with the exams and projects and midterms and finals, but being able to meet new people and make life long connections has been the best experience for me. The one thing I would change would be to make the classes not so early or allow students to take classes even if they are full, because i know so many students including me that would be standing the whole time in a class just to get the credit for it because it fits my schedule so I am not missing out on work and don't have to have a hectic messed up schedule."
Junior,5,I have had a very pleasant and welcoming experience so far. The staff is very friendly and helful. They are ready and well prepared. I'm in the Social Work program and so far it has exceded my expectations.  The academic advisors really focus on you and anwer all your questions with out making you feel silly.
Junior,5,"I'm an older adult returning to school after many years away. At first I had a little bit of problems but that came from being new to the system.
After my orientation, and having the system explained to me, it became very easy to maneuver. Whenever I have a question my online professors  are quick to respond. The systm is very user friendly. I was intimidated at first but now I find the online sites very easy."
Sophomore,5,"It is definitely a struggle, not all professors are the best. But let me not knock the ones who have helped me tremendously. Really enjoy the online learning."
Junior,5,This institution is doing a great job transitioning to the virtual world due to the country's circumstances. I have been helped and advised on all my educational questions.
Junior,5,"My online experience did start off overwhelming, but they are doing their best to communicate efficiently with their students and also advise the students on how to experience online classes, and online activities."
Alum,5,My professors were invested in my success and encouraged me to push myself beyond the limits I placed on myself.
Alum,5,The most thing I like and CSUSB is the help and assistance the facility is. The help is there but is as students need to use them as much as possible. They want us to succeed and graduate. Academic and Advising staff is excellent at what they do and helped me get through the toughest times when I was struggling.  Thank You!!!!
Alum,5,The online classes were easy to navigate through blackboard and if I had a question the professors would answer my email within 24 hours.
Freshman,5,I love that school! Everyone is so helpful and kind. The professors are available for their students during office hours and are willing to answer any questions you may have. Faculty also answers your questions appropriately and makes me feel comfortable.
Alum,5,I finished my degree at CSUSB and it was well worth it. the teachers were amazing and provided me a wonderful education
Alum,5,"The classes I took at Cal State San Bernardino prepared me for my career of teaching! All courses challenged me, extended pre-existing knowledge in my career field, and prepared me for my career in teaching."
Freshman,5,"This college is very diverse! I have meet many students from all over the world. I have joined multiply organizations on campus which as kept me involved with my school and peers. The professors are very friendly and understandable. Due to COVID19, I believe the school has done an amazing job of responding and helping the students with online courses."
Senior,5,This campus is very welcoming to everyone and it has a community feel to it. The people and campus are very friendly and it feels very safe as well.  CSUSB offers a variety of classes and the professors are very helpful. The professors are very willing to answer the students questions.
Junior,5,"California State University, San Bernardino has been an extremely pleasant experience. I have enjoyed all classes and professors that I have taken and encountered. I hope to graduate with a bachelors degree in 2021."
Niche User,5,"I have visited the campus at San Bernadino, it was not that big which was easy to get around as well as it was such a beautiful campus than what others may say."
Freshman,5,"Being a first-year at the California State University of San Bernardino has been very exciting. Truthfully, this campus was my last option right after graduating high school, however, I do not regret it. It has certainly been a blessing in disguise. I have definitely begun my college experience in the right place. Having so much to offer, such as clubs and organizations to help the student get involved on campus. Creating connections and networking with other students on campus can help the California State University of San Bernardino feel more and more like the right choice made."
Niche User,5,The California State University of San Bernardino was an excellent experience for me because its very close to home and I'm getting the best academics for the major that I'm going to be studying.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is absolutely peaceful, but at times to quiet, I wish they would have more events on more days."
Junior,5,"the experience is more than i thought it would be and the people here, professors are very communicative and supportive."
Niche User,5,"Cal State San Bernardino is amazing school, I have heard so many stories about it. The students feel very supported their and feel comfortable in their environment. I am looking forward to attend their for the year of 2020-2021 in the nursing program. The campus is beautiful and has many opportunties to help its students."
Junior,5,The campus is very open and refreshing. There are always people trying to get to know you and lot of space to learn.
Senior,5,Cal State San Bernardino is extremely close to home. Its a school in an area where i wouldn't feel lost. The student life makes incoming students feel welcome and there is nothing better than that. There are many amazing programs for child development and many others.
Freshman,5,The campus is nice and big we have a police department that patrols all the time. It is a public open campus but I feel one hundred percent safe. The people are nice and the faculty is nice. I am a freshman and I have had one of the best experiences because of this school. I am proud to be part of the pack. Coyote for life!
Junior,5,They make adult students feel welcome and not too old for school. The amount of amenities and assistance a student has there is amazing.
Freshman,5,Supportive and caring teachers . Lots of diversity and helpful tools for student’s learning environment.
Alum,5,I loved my experience at CSUSB. The campus is beautiful. There are many places to study and so many clubs to get involved in. The professors are helpful. I miss being on campus daily.
Freshman,5,"CSUSB is a very inclusive school and provides a very good education for everyone. There is a great sports program, honors program, and there are so many clubs to get involved with! The events held are always great and fun, and the staff and students are awesome."
Freshman,5,"First, I must say that going to a university is extremely different than going to normal grade school and that is a great thing because the environment of this university, particularly in the students that are enrolled, have different attitudes than grade school kids. While there are students older than me enrolled in this university along with students my age, these students tend to be more focused, more quiet, and more organized with what is put in front of them in order to succeed in and graduate college. Second, there are unbelievable amounts of resources available all across campus for students. Last, the professors are outstanding with the subject that they teach as they not only want the students to pass their class and college, but want to make their students feel welcome and open to everyone."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere and professors. All of the students I have met are amazing  and have had no issues with anything on campus. Personally, I have not really had any experience with the party scene so I am not very qualified to answer that. I think the only downside is that there is construction going on right now and that San Bernardino is known for being sketchy, but the local area is not bad at all. I love it so far."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy attending CSUSB. I have developed into a person that I never knew that I could be by the help of faculty, staff and students. Even though our campus is growing constantly, we as students still have the access of having personal relationships with our professors."
Niche User,5,I haven't attended the college yet but I hope to in the future because I have heard amazing things about this college.
Junior,5,"This is my first year at Cal State University-San Bernardino and my experience so far has been great. I transferred from a community college, and I had many questions and doubts about this campus. However, the transition has been smooth and the faculty and staff has been of great assistance to me. The student body has a great community of people who want to learn and graduate. My classes have been interesting and informative as well. I would recommend this university to anyone who is applying straight out of high school or transferring to a 4-year college."
Senior,4,Not usually an online school but going online with teachers not use to the format was... interesting. Some are not very tech savvy but most are and I was able to do well even in the online classes.
Sophomore,4,the professors make the online learning easier. they take their time and provide office hours. Students get to interact with professors via zoom. and there are assistant teachers in certain classes.
Junior,4,"The online experience in San Bernardino was good. With our current circumstances, all classes are now held online due to COVID-19, so it does take a while to adjust. It is just difficult because there are limitations to communication and resources compared to when we are physically in school but I believe the school is doing its best to maintain academics and safety."
Junior,4,"This school gave me great experiences in life. Being the first in my family to attend a four-year college in the US, it was tough understanding the differences and how it worked, but CSUSB gave me numerous help to understand how college works."
Freshman,4,So far my classes are alright I got some good teachers some not as good as others.but since it's online I have more time to do stuff
Freshman,4,The campus is super nice and they have some cool activities I have yet to participate in them since COVID but they looked fun .
Alum,4,"Online classes were easy and most professors allow plenty of time to complete assignments. The easiest class was for music, but this requires attendance to concerts."
Alum,4,"The science department is great, however it is greatly impacted and difficult to get into classes. Overall, I had a great experience at this school."
Senior,4,A very quant environment. A lot less students than other Cal States in SoCal. Beautiful scenery near mountains. The campus has provided aid for students during the pandemic. I received finances for the outbreak. I highly recommend this school.
Sophomore,4,"Cal State San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus is a very welcoming campus. The staff is very helpful. Although the campus is not very big, we get a lot of interaction with our professors unlike at a bigger campus"
Sophomore,4,"I've only taken classes online due to the pandemic that is going on, so it's new to everyone who hasn't taken classes online for the first time. However the professors understand that it's harder to learn online so they always help us along the way and understand of technical difficulties. So I believe they handle online classes very well."
Sophomore,4,I have been going to CSUSB for 2 years now and can now say how great of a university it is. The teachers are great and always willing to help their students. Also the services there on campus are generous and help students a lot when in need.
Senior,4,"Due to the current pandemic, everyone is trying their hardest to be able to accommodate to the current situation with online learning. Not only does this affect the students, but the professors as well. It has created a greater bond between students and professors because now the students are lending a hand to their professors as they have done for us."
Freshman,4,California State university San Bernardino has a lot of helpful program. If I were to change something it would to be to have a larger library in our campus.
Sophomore,4,Staff are nice and understanding. The campus is clean and large. The environment of students on campus is welcoming and cheerful. Classes are clean and open. There are many buildings for different departments. It is easy to get in contact on the phone with someone and locate areas on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I took 4 classes online and all were easy to navigate through. The only class that seemed overwhelming was ENG 106 because assignments were difficult to locate but the professor was very nice, understanding, and accommodating to her students needs. The 3 other classes were simple and easy, you just have to be consistently on top of your assignments and due dates."
Sophomore,4,We have all had some trouble adapting to online classes but they make sure that if you are struggling or have any issues that there are several helpful resources.
Senior,4,"Professors transferred into online learning pretty well, the school changed grades to C/NC and gave refunds on tuition as well."
Senior,4,"Its a great school, especially for the price. There are many organizations and event in place to help you with whatever you need. CSUSB has lots of resources for it's students and really has our interests in mind."
Senior,4,My experience at CSUSB was very good! All my professors were helpful and really wanted my to succeed. I will miss my time here and I highly recommend people to consider CSUSB as their future university.
Junior,4,The application process was easy. I wish the Information about how to use the financial aid was more clear.
Junior,4,I have not taken online classes but will be taking them in the fall when classes start again. Due to COVID-19 all classes will be online and so my first semester at the school will be online.
Freshman,4,So far my experience with CSUSB is positive because everyone seems to be very helpful. I am excited for more classes to begin in the fall.
Sophomore,4,The staff are always very helpful and the campus has lots of clubs/events going on throughout the year to get you involved. I was able to interact with many people who shared the same interest as me or had the same major.  That made it very easy to make acquaintances.
Sophomore,4,"I love this college so far, very affordable, great staff to help you, always willing to put you in the right places. I very must enjoy this school. I wish we were not required to buy textbooks we won't ever use though."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year attending the college and so far I find it very fun. Due to Covid-19, the second half of my new college experience was cut short. In the first half when I was on campus, the school was experiencing high winds and some classes had to be canceled. I was amazed. Not by the fact that classes were canceled, but with the way the college handled the situation. On the days when there was high winds, I received many emails about routes around campus that were safer to take. This Covid-19 situation, I believe, the college handled it pretty well. Decisions were made very quickly and effectively to make sure students are still getting the education that they pay for. Switching to teaching/learning online had been a struggle in the beginning, but I am still learning the content that I need to. There is no change to the school that I can think of at this moment."
Freshman,4,"At the moment all my classes are online. In the next school year, the first semester of my  classes will also be online. My professors have been very professional and understanding during this situation. My professors make very good use of internet time and online lessons. Some older professors were having a difficult time at first, but they eventually got used to using the electronics. Because of this, they can now focus on getting the lessons down. Even when they were struggling in the beginning, they found other ways to reach out and keep their students updated on what the students need to be doing."
Alum,4,I only had a few classes online but the system was easy to navigate and my professors were always available to assist me and to clarify anything I needed help with.
Freshman,4,"Overall, everyone is very considerate and very outgoing involving everyone without leaving anyone out. I like the diversity of the campus and how caring everyone is towards one another. Especially, the professor, they are very mindful and very encouraging without berating any students and they are very considerate of each student. I would not change a thing about this school but if any improve it if time serve needed to."
Freshman,4,"Moving to online wasn't as bad as I thought. If anything, it actually made certain classes easier than it would have been in person. Having classes online gives you the opportunity to learn at your own pace which has been very helpful."
Freshman,4,"I am currently about to end my first year here, and it's been pretty great! They have tons of resources for students to use however I didn't even really know about them through the school directly. The professors I've had this past year were all really understanding especially when the Covid-19 pandemic began."
Senior,4,feel the amount of money is good for receiving level of education. student life isn’t the best but not the worst either
Senior,4,zoom is hard but some professors help with leniency. overall online learning is hard because of communication
Freshman,4,My experience here at Cal State San Bernardino has been so far great. The professors are great and understanding of students. The classes are not too difficult to manage and the students I’ve met are friendly. I would like to see CSUSB’s sense of school spirit or community improve. I think most students commute so there is a lack of events for those students.
Freshman,4,"It's not a huge campus so getting places isn't so difficult. They also have everything you would need like a gym, a pool, a place to eat, a library, a student health center, and many different places you can visit for help."
Niche User,4,Cal State San Bernardino is overall unique. When once first arrives we see a clean the campus is. Also the first unique aspect of it was all the interactions. From sports to clubs there is something for everyone. The interactions all help make sure that everyone is enjoying there time and aren't only focusing on academics. I also like how the classes vary in size. They are some that are really large and other that are smaller.
Niche User,4,When I went to California State University San Bernardino  the college was a good school they have options of what you would want to study in the school. In the school they have different departments of what each student would want to study or to become in the future. The campus is a big campus for the students and its easy to find of what classes you would to get into and that you could travel by walking or by skating or biking. In the campus dorms they have different ones of each year in college everyone is separated by year. The student life in the school it fun to see the different diversity in the campus that each person is different and that they have different clubs that you could enjoy. They also have events for the students to enjoy and to be relaxed while they are in college.
Freshman,4,I've been here during field trips and I have very much enjoyed the time in which I got to experience this school.
Niche User,4,"My cousins used to go here and the environment is really great. Many people bash on it because of the environment around it, but it is honestly a beautiful campus. The people that attend is what makes it a great place."
Junior,4,"I haven't been here for very long but the entire campus overall is pretty great, most of the professors here are alright as long as you do your own research beforehand, and most parts of the experience are alright."
Freshman,4,My experience at San Bernardino has been a very good college experience. The college is very diverse and the campus itself is beautiful.
Niche User,4,"Cal State San Bernardino is a very nice and big school. The campus is very well-established and has pretty outdoor walk ways. One thing I liked about Cal State San Bernardino is that it is very diverse and promotes a lot of fun school activities and events. I would say campus food is great too. They offer fast food restaurants like Chinese food or taco bell and dominos. If i'm not interested in fast food then they also offer cooked meals in the cafeteria, where they serve a really good breakfast burrito. Cal State San Bernardino also has a upstairs bar! Most of the professors for general classes are also good and some are straight to the point where as long as I get my work done I will pass the class. Professors that are more in my biology however, are a bit tougher on students and expect high expectation, which is understood for a biology major. Overall I would say my experience at Cal State San Bernardino was a great time socially and educationally."
Senior,4,"What I enjoyed about CSUSB is the environment there, the students there aren’t afraid to help on another when you forget a Scantron  or a blue book. Something they can improve on is the amount of construction going on campus. Sometimes it looks like a construction site and not a university."
Freshman,4,Overall amazing campus with amazing people fill throughout. Very welcoming environment definitely would recommend attending this school.
Niche User,4,it is a very nice campus with much space and I like that it is close to where I live meaning I wont have to drive for a long time and I don't have to be far away from my family. The school is also full of school spirit and that is a good way to cheer up students.
Sophomore,4,"I very much enjoy going to this school. There is a large amount of diversity, and such a wide variety of classes offered. The past year at this school has been great. There are times when I do get frustrated with cost, but overall, I enjoy my academics. With the large amount of majors, I have selected psychology, but I will continue my next year exploring on which concentration I would like to focus on. Being at the Palm Desert campus allows me to receive extra help, and also allows me to make better connections with friends and faculty. This university has many advantages, with the slight amount of disadvantages."
Freshman,4,"Lately, the campus has been closed multiple times because of the winds and fires. There has been a couple power outages, but I have felt safe during these times. The campus is great and I've made connection with people even though I am the kind of person to struggle with that."
Alum,4,"Liked the Nursing Program, met a community there striving for the same goal.  Went through the same hardships with the same people for 3 years which allowed for amazing and everlasting friendships.  What I didn't like was the lack of support from some of the staff.  However, there were staff who went above and beyond to help the students even though it was not their subject of expertise.  Campus is very diverse in clubs and activities, over all everyone is very helpful and kind."
Alum,4,I transferred to CSU San Bernardino coming from a community college and it was a big improvement. The school had friendly professors that you can approach during their office hours. The school had extra classes where you will review what was discussed during lecture. This was very helpful with the difficult science classes that I had to take. I took all my science in this campus and the professors were awesome. Athletics and party scene were not the schools specialty but the main focus of this school is its professional learning environment.
Graduate Student,4,"Great educational campus, amazing professors, within a supportive community.  Campus has recreational activities, events, organizations, restaurants, and just about anything you can think of."
Sophomore,4,"Very close and friendly environment. The variety of activities to do outside of class is great to have. The campus is beautiful, although very warm at times.  The school has many resources any student can use to either get ahead or stay on track in their studies. The classes range from a small class of around 20, to a huge lecture hall ranging from the hundreds. The classes offered are great to get  interested in a subject you thought you had once hated. Overall, a great experience at this school so far!"
Niche User,4,California State University - San Bernardino seems to be a good option for college. I like all the choices they have.
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the welcoming environment and all the resources they provide. The professors always make time for office hours and do reviews so that the students are able to succeed in the class. The students are always helpful creating study groups between each other and making group study guides or having study sessions outside of class.
Senior,4,"For the most part I enjoy California State San Bernardino. The professors are always willing to help you if you need it, there has been countless times professors helped me study for test or quizzes. The CSUSB community in  general is a family like community, meaning you can get along with pretty much everyone. The only thing I really dislike about it is that there is always construction going on, and sometimes class rooms are way  too hot."
Senior,4,"The faculty is great here at CSUSB. However there are not many classes available to take and even with priority registration they fill up pretty fast. They need to hire more professors and open up more class sections to improve their four year graduation rate. Also, opening up more diverse classes would be awesome so that we are better prepared for graduate school."
Sophomore,4,I like cal state san bernardino. It’s really diverse for the most part and everyone just minds there own business. When you talk to people they’re cool and friendly. You make friends pretty fast because everyone is nice and way to talk to for the most part.
Sophomore,4,The campus is really nice and if they're any questions that you may have someone on the campus always has an answer for you.
Junior,4,"Everyone, especially the staff is very friendly! I can see that the faculty genuinely cares about the education of their students. Very ""desert-like"" campus. Not super school spirited but it is very nice to see many people from many different backgrounds. Faculty and students are very inclusive and kind. Thanks to them I was able to get more involved with the school and learn what steps I have to take in order to follow my choice of career paths."
Freshman,4,I like the easy accessibility to resources and aids for students. I would like to see the structure of registration change.
Niche User,4,"I visited San Berbardino, and I really enjoyed my time on the campus. Everyone is so polite, and the atmosphere is so welcoming."
Alum,2,"I attended CSUSB for three years, and earned a bachelors in Nutrition Food Science. Although the topic was fascinating, the program was extremely dysfunctional. The program directors did not get along and unfortunately it affected the students. Additionally, there was not enough guidance for student. I would not recommend this program at CSUSB."
Freshman,2,"CSUSB has great activities ,but as someone who came to school just to study it hasn't been the greatest experience. Teachers are so dull."
College Sophomore,2,"I myself isn't in the drug scene, but just going to class or some school events you  can tell people have just drank or just did drugs. a lot of dorm students take part in it in their homes and the Greek parties are a major part in it. Peer pressure is always an issue anywhere I believe but no one gets caught or people in charge just don't really care until there's someone really in danger."
College Sophomore,2,I can almost never get the classes I want or need. I am always ending up with sometimes only one or two classes for the quarter and then just taking electives.
College Junior,2,"In my experiences this past year at my school, I have received a lot of notices or emails regarding crimes and robbery taking place in close proximity to my campus. This isn't easy to read about because I would like to feel safe walking around or near my campus especially if I have a night class. I do have an issue with our campus safety, however feel that the school does everything they can with the police to make it as safe as possible for the students."
College Freshman,2,The only issue I experienced is when the universities registration system does not recognize transfer classes for class requirements.  This has happen to me twice and the first time I almost lost the opportunity to register in a class that I was eligible from the beginning.
College Junior,2,The cost of living on campus is ridiculous but beneficial for students who do. The best part is priority registration.
College Junior,2,"When I initially started, things were a lot better. Supposedly, it's ""one of the safest college campuses in the nation"", and yet we're sent at least 2 notices a quarter about a robbery or sexual assault."
College Freshman,2,"Many crimes have happened, and I don't feel to safe during the night time. I do know that the campus is trying to decrease the crime rate, and make it a safer environment."
College Junior,2,"There have been many incidents throughout the year, such as robberies, being held at gunpoint, etc."
College Junior,2,Dorms are too small and not too clean.
College Freshman,2,"The career center definitely needs improvement. There were too many instances of appointments scheduled incorrectly, postponed appointments due to system or software malfunctions, and availability of appointments tended to be an issue. 

Professors had told me that my degree in math was valuable, but I wasn't aware of the need to specialize to improve job prospects. I was shocked to learn upon graduating that my degree didn't provide very many skills applicable to most jobs, and as a result, I needed to return to school for a master's degree in a different, more lucrative field. 

The only real interaction I get from the alumni network is an annual phone call asking me how my experience was at CSUSB and whether or not I'd like to donate to their scholarship fund. I haven't had much else in the way of interaction with the alumni network."
College Junior,2,It seems that I receive campus incidence reports relating to crime on a frequent basis. The campus surroundings is fairly dangerous especially at night. I do not feel safe walking alone to my car at night. I think the campus could do a better job by providing more campus police to keep students safe.
College Sophomore,2,"At our palm desert campus , we don't really have any athletic sports"
College Sophomore,2,Was never informed how to find anything
College Sophomore,2,Old dorms no place to live
College Sophomore,2,No houses not very big here
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few places to choose from. The food, other than Taco Bell, is extremely over priced, and it is VERY difficult to eat on campus and use your meal plan if you are vegetarian or vegan."
College Sophomore,2,San Bernardino is mostly filled with unhealthy fast food chains.
College Junior,2,I tried the rice and beans and there was no flavor whatsoever. They were completely tasteless.
College Freshman,2,Mainly its just pricey and not worth it...I rather live on campus
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many food places of shopping places around CSUSB unless you get on the freeway and go to the nearby mall. Most places directly around campus are chain fast food stores, and sketchy looking restaurants. A couple places, that aren't fast food chains, have B ratings."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid process at CSUSB is very stressful and difficult. Being a student-athlete made the process even more difficult because I had to go from Athletic offices all the way to the main Financial offices to try to clear things up. I would recommend direct deposit because the disbursements will be automatic, rather than waiting for a physical check because you will have to deal with the office ladies, who don't understand urgency."
College Freshman,2,The people in the financial aid office are rude! I had no idea what was going on  with my financial aid and they did not answer my questions to their ability!
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's not the apartment complex's fault, but the crime rate in the area is just terrible. I would not walk down the streets in the area at night."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I'm conflicted on this. Administration for the most part seem like well-meaning individuals who work here either because A) they're well compensated financially or B) they're working here until something better comes along. Most do seem to care about the students, but they seem at lost on how to really improve the university. There are so many levels of issues here that it's hard to place all the academic blame on the administration. For one the university is serving a niche student population of the Inland Empire. The students attending are not the best to begin with and thus struggle when they get here. The administration offers help through special programs, but results don't always follow. I could see the administrators becoming jaded over time at the lack of improvement. Thus things are left as they are and things stay stagnant."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The demographics of the Inland Empire along with the size of the campus equates to you seeing the same type of people over and over. You must be involved in Greek life, or know someone in it, if you want to participate with other students. You might be better off finding a group of friends to party with in LA bars/nightclubs. There's at least more diversity and class there."
College Senior,2,It was not a good process.
College Freshman,2,I don't know anything about a Greek life on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The employees are terrible at what they keep track of. My girlfriend asked if there's anything else she needs to do to drop out of college and the office employee tells her that the administration will take care of it. However, they did nothing and my girlfriend called a month later to check up only to find out she now owes a debt to the school because there was a problem with her financial aid, prompting her decisions to drop school. Now after she called, another office employee started blaming my girlfriend for her actions and insinuating everything is her fault.

Also, when calling about a certain topic the office employee usually transfers your call to a another department. However, when your call is transferred, that employee from that department tries to transfer you back over to the same department you called first. There is lack of communication from employees, and largely delays a student's time from getting things done."
College Freshman,2,Scary don't venture off campus too far
College Freshman,2,I did not receive any financial aid
College Junior,2,"All we have are fast food places and many Mexican food places. It would be nice to have a panera, chipotle, or even an in n out close by. It just makes eating healthy very difficult."
College Freshman,2,"Well to start there was an error in my application, which cost me to not get any financial support from financial aid. Luckly I qualify for a 250 dollars scholarship in my high school. But beside that I didn't got anything even do have the grades and the necessity."
College Senior,2,"If i'm being perfectly honest, some of the psychology classes are hard as hell. I have so many Cs that my GPA dropped 2 points. i dont even have a B average anymore and i overstress myself out each and every quarter which always causes my lupus to flare."
Recent Alumnus,2,The campus dining is ok but there aren't a lot of options and you have to eat dinner earlyif you plan on eating on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,There isn't a lot around and if you want to find any real nightlife then it is probably in LA.
College Junior,2,"Off- campus dining is very difficult due to the location of our school. I am a bit of a health nut so trying to stay away from fast food places with processed foods can be very difficult for me, therefore I bring my own food to school to eat on campus. Although, when I do not bring food packed from home it is very inconvenient for me to grab a bite off- campus that is fairly close to school. Fresh foods such a Panera Bread, In-N-Out Burger, or an organic spot can be miles away from campus making it very difficult to grab food off- campus in between classes. As well as the cost of foods closest to campus are not such a great price either and student discounts are not given out nearby. For me, the best place near campus is the Starbucks and Yogurtland, but even then I still have to get into my car and sit through some traffic to get something from there."
College Senior,2,there are no clubs/bars nearby
College Sophomore,2,There are not many activities and there isn't a sense of community.
College Sophomore,2,The 215 Freeway is under construction and the road is very bumpy with many car accidents with no shoulders. It has many traffic buildups.
College Freshman,2,"We try to stay in at night, the crimes at San Bernardino are no joke."
College Senior,2,There is nothing particularly good off campus... the typical assortment of fast food and diners.
College Senior,2,Nothing near campus. Most stuff is far from here and inaccessible without a car.
College Senior,2,Nothing much around for entertainment or food. There is not anything significant near campus.
College Senior,2,"There is a variety, but the public safety is horrible."
College Junior,2,"The campus always feels safe, but there have been times where issues have arose and the cops get there quickly and respond quickly."
College Freshman,2,The wind can be a drag.
College Freshman,2,"The wind is horrible, feels like the wind is going take us with it."
College Junior,2,"more access would promote more healthy people, students and staff."
College Junior,2,"As a vegetarian there are very few options and those that are here are the same day in and day out, plus very expensive.  "
College Sophomore,2,I don't get any financial aid from the school. I'm living off of government unsubsidized loans. 
College Sophomore,2,School scholarships are very picky. 
College Freshman,2,"Barely any Greek organizations, it is difficult to get into a frat party if you are not greek.Greeks are not allowed to post letters outside their homes."
College Freshman,2,i didnt recieve any grants just loans.
College Junior,2,"The people are nice if you live by the school. We're in the 909 so there's a lot of safety concerns but if you are by campus the police drive around so you're good. As I said center of fast food, no great restaurants, no nightlife."
College Senior,2,It's not super strict about social life although it is a dry campus.
College Senior,2,Traffic is terrible whenever classes get out and you pretty much need a car because of how far just about everything is from campus. 
College Junior,2,NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE ARE INTO THE SPORTS UNLESS THEY KNOW SOMEONE PLAYING IN THEM.
Recent Alumnus,2,I hear allot people talk about it and have smelled mj a few times by the classes
College Sophomore,1,We don't have housing at the Palm desert campus
College Sophomore,1,People get attacked almost every night very unsafe
College Sophomore,1,"I have a 4.0 GPA, and I was not able to receive anything but loans from the state. I cannot afford loans, or this campus after this year without scholarships, due to out of state tuition."
College Freshman,1,"They need student discounts, healthier options, prices are just too high for college students. Especially for the ones who have a hard time trying to get a job and never hired."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Same chain of restaurants, i.e. McDonald's, KFC, etc. Be careful going to these places at night. San Bernardino has a high crime rate. Recent on campus carjackings and homeless wandering proves my point."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The dining hall serves the same mundane food every day. It lacks variety and food often look unappetizing and taste bland. A close comparison would be a hospital cafeteria. The alternative fast food options is the same as a mall food court, i.e. Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Fried Chicken Strips, etc. Expect to pay around $8 - $10 a plate. You would be better off bringing food from home."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is no sense of community on this campus, even at the campus housing level. It is a commuter school that does not place much emphasis on building a community of proud students. Students treat attending school as a chore and avoid housing or staying on campus in general. A possible factor is the low socio-economic status of the area."
College Junior,1,"I don't receive anything according to the school and fastfa. I go though high stress anxiety about how Im going to afford school each quarter. i get 5000 for the whole year in loans from the government i have to payback, and that does not even cover me for the whole year. I have to work two jobs just to pay the rest of my tuition."
College Student,1,Not much for student life.
College Freshman,1,It has been really difficult for me to be able to receive scholarships or even apply because sometimes I don't have the resources required to apply.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life that I know of.
College Junior,1,campus is remotely located in a city with high criminal activity.... access to off campus resources can be risky especially at night.
College Junior,1,"little communication on campus about it, if you do not know someone you are out of luck."
College Sophomore,1,There aren't many night life area on campus. 
College Junior,1,"We live in a food desert which means it is mainly Taco Bell and McDonalds. If you want healthy theres El Pollo Loco, other than that  you have to go to Redlands or Fontana. As someone with Celiac Disease, the only options around are Red Robin in Redlands and Red Brick Pizza inFontana. "
Recent Alumnus,1,It is so windy at this school. I have came to campus and have almost fallen over because of the strong winds. 
College Junior,1,"I have had to pay parking, per quarter 102$. Since I started going to CSUSB, I have just accepted the cost and did nothing to protest against it. Not until recently, did I have a real problem with parking. The school is strict on permits and giving out tickets, there are cameras everywhere, especially in the parking structures. We have a police station on campus, and they are there to ""protect"" us, but my car was broken into, and over $1000 dollars worth of stuff was taken unnoticed. The officers basically said that there was nothing they could do, so I was just supposed to accept it and move on. The school doesn't hesitate to hound us for our money, but can't protect us from outsiders? Now I have a problem."
College Senior,1,it is expensive! it is very inconvenient! i do not park there at all
College Freshman,1,Don't live on campus but I have seen the dorms and would never live there 
Recent Alumnus,1,"Are you kidding me? Additional $100 to park at the school I already pay tuition for? No incentives available for students who opt for greener options such as bicycles, public transport or walk. During rush hour at CSUSB 11:30 a.m - 2 p.m parking is impossible. Parking should be free!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Majority of students, including myself are unaware of events through out the city. Absolutely nothing to do in the city for interacting with students from other campuses. As a matter of fact, we all leave the city to mingle with other students. "
College Senior,1,Its a dead area especially considering its near a university. It should be more alive with special sales and deals for college students at restaurants and stores nearby. Also companys that cater to college students should expand near to the university. I have been attending my school for 5 years now and there isn't much offered for nightlife for the students. My friends usually drive out 30 mins and beyond for fun events. My campus tries to create a fun social community environment for students but its a commuter campus so only the same groups of students  in clubs and Greek organizations attend.
College Junior,1,"The housing needs to change things. I lived there 1 quarter and needed to leave because of all the issues and complete lack of culture and an inviting environment. prices are also too high. Campus police also need to calm down, When I lived there it seemed they were always busting down my door to find people smoking their medical marijuana, it's college, it's legal... Chill out."
College Junior,1,"CSUSB is a commuter school and San Bernardino reflects that. There isn't much to do at CSUSB or in San Bernardino. if you choose live on campus have a car or but if you don't have a car then get involved with a club on campus because that is where all the excitment is. The campus is pretty much dead on the weekends, mainly because most of the people who live on campus go home and most of campus is closed anyway. Great news is on the horizon though because there is a little performing arts theater on campus and they put on shows for $5, there is also two game rooms on campus, a couple big ticketed events like comedians, concerts, movies, or shows."
College Sophomore,1,"Teams are awesome, but no advertisment for events until the night of the event, there are few community members who show to events either and that is the best part, this school needs to reevaluate how it works with the community and become much more involved with inviting community members onto campus for these events."
College Junior,1,There really is not much near campus. The area nearby isn't great either. Not many attractions. Although it is only an hour from LA where there are plenty of attractions.
College Junior,1,"Even though we have baseball, soccer, volleyball and basketball they are not a big deal here. Sports are defiantly over looked."
College Freshman,1,"Sign up for earlier classes if you want the best parking.  For those of us who like to roll into our day with 10:40 am classes or later, we must fight for a parking spot.  And even then, it is sure to be at an inconvenient distance from class."
College Sophomore,1,"I really was looking forward to pledging in college. However, the greeks here, have really bad names for themselves. I rarely hear about who is doing what good in the community. I almost always hear of who slept with who and how drunk they were. That is Females and Males."
College Senior,1,Parking is rarely available. You need at least 30 mins before your class to get a spot
College Sophomore,1,"Greek Paying for Friends – I must say, it seems as if those who join CSUSB at my school are those those who may have trouble naturally making friends. Sororities girls are among the prettier girls at school. I feel like greek life at my school are just those who pay for friends. I also don't see them doing many cool activities or contributing to the school or community in any way. For all of this, I am giving them a D"
College Junior,1,"There Is a Bar on Campus – Although most students consider this a pro, i consider it a con. Alcholol is a depressant, which means that it can become addicting to students with low self esteem, students who are facing difficulty with their grades or their personal life and many other reasons. Having a bar on campus can lead the outside community to believe that our school does not care about their students drinking and driving. I have witnessed a few students go sneak shots on their breaks and come back to class , followed by driving home after class. Also, the fwy that most students take to go home is under construction at this time, and you can clearly see many tire marks on the pavement which i would not doubt them to be from our college students who have had a visit to the bar. Other than alcohol, the drug safety on campus is excellent. And there have recently been changes on campus assigning certain areas for cigarret smoking."
College Junior,1,Permit Costs – The permit costs are ridiculously high. As of right now for one quarter it is $104. I came to this campus four years ago when the prices were $64. It's awful to think that the prices will continue to go up. Ticketing as remained the same $45. Parking spaces are limited.
College Senior,1,"Unique Qualities – Our school has managed to adpot a new game system in our Student Union as well as new touch screen vending machines. However, they have decreased the amount of free scantrons that they give to students as well as charge them for pencils. I personally don't understand why we get to have such high quality technology but are deprived of our academic resources."
College Sophomore,1,"Like all universities, parking is always a disaster and such a hassle!"
College Sophomore,1,I do not receive financial aid because I am a middle class student and aid is only available to those who make less money.
College Sophomore,1,"I Dont Believe in the Greeks – I feel its very demonic, because when your pledging all the cruel things you have to do are not safe and your big brothers/ sisters think they are your new GOD."
College Junior,1,There is not enough parking on campus. There needs to be a parking structure on campus cause I am sick of taking 30 minutes out of my day to find parking.
College Junior,1,"CSUSB Is Too Strict – CSUSB has MANY MANY MANY rules. Living on campus is sometimes somewhat rediculous with it's rules. Things like No smoking by the dorms or apartments. We have a DRY campus yet, we have a Pub that serves beer in the Student Union. If you are 21 you SHOULD be able to drink in your apartment. Parking passes cost too much and visitors should have free overnight passes instead of having to pay for them."
College Sophomore,1,"The food isn't that good on campus. There's not much selection, and what they do have tend to be very greasy. I am a healthy eater, and I'd like it if they had more healthy options."

Senior,5,While transitioning online throughout the pandemic the switch to online classes has been an easy process thanks to the amazing professors and faculty members at Husson. They have given us the opportunity to learn just as we would in class but now it is online.
Senior,5,"I am a senior here at Husson and I have loved every single moment I have spent hear on campus. The classes are perfectly balanced and the professors are extremely welcoming and understanding. I also am involved in different clubs and organizations on campus which is a great way to understand the campus and to gain friendships. Overall, I am extremely pleased with my choice to go to Husson and have a network of options when graduating in May."
Senior,5,"My degree has some online classes and I had an enjoyable experience with all of them. I am the type of student where I prefer to be in person as much as possible, but I really liked my online classes. I did not feel like being online prevented me from interacting with my professors. All my instructors were very accessible both in person during office hour and online (zoom or email) which I found very helpful!"
Senior,5,One reason I love Husson so much is the small classes allowed me to form a one on one relationship not only with my classmates but all my instructors as well. My instructors know my name and my hobbies which helped me feel comfortable to approach them outside of class in the hallways. I also love how all my instructors are experienced professionals in the field and are teaching me current industry standards that I can employ when I graduate. Husson is definitely a small school with a big atmosphere!
Senior,5,"Online classes are as smooth as possible thanks to the hard working Husson staff! Classes are still as hands on as possible, and professors still stay involved with your learning."
Senior,5,"Husson has the friendliest community, the cutest (and most safe) campus, and the best staff you could ever ask for. Professors genuinely care about you, you aren't just another face in the crowd. Husson gives you real hands on experience as early as possible, which I absolutely love! Plenty of fun happenings every week, so you're never bored. Ultimately, the opportunities are endless. I couldn't imagine myself at any other school."
Freshman,5,"The entire process from admissions, to financial aid office has been a wonderful experience.  Every department has been extremely helpful."
Freshman,5,I begin my freshman year this upcoming fall.  All the professors have been extremely helpful up to now.
Junior,5,I love Husson University so much! All the professors are amazing and I really love the small classes because it allows me to engage and ask questions when I need to.
Junior,5,Online learning is great at Husson! All the professors are great at communication what needs to be done and when.
Senior,5,"I love Husson. I've been attending since 2016, and have not had many bad experiences here. The professors are very helpful and will open up their office hours to accommodate your schedule. The classroom sizes are perfect for my particular learning style, and I feel like I can be myself here."
Sophomore,5,It was a smooth transition into online learning during the covid pandemic. The sites used are very easy to navigate on the student end you always know when things are due.
Sophomore,5,"I have had a great time here so far. The classes are a little difficult at first but its not overwhelming. I had felt like there was no campus life at first, but I came to see there is a lot of great activities they do, you just have to utilize them."
Junior,5,"The classes are absolutely amazing!  The teachers are great at 1v1 training and the workload is really lenient!  You are also surrounded by an amazing student community; everyone is so accepting of who you are!  On the topic, there are a huge amount of programs/clubs you can get into there; everyone has a spot wherever on campus!"
Junior,5,"All students that have never taken an online class will usually tell you not too, but, in Husson's case, the online programs are not only really fun, but we learn as much if not more then what we learn in class.  The workload is just right and the teachers are very understanding even through technology."
Sophomore,5,"My online classes went very well with Husson, If you put the time into your classes, you will learn a ton in return!"
Sophomore,5,I love the community at Husson. People are very friendly and the food is good! When I'm at Husson I call it my home.
Sophomore,5,Husson University is a really great school with lots of resources for everyone! My first year was very welcoming!
Freshman,5,"Overall my experience with Husson University is great! I don't live on campus, but I know people who do and love it! I highly recommend joining clubs, sports, and activities if you're worried about not making friends. It's a really good way to put yourself out there and meet new people. The food is really great. The campus is one big circle so you can't get lost!"
Freshman,5,All the people are really nice and helpful.  The proffesors and staff are great and understanding of different situations.  There could be a wider variety of cuisine and more healthy choices for entrees.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the environment, and I feel as though I am connected very well to the university. I have made many friends, and through playing soccer, have had a great experience on and off campus. It is close to home, and still far enough away that I am able to grow as a person individually, but am able to go home when necessary. Husson is a great fit for me!"
Freshman,5,"The professors are really nice, they'll work with you on a problem. all the other students are friendly, you can tell that everyone actually likes being there."
Sophomore,5,"Husson University is a very good school. They seem to always be looking to improve, and always look upon their students to get the feedback on how to make the school better. They always put their students first, with them caring about their safety, with several free physical safety and mental health resources for students to use. In general, professors are very open to helping students with learning material, with the student's success always being in mind."
Sophomore,5,"This upcoming semester will be the Spring Semester of my Sophomore year. My time at Husson University has been amazing. From the start I have made an abundance of new friends, had a healthy experience with my professors and work load in classes. The food is great, there are a ton of opportunities to make your own mark on campus: including clubs, sports, and opportunities to welcome New and Interested Students giving everyone a great personal experience."
Freshman,5,Husson University is very welcoming and are always willing to help. The campus is so small that each professor takes the time to get to know you and know your name. All the professors want you to succeed and are willing to help in any way they can.
Freshman,5,I like how it's a welcoming community and they always make sure everyone is safe on campus. I am not sure how they can change.
Freshman,5,All of the staff that I have met so far have been so pleasant and the students are so helpful. I have really enjoyed the campus as it is beautiful and small so there is little to no chance of getting lost.
Freshman,5,"Currently I am a freshman at Husson University and I would say it has been the best school experience ever. I love how small the campus is, especially because you get to see a lot of familiar faces. The professors are also very educated which makes it so much easier to learn the material. I am in the Criminal Justice field and I would say learning from all these professors is so much easier because you can learn about their experiences as well as textbook information."
Freshman,5,"The teachers truly care about our success and giving us every opportunity and resource to succeed. Its a small and safe campus, its very clean and classy. It is a very beautiful campus and it has safe and clean dorms as well."
Niche User,5,Husson is a small campus with a community feel like the town in which I grew up. The dorms are nice and the food is excellent. There is a lot to do in the local area and it is close enough that I can go home if I want to.
Sophomore,5,"Husson University is a college where you are truly able to grow. I have had nothing but the best experiences with faculty members, and other students on Campus. It feels like home here because everyone is so friendly and supportive, plus the food is AMAZING!"
Senior,5,Husson is an overall fantastic school. I would recommend it to anyone who is pursuing a career while wanting to have a good college experience.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy pursuing my post-secondary education at Husson University because of the atmosphere of this school. There is a unified community spirit among students, professors, and other members of the staff here that makes me feel truly at home no matter where I am on campus. Husson is a great school that offers fantastic educational and recreational activities at a very reasonable price point."
Freshman,5,"Husson University is an amazing school. My favorite part about it is the student to teacher ratio. Every class I have had, my teacher knows my first and last name, and even knows other things about me. My biggest class was around 35 students, but the teacher still knew every student’s name in the class. The professors and all of the staff at Husson University are always willing to help you with anything, whether you need help finding something around the campus or if it’s help with homework, they will help you even if they do not have you in class. 


The residence hall I lived in at Husson was very quiet, which made it easy to study and sleep. I have heard about how other campuses are and I think that Husson is one of the quietest campuses. There is also very high campus security that will escort you from the parking lot to your dorm if it is dark, and they are always willing to lend a helping hand if it’s needed. Husson University is an awesome school all around!"
Graduate Student,5,I attended and graduated from the RN to BSN online program.  Overall it’s was a great experience.  Professors are attentive and grading fair.
Niche User,5,"I have not attended Husson University yet, but am planning on attending next year. I am currently in two of their online classes and the teachers are very helpful and organized. The campus is nice and most of the teachers are patient and willing too offer help when needed."
Junior,5,"Husson University is a small private school, so you get a lot more one-on-one with professors. The smaller campus size also makes it so that you end up having classes with a lot of the same students which makes it easy to make friends and study buddies"
Niche User,5,"I love Husson University as an entire campus. They are just like they are during the tour as they are during the school year. if you want a small school and do not mind the cold, then I would recommend Husson."
Freshman,5,"Husson University has always been a school I dreamed to attend after high school. The staff and kids are great, and the program I am applying for is the best at Husson."
Freshman,5,I've never been so happy. In the past I struggled to have people in my life that I always loved to be around and I would always know would support me. Then I got on campus for preseason and I found these relationships almost instantly. I found people on my team and on campus that I really wish to be a part of my life forever. I've had so many incredible experiences in the first two weeks and it only took about two nights for Husson to feel like my second home because of all the amazing people here. The professors try so hard to help you and see you succeed. The security is incredible and they are always ready to help anyone in any situation. The campus is beautiful and you never have to go that far to get somewhere. I love just about everything about this University except for one thing that really isn't that big of a problem. I'm on the track team and this school doesn't have a track to practice on. This still never made me think that Husson wasn't the perfect school for me.
Graduate Student,5,"I absolutely love Husson. I have had the best experience here, amazing professors and advisers. I love having the flexibility to have online classes and being able to meet with my instructors via Zoom and the understand their students have different needs and will help them along the way."
Sophomore,5,The classes are small so you can form a nice relationship with the professor and its a small campus as well. Just a nice school.
Niche User,5,I absolutely love everything about Husson University. The professors and staff are beyond helpful and kind. The campus is extremely well taken care of. My favorite part about Husson is the dining hall.
Senior,5,"At Husson University, you are more than just a number. The professors are always willing to help you with anything you may need, and the class sizes are small so you are able to get to know your peers. There is always something going on around campus, and everyone encourages you to get involved."
Junior,5,Attending Husson has been a life changing experience for me. I never thought I'd be able to fit in so easily and enjoy what I'm learning. I don't know what I would do if I did not meet the people I have or make the connections I did. It's the perfect university to attend if you need the one on one contact with professors and other students.
Freshman,5,"Husson is a great, welcoming environment. Everyone is so helpful and nice. The professors are very helpful and always willing to help you and make sure you're successful."
Niche User,5,"I've applied to several other colleges and accepted to all of them, however Husson really stood out to me. Husson was one of two private colleges I applied to, and I knew after visiting, that Husson was the place for me. The size really applied to me; I really liked how personal it felt. I've done my research about the program and the definitely know what they are doing. Just an amazing facility and I look forward to attending."
Freshman,5,"Great small community college...good teacher to student ratio, and the price is right! Great housing accommodations, great food choices and plans to make a college experience that works for you!"
Sophomore,5,"Great school, with small class sizes! Teachers are always more than willing to help with academic success, and future goals. I transferred to Husson, after a bad experience elsewhere, and by far the best choice I ever made!"
Freshman,5,"Husson University is a great school with an amazing atmosphere that helps you be the best that you can be. The professors are great and willing to help you in any way that they can. Every member of Husson University including staff and students all are very welcoming, making it a great fit for anyone. The campus size is also a plus, with the campus not being too big or too small you are able to easily fit right it and feel as if you belong there. Everyone at Husson University is very friendly which definitely helps you adjust to college life."
Graduate Student,5,"I really liked the small, close knit community. It helps in building connections with your professors and colleagues. I would recommend this school to anyone looking to pursue a graduate level degree."
Freshman,5,"Husson is an amazing school. The food is amazing, staff is helpful. Diversity is important and they have a lot of it!"
Sophomore,5,What I like about Husson is the over all atmosphere. It's big enough to feel like you're living in your own but small enough to not feel overwhelmed by living on your own for a little bit. The professors are extremely helpful and strive to see you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"Everyone is so kind, the teachers a brilliant, and the food is awesome! Everyone is super involved with school spirit. I've only been a student one year, but I feel I know everyone and am never in danger."
Sophomore,5,"I would say Husson is really great in terms of academics as well as the friendliness of everyone on campus. It is very rare to find such a school with the faculty members and the students close to each other. Unlike other schools, you can just drop by any office and ask any questions or concerns if you see people in the office and they are always willing to help everyone."
Junior,5,I enjoyed the small classes allowing for more one on one with the professor. I enjoyed the smaller campus and being in touch with the community.
Freshman,5,"Husson University is a small private non profit University situated in Bangor,Maine. The university is a very peaceful one which is very advantageous to learning. Due to it being a small university, it creates a very friendly and active community. The teachers and professors are always ready and willing to help a student. For every sixteen students there is one teacher available. This facilitates communication between teachers and students. Plus, the food is good!"
Graduate Student,5,The campus is just the right size.  The staff are very friendly and willing to help.  The class sizes are good also.  I would change the curriculum so that all classes are offered online and in class.
Freshman,5,"I currently attend this school. As a veteran, they have been nothing but helpful. The small class sizes are better, giving you more personal interactions with your professors. This makes understanding the material much easier and less stressful."
College Student,5,"So far, being at Husson University has been amazing. My school is unique to me in a sense that it feels like home. At first, moving three hours away to school wasn't ideal, but if I had to pick a college all over again it would without a doubt be Husson I chose. Everyone here is very friendly and always willing to help. Class sizes are small, and you're truly more than just a number."
Senior,4,Classes got switched to online and the professors did a great job. All my classes were done in a way that were understandable and the professors were very helpful if anyone had questions.
Senior,4,"Nice small school, great programs. The professors are very helpful. Wish it was a bit more affordable, but for a private college it's not as costly as it could be."
Senior,4,"I've had mostly a positive experience with the online format of Husson. One class the professor wasn't good at communicating, but overall it's been a very positive experience"
Freshman,4,Husson was actually a good experience had fun a little boring sometimes because didn’t have no where to go and I also didn’t have a car but other then that it’s a good place to learn
Freshman,4,The online was ok she helped me a lot and better understand but I started getting confused because of the covid but other then that I learned things
Graduate Student,4,"Excellent transition to online courses, especially when COVID protocols kicked in. They made an extremely quick turn around in a high-demand time. They made it look effortless and it minimally impacted our course timeline. They showed attentiveness to our needs and were responsive to emails in a prompt matter."
Freshman,4,I enjoy how small but effective the campus is. The teachers are very nice and all the workers are very friendly.
Junior,4,"It’s a great small community, good if you like small schools. All the professors are really nice, and they take time to help you through the classes if you need the help."
Sophomore,4,I will be going into my 4th semester at Husson. The food and the campus community have been delightful! I just wish campus wasn’t a little more organized so I didn’t have to runhalf way across campus to make it to my class in 10 mins🤦‍♀️
Freshman,4,"It's a small but beautiful community. All the professors are very nice. There are many clubs and events going on in the campus, i believe no-one will get bored. The halls and the food is also very nice. I specially like the egg salad from Cressy. I would like to see more international students in the college, so that it is more diversified."
Sophomore,4,"I really like how small this campus is. I also like the class sizes, which are at most 25-30 people. The professors really want to see you succeed, and are more helpful for one-on-one than bigger colleges/universities."
Senior,4,I really like my teachers at husson. Although I didn't receive the financial help or assistance I had hoped for.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy how small the university is, it was easy to find my classes when I first moved here on campus."
Junior,4,"The faculty and staff at Husson University are very friendly and try their best to help each student succeed. However, the cost of housing is expensive."
Graduate Student,4,"I really enjoyed the student-to-teacher ratio. It was very small, making it easier to get to know and develop relationships with my professors. I would like to see more things to do in student life. They already have quite a bit going on, like intramurals and fun events on weekends, but I think that the events could be amped up a little more."
Freshman,4,"I like Husson University because it is a small school, it is safe, and the program I am in is top notch.  I wish there was a larger fitness facility because it always seems packed with student/athletes and there never seems to be enough room for students who just like to stay in shape.  It would also be great to be able to shoot hoops and have a place to do that.  The food is great!  I wish there were more activities on campus and more diversity."
Sophomore,4,"If you are looking for a small school with lots of opportunity, Husson University is the right place.  Because the school is so small, class sizes are small, which means teachers and students can get to know you by name.  The staff and faculty are also extremely friendly. I was roaming around, just lost one day, and a random professor asked if he could help me--so, as I said, the staff is super friendly. The campus itself is quiet and close to town, which is great when you need to run to the store to pick something up."
Junior,4,The small class sizes allowed me to interact more closely with my professors which allowed me to learn better and improved my success.
Sophomore,4,"Husson has overall been a good experience. The campus is quiet on the weekend but there's a lot to do in the area. There are plenty of places to go if you enjoy being outdoors, fishing etc."
Sophomore,4,"The physical therapy program, along with the other health related programs are exceptional. The grounds are clean and the buildings are nice and relatively new. The campus seems to be expanded. The only issue is that some of the population seems to be unfocused on college and succeeded."
Niche User,4,"I went to Husson University multiple times for sports. Their campus is amazing; very nice field, dorm and school."
Sophomore,4,There are some living things that need to be taken care of but other than that it's good. I would recommend a visit if possible to see if the school is right for you.
Freshman,4,"As a first-year student, Husson University is just what I hoped to be. The tight-knit community and the cultural diversity are very prominent the minute you step onto campus. Whether it's Cultural Diversity night, or other on-campus activities such as Karaoke or Bowling, it's always a fun time. Not only is the cultural diversity prominent in the community, but in the dining services as well. The dining hall specializes in expanding our tastes in food. Each meal they incorporate a new ""foreign"" dish, such as Gyro sandwiches, along with other Chinese, Indian, and Western meals. It gives me an incredible insight on other cultures other than my own. Not only this, but the staff here are incredibly helpful as well. When I first applied, I was so set on Psychology as my major. Upon self reflection, I realized it wasn't for me and Occupational Therapy was calling my name. My advisors, professors, and peers helped make my transition incredibly smooth and easy."
Freshman,4,"I like the overall environment that Husson has all over campus, it is very friendly and open. The courses are all pretty great and most of the professors are good at what they teach."
Senior,4,"I enjoy the location in Presque Isle. The staff are great, but I wish the access to more online classes were available."
Junior,4,"I love Husson, I loved it when I first went there and I love it now with continuing my education. The professors are willing to work with especially if you are a commuter like I am and work a full time job trying to get your degree to better your life. The college is very welcoming to anyone and everyone, it is very diverse the sororities and fraternities do a great job with fund raising. The student government does a really good job with hosting events for the students to be able to get involved with. A good all around college to go to."
Sophomore,4,"Husson is a very hands on college where you feel like home. There are plenty of students where you also meet new people, but you can walk around and see familiar faces. Classes are small and allow teachers to really know and focus on each student."
Sophomore,4,"For the most part, a great school. Diverse but tight knit community feeling to Husson because it's not a huge campus- you really get to know a lot of people and form bonds with professors. I have yet to find a professor that isn't accommodating or helpful when needed. The food is good and we have a few different options for dining centers. Dorms need some updating and the cost of tuition is very high. If you're looking for a party school this is NOT it, security and RA's in the dorms are very strict on rules regarding alcohol, loudness, etc."
Niche User,4,"Husson is very friendly and welcoming. Their facilities, such as their football field and their food, are very good."
Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman at Husson University right now, but I already love it here. The environment is friendly and welcoming. Professors are patient and will help you with anything you're struggling with."
Senior,4,"This will be my fourth year attending Husson University. It may be a small school, but there are plenty of fun things to do in the area. There are a lot of things about Husson that I enjoy like attending sporting events to watching the sunset on the lawn; However, I enjoy the small classes the most. It allows for great one on one opportunities with professors and they are all hands on. All of the professors have an extensive background in their field which is great because they can help prepare you for what you may encounter in your future profession."
Freshman,4,"The food is AMAZING here. The dining center is top notch and includes vegetarian/vegan options, as well as a salad bar with a made to order sandwich bar (think subway), dessert area, a grill bar (hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken sandwiches), and two meal areas. They also have pretty sweet breakfast. I just wished the hours were open longer!
There's also an attached gas-station like store where you can buy things like cereal, ramen and to-go dinners with dining dollars. They even have a cafe and another marketplace in the Peabody building next door.

You could say I liked the food the most here. The teachers are here to help, and even if you can't skip a whole lot of classes, you will actually learn here. Office hours, people! The library has a fantastic system for borrowing scientific papers, too. They have one fraternity and three different sororities. tons of clubs and exchange student opportunities. You won't regret being here."
Freshman,4,"I like the small community but the tuition is pretty high. The food is pretty inconsistent, someyimes something is good and then the next time it tastes totally different."
Graduate Student,4,"I chose Husson because I was looking for a small school, and that's exactly what you get here. It's super small and it seems like there is never anything going on on campus. Not only that but though the food isn't very good either. I'm still glad I chose Husson. there are times where I wish I had chosen differently, but I think overall I was happy with my experience."
Freshman,4,I love it! It really feels like a second home. Everyone is friendly and the professors are mostly down to earth. Great nursing program!
Freshman,4,"What I really like about Husson is it's small campus size. Coming in as a Freshman I was very nervous but I met a lot of great people and made a solid friend group. The classes are relatively small, with most classes being only 25 students at most. The instructors/professors are really friendly and are willing to help you succeed in their classes. Another thing nice about the classes is that they can be very one-on-one with the instructor. Husson also has a really good financial aid program and are willing to help you in anyway possible with your bills."
Freshman,4,"Husson University creates a personalized and innovative community for their students. The campus is small enough to provide individualized attention to each student, yet are still able to foster a dynamic and diverse environment."
Graduate Student,4,"Great academics, great community, great people! Highly recommended. Could improve student communication with student accounts and financial aid, but in the end they get it done!"
Freshman,4,I have had a great experience here so far. The people here are super nice and the professors care about you. The college is located just minutes away from mall and other attractions. There are always a ton of student activities going on. During the weekend the various sport have games that are always fun to go see. I feel very safe here and security is super nice. On top of everything the food is also pretty good. They have a ton of variety and plenty of opportunity to try new things. The goal here is to be given a quality education at a reasonable price.
Freshman,4,"The professors are friendly and easy to talk to. The course load can be tough, but classes aren't too long so you have plenty of time to get things done."
Junior,4,The campus always has stuff to do for students that commute and live on campus. The professors really care about their students and are very helpful.
Freshman,4,"I am a college freshman at Husson University. I am a Criminal Justice Major and I love this school. They have a great staff, a fun student life, and great academics. Overall this college is a great one and I personally love it."
Junior,4,"I am currently a junior at Husson University in Bangor, Maine. I am enrolled in the five-year Acccounting & MBA program. So far, I have loved my experience at Husson. There are plenty of opportunities for students to apply for internships and full-time jobs. The professors are very nice and they are willing to work with students to help them achieve their goals. A lot of the professors have connections with businesses in the real world, which makes it easier to find jobs. The campus is a safe environment and is located in the beautiful city of Bangor, Maine. I would definitely recommend Husson University to prospective students."
College Student,4,"Being a member of the softball team here at Husson, I would say it's easy to tell sports are a big part of everyone's lives here. The facilities are very well maintained, and respected by both athletes and non-athletes. Our football team has a great new turf complex, where baseball and track also practice. People are welcome to use any facility even if they aren't part of a team, as long as they are respectful to the surroundings. There's always a student section at any game, and people are supporting their fellow classmates."
College Freshman,4,"It is very clean, rooms are decent sized. The laundry room is in the basement though, which can be a little weird. And I wish there were private bathrooms or showers."
College Freshman,4,"The athletic teams, coaches, and facilities are great. The athletes take pride in what they do, and they share that pride with the student body."
College Freshman,4,"This school is very passionate about the topics that are being taught. The class sizes are small, thus making it easier for the professors to know every student and help them with any struggles they might have."
College Freshman,4,The professors are very approachable and the campus is lively.
College Freshman,4,The alumni network work hard to help students with potential placements in internships. The career center is always available for a number of things including mock interviews as well as resume managing.
College Freshman,4,"I was lucky enough to get into the suites my first year, which was very nice. There is enough space and I loved making friends with the people on my floor. My RA's were awesome with planning floor events such as Easter egg hunts and other cool events."
College Freshman,4,"Some fraternities and sororities put on shows and dinners. Last year one of the sororities held a ball, which was fun. There really isn't a lot of pressure to join Greek life but if you want to you can."
College Freshman,4,"Some fun events are put on by the sports teams. There are themed dinners held in the cafeteria, dances, and other fun events."
College Freshman,4,"I am sure my degree will assist me greatly in my career goals, just wished a higher degree was offered at Husson."
College Freshman,4,"I would definitely chose Husson again if I was in the situation again! Its a wonderful school, and I cannot wait to succeed in my secondary education!"
College Student,4,"I'm a commuter, so I don't live on campus, but I know that the dorms are well- maintained."
College Student,4,The community is supportive and the professors want you to succeed.
College Freshman,4,I don't know too much about this topic yet.
College Freshman,4,The courses are great and the professors are awesome and always willing to take you under their wing and help in any way they can.
College Freshman,4,It's pretty secure and safe.
College Freshman,4,"I love the sports, and the students are always supportive!"
College Freshman,2,"Depending on where you live, it's okay. The bathrooms are gross and people don't clean up after themselves. The dorms need to be updated. It's not somewhere I would choose to live."
College Freshman,2,Small cliquey sororities and fraternities. Only 3 sororities and 2 fraternities on campus
College Freshman,2,"Literally nothing to do, student activities tries but doesnt succeed. Very boring small school in the middle of nowhere."
College Junior,2,"There are very few parties on campus.  Most people go off campus to party.  If there are parties, they typically are just a small gathering in a suite or maybe a few people in a room."
College Junior,2,Not many parties take place on campus.
College Junior,2,Greek life is not seen as cool and is known for bad partying and hazing.
College Junior,2,"While there are maybe two programs I have not heard horrible things about, every other program makes many things difficult for students. Financial aid also does not ""aid"" students as they should financially or customer service wise. The university does not care about their students and it is very obvious. However, the student body is not bad and not every program is horrible."
College Freshman,2,"There is a lot of hype about the job/internship ""opportunities"" but it doesn't go past one or two job fairs."
College Freshman,2,They're people. Odd people but they're people.
College Freshman,2,This has to be the equivalent to a HS team weight room. The pool is only available to the local HS.
College Freshman,2,I personally am a picky eater. The school lacks variety. The only thing I can recall we have done that has been extravagant is the Lobster and Steak night. But that has only happened once. Besides that food is often under cooked and eating the same thing often loses its appeal. School could use a increase in variety and overall better food options.
College Sophomore,2,There is not much for variety of food choice at Husson. Normally they repeat the same meals every week. You have limited options. The food does not taste good either. It would be nice if we could use our flex dollars at more food places in Bangor.
College Student,2,Everyone tries to live off campus so there aren't many options left.
College Student,2,"Really you can only get need based scholarships, though not bad not really enough if you need it"
College Student,2,"Not a lot of parties happen that i know of, most to all  are in Orono"
College Student,2,"The food could be better tasting,maybe have more ""normal"" foods, don't try to go above and be fancy, most of the foods upsets my stomach"
College Freshman,2,There really isn't much of a greek life on campus
College Junior,2,Must go to Orono for any party
College Sophomore,2,"There is very limited parking on campus, especially near the dorms. It may take a while to find spots close to the dorm building."
College Sophomore,2,"Husson doesn't have much Greek life. There are some fraternities and sororities, but it isn't like the typical picture painted in movies."
College Junior,2,The network is slow.  Printing on campus is costly and if you print lectures and notes then you will probably exceed your funds by the end of the semester.  They have recently made printing wireless from your own laptop which is very helpful but the printing network is frequently down in various locations.
College Senior,2,"Mandatory attendance policies are the norm here. If you have a class that meets once a week for 3 hours, miss it twice, and you fail automatically."
College Senior,2,"NESCom students couldn't play in the NCAA with Husson until 2011, so there are only a few student-athletes. School spirit doesn't really exist."
College Senior,2,"Campus Security acts like a collection service for Husson University, they once gave me a parking ticket for having my pass on the wrong window."
College Senior,2,"There is public transportation in Bangor. Where I commute 114 miles roundtrip, there are no public transportation options, no trains going from Waterville to Bangor and back, nor buses going back and forth that work with my school schedule."
College Freshman,2,"Bangor doesn't have much for underage. Most of the clubs and bars are for 21 plus. The transportation is very poor, the Bat bus only runs till about 6 pm."
College Freshman,2,"High prices, very low availability, rude landlords"
College Freshman,2,"Poor driving conditions, very little parking due to snow in lot, long commutes"
College Sophomore,2,"Well I am from Maine, so I am used to it but I do not like it. The cold weather can be a lot to bare through but as long as you bundle appropriately you will be fine. Since I am a local Orono Mainer, I can enjoy the beautiful Maine summers during break."
College Freshman,2,"The BAT bus does not follow a regular schedule so at times it is hard to catch the bus. If you do get it, it is fairly inexpensive and there is a Concord Coach Lines nearby to provide transportation out of Maine."
College Sophomore,2,My tuition went up when I entered the professional faze of my program and I was required to take more classes per term but the school is giving me less financial aid. Every time I go in there there are only students and they are not helpful at all. They never get my emails or my faxes.
College Sophomore,2,"My first year, I was provided with an appropriate amount of financial aid, which was the number one contributor in my decision to attend this school instead of others that I had been accepted to.  My second and third year, I was told that financial aid had been cut back and I was provided with a $1,000 grant each year for earning a 4.0 GPA!!!  I am up to my eyeballs in loans and dread the pay back period. This area has probably been the biggest irritation to me as I feel that my parents and I were misled to believe that the school would continue to support engaged students."
College Student,2,"The parking passes cost generally $75.00 for two semesters. The pass is to be renewed at the beginning of each academic school year. If you receive a parking ticket, you'll have to pay an additional $75.00. Having a car on campus is extremely convenient. In many different ways, including if you have a job that you have to travel to off campus, or if you need something in your dorm at a random hour, Maybe you want to get a late night snack, and don't have any other means of getting there! Having a car is complete convenience. Parking spaces aren't entirely limited but the ""good spots"" fill up pretty quickly usually. "
College Junior,2,"I get little financial aide, not nearly enough to help me pay for living and school"
College Junior,2,"Its hard to find a spot, decals to park is 75 and every parking violation is 75 its way to high for the quality we get. Security is empowered by ticketing so they give plenty of them"
College Junior,2,"Security is not good they only look for drinking and give parking tickets, they don't have much authority to do much else"
College Freshman,2,I absolutely hate the snow and the cold. Luckily campus is small enough so you don't completely freeze.
College Senior,2,Husson Security is rarely around.
Recent Alumnus,2,could be better there are mostly chinese food spots that charge about 5 dollars for delivery and only deliver until 11pm
College Student,2,I don't play much sports to say that I love them. but there are people who cant wait for the next game to happen
College Student,2,"certain parking areas are assigned for students living on campus, teachers, visitors, etc. parking passes for the school year is 75 which seems a lot when buying it but if you figure how much it is your actually paying for a month it is really a reasonable price"
College Student,2,We have a bat bus in bangor area. which is free to husson students and it brings us almost anywhere in bagor that we want to go to.
College Freshman,2,"To be honest I am not happy with the program I am currently enrolled in. Most of the professors have little experience and do not know how to teach or organize a class. Although i love the field I have chosen, I feel that I am getting a very poor education for the amount I am paying. I do not have doubts about finding a job in my field, but that is due to the field I have chosen, not because Husson will help me in any way. The advisors are completely useless and make you feel as if you are wasting their precious time when you make an appointment to ask for advice. If I could do it over again I would pursue the same career but through a different university"
College Student,2,"Depending on what time of day you get to school, there will either be great parking or no spots at all!"
College Junior,2,"the financial aid process is such a hassle if anything is out of place, or someone didn't receive the mail they were supposed to. once it's all said and done everything is ok, but the process is something else."
College Junior,2,"There are Greeks withing the campus but not many, and they aren't really outgoing, only one fraternity stands out while the others are just there to recruit and continue Greek life. people see them and some may catch interest and others may not, but that's just how attractive it is."
College Student,2,"The parking sticker is only $50 a year, and freshmen can have cars on campus.  However, the parking lots are small and you may have to park a big distance away from your dorm room because of the limited space.  There are no designated parking areas for classes, but commuters have designated parking."
College Student,2,"We have many represented ethnic/racial groups at Husson University; however, they are not a large percentage of the population.  The majority of the population is made up of white students.  In terms of sexuality, Husson seems to be an accepting environment for homosexuals and bisexuals."
College Freshman,2,"Bangor has a good mall, tim hortons, a lot of restaurants.  Other than that, its basically trees."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many computers available, and the ones that are available are always crowded. And the printers are almost never working. But the WiFi, connection and speed, is great!"
College Junior,2,Bangor Is Small – There really isn't too much to do around Bangor. There are a few bars that are OK and there is Hollywood Slots but overall there isn't much to look to do. I spend most of my time in my room studying or playing cards with friends around campus.
College Freshman,2,"C for Computer Lab – Husson University if a wonderful university and excels in many ways, the availability of computers is not one of those ways.  The computer lab is frequently busy, and the problem is compounded by a network that is not always functioning.  A solution to the problem would have to include the addition of another computer lab and a network upgrade that would reduce log on trouble."
College Student,2,The amount of scholarships available at Husson University seems extremely little. For my freshman year of college here at Husson I had to pay a few thousand dollars out of pocket. It would be extremely beneficial to many students if more scholarships were available. I know from experience that majority of scholarships are for nontraditional students.
College Student,2,"The Greek life at Husson is very small. They're actually more like clubs that get together. They have bulletin boards around the school where they post pictures and events, but they don't have houses or floors or rooms where they can meet. Most people don't really know about the different frats or sororities that Husson has."
College Freshman,2,"Not Sure. I have my own personal vehicle, so I haven't experienced the transportation."
College Freshman,2,Food Not So Much. On campus we have only one dinning hall and one market place.  The dinning hall is very repetitive and does not list ingredients of foods.  Also our school has very limited eating times.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much of anything to do around Bangor, ME. It's boring and that's pretty much all there is to it."
College Freshman,2,A low grade computer lab that badly needs an upgrade to its hardware.
College Sophomore,2,"Can Be Rough – Some students have amazing experiences with financial aid, but others can be basically screwed over and have to work nonstop to be able to pay for it. Those who do not have much family contribution should look elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,"Maine. Cold. It's Maine, there are long, cold, harsh winters. It's also fairly hot in the summer, late fall, and early winter. Besides that, the weather is relatively expectable for Maine.
Another note is that Husson has nearly the highest altitude in Bangor, with the airport to the south, this leads to wind, and lots of it, most of the time. It's a rare day when you can't fly a kite at Husson University."
Freshman,1,literally sucks. dont even waste your time. all the kids do is party and the teachers are all foreign. dumb as all heck. dont waste your money. i left asap.
College Freshman,1,No one really cares about sports at husson except for the athletes
College Freshman,1,There's no diversity on campus besides the handful of people from out of state
College Freshman,1,Compared to other schools its poor.
College Freshman,1,Parties usually get shut down and reported in the blink of an eye. This is not a party school.
College Sophomore,1,There is no party scene at Husson. Most students either drink in the dorms or go out to UMaine Orono. I wish there were more party options around.
College Junior,1,The Greek life only stick with each other and are extremely cliquey and at the sametime talk bad about each other. Its over priced and rediculous. 
College Student,1,No houses. Not like greek life at a lager university 
Recent Alumnus,1,Off campus housing extremely limited near campus the bus system isnot reliable if living more than a mile away from campus. Housing gets filled quickly there are more nursing homes near campus than apartments 
Recent Alumnus,1,"The parking situation at the school is in desperate need of improvement. For the amount of money they charge for a decal, there are not enough parking spots on campus to make it worth it. Many students are late to classes because of the lack of parking on our campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is horrible. If you aren't there early you are not going to get a spot.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Campus security can be strict about underage drinking and drug use, but normally nobody gets caught often, so you will have drunk people wandering the hallway or you can smell pot on the hallways. If you campus security for any reason they are normally slow to respond."
College Sophomore,1,"Maine in general does not have a diverse population, so most of the people are caucasion. There are quite a few international students in the pharmacy school, but that is the extent of diversity."
College Junior,1,"I hate Maine weather, long winters with lots of snow and not enough sun and warm weather."
College Sophomore,1,"The 50.00$ amount for a parking pass was reasonable, however, it has now been increased to 75.00$"
College Sophomore,1,"There is a roof over your head, and heat during the winter, but that is the most good I can say about the dorms. They are small, the furniture is old and musty, the electricity is spotty, internet is slow and crashes all the time."
College Sophomore,1,"Very few spots, poor maintenance in winter, 50$ fee, terrible drivers all over campus (very common to have minor accidents in parking lot)."
College Freshman,1,Everyone is basically from Bangor. The least diverse college ever.
College Freshman,1,"Living on campus sucks if you are from more than 2 hours away from bangor.  Everyone goes home on the weekends and there isn't any good parties.  The dorms are okay, space wise."
College Senior,1,The printers are reliable and the lab computers are a joke. The network speed is fair.

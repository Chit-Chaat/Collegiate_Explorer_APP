Niche User,5,"It seemed like a very nice community, everyone I spoke too was extremely nice and friendly.  I really liked all the old buildings and Cedar Rapids was a very industrial town"
Freshman,5,"Coe is amazing! The building might not be the newest and the city might not be the biggest, but the people at Coe are wonderful, hands down the best people I've ever met. From professors to acquaintances, everyone says hi, the professors don't just care about your grades, but they care about your success and your health, both mentally and physically. Coe is not just a college, but a family. No other college will welcome you so warmly, treat you like an equal, and make you feel loved and cared for as Coe does."
Alum,5,"It’s college so it’s gonna be though and have highs and lows. Overall though my college experience was top notch. I had great professors who actually cared, comfortable environment and so many opportunities thanks to Coe. The 1:3 clinical opportunity really sold me when I toured. After that the people made it feel like home!"
Freshman,5,"Very friendly staff, you feel like you belong the minute you step on campus. All the professors do everything the can to help you. Sporting events are attended by a lot of people. The surrounding community is amazing, there is so much to do."
Alum,5,Great experience. Professors were always approachable and genuinely wanted to see students succeed. Coe provides students with the opportunity to make their student life experience however they would like. Many opportunities to engage in events and organizations. My athletic experience was nothing short of amazing.
Sophomore,5,"Coe is a place where everyone feels welcome. They have so much to offer through academics, clubs, and sports. The professors care about you, know you by name, and are always there to help when you need. Overall, Coe is a happy place and has a wonderful learning environment."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere at Coe, the feeling of being welcomed, no matter where you're from. In addition, the professors make college feel less overwhelming, whether we're talking about the new living arrangements or your class schedules for the next four years."
Niche User,5,"I had an amazing visit with this college, and I hope the rest of my years here go very well. However, after viewing the alumni and the other students at the college, I think that I will have an amazing experience here."
Senior,5,Coe has a great nursing program with 3 semesters of 1:1 preceptorship... not to mention all the professors at Coe care about you and you’re on a first name basis with 90% of them.
Freshman,5,"Really fun campus with enough diversity for everyone to fit in! Small school, phenomenal professors and staff."
Alum,5,"It's a welcoming environment from the start - engaging professors, kindness, inclusiveness, a myriad of fun activities that brought us together into community while each of us tended to our own educational pathways. ... a gentle place where the warmth never leaves you."
Niche User,5,"The professors care immensely. After attending for one year, one of my professors stayed in contact and has been encouraging me not only to continue my education but try for a PHD. The campus is beautiful, and people are friendly. The food could be better, but it is all you can eat."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Coe! I wasn't sure what I wanted from a college and so I came (from out of state - more than 9 hours away) with the ""You can alwaaaays transfer mindset""...... Well, here I am. It is so easy to get involved, to find faculty who care about you, and to take classes you are passionate about. I was very involved in high school, but leaving Coe my resume is going to be stacked - just because they provide you with THAT much opportunity (not saying resumes are the end all be all, but you do have to use them for grad schools or jobs so its something to think about).
Coe has taught me how to think analytically and independently, which, to me, is the ultimate ""return on investment,"" if you will."
Freshman,5,The professors and staff are very hardworking and helpful. The students are welcoming. It has really good classroom sizes.
Freshman,5,"Coe has a very strong sense of community and the professors are always available. Even though it was my first semester, the upperclassmen are already giving me advice and helping me study. There is a variety of clubs and the food is customized. Coe has also already helped me compile my resume with conferences and experience in my field of study."
College Junior,5,I absolutely love Coe. I want my kids to go here.
College Junior,5,"This is a very strong part of Coe. We are steadily increasing ways to improve, however. It is a part of our 5 year strategic plan."
College Junior,5,"We were ranked in a national listing as one of the few schools that get Greek life right. There is a non-tolerant policy on hazing. We have slight drama among sororities, but its not as bad as media or movies portray."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a psych major, and I've gotta say I adore my department. The professors are enthusiastic about what they teach and my peers are non-competitive and friendly. Class sizes are small. My biggest class had 29 kids and my smallest had 4. Classes are usually lecture based with little every day homework. I love it. These areas are exactly what I looked for in a college."
College Freshman,5,"I love it here, there are a handful of things I would change or make better but overall it's a great experience."
College Sophomore,5,"Coe's small campus and community were really what I was looking for in a college. The professors expect a lot out of you, but they're willing to put in all the work necessary for their students to succeed. I honestly cannot gush enough about Coe. I had such a hard time saying goodbye when breaks rolled around. Overall, if you can afford it and are motivated enough, Coe is an incredible place to learn and to be."
College Student,5,"The classes are small, with an average of 17 students for one professor. We don't have any teacher assistants(TA's), because the class size is so small. The largest class offered on campus is typically Cellular and Molecular Biology with anywhere from 30-70 students. Class styles are open and inviting for questions, opinions, and discussions."
College Freshman,5,There are a lot of people that participate in the athletics at my school.  They take the sports very seriously and it shows.  Students and people from the community love to attend the sporting events and it is a great source of pride for the school.
College Freshman,5,"I love how the people here were so welcoming and nice to me when I first came.  The school is very far away from where I lived and my family, so it was difficult for me to adjust to life there at first.  The people I met and my teachers were fundamental in helping me get settled in at my new life at school."
College Sophomore,5,"The school is over all very welcoming. Everyone knows everyone and are all very nice. Teachers care a lot, you can tell. Classes are smaller than a typical college and that makes it a much easier environment to learn from."
College Sophomore,5,"Coe College is an extremely diverse and tight knit community. The students and faculty are driven individuals who are passionate about learning. The schools slogan is, ""Coe makes it possible. You make it happen."" This most accurately describes the college's mission. The professors and faculty will do everything in their power to set students up for success. But it is up for the student to take action and become leaders in their fields of study. The small class sizes create more opportunities for students to become close to the professors and build lasting relationships with other classmates. Determined, accepting, and focused students should consider joining the Coe community."
College Freshman,5,Like I have tried to make clear there is no place I would rather go.
College Freshman,5,The Physics department has such a great hold on the subject and research options. It is one of the best places for undergraduate research in the field.
College Freshman,5,"As a member of Greek life I am a little biased, but I never thought I would be a Greek and Coe changed that."
College Freshman,5,"Love the atmosphere, the students, and the teachers. No other school like it."
College Freshman,5,"Coe was voted one of the top ten schools in the US that do Greek life right. I'm in a sorority here and I love it. There are parties, but a lot of Greek life is about bonding with your sisters and doing philanthropy."
College Freshman,5,"Coe offers an amazing education, community, and overall experience. The classes are discussion based for the most part and really engaging, the professors want to make sure that you are involved in your learning so that you comprehend as much as you can. And they always encourage you to visit them if you have questions or want them to look over a paper. The students are all very friendly, there's not really any cliques or drama. Everyone smiles and says hi to you, even if you've just met them once, when walking to class or in the halls. There are many clubs to get involved with from improv to math club to volunteering to rock climbing. There are a lot of off campus study opportunities such as May terms, choir and band trips, and New York and Asia terms. They just got the Learning Commons in the newly renovated library, where you can get tutors or go to the Writing or Speaking Centers for help on papers and speeches. A lot of the campus is going to be renovated within the next few years. There is always something going on on or off campus. SAC, or the student activities committee, has free movies at the local movie theater once a month, study parties, music and performance groups that come to campus, and much more as do the other clubs. Cedar Rapids is a great city, it's small, although the second biggest in Iowa, and there are lots of events going on all of the time. There are maybe only two cons that I can think of and that's the food is not the greatest but it's good compared to many other schools and the staff there are all super friendly and greet you by name. And the area is a bit sketchy, but you're fine if you walk in groups. Overall I love Coe!"
College Freshman,5,"While Coe is located in/near a not so safe neighborhood, crime does not happen on campus. In the very few cases where crime has been involved, Coe does an excellent job notifying, informing, and providing services for those that are affected emotionally."
College Freshman,5,All of the professors are pretty good in general. Class sizes are great with only a few lecture classes needed. Would definitely take advantage of the small school size and get to establish a relationship with professors.
College Freshman,5,"Coe does a good job with prepping for careers and grad-schooling. All students are required to finish a research opportunity, internship, study abroad, etc. for graduation."
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is outstanding at Coe, especially for a school this size. Though not all fraternities or sororities may have the best reputation, they are still a really big part of college life."
College Freshman,5,"While Coe may not be known for their sports team, they do have an outstanding athlete population. The facilities are well-used and are in great quality."
College Freshman,5,Coe college is an amazing school. The class sizes are excellent and the student life great. There is always something to do or people to see on campus.
College Freshman,5,"I love it! My sorority is the best thing to happen to me at Coe. There are so many choices, and they're all great. Plus, the parties are so minimal, it's really only one frat since Greek Life doesn't have houses."
College Freshman,5,Coe is extremely diverse and accepting to everyone.
College Freshman,5,The academics at Coe are great they offer various courses and help you become the professional you want to be. The professors are great and will help you as long as you seek help.
College Freshman,5,The courses offered at Coe are great because of you have a plan on your major their is a strict schedule you can follow and the professors will lead you in that path. However if you come into Coe undecided the professors and your advisor will work with you until you decide on your major and will lead you in the path to be successful.
College Freshman,5,"Housing at Coe is excellent, they ask you various things about sleeping habits and other things that will make you feel at home and then partner you with a Roomate that matches your interests and sleeping habits. The living space could be a little more spacious but it's still okay. Social atmosphere is great because that's how you meet new people and make friends."
College Sophomore,5,"The small size of Coe gives off the same vibe as my hometown, a rural farm town in Illinois. Being surrounded by the city of Cedar Rapids gives Coe's campus a safe feeling, like a little bubble. If you so choose, you can venture out and have a lovely city experience, or you can choose to surround yourself with a tightly knit, friendly college community. The attention you receive from professors is completely individualized and personal; this learning experience is completely different from high school even."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Coe College, the student body and living is great!"
College Junior,5,Coe is really good about working with students who have financial need. I was not going to be able to attend a private institution until Coe helped to build up grants/scholarships.
College Senior,5,"While I haven't yet gotten to my student teaching semester, I've had several practicum experiences in local elementary schools. The Education Department does a good job of setting these up for you and making sure they work with your schedule. I've had great experiences in all of my practicum placements. The professors do a great job of providing time for us to talk about our practicum time during class and connect our observations to methods that we're learnign about in class."
College Junior,5,I applied to 4 colleges and Coe was the only one that sent me a personalized acceptance letter. They included a little blurb about my essay I submitted and it really made me feel like the college actually wanted me there as a person rather than as a number.
College Junior,5,Everyone is very friendly. The best place to workout is the Clark Racket Center. The library is big as well and majority of the people are respectful and quiet. There is always something going on on campus as well and it is never a dull moment.
College Junior,5,The Political Science professors are great. They really care about your grades in the class and are always wanting to know how you are doing in other classes as well.
College Junior,5,All of the professors are friendly and wanting to know how your day is. They also care that you get the best education and that you push yourself as well. They are very understanding of emergencies and willing to work out any situations if needed. Coe offers many different study atmosphere variations that are open 24/7. Registration is not as hectic and stressful as it seems. There are also many different interesting classes available if the one that you would like to take fills up before your time.
College Student,5,Coe offers a really good variety of majors and minors
College Student,5,"At coe everyone gets a faculty advisor to help them decide what classes to take. you can switch to an advisor in your area of study so that you are for sure getting into the classes that you need. I am in the business and accounting programs, I enjoy it, but you have to be aware of what teacher you are taking it with. knowing the teaching styles of the teachers in your major are crucial to succeeding at any college. my first semester I took accounting with a teacher that was a great teacher but didnt teach in the way I needed to learn the material. so the second semester I took it with a different professor and did incredibly well."
College Student,5,I love my professors they are so understanding and really flexible when it comes to needing help.
College Student,5,I love Coe's programs. they are very hard at first but once you get to know the teaching styles it gets better.
College Student,5,I love Coe. all of the clubs and Greek orgs are incredibly accepting and kind.
College Student,5,"Coe is so safe, If you need to be walked to your room at night the security with escort you at no cost to you."
College Student,5,Coe gave me the best financial aid award of any of the colleges I was considering attending.
College Student,5,There is so much to do on campus at night. and you Do not have to drink if you don't want to.
College Freshman,5,"I've found that Coe is very accepting of all people, which makes for a great school atmosphere."
Niche User,4,"It was made easy to understand and was very helpful, I thought everything was well put together, easily read."
Sophomore,4,"Good professors, academic support, and good general environment. Buildings need updates and campus/immediate community is kind of small."
Alum,4,"The best things about Coe are the community feel, the connections you make with professors and peers, and the class sizes. I was really wanting a college that gave me the opportunity to know and engage with my professors, and Coe was excellent for that. The downfalls of Coe are the limited parking spaces and exorbitant fees, the outdated dorms, and the sheer price of the institution."
Sophomore,4,I think Coe is a great college.  I believe Coe gives a great education with so many possibilities to become part of the student body.  I would highly recommend Coe to anyone looking to further their education with a 4 year degree.
Sophomore,4,I have taken a few online classes with Coe and I feel as though the learning is rather good.  I prefer in person classes but online classes can work well when it is needed.
Freshman,4,I thought that the professors all did a great job of conforming to the online learning environment. I never had any issues with communication or understanding what was expected of me. I felt that my online education with Coe was a smooth continuation of my classes on campus.
Sophomore,4,"It is a small college, but everyone it very kind.  The teachers are helpful and really do want students to succeed. They could have a few more activities, but they try to do as much as they can."
Freshman,4,First year on campus has been a great experience. I like all of my professors and my classes have been very helpful.
Freshman,4,everything is great. except for the price. many people struggle to handle the pressure and money issues. so we scramble to make sure we can stay.
Niche User,4,"I did a high school program at Coe and had an awesome experience the food was great and the walking distance from my class to my dorm was only a short walk away, but the freshmen dorms aren't that great in my opinion. Overall I give it four out of five stars."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, professors care immensely about all of their students, and academics are a clear priority to the college. The only thing I would say negatively about Coe is that they need a facelift. Just to update and beautify the surroundings would make all students so much happier."
Sophomore,4,The thing i like about Coe how immensely diverse it is. The amount of culture there is eye opening. Something I would like to change about Coe is the tuition cost.
Junior,4,The campus at Coe is small and everything is easily accessed. The class sizes are smaller than the typical large campus classes. This allows for students questions to get answered in front of the whole class. The professors care for your education and have office hours that get used by students to further educate themselves and ask questions. The campus has a wide range of activities and organizations for all. The dorms are decent for being around for a while. The custodial staff work very hard to keep all the buildings in clean and working condition. There are many options for work study position if the student is eligible for it. Sports are a part of campus but participants are kept to being a student first. There is a new workout facility on campus that is nice and has something for all to do.
Freshman,4,"Since I've started school at Coe College, I have been challenged in so many way and it's crazy to think that this place exists in Iowa. The staff here is so educated on their subjects and how to adapt to different students' learning styles. They are all very approachable and easy to talk to. They know who you are and the seriously want you to succeed in their classes. There's no way for you to fail at Coe unless you are trying to fail."
Niche User,4,"Coe has a beautiful campus. It's small enough that you're going to get one on one connections with everyone, but it's also large enough that you'll always have someone new to meet. The cost is a bit high, but it is well worth it."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere at Coe. If you try to find friends and get involved, this place really does end up being like a home away from home!"
Alum,4,"Fantastic education on par with the best universities in the country.  The professors are truly there because they have a passion for teaching and mentoring students, something you may not find at larger institutions. That said, the price tag is rather steep vis-a-vis the amenities and services.  The facilities, food, and athletic programs need a considerable amount of investment to make Coe a national and international destination.  The endowment needs to be inflated and enrollment increased by at least a couple thousand."
Senior,4,Coe College is an amazing school. The support from professors is outstanding. They always seem to go above and beyond for their students.
Freshman,4,I love the people here. I've had some great professors. I would like to see the food improved however. There needs to be healthier and more diverse options.
Freshman,4,"Going to Coe College was my dream since I was 6, my mom went there so she'd been telling me stories about it for forever. When I arrived at Coe for orientation I wasn't dissappointed, but I was brought to reality. 
The food could be a lot better, and so could the dorms and furniture. Parking is awful, and options for housing are slowly improving. 
The campus is Beautiful, with dozens of squirrels living in the trees that eat from your hand, and geese that stop here in the fall and spring. Every winter they put lights around the trunks of the library quad that are solar powered and only light up at night. 
There are a lot of options for partygoers, and the classes themselves are really good. 
Everything is much more expensive than it has any right to be, and the professors are occasionally really problematic. 
Most of the staff is really nice though, and they often actually work with students to help them out. The library is awesome."
Alum,4,"I got the degree I wanted and feel extremely prepared for the working world, but not without sacrifice. There was a lack of diversity and acceptance for anyone who was not neurotypical. Alough teachers were available for help, ther solution to poor test scores was always more reading, more assignments and more work, rather than more effecient readings, assignments, or work. Ultimately adding to student stress by and making nearly impossible to keep up with the additional work and not fall behind on other assignments."
College Junior,4,"Coe is very resilient. Being a smaller campus, challenges face us differently than larger campuses- the effects financially are felt a little more closely. We have a very strong administration that is very well trained on how to deal with these obstacles as they come. The decisions that are made by administration may not be what students want or understand, but it's to make our lives better in the end. I think we have one of the most transparent institutions out there, students are involved in every step of the process for staff/faculty hiring. At Coe, the student voice really matters."
College Senior,4,I know that I have been prepared very well for my next step in life
College Senior,4,"The professors are so knowledgable about their field, and they all are vey willing to help me"
College Senior,4,"In a sketchy area, but I always feel very safe walking across campus by myself at night"
College Senior,4,"It is a great school where teachers are really available to help any day of the week, at any time"
College Sophomore,4,Students from Coe generally get a job right out of school/offered a job while in school or move on to higher education. Coe prepares all its students well for their future careers and academic advisors are always ready to help- no matter how many times you change your major. Lots of Coe alums get recruited by employers right in the Cedar Rapids area.
College Sophomore,4,"It really depends on where you're put. As a first-year, I was placed on one of the nicest dorms on campus, Armstrong. The rooms are a decent size and the lobby is always bustling. Douglas and Voorhees are also nice and clean. The RAs do a good job of promoting a sense of community on floors. The less nice dorms are getting their lobbies redone this summer, so that's a plus."
College Freshman,4,"Sorority life here is awesome, I"
College Freshman,4,The athletics are all very good but if you aren't involved you never feel like a loser.
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life does great things for the Cedar Rapids area, they're always holding events and fundraisers and are just cool people to be around. Each sorority/fraternity has a different feel to it, so there's something for everyone. I'm definitely considering rushing next year. The cost of Greek life leaves a little to be desired, but all the branches have payment plans and scholarships. And while most of the Greeks don't have their own houses, they do have their own special floors in the respective all female and male dorms."
College Sophomore,4,"While I don't participate in sports myself, I can appreciate the work Coe puts on to give our athletes proper space and equipment. There are two gyms, Eby and Clark, and a new addition being added onto Clark this summer to give athletes additional space. As an average student, I would like to say that I wish there was more Kohawk pride on campus, but I guess that's what comes with being a small, division III school."
College Student,4,"The career services is very friendly, and they send out emails with opportunities to volunteer, do community service, apply for an internship, get a job, etc."
College Student,4,"They are currently renovating the athletic facility to include; a new performance arena with 2,000 seats, an updated fitness center with a skywalk between the two athletic buildings, a brand new wrestling room, elevators in one of the buildings, bigger and better locker rooms, as well as new athletic machines and weight-lifting rooms. Sports are big part of campus, but don't overshadow the other activities and clubs on campus."
College Student,4,"The professors are there to help and love it when you stop to ask a question or to just say hello. They are available majority of the day, and they post their office hours on the doors so you can check and see when they are next available. As normal, their teaching style and types of materials they use varies from professor to professor, but the have one thing in common; they want you to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,I've seen quite a lot of people get jobs immediately after college but I don't know much about the process myself.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of cousees available and I love how the GED requirements forces you to at least consider the different options available. You can never know what topic or subject you'll love.
College Sophomore,4,I love the idea of family in fraternities and sororities. I'm thinking of joining one myself.
College Sophomore,4,I love the school but a reduction in the cost of tuition fees won't be the wworst thing.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of big employers in Cedar Rapids that often offer internships and job opportunities to students at my school.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of big employers in Cedar Rapids that often offer internships and job opportunities to students at my school.
College Freshman,4,"The housing on campus is really good depending on where you get.  The first year dorm, where I was my freshman year, was very clean and was a good building.  The lobbies that we have in the dorms are a great place to meet up with friends and have fun."
College Freshman,4,"Many of the parties on campus are thrown by people in Greek life.  Though this may be true, a lot of people in Greek life also don't participate in these parties, so the dynamic for Greek life on campus can be very different based on which fraternity you're looking at."
College Sophomore,4,"There is capus security, which is nice. There are also these phones that you directly pick up all over campus that connect right away with security that you can use if you ever feel unsafe."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life isn't a big deal on campus. I would say that's good and bad. I'm not currently a member so good for me as I'm not treated differently. But I suppose it could be bad for members that are involved because there isn't a big spot light on them like there may be at some schools. It doesn't make you any better to be a part of it.
College Sophomore,4,"The school is small, and not a big ten school by any means but I think that's great. Because it's small, the students really care and make an effort to support their school. As for fans, other than connections to the school there is not much of a following."
College Freshman,4,Classes can be hard and demanding but the professors want students to succeed. They are always available to offer help as are the writing and speaking centers and the AAP office. Some classes are pretty easy but most you have to work for.
College Freshman,4,"The school isn't that great of a neighborhood but campus is security is always available 24/7, whether you forgot your keys or don't feel safe waling back from the library late at night."
College Freshman,4,Every student is required to complete an internship before graduation. The school seems very good at getting students employed after graduation.
College Freshman,4,"The courses are varied and interesting. The professors are engaging and want you to learn. They are always available to meet with you to answer questions or to just have a conversation. There are many resources available on campus for free that are there to help you to succeed such as the writing center and tutoring. The classes are small and discussion based. The faculty here want you to succeed. The campus has almost a small town feel. The only negatives are lack of housing with increasing class sizes, students can be kind of ""high school"" at times and the food is hit or miss."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing at Coe is typical. Students can live to live in singles, doubles, triples, and quads. The rooms contain twin XL beds that can be bunked. There is also modular furniture that can move around. In the dorms, there are communal bathrooms and showers on each hall. The landry rooms are in the basement of the dorms."
College Sophomore,4,I do not participate in sports at Coe since there is not a hockey team. Sports play a big role in shaping school life. Many Coe students participate on sports teams whether in NCAA Divsion III or intermurals.
College Junior,4,Organizations and companies love Coe College graduates
College Junior,4,very welcoming and homey and friendly
College Freshman,4,"I feel really safe on campus. There is security that drives around campus all the time. Also, you can call the security at any time and they come. I also like the fact that if you are somewhere on campus and it is late at night, if you don't feel comfortable walking by yourself, you can call security to come walk with you and they will. I would say the downfall is that they don't also come fast and sometimes you have to wait, especially if you get locked out of your dorm, but they will come and let you in."
College Freshman,4,"So far from what I saw, post education and jobs after graduating from Coe are pretty good. There are a lot of opportunities to intern at the various businesses around campus. There are also a lot of job searchers that come to come looking for volunteers and interns to come work for them. Also, teachers and resources at school are really helpful at looking for jobs and internships, and even volunteering."
College Freshman,4,"So far I really enjoy my experience at Coe. I like all the new things that they are trying to incorporate to make everyone feel welcome here. The people on campus are pretty friendly but it is not like a fairytale, there are pros and cons of coming here. But they are different for everyone. I love the class sizes too because there are rarely any big classes over 18, except for the sciences. Also, there are so many different courses that are available and they don't all have to be strictly academic. Plus all the professors are really nice so far, but I do have my favorites. Other than that I am glad that I chose Coe."
College Freshman,4,"I live in the all-freshman dorm building, Armstrong Hall, and I really like living here. I like the fact that I can be surrounded by all freshman so that you all can relate because you are going through the same thing. Also, I really enjoy the lobby because it is a great place to go and socialize and you find quite a few people down there at times. However, Armstrong Hall does not have an elevator so it can be a hassle sometimes. But other than that I like environment."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the greek life at Coe. I am apart of the greek life here so I might seem bias but I'm not. I went through informal recruitment but I heard that formal was really fun. We have 4 sororities here at Coe but we do not have any greek houses, except for one male frat house, TKE. But what we do have is greek wings in all girl and all boy dorms with chapter rooms. So you still that sense of living with your sisters or brothers and being a family. Also, all the people in the greek are really friendly and they aren't like the stereotypical movie sororities, except one group that has their ideal girl but I shall not name them."
College Freshman,4,"So far I am really enjoying my school. I have great friends that I have made here and I feel like I have found a home here. There are sometimes though where I have gone through my ups and down but I managed to make it through. I have also learned that there are quite a few resources available but you have to go seek them because they won't come to you. Also, there are times when it seems extremely boring on campus without a car, but the school does a good job at trying to bring entertainment to the school, but again, you have to go see them. But other than that, there are some things that aren't the best but I would definitely choose Coe again if I was given the choice."
Niche User,2,"Coe offers little support to victims of violence, particularly those who are hurt by members of TKE, the only fraternity with it's own house, and makes transferring to another school very challenging. The professors are largely great and very supportive, and they take a genuine interest in your education and even offer personal support."
Sophomore,2,"Coe College is very friendly to dietary, religious, and physical restrictions and has quite a few welcoming and helpful professors. Living spaces are decent. I wish the community was a bit more friendly in terms of sexuality, gender, race, and political views as things tend to get very tense and sometimes violent. This could be resolved with campus speeches as there are many support groups and events. There should be more talk about the importance of education, being respectful to others and their desire to learn, sexual consent, sexual safety, and sobriety (drugs and alcohol)."
College Sophomore,2,Hard to find your group on campus. Not belonging is hard.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know a whole lot about Greek life because I avoid it. I can't stand women being forced into wearing dresses and being ""proper women."""
College Junior,2,"There have been many problems with every place I have lived in so far on campus for three consecutive years. The issues are significant, not minor, and the college does little to nothing to solve them or help fix them. The college requires living on campus, but does not have many options or space, especially for upperclassmen. This makes housing selection very competitive and stressful for everyone. Requiring the meal plan seems like a sneaky way for the college to get the most money."
College Freshman,2,I haven't been the best student for my first semester.
College Freshman,2,I haven't seen myself grow as a person and as a student during my time at Coe.
College Freshman,2,"Just crappy fast food. There is, however, and excellent coffee shop across the street."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many options, and they are expensive."
College Sophomore,2,It's a small school so everybody knows everybody anyways. This fact sort of makes needing to join a frat/srat to have friends a non-factor because you'll probably be friends with all the same people anyways.
College Sophomore,2,"Coe is a school of less than 2,000 students. Because of this, Coe can (almost) house all of it's students on campus. Therefore, the resources and availability of moving off-campus are more limited. Living on campus is better at this school anyways."
College Sophomore,2,"The school nurse is terrible (she is reported to sometimes google symptoms on her phone, but does sometimes write a prescription) and Coe has an infuriating track record when dealing with sexual assault cases.

However, St. Luke's (a hospital across the street) offers 10 free mental/emotional health sessions to students and hosts free sexual health fairs that include contraception, STI screening, and general health questions.

In addition, every other Friday PAIRS (a student organization) gives out free condoms outside the caf while also hosting fun health fairs (more like a carnival, with lube, candy, and condoms are the prizes) a few times a year."
College Junior,2,"Well over 90% of students live on campus, and it is designed to be that way.  Usually only people who are from Cedar Rapids and live with their parents live off campus. Most people stay on campus in the residence halls, and then move to on-campus apartments as upperclassmen."
College Freshman,2,"While in the residence halls, the wifi is relatively reliable--but I have an ethernet cable that helps when the going gets rough. Around campus, there is wifi. However, it makes me log in every time I open a new page on my smartphone, so it's easier to just use 4G."
College Junior,2,"Student life on campus is not what's it's cracked up to be. The students are friendly and the location is great, however there isn't a lot to do on campus. Besides partying or sitting in a dorm room with friends, the campus really lacks entertainment."
College Sophomore,2,"The college does not provide any sort of public transportation. That being said, there are public buses which are more-or-less reliable (though they do not run late at night or on Sundays). Chances are that there will be someone on campus you know who has a car though, and people are understanding about giving rides so long as no one abuses it."
College Freshman,2,"Make Friends With Cars – It's hard to get to a lot of places if you don't have a car, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. There are bus services but Coe is in a very small town, meaning there isn't much to get to anyway. If you really want to go out an have fun, you're likely going to have to leave town, and that requires a car."
College Junior,2,Have a Car or Know Someone With One – It's a small campus so you can walk everywhere but if you want off campus you need a car or someone with a car.
College Freshman,2,"Not Much – Mostly it's fast food and Italian, neither of which are my favorite. But Brewed Awakenings across the street does a fabulous mocha, and has great lunch options."
College Junior,2,Greek life is in existence only within the brothers and sisters.
Alum,1,"This school has caused me a thousand headaches. Because of how they handle advising, I was poorly set up for a degree, ended up having to transfer as I would have had to go an extra year since intro classes are only offered fall semester. Ever school I’ve transferred to has had issues with their transcripts and many times classes won’t transfer. I would never recommend the school. Worst decision I made as far as college education is concerned."
Freshman,1,"Unfortunately Coe has a lot of hidden fees and money you have to pay on the side. Along with the 40,000 you have to pay the best scholarship, I could get only get half my tuition paid off. They unfortunately don't deal with a lot of issues on campus very well or will be receptive to reporting incidents that happen. The College is situated in the worst part of Cedar Rapids and they don't tell the incoming students that cars are constantly broken into. There was incidents of women being followed or grabbed or items being stolen. There were over 8-10  sexual incidents just ""reported"" by students from the time I was there. While the classes are good but very hard to balance and challenging to get when it comes to picking classes. The dorms are updated but there are cockroaches in the mens dorms and the apartments. Ive gotten food poisoning 3 times from Coe."
Alum,1,"1. During my study, I forced to change my composition teacher every year. Neither of these teachers had idea where the path of my education should go next: the first one was a decent professor; the next one was still pursuing his doctor degree in University of Iowa; the last one is a high school teacher doing it as part-time job. 

2. They are very conservative: a DAW lab locates in the B1 floor but nobody uses it. Yet after you graduated, these are the very basic techniques letting you to survive in this industry.

3. Overpriced. Seriously I paid $40,000 to ""hire"" a high school teacher teaching me how to write music? Before the school I did four studio albums and produced many artists I just don't know how to play an instrument so many school in the U.S. wouldn't accept me. 

College education is an investment toward yourself. Don't invest $23000 a year and end up nothing: no connect, no experience. If you have a dream, go to a big city, even it is a for-profit or low ranking school."
College Sophomore,1,Way too hard and difficult to register for classes.
College Sophomore,1,Went to an athletic party and the kids were doing MOLLY! WTF not safe at all.
College Sophomore,1,"Dead body found on campus within the first week. And multiple gun shots throughout the year. Coe is in the hood, very unsafe."
College Sophomore,1,I did not know most of the people on my floor. Housing is way too much money and being forced to live on campus isn't fair.
College Sophomore,1,"Some of the equipment in the weight room is a hammy down from a HIGH SCHOOL!!! If I pay that much to attend I would expect something a little nicer. The indoor track is the worst I've ever seen, throwers have to throw into the wall because the tennis coach is crazy about the floors. Complete joke for an athletic facility."
College Sophomore,1,Coe College is a waste of money. It was the worst decision of my life to attend. I made no friends and struggled in classes. Only go to this school if you are a socially awkward super genius.
College Sophomore,1,"There are few options, and the academics is not rigorous at all  - classes are extremely easy and will not prepare you for graduate school or professional careers."
College Senior,1,It's a requirement to live on campus all four years. It creates a better community. The surrounding area of campus isn't very welcoming. It's definitely better to stay on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"It never gets warm. Constantly, the weather is rainy or clouded. When it snows, it stays around for months. Outdoor weather almost never happens. If you're from a sunny place, watch out for seasonal depression."
College Sophomore,1,"Awful, Fattening and Insulting to Vegetarians – If you're a vegetarian or vegan, welcome to an all carb diet. The few fruits and vegetables aren't fresh and very repetitive. There's almost nothing around campus to eat. The things that taste best are the hamburgers and fries, which unsurprisingly are unhealthy."
College Sophomore,1,"Asian Studies – Being an Asian Studies major here is nothing short of a joke. They don't offer Chinese and only have two years of Japanese which the major requires. After that, there's one other a class mandated and a period abroad and viola! You're an Asian Studies Major."

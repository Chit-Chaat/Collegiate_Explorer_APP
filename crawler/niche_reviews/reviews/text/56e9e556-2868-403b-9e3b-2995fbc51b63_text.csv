Sophomore,5,"My online experience with Loyola University New Orleans was great. When all students were sent home in March due to COVID-19, I had to finish some of my classes online. I was able to complete my courses with Zoom calls with my professors and classmates. My professors were really helpful with guiding me through the online courses."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Loyola University New Orleans has been great. I have only been there one year and I have had a great time.

Alum,5,"I took online classes, and I passed all of them!  Follow instructions and finish works by deadlines."
Alum,5,"There is true diversity of people from all over the world on small campus of a private university.

I enjoyed my experience with LUNO, so I am proud to be an alumnus."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Loyola. It was not my top choice for a while, but then I slowly began to realize it is the perfect place for me. The community is wonderful, people come from everywhere, and New Orleans is such a great place to spend your college years."

Junior,5,"Loyola University is a close knit community built on a strong spiritual foundation. The staff and faculty lead with a heart of love and understanding through all situations. I have always felt listened to and cared for since starting my college career here. Through all obstacles I faced while at Loyola, I found patience in professors and a willingness to work with me no matter the circumstance. My mind has been challenged to do things that I didn't know I was capable of doing. I would recommend Loyola University to anyone who is looking to enter into a college program."

Whatever the students need, Loyola makes sure that they have it!"
Sophomore,5,I'm a music major and the program is excellent.  The overall community is uplifting and there is something for everyone.
Freshman,5,I am an incoming freshman at Loyola University and attended their orientation. I absolutely enjoyed my preview into what my freshman year will be like. Everyone on campus was very helpful and the professors and advisers were lovely. The food was excellent and the rooms are very comfortable. I immediately felt at home and safe in this atmosphere. I can't wait to begin the next 4 years of my life.

Sophomore,5,I liked loyola because it’s a peaceful environment. The staff and professors are nice and helpful. Everyone there is inviting as well.
Freshman,5,"Super friendly people, beautiful campus, and wonderful atmosphere. Can’t wait to start classes with the Class of 2023"
Freshman,5,I love the support services like the success coaches and tutoring center. It’s also a great campus for diversity and acceptance. Students are one big family. I wish the freshman dorms were better but you can’t have everything!!!
Niche User,5,I can’t wait to attend this school in the fall!!! In a very nice area with a lot of food around the area with the nicest people in the world!! They also have a great athletic system as well they have the Saints and Pelicans

Freshman,5,Loyola has a very comfortable campus life that is relaxed and is similar to being in the park. People and students are friendly and buildings aren't too far from each other. The facilities are also well monitored and kept clean.
Junior,5,"Transferred to Loyola after my freshman year at a much larger school with an international reputation (considered among the ""ivy league plus"" schools), and found the environment at Loyola to be the complete opposite in the best way possible. Classes are small, faculty members are extremely knowledgeable and attentive, classmates are congenial and supportive, and the general environment on campus is much more supportive of the individual. There is extremely helpful and useful counseling center on campus with no limits to visits (a huge plus where my past school at wait times were weeks long and visits were numerated), it's not necessarily close to downtown but getting to downtown couldn't be simpler with a $1.25 streetcar ride being the easiest way to get there, and it is in an incredible area of town in which to be a student."
Niche User,5,I am currently applying to Loyola University New Orleans and my experience with the school and the general admissions department has been very successful. My admissions counselor has been very helpful in investigating my questions with all aspects of applications and helpful with my possible move to New Orleans.
Alum,5,"I transferred to Loyola University in my Junior year of college to pursue a degree in music industry studies.  Choosing to transfer to Loyola was one of the best decisions of my life.  Living in the city of New Orleans is already a great way to study music, but being able to study music at Loyola University in New Orleans is a formidable combination for the aspiring musician.  The teachers in the music department are of the highest quality.  I would highly recommend this institution to anyone looking to study music or anything else the university may offer."
Sophomore,5,Loyola University of New Orleans is great because it is in one of the best locations for students to study and live. As well if you are an international student there is a huge Latino community and also other minority groups that are pretty strong. The business school has started to grow every semester and has demonstrated connection with various companies around the country. I would definitely recommend it.
Sophomore,5,I love how small and cozy everything is here! It is definitely the perfect match for me. Some of the teachers here are absolutely amazing and you learn so much from them.
Freshman,5,"I love Loyola!!! After finishing my freshman year i can safely say it was one of the best years of my life, they are the embodiment of all that a liberal arts college should be! The faculty are patient and extremely proficient in teaching their fields. All of the jazz and music therapy faculty not only began to give the skills and knowledge needed for my career, but have given my peers and I ample opportunity to explore and experience internships, volunteer, and work opportunities in the city of New Orleans. Campus life is great, everybody on campus is inspired and motivated towards their own goals and are always seeking to collaborate and learn from others. The school itself reflects the city of New Orleans, it is individualistic, diverse, and is a safe place to explore different career paths and multiple forms of artistic expression. Couldn't have asked for a better first year of college!"
Niche User,5,"I have been an exchange student at Loyola University New Orleans during the Spring Semester 2018, and it's one of the best things that have happened in my life! Loyola is a really friendly and cozy university, the campus is small but that gives you the chance to get to know almost everyone. The party scene is really good, you have the Boot at 5 minutes walking from campus, and believe me, you'll spend more time there than in your dorm. You also have Bruno's and TJ Quills, and don't forget Downtown! You can easily get to Bourbon st. with the streetcar. Also, New Orleans is such a special city. You have Mardi Gras (Jazz Fest, French Quarter Festival...) and almost every weekend there is something new to celebrate!! If you are doubting about going to Loyola, don't doubt anymore, this is the place to be!!!"
Freshman,5,"Loyola is a progressive university full of unique accepting individuals. With students from not only  around the country but all around the world, Loyola students bring a lively and artsy vibe to campus no matter what their major. It’s a great place to learn both in and out of the classroom while enjoying great professors, great music and america’s Most colorful city."
Niche User,5,"I think the Loyola university of New Orleans campus is awesome. The professors and the staff are friendly, courteous and extremely helpful to new students and current students. I believe attending their beautiful New Orleans campus will be a truly amazing experience and help each individual attending to become an outstanding citizen and person ."
Junior,5,"Loyola University New Orleans is a very liberal, diverse school that has a lot to offer. As a jesuit university, it preaches morals and ethics without attaching itself harshly to Catholicism. Everyone here is welcomed with open arms and you will meet lots of interesting people. Its a small school, but is located right next to Tulane University, so you get the benefits of attending a  big school while attending a small university."
Freshman,5,"Loyola is an amazing University! It has good food, a great location, and its a very friendly enviornment."
Freshman,5,"I love going to school at (loyola) because the kinds of students that the university attracts. I have been able to make some great connections, the staff and faculty at the school are always willing to help and push you to get where you want to be. I am personally a part of the Music Therapy program and I would say it is one of the best programs on campus, and one of the best programs in general for Music Therapy, our professors are very well-versed  and are very hopeful in the learning process, whatever level musician you are. In general I just love how  much of a tight knit community the school has and how much it makes its students feel at home."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Loyola University New Orleans is the amount of diversity and inclusion. Students of all backgrounds feel extremely welcomed.  
The school holds many after school events that all can enjoy. 
 This institution truly values the passions of each aspiring student.
The thing that I would like to see change is that there should be an increase in the amount of professors with different ethnic backgrounds. This would increase the amount of diversity that the school strives to achieve."
Junior,5,Such a small school creates a very tight community. Professors are very involved and lots of opportunity for undergraduate research.
Freshman,5,I really like how the staff is willing to help students at every step of the way of their college career.
Sophomore,5,"Loyola University is an amazing place to be part of. The community, peers, and educators instantly become a very present and helpful part of your life. The sense of community and belonging in this school is absolutely wonderful. Perhaps, Loyola is extremely resourceful and owns many different connections that facilitate your changes of gaining experience within your field in many ways. Additionally, Loyola's educators aren't just full time professors, but are active workers within the fields that they teach. Loyola is a place that you will not regret to be part of. I certainly do not!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Loyola. It is welcoming, academically challenging and a beautiful campus. It's located in a great part of New Orleans and it's easy to get off campus for a job, event or party. There are dozens of cheap and really good restaurants around, plus shopping on Magazine Street or relaxing in Audubon Park. The students are happy, intelligent and socially conscious while the layout of the school promotes safety since it's so well lit and visible. It takes about 5 minutes to get from one side of campus to the other, so getting to class from the dorms or parking garages is easy. The classes are interesting and it's easy to register for the classes you want, since advisors will always help you select classes that fit your schedule and interests. There is plenty of green space around campus and at the park across the street so it's easy to get away from city life if need be."
Alum,5,"Loyola was where I really saw myself grow as a soloist and an orchestral musician. Even on my time off from classes I received volunteer and career opportunities. Helping with the Viola section while volunteering to play with the Greater New Orleans Youth Orchestra under Dr. Jean Montes was a great learning experience for me and the students I worked with. Playing in ensemble 504 was another way for me to excel and visualize how the orchestral world operated. While in school we played some of the best and professional pieces of the classical world. I also was given the opportunity to perform with Mrs. Nadja Solerno Sonnemberg and Mark O’Connor, which was both educational and thrilling. Both musicians were very inspirational and it was a great honor to perform with them. Overall Loyola wasn’t easy but I’m glad to say that the experience I had was very life changing and hope that I can utilize what I’ve learned to further my career in music."
Junior,5,"To be fair, Loyola was not my first choice college. It wasn't until my sophomore year that I really fell in love with this place and knew I wanted to stay here and major in journalism. Thanks to Loyola, I discovered what I want to do career-wise and the type of person I want to be. The small student body means you are really close with all of your friends and you often get one-on-one instruction from your professors. Loyola is easily and home and family away from home."
Freshman,5,"I chose a school not close to home. At first I was homesick but within a month I started to feel connected. By thanksgiving I had a great group of friends and really enjoyed my classes and professors. When I went home for Christmas I felt like I was actually leaving my home and knew I would want to come back after the break. When I returned for my 2nd semester, I was excited for my new classes and looking forward to spending the next few years here."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Loyola has been great! The people are so nice and living in New Orleans is a once in a lifetime chance.
College Freshman,5,"I really enjoy Buddig Hall, I have plenty of space and everything is really clean. Definitely nice having my own bathroom, only to share with my 3 suitemates. Everything is close and good quality. I heard Biever isn't as good, but it's easy to make friends there since everything is communal. Carrolton is great also, I've been in there and it is quiet, spacious and clean"
College Freshman,5,I am happy with my decision to go to school here
College Sophomore,5,I love my school because it's small yet rewarding. The professors are very bright and will go out of their way to make sure their students are successful.
College Junior,5,"The value of a degree from Loyola is one of the highest.  It's equivalent with a degree from the top schools like Stanford, Yale, and Tulane.  Loyola is in the top 100 schools in the world and holds that name accurately, however, there is"
College Junior,5,There is always support when needed
College Freshman,5,Loyola New Orleans is an experience like no other. The people here are incredibly diverse and open-minded and the school is willing to help you get wherever you want to go.
College Sophomore,5,I think Greek life here is the best because it is super chill. Ultimately it is what you make of it.
College Sophomore,5,"Campus crime is very low, and any time anything happens to a student whether on campus or not, the whole student body is alerted through an email BOLO. The police are very kind and are happy to escort you anywhere you need to be after dark. Tulane has a shuttle that Loyola students can use that will pick you up at anytime if you are off of campus and need transportation back."
College Sophomore,5,Greek life at Loyola is amazing because it's not stereotypical. Most sorority girls and fraternity boys you meet you would never expect to be great. Greeks don't have their own houses so they aren't separated from the rest of campus. And most people have a good or at least indifferent opinions of the Greeks.
College Junior,5,"I find that although there is always going to be 1 or 2 teachers that everyone will hate, our professor/student interactions are great. The professors want you to be engaged and succeed in their classes and most will try to help you if you are struggling"
College Junior,5,"The small campus Greek life is very different than large campus Greek life. There is no pressure to join any of the Greek organizations on campus and there is no negative connotation from being associated with one fraternity/sorority or not being associated at all. Our sorority/fraternity life is probably one of the most diverse Greek life organizations. We have people of all faiths and all races. Our Greek life is meant to include, not exclude."
Sophomore,4,Loyola University is a very good environment for students. It offers many help for students who can't pay the university and teachers a very welcoming.
Senior,4,I like Loyola's small class sizes and how you get to know some professors very well. Their dorms need updating and so does their food options.
Sophomore,4,"I think that my school did the best that they could given the short notice for stay at home orders; however, due to my major, I wish that the professors would’ve been given more time to plan for online learning."
Sophomore,4,"I am in my second semester at Loyola and so far I am very impressed by how the school is run.  The teachers are well informed and take time with the students, due to the university being small."
Freshman,4,The school is very well rounded and diverse. While the campus is quite small the staff and professors are very liberal and open minded. If you are looking dor a smaller campus with a home vibe Loyola will be a great fit for you.
Sophomore,4,I love Loyola because it is my home away from home.  All my professors are super nice and work with you and actually seem to care about how you do.  I definitely would recommend anyone interested to come check out the campus.
Freshman,4,"Overall, the experience I have right now at Loyola is pretty great. There are some great people, and lots of diversity. Everyone on campus are really there for you and push you to be your best self. The only thing about Loyola that can be a problem to anyone are  the expenses. knowingly Loyola is a private school and it isn't cheap but some things are a little bit on the expensive side in which you should probably get for freer instead of getting money out of your pocket when you really don't have it to begin with."
Freshman,4,"It’s good, a lot of programs and ways of getting connected. Wish the Tyrion was cheaper but overall pretty good school."
Senior,4,"I loved my experience at Loyola University New Orleans.  I majored in music therapy, and found my professors and other faculty were very helpful and competent in their positions.  What I would like to see changed at this university is the turnover rate of workers.  I have seen my professors and other faculty members be too far stretched in their positions, and in turn it has strayed them from the jobs they were originally hired for.  As far as professors, I have seen amazing professors be laid off or leave for a better position in academia at another university.  I hope with the upcoming classes these problems will change."
Sophomore,4,"I love this school, the campus is amazing, and the professors are great. They also offer a lot of financial aid to students which is beneficial to many."
Freshman,4,Loyola is a great liberal arts school that lets you explore a wide variety of interests. The campus is beautiful and the teachers are helpful during office hours. This is my first year in Loyola and I have felt welcomed due to the diversity the campus provides. I am excited for my next 3 years at this university!
Freshman,4,Very friendly people and kind teachers who are passionate and care about their subject. I would recommend going if you can afford it. The students and staff are very welcoming. The food choices are pretty good as well. Gorgeous campus and good for nice walks.
Freshman,4,"I love the diversity and community aspects of Loyola. The academics are great, and many students move into graduate school (including medical, nursing, business, and law school). The only drawbacks right now are the transition between presidents has been shaky, and financially the school has made some poor decisions (also we don’t have a football team)."
Graduate Student,4,"The tradition and atmosphere are great. Being an online graduate student, little time is spent on campus but they are inclusive and make you feel part of the University."
Sophomore,4,"Loyola University is a great school for education, its networking, and its historical background. But on the other hand I believe that Loyola can do better in its student social activities and its clubs specifically the Black Student Union."
Freshman,4,"I like the experience, the food court, the dorms and the sports complex. I love Loyola I want to go there next year."
Junior,4,"I love the economics department and their focus on public choice and Austrian economics. I dislike the low level of academic and intellectual interest in my fellow students, it makes classroom discussions very difficult."
Freshman,4,"It is definitely an experience for the books. I had the pleasure of entering college in the spring semester, not the fall. The hoops that I had to jump through was ridiculous. I was told I received a scholarship and then had that same scholarship taken away from me. I wasn't told I was admitted into the program I auditioned for until the day of orientation. Despite all of this, I had met an admissions counselor who helped me every step of the way. Despite all of the miscommunication and craziness that Loyola put me through, I now know what I want to do with my life. So thank you Loyola for putting me in one of the hardest places of my life because now the rest is easy."
Junior,4,"As an English major, Loyola University New Orleans has given me an amazing opportunity to hone my skills as a writer and also advance myself as a overall student."
Sophomore,4,"I love the environment, diversity, and jesuit values that make Loyola New Orleans such a wonderful place. The professors are very unique and most are attempting to mold you into an independent free speaker. The only problem I have is with the organization of Loyola, at times, with the dining hall and financial aid office. However, I can honestly say that I feel transformed by my time at Loyola. I feel I understand the world better, and learning in New Orleans, such a unique place, only adds to the experience and makes it easier to apply the skills and knowledge you learn to real life."
Freshman,4,"Loyola is a very close-knit community that often shows care and support for their students. Unfortunately, like many universities, Loyola tends to lack awareness and lack of diversity. Overall I've enjoyed my time here so far."
Junior,4,"Community is a gathering that embodies the best of our contributions to both ourselves and to others around us. In Loyola, you see plenty of it. Diversity and a small, tightly knit, yet willingly open environment are all part of the Loyola experience. Your college experience is neither diluted or hindered from any contending masses of people, but is still both competitive and well designed. The dorms and athletics department, while sufficient, could do much better with cleanliness, size, and competition."
Sophomore,4,"If you're someone who is into the arts or simply would love to be surrounded by a carefree environment as a business major, then this is the perfect school for you. The professors —whether or not you take a class of theirs— are very helpful, encouraging, down to earth people. The only downside I would say is the price of the school as well as the scholarship award amount. Another thing would be how the student must pay in full before attending classes. This could be a great setback for many students with incredible potential."
Freshman,4,"I really like how diverse my university is, you really get to see and converse with all races and cultures. I would like to see better dorms and a more active student life."
Graduate Student,4,Loyola is a great school if you're looking for a place that is supportive and creates an environment that makes you feel like everyone is rooting for them. The professors are surprisingly available and encourages students to visit during office hours and will meet any time of the day (of their availability) if office hours won't work.
Sophomore,4,I like that it's a small campus so professors know who you are and they care about you. I would like for students to be more invokve in campus because not so many care about what it's going on
Junior,4,"Loyola University in New Orleans is composed of a diverse student body, all of whom are passionate about social justice issues. The community at this college is very small and tight-knit, you will recognize a friendly face almost everywhere on campus. What sealed my decision in attending this university is the intimacy of small lecture courses, and a maneuverable campus. While larger state schools can make one feel lost in a crowd of thousands, Loyola's staff makes an effort to get to know each of their students. Since the lecture classes are smaller than typical university's, it stimulates effective discussion and debate. Moreover, the campus is very easy to navigate, which also makes for a comforting environment. Lastly, I think the college could benefit from providing a wider range of food selections for its students. Since many do not own a car to drive to local eateries, it would be beneficial for the school to provide more food vendors."
Freshman,4,"My experience here at great. I had a couple of teachers who I wasn't a big fan of, but everything else was great. It is possible to balance work, school and a sport. Also staff here is pretty helpful when you ask them questions."
Niche User,4,Loyola University is a pretty good school. It's a private college & alot of people succeed & thrive in the present environment.
Sophomore,4,"I am a music industry major at loyola and it was a great decision. However, if you're a science kid, it may not be your best bet. But if you are super artsy it's definitely the place for you. It's a great campus environment of creativity and support for those endeavors. I love the honors program because it is a small, tight knit community with cool class choices (cults and religions filled my religion req) and helpful  advantages (special study spaces, people bring in free food to share, can check out books for a longer time, good community service opportunities). The music industry program is amazing and different from any other one I have experienced because it gives you a broad, universal view of the music industry and then you can apply it to your own goals by specializing by joining on campus companies and clubs to further your experience in that area, such as the on campus live sound company and recording company."
Sophomore,4,This university has a lot to offer if you are looking for one that is smaller than a state university. The small population allows students to receive help from their professors very easily through their given office hours.
College Junior,4,"So far, the experience has been rewarding. I am already utilizing what I have learned in the lecture halls in my workplace."
College Junior,4,I love living on campus
College Junior,4,"The school is very small, welcoming, and warm.  It feels like home and the classes are not huge which makes it easier to learn.  Most professors are always available and very open to helping students succeed."
College Freshman,4,"I think a huge part of the Loyola appeal is that the cool truly cares about each individual in every aspect of their lives, and this shows in their Health and Wellness programs."
College Sophomore,4,"The small classes are great, and most professors are really knowledgeable of their field and have experience in their field, especially in the Mass Comm school."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are very interesting in the Honor's Program. Because they are interdisciplinary, you can pretty much get the classes to count for whatever you want. Teachers are smart, helpful, and caring. Classes contain about 15 people, 20 at the most. The only problem I have with it is that it is almost like also having an English major. All of the classes require a lot of reading and writing."
College Sophomore,4,"Loyola is amazing. It's full of people for all the country, and it's in one of the greatest cities in the world. As a non-music major, I'm not in love with how much of the school are music majors, which seems to be about 50%. It's easy to fill like you don't belong when surrounded by musicians."
College Junior,4,We have a website (Employola) that is dedicated specifically to help students find jobs and internships and your advisors are always available to meet with to discus your options and they have connections within the community that will help you find a job/internship.
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on campus, even at night. Outside of campus at night I don't feel very safe unless I'm with a group of  people"
College Junior,4,"Our gym/athletic facility has everything I would need as an average, non-sports playing student including: a pool, a weight room, workout equipment, and exercise classes such as yoga and twerk-and-tone."
College Junior,4,Loyola helps create connections for students that help them in pursuing their careers.
College Junior,4,"Depends on what building you are in. Carrollton is beautiful and the rooms are nice, but Buddig is a little old looking."
College Sophomore,4,There's theft here and there but nothing too serious. LUPD is always on campus.
College Junior,4,I personally almost always feel safe and comfortable on campus. There are always campus police officers on bikes roaming around campus.
College Junior,4,"The athletic facility is bigger than any other I have seen. It is used by athletic students and non-athletic students. School spirit is pretty high at Loyola. Every Wednesday, it is Maroon and Gold Day and that is when students where Maroon and Gold Loyola Regalia to show school spirit."
College Junior,4,I am getting a top notch education that is preparing me for medical school. The diversity of my school is what makes it unique.
College Freshman,4,"Having not attended yet, I've heard great things and I'm extremely excited to attend."
College Freshman,4,Loyola has pretty good security as far as being on campus.
College Freshman,4,Campus life is campus life. Convenient and what you make it.
College Freshman,4,"The school is not that big, so classes are nice."
College Sophomore,4,My school is passionate about instilling in their students a desire to help those in need.
College Sophomore,4,Always something going on on the weekends so you'll have something to do.
College Sophomore,4,Pretty good. There are bars and house parties to attend.
College Sophomore,4,It is hard work but it is challenging in a good way.
College Sophomore,4,People seem to know when they need to step in and when they don't.
College Sophomore,4,We live in New Orleans so there is only so much that they can do. LUPD patrols 24/7 throughout campus and does put an effort towards safety.
College Sophomore,4,The School of Mass Communication has a reputation of being one of the more high achieving majors and they give us lots of help and opportunities to help us find internships and jobs.
College Student,4,I am very interested in going to Law school and i believe the history of New Orleans and the community work that I can do in the area will assist me with my goal.
College Student,4,I will be a freshman this year and my visit was limited. These answers are based on a two day visit I look forward to the fall with an open mind.
Sophomore,2,"The staff does not care for students, programs are being cut, teachers are being fired, do not come here unless you want to do music or truly love new orleans."
Alum,2,"Large stoner population. Very nice professors. Lovely city. Bad athletics, but very artsy (especially music)"
College Sophomore,2,"They definitely do not prioritize living conditions here, as the dorms are way below the quality of dorms at other schools. What's nice about Beiver Hall is that you're living with most of your friends."
College Sophomore,2,Professors expect you to know everything and grade really hard.
College Freshman,2,My roommate is awful and the rooms are so small that you get no space from them.
College Freshman,2,I am a student athlete and the facilities are subpar. We have to drive 30 minutes everyday to get to the track where there are so many people. No one goes to any games or anything on campus and as a student athlete we get no merchandise at all to represent our school.
College Sophomore,2,There is evident drug use in the dormitories and it is aggravating.
College Freshman,2,"The freshman residence hall, Biever Hall, is very dirty and doesn't have a renovated feel to it."
College Freshman,2,"There is a small Greek Life scene, but they are irrelevant."
College Freshman,2,Loyola N.O. has recently earned a rep for their cost (tutition).
College Freshman,2,The OR disappoints 90 percent of the time
Recent Alumnus,2,Financial Aid advisers are not very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Alcohol plays a big part, and off campus is unsafe"
Recent Alumnus,2,This college doesn't even have a football team.
College Freshman,2,The verification process is hell. Loyola's no help
College Freshman,2,The street car is 1.50 but it takes about an hour to get downtown from Loyola. Taxis are not only expensive but they are hard to find and sometimes take up to an hour to come to pick you up.
College Freshman,2,"The majority of students drink and do drugs. Being in New Orleans and walking distance from a bar, most Loyola freshman drink more than twice a week. This past coming year the drug scene was horrible. I could smell weed from my dorm room almost daily and almost weekly someone was being taken to the hospital for a ""bad trip"""
College Sophomore,2,Loyola's school spirit barely exists and no one ever participates in sporting events. Our gym is also very small and not many people go to it.
College Freshman,2,We only offer a handful of actual sports and that includes Clubs. No one goes to games/matches or even talks about them unless they are a participant. The facilities are adequate. The indoor track is absolutely horrid; it's too small and it's a square shape. The weight room is about 10 ft by 15 ft so one can only use it if less than 15 people are there.
College Sophomore,2,"Our gym is very small and there are no specified practice quarters for the teams at the school. Therefore, if you're playing basketball with your friends in the gym, you might get kicked out one day for basketball practice. Or say there's a volleyball game in the afternoon; they close the gym for most of the day to setup for the volleyball game. The weight room is also small. So if a team is having a group lifting session, you might have to wait a while to finish your workout. Not many people care about the athletics on campus other than the friends and family of people on the teams. We aren't even NCAA, so we're not taken very seriously. "
College Freshman,2,I do not go out too often but when I do I expect to have a great time. I do not get to experience fun during the parties.
College Sophomore,2,We have to live here for two years???!?!?
College Sophomore,2,"With the enrollment rate falling, Loyola needs to be more involved in financial aid affairs. Most kids can't afford it or leave after a few semesters, because it gets harder and harder. Living on campus is so expensive. "
College Freshman,2,"Pros:
-10 minute walk tops to class, meaning from the time you pick up your bag in your dorm room, to the time you walk into the classroom door.
-free laundry. you don't have to pay every time you wash your clothes or dry them.
-bed matresses are pretty nice, I guess

Cons:
-always in varying states of uncleanliness. Showers are usually gross, and the lounge area with the kitchenettes seem to always have grease or some slimy grossness on them.
-loud, and people easily sneak alcohol and drugs in it seems like. 
-NO SOUNDPROOFING! I cannot tell you how often I've heard people singing, drunk talking, screaming, and participating in ""private time"" during the night AND day.
-planning when and how to do laundry is like planning a military operation. You need to observe the times when the machines are most likely to be available down to the minute, time when you get down to the laundry room perfectly, know what colors and/or clothing you will wash, and know exactely how much clothing can fit in the machine. Too early, your stuck sitting there akwardly hovering. Too late, your next chance is 15-60 minutes later."
College Freshman,2,"GET A ETHERNET CABLE!!!!!!!
 
I was one of the students who started the year thinking ""Oh, I won't need that. Wifi isn't that important, and I bet they are exaggerating.""
THEY ARE NOT EXAGGERATING!
The wifi is down, slow, or plain old screwed up 75% of the time, especially on the weekends. The tech for the wifi rarely comes in, and does not come in at all on the weekend. Schedule sign up is very crazy, especially for upperclassmen, so the wifi will NOT WORK.

I REPEAT: GET. AN. ETHERNET. CABLE!"
College Sophomore,2,"I wouldn't exactly know much about this, especially since I haven't even found a job to reach this stage yet. However, the general costs of apartments/houses in the are pretty hefty when I did some searching, but typically are almost always ads for people looking for a reliable roommate and a few supervisors/professors/what-have-you are willing to assist in putting you in that area."
College Junior,2,"The dorms are old. They are constantly trying to update, but I really don't think they know what they are doing. On the upside it is a small campus, and I could hop out of bed 5 minutes before class and not be late. I've only been inside Biever, Buddig, and Cabra, and out of those three, Biever may have to be the best. Unfortunately it's only for freshman, and people will drunkenly scream down the hallway at 2:30 in the morning during midterms. Also, the bathrooms don't get cleaned on weekends, so it's disgusting when you're trying to get ready before the janitorial staff has a chance to clean in on Monday morning. I didn't get to live in Buddig because I only went for a year, but I don't really remember hearing too much complaining from them. I stayed there for orientation, and the mattresses were super thin, but they have nicer desks and little lounges on each floor. Cabra is on the Broadway campus, so it's a bit of a ways away, but when I visited a friend there, I noticed the closet space was pretty decent. Plus it's apartment style, so you have a living area you share with three other people, which is nice on a social aspect. I don't know anything about Carrollton except that it's like living among the gods... Seems to cost about that, too."
College Junior,2,"Multicultural hippies. cool kids, very young though. hardly any adult students"
College Freshman,2,Loyola does not have a football team and students don't really have school spirit. The focus is mainly on music.
College Junior,2,"In the uptown area, there are limited shopping centers. They are located on Carrollton, Claiborne, and Tchopitoulas streets. In between those streets are numerous residences. So you would have to walk. The rent in the area, as expected, usually starts at $900 and up, unless you move in one of the low-income areas (which I would not recommend, unless you have lived in those areas before). Cheaper apartments are found on the outskirts of New Orleans in Metarie, and on the Westbank (Gretna). But, then you would need a car, and rush hour traffic is awful. No shopping centers are on St. Charles, which is where Loyola is located. You would have to take the trolley to go shopping downtown or find a bus. The public transportation btw is horrible after 7pm."
College Freshman,2,"There is sort of a lot of drinking, but I mean, it's New Orleans. If you don't drink, people won't care, personally I've never been pressured. It's really all up to you if you'll partake in drinking, but it will no doubt surround you."
College Freshman,2,"The drug scene at my school is not big at all.  There are policy enforcements of course, but no one sees drug or alcohol frequently throughout the school everyday.  There is no peer pressure for someone to go and drink or use drugs if someone didn't want to."
College Freshman,2,Poor freshman living in doubles/triples.....Hard to get solid upperclassmen housing
College Sophomore,2,"We always recieve BOLO (Be on the Look Out) emails about thefts and robberies around campus. So safety is somewhat of an issue, not so much on campus , but off and around campus. I wouldn't encouirage walking alon especially at night."
College Junior,2,"If caught drinking underage or using drugs on campus, the police and Residential Life are quite strict as far as sanctions go, but Student Affairs will try to get you help, either with counseling or treatment. You may be asked to withdraw from the university."
College Sophomore,2,Weather in New Orleans can be really unpredictable.  It will be pouring rain and storming one  morning and then in the afternoon the sun will be shining.  Not to mention the constant threat of hurricanes in the fall semester.  When there's a storm campus pretty much floods.
College Sophomore,2,"Not My Taste – the city is supposedly known for its great food, but most places flat out suck. places to eat especially around campus are overpriced on purpose and it's not worth it when the food isn't even that great."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Many Options – if you want to live off-campus, that's up to you. there's not a lot of options, because places to rent go quickly. you will need at least two roommates to pay rent because apartments are stupid expensive here."
College Sophomore,2,"Students are definitely not involved in sports, our teams aren't the best, and there's not much school spirit. However, our facilities are nice."
College Junior,2,"We have a few fraternities/sororities, and they are all pretty quiet and don't make a lot of trouble.  True, one sorority has meetings reserved solely for discussing ""date rape"" but none of that has ever happened with them.  Of course they party, but its off campus and nobody gets hurt or dies, and even then, not many people goes, because there aren't as many people who are into that kind of thing.  There are a few business/educational fraternities, but they are co-ed and are there for the benefit of the students.  Their events are business and they only have one party a year for the pledge class."
College Student,1,No team spirit because the sports are practically nonexistent
Recent Alumnus,1,"Off campus housing can be cheaper, but the city is dangerous ."
College Freshman,1,This is what bothers me the most about Loyola. We have ZERO school spirit what so ever.
College Freshman,1,The RA's do nothing to enforce quiet hours and the damages policy is beyond stupid. The buildings are always disgusting and no one cares.
College Junior,1,They do not help you and insist that you go to Urgent Care ALL THE TIME!
College Junior,1,"Dorms are outdated, and some look like project buildings. The cost to live in those buildings is ridiculous. But, students from other states likely have no choice."
College Junior,1,"Students are late to class because of lack of parking. you have to arrive very early to get one of free spots at the school. The tickets are outrageous, but you do need a car because the transportation system at night and late evening (for evening students) is horrible. Also there are not that many buses"
College Junior,1,They decided to close a housing unit and sent students on the other side of town to leave and made the students pay for their mistake.
College Freshman,1,The parking is a bit crazy down here in New Orleans. I feel that its because of the way the city is designed.If you want to park on campus you have to pay 400 a semester which is alot to me. You can usually find a space in the parking garage but its up to you if you want to pay that much
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrid. There is never any parking, come really early to class to find a spot."
College Junior,1,"If you're a good student, scholarships will present themselves to you. However, the cost of attendance is around 60,000, and the financial aid is s****y.Make sure you endlessly apply for scholarships and grants!"
College Sophomore,1,"Visual Arts – if you are legitimately serious about majoring in art, do not bother with loyola. the classes are limited, and are taught by the same five professors, and with only two majors to choose from, it's extremely frustrating. art majors are ignored, so don't expect any recognition or praise outside of the ten kids in your art classes because no one else cares."
College Sophomore,1,"Hard to Tell – Greek life is available on campus, but a student can have fun without it. There not alot of Greek life on campus because there are other things to do in New Orleans."
College Sophomore,1,"Buddig Hall – To start off, this place is extremely old, I would say a good 50 year old building. The washing machines rarely do a good job and are not enough for the 12 floors of students. It is very moldy everywhere around the windows even though the windows are glued shut! Most beds in the dorms cannot be moved so it is very stationary. This building unfortunately looks like a real old mental institution."

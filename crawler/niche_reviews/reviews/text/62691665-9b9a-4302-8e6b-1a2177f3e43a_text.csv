Junior,5,"My time at Miami Dade College has made me truly adore education. All of my professors were amazing, they were harsh but fair, never sugar coated everything, and made sure you understood the subjects for you to utilize them. They provide you with resources to get your work done such as reliable labs with the latest technology and information.
The College Life is so much fun, I finally got to make friends who shared the same passions of me even showing me things I never thought I would be into. The students I have encountered are very respectful, intelligent, and great to have a conversation with.
My time at Miami Dade College is something I will treasure for all my life for all the good reasons."
Sophomore,5,What I love about miami dade college is the amount of support you get while studying there. Professors and students are always willing to give out a helping hand.
Sophomore,5,Professors are very willing to understand your predicament and especially now with Covid. They are willing to help you with videos and online conferences and emailing quickly. The only thing that is okay about the system of online learning is The older professors barely know how to work the system but it is understandable.
Niche User,5,"Due to the pandemic, I had some online classes which were very interesting. The teachers were very passionate about the material and would engage with the students often. They also made sure to explain everything thoroughly so that it was easy to understand."
Niche User,5,"I like how they have good teachers for the majority of their classes. Also, I like how tight-knit the student body and faculty are, and I love how their lunch food is very diverse."
Senior,5,They have good professor that would teach you  the only thing is the fafsa since sometimes they will help you or something they won’t answer that questions you asking
Sophomore,5,I am currently taking 4 online classes due to the pandemic. The majority of my professors were able to accommodate extremely well into the online teaching experience and I can almost admit I prefer online classes over in-person classes. Having the opportunity to go back into my courses and rewatch any class session as many times as needed is extremely useful. I can study at my own pace whilst respecting assignment due dates. I do believe I will be taking online classes again for the Spring Term of 2021.
Alum,5,"I did not take online courses, because it was not widely available. Also, I preferred in person schooling. This way if I have questions, they are available."
Alum,5,"Variety of degrees and flexibility of time and days for all courses. My degree was available and additional services for all students were available,  even weekends"
Freshman,5,My experience with Miami Dade College has been great even under the circumstances of doing everything online. The professors have been very welcoming and helpful during these hard times. GO SHARKS!

Graduate Student,5,"I never took online classes, but we did have a lot of programs and files to access on the school official site as well as in the Film & TV web, which was very useful. Overall, very good experience!"
Junior,5,"Miami Dade College has numerous activities and opportunities to get involved with student life, but they do not advertise it as much so you have to go looking for these activities. The professors are really dedicated and are willing to work with students 1 on 1."
Niche User,5,I like the flexibility of the school and how they truly make getting a good education affordable. Miami Dade College gives everyone a chance to move forward.
Niche User,5,I am currently taking all of my courses online and I am thankful that Miami Dade College is working with everyone and offering all the classes I need online. If it wasn't for them offering all of these classes then I would be falling behind on my path to finish my career and for that I am thankful.Luckily when connecting online with my professors and classes has been going smoothly so far.

Freshman,5,I love how  kind the staff members are there. Its a very good community college and you make the best friends here. Its affordable and the financial aid office works with you and your aid. Just make sure to have your file completed in order to receive aid.
Freshman,5,Currently Im taking all my courses online. I am thriving as im able to work on my assignments whenever I like. I also know that I am not alone in this journey so that helps a lot.
Sophomore,5,So far my online learning experience with Miami dade college has been phenomenal. The professors ive had teach the same as if it were to be in class and make sure they are available via email and/or blackboard. The homework and tests are easily accessible.
Sophomore,5,Miami Dade college is an excellent college. The professors dedicate their time and attention towards the students. The advisors are very helpful and do the most to help you be on the right path to graduating.
Sophomore,5,What I love about MDC is the opportunity that give to every student to reach their goals. MDC has so many programs and options of payments that you will find what best fits for you. Professors and every single staff are always willing to help you.
Sophomore,5,"I took my first online class in spring. I thought that have an online class would be difficult to understand, but the professor was always willing to answer all my questions, and the platform had everything well explained with videos and powerpoints that help me a lot."
Alum,5,"I have a good experience. The advisors help all the times, send emails regularly to ensure that we received all the support required."
Alum,5,I took all my classes online and I have a good experience in learning environment. All the classes have a lot of resources clear.
Alum,5,"It has been an interesting experience. I feel safe knowing that despite the difficult situation we are experiencing, my school has not passed me by and I can continue preparing for my future from home. It was a difficult change but it was worth it."
Alum,5,"Miami Dade College has shown me that there are no barriers or limits when you want to achieve a dream. I arrived at this school without being able to speak English, only with basic knowledge, and MDC prepared to break that barrier that without knowing it I had put myself, they offered me their wonderful EAP program, and thanks to that today I no longer see any limits other than heaven. I can only thank you for having given me the opportunity and preparing for my future, thanks to this school, today I feel blessed."
Freshman,5,They have great professors and I would definitely recommend Miami Dade college for any educational purpose.
Freshman,5,"A great affordable college but very expensive custom books, there should be more options for book purchasing."
Sophomore,5,I've taken several online classes and will always recommend them to anyone working full time. Miami Dade has an excellent online program that always makes me feel as if I'm getting the full college experience.
Sophomore,5,"I feel as if I am getting my money's worth here, the professors are great and understanding. I can confide in my professors for any questions relating to the class and know they will be 100% with me."
Freshman,5,"I like how my assigned teachers were able to answer my questions regarding concepts of the class as soon as possible, and also how explicit they were when correcting me when I committed a mistake in my quizzes. Beyond that, I think that the course of ""Student Life and Skills"" helped me develop a better management in regards of my time spent in studying. Back in high school, I was pretty much a mess when it came to have a schedule and handling homework and sport. But now, I have organized myself using spreadsheets, calendars and daily reminders in my phone which helped me in the end to have the highest grade I have ever gotten in math."
Freshman,5,Due to this whole pandemic Alcazar right now remote online but they’re working hard for us who like face-to- face learning make sure they take the right precautions for us !
Freshman,5,So far excellent all around. They have handled this whole pandemic situation very well and  can’t wait to start!
Sophomore,5,"MDC cares for all its students, there's always someone there if you need help. Advisors and counselors are available through email or in person. The schools campuses are nice too."
Freshman,5,I am taking multiple classes online and with MDC it is easy-going and fun! The learning environment online isn’t easy but MDC makes it better.
Freshman,5,The staff are super nice and helpful. The professors are understanding and the campus is beautiful. It’s really amazing here.
Niche User,5,Its a very diverse college and there are many opportunities for people and would highly recommend it to anyone.
Graduate Student,5,"Im currently attending Florida International University, but I previously attended Miami Dade College Kendall campus. I strongly believe MDC is one of the best colleges there are, from organization to classes to campus life. The one thing I would change would be the layout of online services of MDC Connect and Blackboard. These online services need a face lift or upgrade since mdc connect looks from the 2010 and blackboard could definitely be upgraded. Lastly I also feel like advisors should be more attentive to the students."
Graduate Student,5,"I took multiple online classes as well as face to face classes. Online classes were decent, neither too good or bad. As I stated before I do feel like their online classes provider blackboard could be updated since it has an outdated design. In regards to the professors online they were great."
Sophomore,5,Miami Dade College is a great community college. The college has great professors and a lot of campus activities that make you feel like you belong
Sophomore,5,"The online courses are challenging since it requires a lot of time management, but at MDC and with the help of their professors everything is so much easier"
Alum,5,"Miami Dade College was the best decision I could have made for myself. The professors were amazing. They were extremely flexible and always willing to help with assignments, grades, and classwork. The courses I took while at Miami Dade College were challenging but also very ""first time student"" friendly. Many of the courses were engaging and geared towards your major."
Alum,5,"I did not take any courses online completely, but I did have professors that had blended learning which made the class more innovative and entertaining. It was much easier for the professors and students to submit assignments and be aware of the future assignments."
Sophomore,5,I would recommend Miami Dade College for the people that are not sure what they want to study. Advisors helped me decide exactly what I want to be when I grow up. I am so excited to continue on this journey to becoming a doctor.
Sophomore,5,I like Miami Dade College because it has helped me grow in many ways. The teachers I have had are patient and want students to learn. They are also understanding.
Freshman,5,MDC helped get the education I needed in order to graduate with my AA along with giving me the tools to be able to transfer.
Sophomore,5,My experience at miami dade college has been a very positive one. I honestly have learned and grown so much from this school and i can't wait to see what the rest of my education here will be like.
Sophomore,5,Miami dade has made a very smooth transition to remote learning during the whole covid 19 situation. I haven't fallen behind in any of my classes and the professors have been more than understanding with the students
Sophomore,5,Miami Dade College is all around amazing and very affordable.  It does not throw away experience for cost either.
Sophomore,5,"So far my online learning experience with Miami Dade College has been fantastic, smooth, efficient and easily understandable."
Sophomore,5,My experience at MDC has been amazing. From the type of advisement to the great teachers I feel like this school has been going great for me.
Sophomore,5,I have been taking classes on MDC online since the beginning of my college career. It has always been a breeze I love the way you can work on things in your own pace at the comfort of your home. Ever since the pandemic started the quality of their online courses has not changed in the slightest. Can not recommend enough.
Sophomore,5,"My online experience is still happening at the moment. It's definitely an adjustment, because I'm very used to interactions, especially with my professors. However, my professors have been patient with me and my classmates regarding assignments and they check in with us regarding our mental state as well."
Sophomore,5,"I am a film student at Miami Dade College, and their film program is one of the best. I am a lot of fun doing what I love. Also, I've been on the deans list twice: in my fall and spring semester. My professors have all been very helpful in making sure I understand material and that I reach my potential."
Sophomore,5,I find online classes to be extremely easy and works very well with my busy schedule. I also find it easy to learn its not just about easy assignments but learning as well.
Freshman,5,Excellent college with great resources and opportunities to grow and learn. Many class options to fit your schedule and needs and to accommodate your needs.
Niche User,5,Miami Dade College is an exceptional college! I am so we selected this school for my son. The school has hardworking individuals from the administration to the the staff and faculty. My son has received help in ever department from from professional and down to earth employees at both the North and Kendall campuses where he has attended. The school is extremely diverse. I am impressed with the teachers and extracurricular activities that they have offered my son in the school of film.
Freshman,4,"It was something new for sure. Being a freshman in college and having to balance school and your personal life is a hard thing to do at such a young age. With the pandemic going on, it most certainly made my learning experience unique. Coming together with different kinds of personalities and meeting each other virtually but also learning is something I cannot forget."
Freshman,4,"The staff are very helpful and takes their time to make sure your are comfortable. Also helping with any concerns, issues or problems."
Sophomore,4,"Starting at Miami Dade College, I was in awe of the sheer size of the Miami Dade College North Campus. It was beautiful to just look at, I could only imagine how it would feel to actually go there every day and be a part of such a grandiose college experience.  Although the campus buildings were confusing to get accommodated to, as the 8 buildings were in no certain order, I quickly found myself navigating the area just fine. The campus's math labs and library were exceptional, there was enough space and resources (computers, books, etc) to adjust to anyone's needs. One can be in a calm environment while studying and/or completing your work. I would honestly rate the college as a whole 5 stars, but the one thing that is keeping me is the fact that some of the professors I have had to take were less than satisfactory. Some professors on campus seem to have adopted the mindset that is it okay to not teach their students, to only assign work and let the students figure it out."
Freshman,4,"I love studying in this place, it has excellent teachers and although my campus (west campus) is not that big I feel that we are all like a family. Here I met my best friends and I even belong to a club focused on the environment. There are so many clubs and activities that you can join and also all the administrators and teachers are very nice, although I feel that sports and athletes should be supported more."
Junior,4,"Miami Dade College is an incredible school in almost all fronts. Good facilities, good teachers, a great variety of classes for multiple majors, good prices and plenty of campuses. The only issue I could see with the college is counseling, these professionals do not help the students on how to graduate smoothly and with success but rather just want students to graduate as soon as possible regardless of the situation."
Freshman,4,Super easy and convenient. All the classes are on Blackboard. You can see at the assignments and the syllabus for the entire term.
Freshman,4,MDC is decent and easy to get into. The work is easy for the most part. I just don’t like how they take long to respond back to you.
Junior,4,I like how some professors are extremely hopeful and will help you when you need assistance. I  would like for Miami Dade college to invest more in the school so we have better services that we need for our studies.
Junior,4,I took some classes online and now with COVID-19 I have taken remote classes. They are pretty well organized and the teacher will be there for the student 110% .
Freshman,4,My learning experience with some teachers were not the best but manageable. the majority of the professors will help you so much and never let you down. This is one of the reasons why i love mdc.
Sophomore,4,"At MDC, the professors and courses I've taken have really shaped me into the student that I am today. I learned the importance of putting strong effort in every little thing I do, not just assignments. I can't say that all the professors here are great but from the ones I've taken classes with, I can definitely say that they deeply cared about their students and the work we had to do."
Sophomore,4,"After having taken a handful of classes online at MDC, I think I can say that each class had its pros and cons of being online but overall, my professors tried their best to explain the material/lectures to students. This definitely helped with my success in these classes because of the drastic change from only in person classes to strictly online."
Sophomore,4,"It has been a great experience. Variety of campus and professors is enough and besides being a college the art programs are really great especially the ones in Kendal Campus. You will find a wide variey of interesting and very student caring professors that will guide you through the process of your education. Sometimes the professor can be better than advisors. However, when it comes to online learning it stills need some improvement in communication levels in my opinion."
Sophomore,4,"I used to go to Miami Dade College- Wolfson campus for 2 years. For me, it was an amazing experience. The campus was big, spacious and modern. The teachers were great, they explained the material in an easy and understanding way. Each teacher had office hours in case you had difficulties with the material or any questions, which was great. The only negative thing I have experienced with Miami Dade College is that it always took extremely long to get some papers filled in or register for classes. But in overall it is a great college!"
Freshman,4,"I have always had problems with learning math. Nevertheless, at MDC I was able to get the highest grade I have ever gotten in my entire life with the help of my teacher. I e-mailed her (almost every week) because I had a question regarding the answers to some of the quizzes questions or in the solutions of equations in the PowerPoints she uploaded on Blackboard, and she emailed me back as soon as possible with a photo of her notebook explaining to me, step by step, how to solve the problem."
Junior,4,"I have loved my experience at Miami Dade College, the professors, advisors, and students are all nice and helpful. The only thing I wish the college had was a more college campus experience and student life. When I went to other universities to study I would want to stay on campus, when I am at Miami Dade College campus, I just want to go to class and then go home and study. I love Miami Dade College and all of the opportunities they have given me, just wish there was a better college ambiance."
Junior,4,"Online classes require a lot of patience between the students and teachers. It can be frusturating at times because of the camera, mic, and internet connection. I honestly have always preferred in person classes, so this has been an adjustment for me these past few months. But overall, all of my professors are understanding considering these circumstances."
Sophomore,4,"I took some classes online, and they good. The teachers provide you with their office hours and are usually always quick to answer emails. If you have any questions they are more than happy to clarify."
Niche User,4,The Miami Dade College Wolfson campus was a good experience overall as my first secondary institution as the campus was very pleasing to be in especially the fact that it is in the heart of downtown Miami with many places to study or explore between classes.
Niche User,4,My online learning experience with Miami Dade College was maybe not the best since there was confusion at the beginning but as one starts to acclimate themselves it gets better and the professors have so far been understanding and easy to communicate with.
Sophomore,4,"Professors are doing a great job, however, some still need some coaching on the shift to home learning."
Sophomore,4,"Honestly, great college and great teachers. Students are constantly involved in activities around the school although there aren't many."
Senior,4,My online learning experience was great. when it comes to certain classes such as a lab classes it was a little difficult on trying to figure out how to work certain programs but I was able to get through it and complete the course. I appreciated it because I was able to do it from the comfort of my home and it also helped me save some gas from traveling to the campus.
Niche User,4,"The online learning experience with Miami Dade can be significantly better than in person it all depends on your professor. Depending on your instructor it is either much more simplified or it can be much much more boring and can feel like a slog. I graduated this past summer semester from Miami Dade with my AA in International Relations. Due to COVid-29 my spring and summer semester were remote/online.  For one of my classes my professor put up all of our assignments with attached reading and brief 30 minute lectures. For another class one professor acted like his class was the only class we were taking and posted lectures that were rarely under 2 hours long and forced us to answer over 20 questions asking about what was covered in the lecture using short answer form. This was in addition to meeting twice a week 2 hour
I experienced two drastically different teaching styles and I quite frankly enjoyed my class where my time was valued by my professor and I still learned quite a bit."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus. The professors are very helpful and usually have great office hours. It is difficult to speak to financial aid or advisement.
Freshman,4,"It really depends on the professor you take but for the most part, it has been great and they are willing to help you with anything."
Alum,4,"Miami Dade Honors was an unforgettable two year experience. The environment is very healthy and busy. The campus is surrounded by several restaurants and stores, as well as bayside. The only change I would like to see is the renewal of the buildings. some are old and dirty."
Freshman,4,I am not a great online learner but I did take a few because of the coronavirus pandemic and some of the professors really made it easy on you so you would not have to worry about finding things out because we were not in the classroom.
Freshman,4,"Overall, Miami Dade College was something I was not expecting, I was not expecting such great professors that know exactly what they are doing, that of course because you choose most of them if you do it on time. even then they are great and kind and try their best to teach you what you need to learn."
Sophomore,4,Professors are excellent they care a lot about their students. The rest was very average but they offer me a lot of opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"They were easy to manage and if you have any questions, most of the time professors are there to answer."
Freshman,4,The admittance office was very helpful and guided me at the beginning of the semester. They were available to help me with any questions as a new student returning to school after 20 years of being out of the field. They helped me select the best classes to match my children's schedule so that it would be a smoother transition for me. Even before I explained the kids demanding schedule the advisor was looking into a very smooth path for me and giving me every e resources i needed to susceed. As a mother of 4 and taking a big step into the new era of our norm it was helpful knowing that they where there at the begining to help prepare me.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Miami-Dade College was a positive one over all. I learn vital skills, not only for my professional career but also for my life. They help you whenever you need it. Like all schools there's positives and negatives. I believe they can improve on wait times for things to get done."
Freshman,4,"I like the campus. There are many different cultures, races, and ethnicities. It is very diverse. I like the food and the nice professors. I am getting a good quality education. What I would like to change is the traffic because it is always busy and hectic."
Niche User,4,I enjoyed the online experience more then the in person experience. I learned more and had work that was pertaining to my exams.
Sophomore,4,"My online experience at Miami Dade was very good. Knowing that classes were online and not face to face, professors accommodated students to their best abilities. Also, they were sure to remain in contact with students, listing reasonable office hours and means of communication."
Sophomore,4,"What I liked about Miami Dade college is the cost efficient option it is for college students to complete their AA degree. Though it is not a university or big name school it still offers that scenario. Theta are multiple clubs, a gym, and very diverse student life."
Freshman,4,The online learning experience is done very well through the use of Blackboard. The platform used is easy to navigate and professors are willing to answer any concerns. Contacting professors is done through email and they respond within a matter of a few days max.
Freshman,4,"Miami Dade provides an amazing opportunity to transfer out once you earn your AA. There are tons of professors to choose from, all willing to help you learn. The environment is open to those who seek help and tutoring is always available. Many students transfer from here, so it is a great way to earn credits."
Graduate Student,4,"My time at Miami Dade College was amazing. I've obtained my A.A. in Psychology with ease and have learned not only inside the classroom but outside as well. I was provided with everything I needed: a computer, calculator, study area, books, amazing teachers, and the community. Miami Dade College is affordable. If you are looking for a school to attend I highly recommend this amazing school! Professors help inside and outside the classroom. As for the college itself, they have job fairs and opportunities to learn within your field of study. They help with jobs within the school to help with costs. Professors are super helpful. Everyone that works for the college is super nice and willing to go out of their way to help. Miami Dade College focuses not just on the academic part of their students' lives but also on the emotional aspect of it. They hold mental health events where there are free massages and have a counselor on campus to help with the stress of life."
Sophomore,4,"I had to take a lot of online classes my second year due to very little to no availability of on campus classes. My online experience was good, I chose highly rated professors and it was pretty easy and flexible. there is a lot of time to complete assignments if you don't leave things for last minute. Of course though, my only bad experience was having to call the office for a simple question and they didn't want to help me out and they spoke very rude."
Graduate Student,4,I only took online classes during my last semester there and they where pretty normal. The teachers where nice and replied to my emails fast. I still prefer going to class over online though but that’s just my personal preference.
Alum,4,I loved my Miami Dade Honors College Community. Coming to the end of my time at Miami Dade I have realized how formative these two years were. The community at Miami Dade College really helped me flourish and confirm that I was in the right field of study. I have had many impactful professors that I appreciate from the bottom of my heart and my education would not have been possible without them. I have met incredible people who have challenged the way I look at life and made me realize that things are not always what they seem.
Sophomore,4,Teachers and staff are always prepared to assist the students in need. They make sure their students understand the material and always answer any questions we have. Miami Dade is a great college to go to and it is affordable for anyone. They offer several scholarships for others who need money to pay for school. Sometimes the teachers give out pictures of the book so that their students do not have to buy the books. Miami Dade is a great way to save money and continue your career.
Alum,4,"MDC is a great community college. If you want to learn and push your self, I think you can by choosing the right professors. If you want to just take easy classes and pass them relaxed, you can do that too. Some of the professors just don't want to be there, but there are so many that its really up to you to do the research on professors. The administration can be horrible sometimes and helpful others from my experience. Overall, I had a great time and it got me to places where I wouldn't have from high school."
Junior,4,"Miami Dade College has made my college experience very easy going. Although sometimes it can be a little difficult with programs changing, advisors are very caring and send an email or even contact you via phone to make sure you are staying on track and on your way to graduation."
Sophomore,4,it is a fairly good school. wide diverity in not only the student population but the staff as well. The administraition puts the students education fost. a lot of opportunities and great and safe campus.
Niche User,4,"I liked that my education was all paid for by my financial aid since I didn’t have a job at the time that could help me pay for school. What really made me happy was the fact that many of the professors made their courses really easy to understand. My highest GPA was 3.78 (if I recall correctly) and I was even sent a letter by the Dean, in acknowledgement of my success. What I want to see improve is the food and student life. The fries lack in taste and the chicken tenders don’t taste good either. They need to be better in maintaining a clean and fresh food station. I have seen flies touch the tip of the sauce dispensers, and that was vile for me to witness. Ever since then, I have avoided getting sauce from there. The school needs to be more careful about who they accept into the school as I have met some people that truly didn’t care about their education. Otherwise, there’s some room for improvement, but I did like the classes and teachers."
Niche User,4,"From the people around me that has and that are in the college, have told me that it is almost as good as a university."
Alum,4,"I received both my Associate's and my Bachelor's from this school. I studied Early Childhood Education. Overall, I have had a great experience. When completing my associate's degree, the staff was not really helpful and no one could give you clear answers. However, once I got into the school of education, everyone there is there to help. They genuinely care about your success and they get to know your individual situation. The staff at the school of education was amazing!"
Senior,4,"I have been in three of the Miami Dade Campus and in general the professors are good and they are there for the student need. The campus is always full of life, the food is good as well."
Sophomore,4,"At my specific campus it is very well kept for how old the campus is, being that it is the first campus of Miami Dade College."
Freshman,4,"It a good college, with small classes sizes which helps you to be closer to the professor. Professors are good and always willing to help. Good option for people that want to save money and transfer to a 4 year university."
Senior,4,"Miami Dade College is a good place to start your college experience. For me, it was not too hard and I feel like it prepared me well for me to start FIU. Although, even though it is a good place to start it is not a good place to stay. At some point you have to leave because Miami Dade won't help you get the best job. That is why I am going to FIU so I can start my bachelor's and hopefully make it to medical school one day."
Alum,4,"I loved to see the diversity in the community college because you definitely get to learn about others and implement their culture into your own life. The only thing I did not like was that some professors were very difficult to understand. The only thing that I would like to see change is the implementation of a more modern-like environment onto North campus.  Out of all of the campuses, it is still the one that looks the oldest."
Sophomore,4,"I attended Miami Dade College knowing their education system was not the best. However, I was greatly surprised. I met faculty who genuinely cared about my future plans and tried to guide me in accomplishing the best. Like any college, I had bad professors as well as good. But, if you truly try to engage in the community, I guarantee Miami Dade will not disappoint. I met remarkable staff members who made Miami Dade so welcoming and a safe place for many students."
Sophomore,4,Miami Dade has truly impacted my life for the better. The people I have met and have made my experience wonderful.
Sophomore,4,Overall great experience. The occasional bad professor here and there but there are many tools one can use to receive help. The campus is a bit bland but functional.
Sophomore,4,"The college is great, its campuses are very diverse and open to all. The quality of some of the teachers is what lacks. Some are incredible and may change your life, but some are so terrible. They give little about the students or if they understand the subject or not. other than that, it's pretty good."
Freshman,4,"I like involved most professors could be. They are most of the time, if not all the time available when requested."
Junior,2,"It was just as impactful as being there physically, the lectures were pretty dull and the homework wasn't challenging."
Freshman,2,I never took any classes online I don't know if it would be much easier or the same. I may not go to the school but anyting I might try to take the class online that's all I know
Niche User,2,"I would like to see a change in the level of education, I understand that it is a community college but there are people that want to learn a thrive. I like that it is affordable and my workload is surprisingly low."
Sophomore,2,"I was on my own there. When I first started in 2016 I was completely lost. The counselors didn't seem interested in helping me further my education. I felt like another brick in the wall. The school looks like a prison and not many friendly faces. Regardless of all that, I still managed to graduate with an associates. It's not impossible to graduate college but I definitely wish my experience there was more like how they advertise. You walk around campus and you see happy faces on posters but when you actually look at a real  person. They're either looking at you with an ungenerous look or they look regretful. It's because of this that I decided to continue my education elsewhere."
Sophomore,2,Personally feel separated from students who receive financial aid. Favoritism makes me discourage the school and want to drop out.
Works Here,2,The system of Miami Dade is absolutely terrible. I wish I never took classes here. The administration is a mission. literally trying to get anything done is a mission. they make it a terrible experience and they dont help at all.
Sophomore,2,Horrible experiences. Most of the staff and faculty there are bad and don't what they're doing. Place looks really old. There's some people who are very good people and know what they're doing and look out for the people's best interest.
Alum,2,It's hard to achieve anything with any of the school offices. One would think with multiple campuses at least one would provide better services but that is not the case. They could improve by answering calls and emails.
Graduate Student,2,"MDC is a great school with a lot of potential for the student, But I do believe the major problem with the school is with the staff  that is running the system. The staff is no very professional or  helpful at all and most important It feels that they only help the people they personally know ( No a very fairly place )."
Sophomore,2,"Miami Dade College is a whirlwind. Teachers don't invest time in students, financial aid is mediocre, Student Life barely exists"
Freshman,2,"You go to ""learn,"" not to interact with other students or even the school in general. There isn't much college pride, which isn't surprising."
College Senior,2,I can say of the 10 professors I have had in college.... maybe 3 have actually cared for their students. Everyone else is literally there to collect a paycheck.
College Freshman,2,"I haven't enjoyed my online classes. Maybe I just enjoy sitting in a good old-fashioned classroom and learning from a human in front of me, but I've never been able to immerse myself in my studies online."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a very little help from a career center, you have to count on yourself."
College Sophomore,2,"Advisors provide career services help which is ok. No job/internship prospects, low chance of recruiting in campus."
College Freshman,2,Only if you have financial aid
College Junior,2,Courses aren't the issues it's the professor's who don't seen to care at all.
College Junior,2,"Unfortunately Miami Dade College is the only community college for us here in miami.  It's a pretty bad school, some professor's could care less if they taught you anything at all. Some just wasted your time worth fake work, I had a teacher once have us to origami as a class assignment"
College Junior,2,I have yet to encounter any of this.
Recent Alumnus,2,Too many students working at the front desks and sent me to many different places across campus for a simple answer. I had to bother them for weeks to finally find out what I needed. No communication in the office between adult and student staff.
College Sophomore,2,"There is non, i was selected for honor society back in 2015. i tried to get a hold of them for over 6 months without any of my phone calls being returned from the school, only to find out it was a mix up and i a male was selected for a female honor society."
College Junior,2,"It's incredibly unrealistic. I'm online because I need a class that is convenient and portable. But if you're planning to do other things then good luck because online teachers suffocate you with assignments and login attendance and after all the work you do, it barely matters because you're final exam is the grade that actually determines whether or not you pass. It's creul."
College Sophomore,2,"By using third-party resources, it is easy to weed out bad professors. That said, it is still difficult to study effectively while weeding through all of the administrative inefficiencies. I have yet to have a semester that did not involve an issue with the financial aid department. I have yet to meet anyone who has. They will lose your transcripts at least once. They will forget to submit important documents for FAFSA. They will not notify you of everything that they are supposed to. You will have to spend several hours trying to correct their mistakes. These are guaranteed. Unfortunately, as the only college reasonably close, many students have to suffer through this each semester.

Aside from the terribly unorganized and counter-productive Financial Aid department, the college does boast a fantastic variety of areas of study. It also has a goldmine of great professors, though getting a bad one is a guaranteed ""F"". As I write this, I am figuring out how to regain $1000 of my financial aid that they ""misplaced"" as well as my book advance within the one day that they are open before classes start and registration closes. If you are out-of-state, spend your $11k for tuition somewhere else. So far my GPA has suffered more than anything at this school."
College Freshman,2,"My major is currently in health services and therefore I am required to take psychology of personal affective mess and human growth and development. In both classes I received a grade of ""95%"" or higher. I really enjoy the classes available."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no genuine care for students among the staff. If there is a problem with advisement or financial aid, good luck getting anyone to listen to you or actually care. More often than not faculty will ""pass the baton"" to the next in hope of not having to deal with the problem themselves."
College Junior,2,"It very expensive for international students. I fell that it is not fear, because, the school is public."
College Junior,2,There is not really good opportunities for business fiend.
College Student,2,It's bad I don't see that many employers recruiting on campus.
College Student,2,I wish there were more programs for my major study.
College Freshman,2,"I am consistently trying to contact my adviser and financial aid office but they are reluctant to be cooperative. Other than that, the courses and professors are enjoyable."
College Senior,2,I always have a problem with financial aide.
College Freshman,2,"When signing up for financial aid or for classes it's so frustrating. they tell me to do one thing and in the end, it turns out I'm doing it wrong. or when I'm in financial aid they tell me to bring certain documents. and when I do bring them, they say that I'm still missing some documents."
College Freshman,2,They send me to the wrong places sometimes.
College Sophomore,2,Don't know anything about it...
College Sophomore,2,An AA from MDC has proven to be useful in regards to transferring. The institutions I am currently applying to respect my past at MDC.
College Junior,2,"There's been a lack of classes available that are specific to my major, I am worried I might not graduate on time"
College Freshman,2,I've only taken one online course and had a bad experience with it. The online system requires multiple logins to multiple websites and you're required to purchase access to other websites. Whats the point of that? You're also required to log in every single day for attendance and participation grade which is inconvenient and completely contradicts the point of taking online classes. The professor seems very removed from the class and communication between other students virtually doesn't exist.
College Freshman,2,"The student body mainly consist of hispanics and latinos. Most of the students here have very poor english skills which is understandable, but it's upsetting when they are allowed in higher level courses and can barely speak or understand english. it slows down the entire class. Also most of the students are unfocused and don;t do their work and want everything to be a joke or a party which is very distracting and annoying."
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid is bad in this school. They are hard to talk to. They are not specific. They don't give enough information. They left me wondering. I email one of them. He was rude and was not specific. I ask for more details. He did not answer back. He was of the dirextra of financial aid.
College Student,2,I have tried one online course and I had to drop it because the teacher would not respond yet giving us grades which made many of the students fail assignments.
College Junior,2,When registering for classes their isn't many options that are convenient. Also there are a few professors not much of a variety.
College Junior,2,"I personally haven't taken any online virtual class but I have met many people that have and are very unhappy.

The workload is incredibly overwhelming as well as the teacher doesn't always seem that willing in helping the student. In general with online technology it's easy to use. And it helps very little but not a lot with learning the material."
College Sophomore,2,There is currently one professor under this major.
College Senior,2,As stated before my entry to the school was messy because no one in th administration office communicates with one another.
College Senior,2,I personally think when it comes to the registration process It was a mission. They were very unorganized.
College Student,2,"I also have an issue when it comes to having to speak to a counselor or advisor , I feel like they are not competent enough or just don't put effort to help me out and go out of their way to find help for me."
College Freshman,2,It is difficult to keep up with a course whose teacher is not interactive.
College Student,2,We don't have anything of the above at school.
College Junior,2,"The financial aid process needs to be improved. What's the point of having an American Dream Scholarship if you can't use it? Just because some of us receive financial aid, doesn't mean that it'll cover all the books that we need to purchase. If we're eligible for a scholarship, then it should fully cover the costs. FAFSA doesn't cover summer term, so normally I would look forward to using the American Dream scholarship, but it doesn't cover the summer term either, therefore there's no benefit to the student. I have had to pay with my own money as a student, and many students have had to go through the same situation but not all of them can afford it."
College Junior,2,Not available to help students as you would want
College Senior,2,"For a medical campus, the library should be expanded and provide quieter study areas for students. The library is very small and has only a few shelves of books."
College Junior,2,Not many recruiters are career services. Luckily I'm transferring in a few semesters.
College Freshman,2,"It was sort of annoying because i had to do a verification worksheet three times till i finally got it correct. The thing is, was that the second time i submitted it, no one told me i filled it wrong incorrectly until i spoke to the main financial aid lady. It was a hassle but they finally sent it to me"
College Freshman,2,I dont like using the online website to do my homework
College Senior,2,My school does not offer all of the courses I want to take.
Recent Alumnus,2,Special study options NEED flexibility.
College Senior,2,"depends what campus North is the worse there no activities, library sucks. Wolfson has activities and a better library."
College Senior,2,Sometimes I feel very discouraged to be attending a school.
College Sophomore,2,To be honest I've never heard of such opportunities.
College Junior,2,"I have only taken two online classes, a math and a science class, and I feel that due to the lack of instructor attention and promptness made my experience a terrible one. The work load was pretty much reading the book and answering 8 different assignments that had relatively no relevance to the material and frankly, it was annoying and dis encouraging."
Senior,1,I For the spring of 2020 I have taken 2 courses online and i had an overall great experience. I have no trouble at all.
Sophomore,1,my learning experience was exciting . some professors cares about your success but not the staff!!  the staff cares about money and thats it.  now I am behind !!
Sophomore,1,"I went to this mdc thinking, I would graduate than boom a fat balance due. when I went and ask why I owe the college money . they all said oh I dont know like really. how you work in a place and you don't know than the lady said oh cause u took to many class . 5 class 😒 makes no damn sense. when I went to the office at north campus the lady there kept saying that my ID was expired and I didn't have any papers..I said ma'am.  I am a us citizen and check the id again it said expired on 2021 smh. the staff dont take their time and do anything right. hire people with common sense. if I could give this college a no star that would be great."
Junior,1,"The online experience isn't great, professors don't really put their full potential in helping us understand. During COVID right now all my classes are online and I  would say out of four classes I'm taking this semester only 2 professors are trying their hardest."
Sophomore,1,"think of DOLLARTREE of superstores think  of MIAMI DADE COLLEGE OF higher institutions. As an international student i was taken over 10 grand in tuition over each  year and treated like a dumpster by almost all of the staff. Dont know where to even begin with this college. Fine treat the residents that arent paying a dime for education like that but the international students? HOW DARE YOU? WE ARE THE ONES PAYING YOUR SALARIES AND WE DONT NEED TO BE HERE, SOME OF US COME FROM FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES, WE ARE NOT DESPERATE TO BE HERE! TAKE YOUR 3 THOUSAND DOLLAR INSURANCE AND BUY YOURSELF A NICE CAR WHILE I AM EATING RAMEN. HONESTLY JUST  DONT GO TO THIS SCHOOL. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR"
Graduate Student,1,"This is the absolute worst college I have ever attended. I have been taking math classes in preparation for a PhD in economics. The math professor are completely incompetent. The people running the college are no better. The best people are the student workers but they are limited in what they can do. Throwing government money to this college is a waste of tax payer money. If you are a future student, do everything to possible to go to FIU at the minimum. You will struggle here because of the incompetence all around. YUCK!"
Graduate Student,1,Professor sounds like he is falling asleep. Incompetent. Doesnt answer their emails. Horrible! I feel bad for the students who have no alternative to thiscollege.
Freshman,1,"I did not take online classes. However, I do wish to take some in the future. It will be very convenient because I’ll be able to work on my own schedule."
Freshman,1,When I used to go to Miami Dade College my experience there was terrible. Most of the professors I've met are extremely careless and don't even try to understand why a student might not come to class never give the student a chance to complete whatever he or she was missing for whatever reason. However when I got sick like once or twice and I couldn't come I contacted the teacher I emailed the teacher I text the teacher but no response all they could say was well just try to catch up all there's nothing we can do as if all the time and some type of excuse or you just don't want to attend class I hated this tub of crap and it was a waste of page in the internet of a rating of Professor to choose a seat in the class that's just a big waste of time because all of them I give them the same rate terrible extremely awful except for one teacher that was understandable I don't remember her name and even if I did I wouldn't mention her name but she was the only Professor that respect everyone
Alum,1,"I never took online classes at MDC. However, I did rely on various technology resources and online homework assignments. It did always cause a certain level of stress due to malfunctions of the webpage and not letting us students  upload assignments."
Sophomore,1,"To even call my online experience at Miami Dade College an “experience”, is an insult to the word itself. The abysmal communication between faculty and students are just one of the plethora of problems plaguing the switch to remote learning. The lack of care on the College’s part towards its students, saddens me to my core. The fact of the matter is that my tuition money, is being used to fuel the greed of institutionalized business, rather than improving students and giving us a variety of options other schools have given theirs. Not only did my GPA drop dramatically due to the switch to remote learning, but the lack of care from some of the professors made learning more of a chore ,than a hands on learning experience. Furthermore, I feel like the college not only failed me, but all their students in forcing us to learn in an environment we’re not comfortable learning in."
Niche User,1,"Miami Dade College is a horrible school in academics and facilities. The teachers show that they don't care about their students and don't show motivation, they make it seem as if going to teach every day is a punishment."
Alum,1,"This review is pertaining to the Wolfson Campus exclusive program M.A.G.I.C. (Miami Art and Gaming International Complex) and it's contents circa 2016 to 2018.

The program boasts it's multiple connections to the entertainment industry and ""realistic experience"" of a full production, including pitching your idea and getting mentored by someone in the respective industry you pitched for (Gaming or Animation). The problem arises with it's roster of professors, most of which were not veterans of any full production and were fresh graduates of the neighboring school: The Art Institutes. The lessons consisted of Youtube tutorials being played on a projector which ignites a feeling within the students of feeling cheated, as anyone can watch free access tutorials at home and learn these programs free of charge.

A particular professor and the head of the program (Ferazza) were very abusive to the staff and students, often lowering morale for anyone in their destructive path."
Freshman,1,Miami Dade college has some good things but when you need help no one helps you or gives you info they have horrible long lines for help and only two or three employees when there are about 10 open desks. The only good thing is they have a lot of variety for classes and hours. The teachers don't even care about teaching and don't explain anything. There's never parking the parking and the available parking is on the whole other side of the campus.
Alum,1,"BEWARE OF THEIR SUB-PAR BACHELORS DEGREE. I attended, graduated at the top of my class with the BS in Electronic Engineering Technology because i was being told that they offer the SAME classes as Florida International University. To my surprise, the degree is accredited by some garbage 8 letter acronym organization for which professionals (like the Florida Board of Professional Engineers) laugh at and consider INVALID! Miami Dade College officially waste 2.5 years of my time and thousands of dollars of my money!"
Graduate Student,1,"I have graduated 5 months ago and they havent sent my diploma, i have been calling several people from MDC and they say that nobody cant help me,that their system is messed up, the majority in there has not idea of how to do their jobs;the majority of their staff is rude,people of low income, with poor preparation for their positions,plus very prepotent and arrogant."
Niche User,1,The professors aee not there to past you but fail you. Its inexpensive but never ending classes and school
Alum,1,"Unfortunately I had to go to this institution's kendall campus because I did not do very well in high school. I spent two years here and they were equally as bad. This place is so unorganized, it almost funny. If you have Florida Pre-paid good luck registering for classes. Some of the professors are good and nice people; while others do not speak english well and do not know how to teach. The staff at the bursar's office are extremely rude and do not care to help you. Most of the staff are rude as well. The students have no respect for anyone but themselves. I really encourage people to do their best in high school so they can avoid this disaster of a ""college""."
College Senior,1,I feel like this college doesn't do much to prepare it's students. I have friends at other colleges and universities that their advisers work so hard to find internship opportunities for them... I have emailed my adviser 3 times in the last month and still haven't received a reply.
College Student,1,Never ever take one of those
College Sophomore,1,dont come to mdc its sucks
College Freshman,1,The post grad services available at Miami Dade College is not of the highest quality. Therefore I plan to transfer.
College Freshman,1,I have tried to receive my financial aid and complete the process for 3 semesters now. The staff refuses to comply and has given me many problems with being able to take classes here.
College Sophomore,1,"If you ever need to talk to someone about financial aid, be prepared to be herded like an animal and treated poorly by employees who just want to go home."
College Sophomore,1,No alumni network whatsoever. Not helpful at all.
College Freshman,1,"They only offer two courses in my major, and there's no community interest in it."
College Freshman,1,Customer service is the worst
College Senior,1,"I do not agree with the financial aid process. I do not have the funds to pay for schools, but was awarded the American Dream Scholarship. Without my scholarship, I would be paying for school completely on my own. Last semester I spent $500 on books and struggled to pay for that."
College Senior,1,The library's resources (computers) are slow and the staff is not helpful at all. The schools advisors do not know what they are doing. They are constantly advising students to take classes they do not need. Advisors do not know what other schools require in order for you to transfer.
College Junior,1,"They truly take for ever doing everything. Financial aid in the school is horrible. They are not willing to help you go to school, if you cant pay of loans or pay off school all at once they push you away."
College Sophomore,1,"My rating is based on personal experience, i had a recent professor that had a mix up with my grade and didn't even bother responding to my emails, affecting my GPA."
College Freshman,1,These services aren't provided and if they are barely anyone knows of it.
College Student,1,"My experience with the financial aid office is really bad. You need to go over and over to the school because always is a problem with the Fafsa application form or anything happen. Plus the administration who is in charge of financial aid, they are not very friendly and don't care about students."
College Student,1,They don't have enough information for the students.
College Junior,1,"I was told that credits that I took at a university would transfer to the plan that would but me in a certain math class. I dropped the lower level one that they were going to make me take. When time comes for me to get into the upper level math, they say that they got it wrong and I have to take the lower level one, wasting a semester as I could have done it in the first place. Pretty much all my courses transferred here as electives."
College Junior,1,Absolutely terrible. You get around a week to pay for your classes in full or they will be dropped. There are no payment plans either. The financial aid office does very little to help. I suggest applying to as many scholarships ASAP. They rarely allow for payment deadline extensions.
College Senior,1,I have yet to receive any financial aid.
College Senior,1,the process is LONG!! Your forced to take a short term loan paying 50% when you probably dont have it. dont try talking to a Dean no extensions
College Senior,1,The process is long and grueling. Students who live in Florida and can prove residency still have to bring a portfolio worth of paperwork to prove residency.
College Senior,1,The online career courses are probably the pit of this institutions problems
College Sophomore,1,It is only a community college
College Freshman,1,"Online courses differ from traditional classroom experiences because you to have to teach yourself and understand the material on your own. The teacher/student relationship is less personal because you don't have physical interaction. Also, if you have a question you have to message them your questions and it may take hours to get a response."
College Sophomore,1,Online course is boring. It gives a ton of work load. It makes you not want to do the work.
College Sophomore,1,The money takes forever to come in. The financial aid employees are extremely rude. The money I get is fine .
College Sophomore,1,"If there is a problem , one must go to one building,then sent to another. Then after a a day of running around the school will then say that something else is wrong."
College Student,1,I am paying college out of pocket because they have not approved my appeal. My parents were separating when I first started college and I had to help my mother financially and I wanted to go to college too and because of this I was failing and dropping classes. And I have grown and moved out of my mothers and now I wanted to start college again but only if I pay out of pocket. I have to do an appeal for each semester I want to attend.
College Senior,1,"Well i never qualified for financial aid. They thought I was too rich. Sometimes I thought the classes were too pricey you don't receive the best education from Miami- Dade,  not worth $300."
College Sophomore,1,The school is a great school but visual there is not appeal to me its very colorless and to me I enjoy seeing a lot of color to concentrate more.
College Junior,1,"There is absolutely nothing unique about this school. The atmosphere is horrible and I solely come here to get an education, thank god the professors are okay, and leave right after."
College Junior,1,"Their wi-fi is ridiculously horrendous, it is a complete nightmare! I feel as if a chimpanzee set up this network. Now I am not a networking genius but it should not take me ten minutes just so the log-in page decides to pop up! It also doesn't help  that once you manage to finally log on it feels like if I'm still using a dial-up connection. Either they are actually using a dial-up connection or their bandwidth is terrible. They need to provide a faster internet connection seeing as they have hundreds of students connecting at the same time, especially in their library! There have been times when I just get frustrated and just use the computer lab instead, which thank the lord is fine. It also helps that I am able to print there either way. "
College Junior,1,"As I have mentioned before, the student body is completely horrible. Since the school does not have any activities or there are no clubs to join most of the students remain to themselves and leave immediately once their classes are over. I would love this to change. If it ever changes will I am still attending this college I actually might consider staying and finishing my degree here. The student body is a big thing for me and can sway my decisions easily."
College Student,1,I only went to this school because it was all i could afford
College Sophomore,1,I only say this because I haven't started yet
College Junior,1,When it comes to networking at my school it is one of the worst things. My school doesn't provide student clubs other than Student Government. 
College Junior,1,The career service is not for my career path. The college is better for students that want an A.S or an A.A in a career that doesn't need higher than a Bachelor Degree. 
College Sophomore,1,Nothing about this school sets it apart. Not a memorial school. 
College Senior,1,Im currently enrolled and taking classes for a different major than the one I want to do. So for me right now its torture. I hate the classes im taking now. Not to say they're not interesting just not to me.
College Sophomore,1,The Academics offered at my school were difficult because teachers thought I wasn't honors material but in my heart and mind I was gifted better than average however being demoted to regular cost me to have a rage against my teachers. My class registration process was the worst especially with computer issues destroy my access to online applications.
College Junior,1,My school does not offer post grad services. 
College Junior,1,The student body overall is careless and so is the faculty. The school has very little spirit and the students are not all involved in the school activities. The best feature about the school is the online classes.

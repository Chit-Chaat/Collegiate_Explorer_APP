Sophomore,5,Super good experience! Love this college and the amazing staff here. Really good personal connections can be made with students and staff. The community is really nice and the view here is amazing. The education I am receiving here is of very good quality and everyone is very attentive to your needs.
Sophomore,5,My online experience at Sul Ross State University was very good. The professors were ready to help whenever I needed it and the instructions were fairly clear. Online classes are overall hard to me because I am more of a hand on learner. This does not mean Sul Ross State University was not prepared. This means that did an excellent job!
Alum,5,I loved it here! Very intimate campus. Great place to raise kids. Professors and staff are awesome! I loved my psychology classes.
Alum,5,I liked my professors a lot. I had an online class that was helpful with having a small child. Campus is beautiful and plenty of places to study.
Sophomore,5,I love how the student population is so kind and friendly and just love the nature around the campus.  Loved having a place to go study and receive help when needed on a certain subject.
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience, in the beginning, was tuff but at the end of the course I succeeded with the help of my professor who was understanding when I ran into technical issues along the way."
Freshman,5,"When i went to Sul Ross State University, for an official football visit i was amazed on how to view was, the scenery was just mind blowing."
Sophomore,5,"This is my 2nd year attending Sul Ross University.   I like that it is a smaller school.   The food is not bad.   The classes are average in attendance - the professors are great.   There is tutoring available at all time.   I play football and need to keep my great good.   So, with the available assistance they provide is awesome.   I plan on attending Sul Ross for 4 years.   Great experience."
Freshman,5,Sul Ross State University is a small campus but full of fun and learning. The staff here has been wonderful to work with and they really care about your college degree and for you to be successful. From the Lobo Den to the classroom they are always there for you. The students here are here to learn but have some fun doing it. They have so much to do and you will only be home sick for maybe a week. I love the place small town but fun town. Just remember a large school might be to big look at schools like Sul Ross and you can be just as happy at a place like this then at a D1 school Go Lobo’s
Sophomore,5,I like the peacefulness of the school and how close people tend to get since we are the only ones there. I also like how we tend to me more focus since there’s less distractions in the area. It is a small town but it’s beautiful and the school is the heart of the town. I would like for it to have more activities for the students.
Freshman,5,Great place with friendly people. The town is small but really comes together for university event. The place around the university is great if you love mountains.
Niche User,5,I applied and they text me regularly to let me know where in the application process I was in.  They even text me the day I was accepted to congratulate me.
Freshman,5,"The adversity of the school is very outgoing, I really enjoy the campus how close everything is to each other, the dorms are very good for having your own space. I loved the Gallegos Arena the basketball gym is very beautiful. Although, the city is very small hardly having anything to do the university keeps you going and focused on your academics and other activities or sports you may be in."
Freshman,5,Sul Ross is a beautiful campus with small classes and great professors. The one-on-one teacher to student education is outstanding.
Senior,5,My Sul Ross experience has been amazing I am an education major that has accomplished so many things. This student to Professor ratio is amazing and the classes are small enough where the professors actually get to know you
Junior,5,"It is an amazing school! It is great for my field of study, as well as different people or different places. Professors are great at teaching and helping students learn the material. There is the one on one teacher, student ratio that helps the students learn better. Campus is beautiful and has amazing weather. I am on my own but not too far from home. I have made friends that are becoming family and they are my family here at Sul Ross."
Sophomore,5,Sul Ross is a small school but that means that you get to know your classmates and they get to know you.
Freshman,5,"Sul Ross State University is a great college. It’s small size and supportive staff foster character building and academic success in the student body. The rural, small town, historic atmosphere of the Big Bend Region are a great backdrop for students who enjoy th outdoors.  I highly recommend Sul Ross!"
Junior,5,"Thus far, I have had a great experience with Sul Ross. The teachers are very knowledgeable is in their fields and display this in the classroom. I am taking part in a distance learning program Midland College. This provides a great education at a great price without me having to relocate."
Sophomore,5,The campus is beautiful. Everyone is so friendly and always willing to help and make you feel comfortable.
Niche User,5,"Students & Professors are super nice!  This school has a strong agricultural ranching program.  Many students are future ranchers, horse breeders, rodeo ranchers.  The location is extremely isolated with a two hour no cell coverage drive to the nearest Walmart.  The local area is a Texas tourist destination as Sul Ross is next to Big Bend National (Desert) park, the Marfa Space Alien Lights, Marfa Fine Arts District, the famous Terlingua Chili Cookoff,  McDonald Observatory and miles of Texas Desert.  The town caters to students that make up 1/2 the population.  This is a lovely place to live if you don't shop much & like sunset old west vistas.  Restaurant are barely edible stick with the Sul Ross Cafeteria or cook.  If you have a good air conditioned car there are a lot of fun Desert Tourist locations to visit."
Freshman,5,"Sul Ross has offered everything I wanted and more for my college experience.  The campus is big enough in which I keep finding new interesting places to hang out or study, but is small enough to where it is very comfortable and familiar, unlike those gigantic colleges that seem as though they were a city of their own. 
   For food, both the University and the town it resides in, are very generous. In town, across from the school are the fast food joints and a local food pantry. In the school cafeteria, the staff is very friendly as they remember our names and even make certain sauces if you ask them to.
   Sul Ross and Alpine, the town it is in, are simply astounding for me. Homesickness has still not reached the level I expected it to be because of how the environment is so cozy. I can truly say that I am happy. 
I am happy going to college. This college."
Freshman,5,"At SUL ROSS STATE UNIVERSITY, you are important! I am entering my second semester freshman year and can't wait to return! Instructors are knowledgable, caring, and make you feel like family. They take care of us there! I had an incident where I was careflighted to a major hospital and was amazed at how my instructors checked on me! They knew and they cared! This is the way they instruct too...they are knowlegable and care about your success as an individual!! I can't wait to se how far I go in life with the help of SRSU! Great university!!!"
Freshman,5,Great environment and great people i love how its located in a small town because everyone there knows each other and the fact that the teacher have small classes that they can actually have time for you and help you with every thing you need help with
Freshman,5,This is my first semester so i don't have much experience here yet but so far its an awesome school.
College Freshman,5,The courses are very diverse but animal sciences are very focused on. Most of the professors care about how their students are doing and are willing to help them.
College Freshman,5,The coursework is very competitive with larger state schools. My degree plan is even more competitive than the school that I am transferring up into.
College Freshman,5,Sul Ross is an amazing school with great outdoor activities in the surrounding areas! The staff and teachers are willing to work with you which is great! There is a lot of opportunities for hands-on experience which is great for me since I am going into veterinary medicine! I feel that the coursework is competitive with larger state schools and that it will prepare me for when I transfer to A&M.
College Sophomore,5,Texas has a shortage of Agriculture Teachers.  My adviser has assured me that I will have no problems finding a job.
College Sophomore,5,The majority of the dorms are basically 2 bedroom apartments without a full kitchen.  You have your own bedroom and share a full bathroom with the roommate who lives in the other bedroom.
College Junior,5,"Since I've been there and from what people have said, I have never had a problem with security I believe its great so far."
College Junior,5,My education teachers are the best! They have really given me so much experience for me being a teacher. One of my teacher is helping me to prepare myself for my certify teacher exam and she is so knowledgeable in her field. I enjoy listening to her lectures and she pushes us up our thinking level and she has us teaching the class so we can get the experience. I have enjoy all of my education classes I have taken at Sul Ross.
College Junior,5,The career service here on campus are very good at their jobs. They hold an a career fair per semester and they bring many people in each degree. They bring several school district for education majors. They work very hard to bring these people to the career fair for us students.
College Junior,5,Our police officers on campus are hardworking and careful officers that I know. They take their rules very seriously and make sure everyone is safe. If you need a police escort they will be there less than a minute since we are a small campus and they make sure you get to your destination safety. They often send emails about being safe around campus.
College Junior,5,"Sul Ross is in a unique place. We are surround by mountains and nature. We have deer, javelins, foxes, and even some mountain lion on campus and that's something you don't get to see or experience. The weather atmosphere in Alpine is so nice and relaxing that I love the weather in the summer and we get a lot of breeze. You also get the experience of living in the small town of 5,000 people, where the people of the community are super friendly and supportive. I would still choose Sul Ross as my college because of the experience I am receiving now and Sul Ross has the best teacher program ever."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The Professors are helpful and are available at any time

the curriculums are great some however are not

the registration process isn't hard its really easy to get through... GO EARLY

the workloads can depend on what classes you take... art however is the most difficult

study rooms can be available when you go and get them reserved and there a several study areas my favorite is the library or the UC upstairs in the lobby"
Recent Alumnus,5,"its all very hands on learning and i love it!

some classes however are not and its just papers papers and papers

i would like to be more engaged rather than just sit there and listen to the lecture with no activity"
Recent Alumnus,5,we are very safe the only thing you really need to watch out for is the jerk guys on campus...
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love the family housing that i live in its great spacious and safe.

The only thing is that the neighbors can complain about anything, especially noise that the #1 complaint

the RA's can be helpful but sometimes it seems you might have to take it a step further. The Family Housing is great for those who are parents and especially couples who are going to school together or just one. They are nice places to live for sure and are well equipped with washer, dryer, full fridge, dish washer, and furnisher. There is little social atmosphere and its hard to socialize with the neighbors because they seems to be afraid or just plain don't wanna talk to anyone. the cost is a bit high for me as i am a single parent going to school and working."
College Senior,5,The academics are all taught by actual doctors.
College Senior,5,The athletic events are the best things you can attend.
College Senior,5,I love this university because it helps you grow and help you figure out what to study.
College Freshman,5,There isn't anything bad going on on campus and it makes everyone very comfortable around each other and friendly with one another.
College Freshman,5,"What makes my school unique is that the school is very beautiful. It sits in a valley surrounded with mountains. I am planning on starting up an archery team here very soon, and I will most likely be the president of it. If I had to do all of this over again, i would most likely still go back to Sul Ross. I love this school. "
College Freshman,5,The weather in Alpine is amazing. It is always very cool weather. Not ever humid. The air is much more breathable out here. 
College Sophomore,5,the treat you like family. that want to make sure you are doing your best. but not in a im a parent kind of way.
College Junior,5,"I transferred to SRSU-RGC from SWTJC in Del Rio.  The advisors were wonderful and guided me every step of the way.  Getting into the program was not hard.  The only issue I had was not being aware of the THEA scores needed to be admitted into the Teaching Education Program.  That was the only hiccup, but the advisors were quick to give me the information that I needed about when and where to take the text.  "
College Senior,5,"Our diner is one of the best. It's nice and modern. The food to me is second to none. Our cooks are very aware of the food they should give us, they even take time to ask us how we like their new dishes."
College Sophomore,5,"It was very easy to get into my major. I did not have to write an essay, fill out an application, or anything of the sort. My adviser is a very nice woman who is willing to help me with anything that I need."
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms are new and only 7 years old. They are very spacious, with a living space to share with 2 bedrooms, a bath, and half kitchen. The walls aren't thin so you don't hear everything your neighbor is saying. The atmosphere is very social, and everyone become familiar with one another. The cost is very reasonable, and the housing process is a breeze."
College Sophomore,5,"Feel safe being on campus, there is many security during the day. I've never had to worry about being on my own. I like how they've got the campus police everywhere to keep the students and faculty worry free."
College Freshman,5,There is a mass abundance of parking around campus.
College Senior,5,Sul Ross has open enrollment and small classes. It is very easy to become involved in any program.
College Freshman,5,Students here Dress nice they are very appealing the social life is awesome here if you talk to anybody here you will have Great conversations almost everyone here at sul ross is my friend i love it here
College Sophomore,5,"Ever since i have been here at Sul Ross State University i have never seen a speed chase, or police aresting some one. I feel safe around Sul Ross. I can walk around in the dark and no one is gonna mess with me. In case if there is trouble in campus, there is always police patroling around the campus, and there a building where there is police officers near by the campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Parking at Sul Ross is great, there are always places to park and the parking permits are very cheap."
College Sophomore,5,"Bar SR Bar Is Strict and Secluded – Sul Ross is a very conservative school, but it is a state university  right in the middle of a small town ranching community. There is nothing for miles and miles around so it would be very difficult for the campus to be anything but conservative since it is pretty cut-off from the rest of the world."
College Freshman,5,"What Drug Scene? I'm sure there are drugs somewhere. Where aren't there? But I've never seen them, heard anyone talking about them (people tend to even in class in high school) nor have I seen any shady doings or heard of anyone getting sacked and kicked from school for possession."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Walking Distance – Everything is in walking distance. The town is probably 5 miles across, give or take."
College Sophomore,5,"Hands-On All They Way – At my college, we have very very nice and helpful resources for any student who is a Animal Science major like myself. We have a barn for large animals and a kennel for small animals. Our professors in the animal science department are very helpful and are very hand-on in class. I love my major and I'm glad I came to this university to pursue it."
Sophomore,4,"The online classes were as expected when taken. The occasional discussion boards and papers were easy to manage and got hard to do. Sul Ross also had a very good turnout when switching over to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Students were immediately notified and were taught how to use blackboard collaborate and zoom if they did not already know how to operate these tools. Overall, Sul Ross had very good online learning and transitioning."
Sophomore,4,"Sul Ross is great in the way of being a small enough college to get one-on-one interaction but also big enough that you still get the college feel! The community is great and always tries to make you feel welcomed and find different ways to be involved. The only down side is the lack of instructors and classes. The lack of instructors leads to fewer courses and somewhat bigger classes. Besides this small inconvenience, Sul Ross was a great small town college!"
Senior,4,"Considering my circumstances, I had an incredible experience at Sul Ross. The psychology department staff was amazing, they know how to teach you and they make it interesting. I came over to Sul Ross with an associates degree, so I cannot attest to how the other departments are, but overall, my 2 years at Sul Ross were great, and the best part is that it is affordable. Normally people believe that the more affordable that a school is, the more mediocre an education will be, but I do not believe that to be the case here at SRSU."
Freshman,4,"It is a very beautiful campus, and everyone there is very friendly. I can't wait to start school there."
Senior,4,"My experience here started very challenging . Over the year sit has become a home to me. Yet, i want to fly away from it because i am hungry to grow in my education and as a person. I would change some things about my school and that may be how small the town is. I know it is suppose to be a small town, but as most of the popularity comes from the students and we need something more attractive."
Junior,4,"I had just finished my first semester at the school and my overall experience has been great, it's a small but productive school. What made my experience great was the friends I've made, my roomate is awesome and so are her friends that she introduced me to. They involved me in everything that went on during school and wouldn't leave me alone since I was new.  The only flaw Sul Ross has is participation, whenever the school hosts events or activities for students to join not many would show up."
Sophomore,4,I like how the teachers can be more one on mone with students. I would change the price so I can afford more.
Graduate Student,4,Sul Ross State University is a smaller school that allows you to gain one on one learning with the professors.  Also excellent hands on learning experience.
Junior,4,The campus itself is absolutely beautiful and everyone that i have been in contact with are so helpful. I plan on playing softball and my coach is a great person. Definitely one of the best places I have ever been to.
Junior,4,"I attended Sul Ross in 1998, right after high school.  I did not complete my studies and after 18 years decided to go back.  I do not live in Alpine and moving back was not an option.  They have a great online program and have been very accommodating.  They made it easy for me to go back and finish what I started."
Sophomore,4,Great school. Some professors don't like student athletes others are willing to work with you. Really small town lacking some a lot of options but great community feel if you love small towns.
Senior,4,I really enjoy this school. I have been here going on 4 years now and I can't imagine being at any other undergrad school. I have learned a lot and I have enjoyed my overall experience here!
Freshman,4,"One of the many things that I like about SRSU is that you can have a lot of one on one time with the professors. That was one of the main things that really drew me to SRSU. With that being said the professors are really understanding and they are willing to work with you. The campus itself is amazing, with beautiful scenery and the company of some wildlife. The students here are also very open to making new friends and it is rare that you find someone who does not talk to anybody."
Freshman,4,My semester here at SRSU has been very good to me. They make sure you are taken care of and give you all the help you need. Transitioning to college was not difficult because srsu makes you feel welcomed and secured.
Sophomore,4,"This year it's my third year at Sul Ross State University. Since it's a small college the teachers pay more attention to the students. Everyone is real nice, the teachers help a lot on their office hours and even after office hours. It's a quite campus in which you can study in the outdoors."
Alum,4,Sul Ross State University offers a top-notch education with a small town feel. Faculty are leaders in their areas of expertise. The University offers degree programs that lead to advanced careers. A great rodeo school too!
Sophomore,4,"So far going to school at Sul Ross is amazing, the teachers are just great and are always ready to help. Everyone from students to teachers are very exceptional, willing to help, and easy to make friends here. Sul Ross itself is a school full of history, and the sceanory around the school is something you would find in a beautiful painting. The town of Alpine may seem small and boring to some, but to others its a great town with many sights to see. If I had to think about one thing the school could change it would have to be that, the school should build a school bar. Where students after midterms and finals can blow off some steam by enjoying a nice cold glass of whiskey, and perhaps a smooth cuban cigar."
Niche User,4,"To begin the Campus is not such a big campus in my opinion its way better for any student to go to a campus where you can get a one on one with the professor. I went on a tour and its such a different world you don't have your mall your big places but places where people like me are filled with adventures. You don't need to have to travel across the world for it to be an adventure. I truly think people also can get away its a great opportunity to just focus on school , just worried about school. I'm a Student-Athlete and the way the coach and professors welcome you is so great everyone is really kind and outgoing."
Sophomore,4,"I like Sul Ross State University. I like the fact as a student I truly feel my teachers care about me and my grades. And, rather than a number assigned to their room. They actually bother to learn my name. Most of my professors recognize me on Campus, and can even have a friendly chat with me about my class. The coursework is fair, and what you put into it is what you earn. A couple negative things I would say about Sul Ross is it's atmosphere, and Students. It's atmosphere is a issue, for a school in the middle of no where, to me, it should be more lively. My friends and I love it when the music students  come out and play songs on request, or if the theatre club did a comedy act in front of the cafeteria. And the students (well, some.) are a issue. If you are a sports atlethe, good for you. If you're someone who likes knocking on random people's doors at 2 am and run away, you're kinda the person and people im directing this at. All in All, Sul Ross State University is worth it."
Junior,4,I love being able to walk from one end of campus to the other end in a matter of 5 minutes. I love having classes that pertain to a max of maybe 30 students. I love having professors who are reachable and who know my name. I really wouldn't change anything about the college.
Junior,4,"My Sul Ross experience has been awesome! I am a junior now, so ive been here for 3 years. My freshman year I had a hard time honestly. Then I got myself involved in being a SRSU Cheerleader. Involving yourself in things like this is really important. Sul Ross is very good at helping you find those involving things that everyone needs. The campus its self has grown so much from my time being here, they've added a Rec field, new landscaping that makes the campus beautiful. The professors are amazing and I love how helpful they all are. You can go to their office and get help. They know you by your name rather number at a bigger school. You make so many great friends it being so small. One thing I love the most is of supportive all of our athletic teams are of each other. The only thing I would change is the food. Sul Ross is definitely my second home!"
Freshman,4,Sul Ross is a small campus located in a small town. The professors are the some of friendliest  and ready to help you in any way possible. It is very easy to get around because it is such a small campus. There are many clubs you can join and many activities to go to. Almost every week there is something happening around campus. It is a very beautiful and peaceful campus. The people are very friendly. It is also one of the cheapest public universities in the state of Texas.
College Freshman,4,The campus is very safe.
College Freshman,4,I'm not really involved in the athletics but many students at the school are very involved.
College Sophomore,4,The Animal Science: Agriculture Education adviser is spectacular.  He has helped me both as a student and as a person not from the area.  The Class sizes are generally great. Only a few professors do not work with athletic absences.
College Sophomore,4,I am out and about early in the mornings for workouts and practices.  I've never felt unsafe.
College Sophomore,4,"For a NCAA D III school, the facilities are great!  They just updated the gym floor and put in turf for the outdoor fields.  The football stadium isn't super big, but it's Texas...Everyone supports football!"
College Sophomore,4,"Small school in a small town.  My advisor is great and extremely helpful to me both in my field of study and as a student from out of the area.

I had a hard time, last year, with the dorm arrangements.  Also, I don't find certain departments to be overly helpful.  However, even in just this past year, changes have been made in staff and I can see a difference."
College Sophomore,4,Our campus safety is great if you attend Sul Ross you're extremely likely to be safe at all times.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing is great, the dorms are campus are wonderful.You and your roommate share a dorm but each have your own room you can go into."
College Sophomore,4,My school is one the best in the state of Texas and I suggest many people look into attending Sul Ross.
College Senior,4,"The building itself is not that bad but when something needs fixing or repairing, the help is slow. The good thing is that a person is surrounded with friends all the time going through the same part in their lives."
College Senior,4,College has opened a lot of doors for my future and brings the needed experience students need.
College Junior,4,"I feel as though the athletics at Sul Ross State University are fairly important, however I feel as though our Rec Sports might be a little more important because even athletes are on Rec Sports teams. Our fan sport no matter the sport tend to be very strong because not only do students come out to games but community members do as well because this town is so small. Some of my favorite times have been spent at football games when we were out tailgating at our family weekend because there was something for everyone to do. I know that our facilities are about to be some of the best because we are upgrading many of them right now. We are also acquiring a brand new Rec Sports field and the football field is getting new turf. Our basketball/ volleyball court is already the best in our conference because it is one of the newest around."
College Junior,4,I would say that my Overall Experience at Sul Ross State University has been tons of fun. I feel as though I have been able to do a lot of things that interest me such as hiking because of the area that the University is at. I also have enjoyed my time going to Student Advisory Board for the Texas State University System because it has helped me make connections all over the state. I have also enjoyed going to these meetings because it has allowed me to make connections within my university as well such as with my President who knew I was accepted into Graduate school before I did. I also think that the close community at Sul Ross State University has allowed me to excel in ways that I never imagined possible.
College Junior,4,I've known many people that have graduated from Alpine with a bachelors and a masters and have done very well for themselves. I believe the value of the degrees from this college are extremely great.
College Junior,4,The courses are exactly what I expected them to be. The instructors are really prompt at replying to any questions and concerns we might have.
College Junior,4,I see a lot of support around the campus for all the athletics. It is a small campus but very community oriented. I really enjoy the time I spend there.
College Junior,4,"Class size is small and interactive. Helpful Professors, except one that I personally had. Everyone wants to help you and see you suceed"
College Junior,4,"Alpine is an interesting place to be; the mountains, the small school, the people. It's a great little school to great acquainted and get help if you need it!"
College Junior,4,"The housing on campus are in good conditions but I just don't like that the walls are so thin that you can literally hear everything. I currently live in the school apartments and I like having an oven, refrigerator, sink, bathroom, and furniture. Especially an oven and stove so I can cook my own meals. My apartment is pretty quiet and my neighbors are pretty quiet and don't cause troubles which I really like."
College Junior,4,Our school teams are getting better each year pass by. We do have school spirit for each of our sporting teams we have on campus. We also get a lot of community support when we have our home games in Alpine. Athletic facilities ties in with our gym facilities and I wish they would have been a bigger place because many of the students like to go and work out but its too small and there aren't enough of equipment for everyone to work with.
College Freshman,4,The professors are for the most part very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,4,"my degree is not the best for the town I'm living in since there is no ideal programs that will help me engage into the local community. There were a few events but not many, the employees are great and i feel there should be more in the career centers for more programs and having a way to socialize and get along with the local community as well as getting to know more about the profession that your planning in getting into"
College Junior,4,"The school is very small, so you get to know your professors very well and in my case, my professor has set me up with numerous jobs and internships."
College Junior,4,I have had great experiences with the professors in my major.
College Junior,4,"SRSU is literally what you make of it. It is a very easy to get good grades, which is appealing to a lot of people, but if you are someone who likes/needs to be challenged, you have to go seek out those experiences. I have found my time here to be a lot more rewarding by doing so."
College Student,4,"The dorms are nice and simple, yet there is no kitchen and some of the students are loud at moments. The social atmosphere is pretty good."
College Student,4,For school spirit and fan support we have band which plan on the stand during the football season.
College Student,4,"The teachers are very outgoing, are easy to contact and are easily able to find if there are any questions we have."
Recent Alumnus,4,overall the good out weighs the bad
Recent Alumnus,4,i have great views lots of clubs to chose from
College Freshman,4,Our athletics aren't the best but everyone loves it.
College Freshman,4,I love my school there is a lot of friendly people and it is beautiful.
College Senior,4,Health and safety is always to its prime.
College Senior,4,"If you want to be a great student, everything will go better than expected."
College Senior,4,"Campus housing is very spacious, even better and bigger than the campus apartments."
College Senior,4,Smaller class size enables direct communication with professor.
College Sophomore,4,I love the small town feeling. It's great that there isn't very many students in the classrooms.
College Senior,4,It was an easy process
Freshman,2,"As a coeducational, comprehensive, public institution of higher education, Sul Ross State University offers certificate programs and associate, bachelor's and master's degree programs. The main campus is situated in the unique environment of the Big Bend region and is the primary institution of higher education serving a 19-county area in West Texas"
Senior,2,I am currently in the Rio Grande College campus at Eagle Pass. There are very few degrees offered and I had to often wait semesters for a course that was a requirement for me to be available. Summer is only online classes.
Sophomore,2,Dorms aren't very great. Signal is terrible. Their website always goes down. Food isn't good. But the school is in a good location.
Freshman,2,"Sul Ross State University is a small university but it helps to keep you out of trouble. It is a beautiful town and there are very friendly people. Overall the classes are based on how you pay attention and follow directions. It is not difficult at all as long as you do what you are supposed to. However, if you feel like you would want to go to college out of town then Sul Ross is the best University to come to for out of college experience. What I would like to see change is for the town to expand a lot more. I feel like there is a lot of free space in Alpine to create a lot of things to get people out of their houses and even students out of their dorms."
Graduate Student,2,"The honest truth is Sul Ross State University is their retention rate only 28% of the students who attend graduate. Furthermore, in most of the graduate study programs, most of the professors have only master degrees except for the department chair and one associate professor. In comparison to other programs in TX such as Texas Tech, UTEP, etc. courses in the graduate studies are taught by professors with doctorate degrees.  Future students beware before investing your time and money.  Future employers know the statistics on most universities this makes a difference on whether or not you get a job."
Recent Alumnus,2,i don't hear much about it
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you are looking to get a glorified Junior College degree that is recognized as a 4-year college degree, then this is the place for you! Very easy to get around campus, but keep in mind that this is a sleepy mountain town that has little to offer for college-age kids. The town hasn't ever truly embraced the college and thus has not had any entrepreneurs interested in investing in having Alpine become a college town. 

If you enjoy the very quiet and slow life, this college is for you. Although I cannot speak for other departments, it appears that the Geology program here is extremely watered down from what it used to be in the mid to late 80's to early 90's when Sul Ross was regarded as being in the top 5 Geology programs in the nation. Now the faculty is either too engrossed in their own pursuits to teach effectively or using their tenure as a glorified retirement to get a check to keepfrom rotting away in a retirement home.I have had little to no real guidance or financial help, but I have heard that Sul Ross is leader in degrees for people first in their family, which only disguises the fact that there isn't a system of parents holding an SRSU degree urging their children to follow suit. It's really a shame that SRSU isn't a geology target school for any company seeing as hardly anyone younger than 55 even know of Sul Ross' existence. With easy access to the beautiful igneous rocks at Big Bend National Park and Big Bend Ranch State Park, the potential will always be there for pepole to take Sul Ross geology seriously in the future, but do not expect any help whatsoever with your degree. This is a college that you get an easy degree from and use the time you don't need to study to network a lot due to the classes being the same level as a run-of-the-mill Junior College. Even if you do not believe my opinion on the state of academics here, research for yourself the times that Sul Ross has been on Academic Probation from the accrediting governing academic board."
College Sophomore,2,some times it is not etiable
College Sophomore,2,Full scholarships are unavailable for members of the rodeo team. There are no scholarships for athletes and most scholarships are limited strictly to people from west Texas or Alpine.
College Senior,2,Their cars are always falling apart with something new everyday.
College Sophomore,2,"Though the University is getting stricter the fact is that their is still doom parties happening, my own dorm mate had a beer pong party in my room and did not get busted until the next day for extra beer in the fridge and in their cooler, bc i complained of the noise."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are great! They are spacious, clean, and very neat! There is two people to a dorm and you have your own room, a living room and a nice bathroom. I would like to keep living in the dorms BUT the prices are horrible! Prices on dorms are going up this semester even more! So I have to find a cheap place to live or live in my car!"
College Senior,2,"The campus is beautiful, but the wind makes it miserable going outside at all."
College Sophomore,2,Alpine has a great view however other then going to the movies or out to eat there is not much in the town
College Senior,2,"It Gets Old – When you first start out at school the food is very good but it starts getting old very fast! They serve the same thing everyday and it's like they never have a variety! The food off campus is good as well, but it's the same thing over and over but somehow we all love fast food so we still eat that everyday!"
College Sophomore,2,"The Ethnicity at Sul Ross – The boys and girls here at Sul Ross are a mixture of ethnics and culture. Men and Women come to Sul ross speaking not only one language but multiple. The girls here are very pretty and some are smart, some people that are not from here, it will take sometime to get used to the accent of the native speakers of their Language."
College Freshman,2,Small Town Feel – Its nice for a small town feel.... You have to know how to have fun in the middle of nowhere...
College Freshman,2,Melting Pot – There are many diffrent types of guys and girls here its just a big melting pot!
College Junior,2,"There are 5 bars in town, 2 of which are usually populated with underage college kids.  The other three are aimed at an older crowd and would be described more as ""dives."" The 2 that are for the younger crowd have been known to have incidences of drugging and other illicit activities.  Occasionally you can catch some good live music and nice drink specials, and all the bars are within walking distance.  So you don't have to worry about DUI's."
College Junior,2,"Living Off Campus – Living off campus has its perks. You don't have to share facilities for one.  However, living off campus can be quite taxing.  It is extremely difficult to find housing off campus, especially at an affordable rate.  The commute to school isn't bad because almost the entire town is within biking distance.  There are few apartment complexes and half of them have weird obscure requirements."
Alum,1,"Look at alum and sr reviews. We have been there long enough to have clear picture.  I sincerely hope things have improved.  I was quit naive when i was a SR.  (why else would i go to SR?)  
1. Guidance was very poor.  Not much help in career planning.
Lots of things i did not know.
2   Teachers were mostly bad. (Though a few were nationally know experts)
In truth, for me, teacher did not seem to care. 
3. When you get out, SR is Not well known, except in West Texas where it is looked down on (except for education)"
Freshman,1,"If you are considering Sul Ross, I would strongly advise reconsidering your choices. The professors here are average and the classes are on the smaller side. This makes it easy to get one-on-one time with professors if that is something you need. However, the campus food is terrible. If you are looking to begin working out or getting in shape, the cafeteria does not serve an adequate amount of protein to sustain an active lifestyle. On-campus living here is a joke. The elevator has been broken the whole second semester and RA's have no control over any of the residents. The amount of noise heard after midnight in the hallways is ridiculous. The library and rec center are both very limited on hours. If you want to study a little later into the night(after 9) or before 8 am, you'll have to find somewhere else to go and it isn't open on Saturdays. Also, all athletic teams use the rec weight room and basketball court, so you have to attempt to schedule around them."
College Junior,1,"This is one aspect where SRSU doesn't do too well. Sexual assault is a real problem, but if you go to campus police with an issue, they will blow you off completely in a manner that is completely disrespectful."
College Junior,1,"SRSU makes you stay on campus for 2 years, which is terrible, and they also force you to buy a meal plan, even though the cafeteria food is awful and has given me food poisoning numerous times. And, the people who run res-life are the absolute worst, and will make your life hell."
College Junior,1,No Greek life here! There was a huge cocaine incident in the 80s.
College Junior,1,"I do not enjoy Sul Ross State at all. But it had to do, money played a huge roll in my college choices."
College Freshman,1,We do not have greek life and no one here seems to have a problem with that. 
College Sophomore,1,Aramark supplies the campus with food and it is inadequate. Very few times do I leave the cafeteria feeling satisfied. It is poorly managed and sanitation is a serious issue with the dining utensils.
College Sophomore,1,I am one of very few women on campus. There are some pretty girls but for the most part they are a dying breed.
College Junior,1,you failed and did not pass the class. you will have to take it again
College Sophomore,1,"There is ONE bar that students can attend to on Friday. Of course, you have to pay to get in and can't drink because you are under age. The students in SRSU are the majority ""gangster"" boys or whatever and they always put rap songs etc etc. BORING. I usually stay in my room and watch movies! I have a better time and I know I'm not getting in any danger. I feel like an old lady sometimes because I don't go party like 'normal' college students should. But I'm happy so who cares!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Prepare for a Bumpy Road – SRSU is notorious for it's slow Financial Aid processes. If you want it done, you'll have to be a jerk and you'll have to hound them until they get it done."
Recent Alumnus,1,"One Place on Campus – The campus cafeteria is run by Aramark. There isn't much diversity. It's a boring place to eat. There are set meal times, so if you miss, you don't eat in the cafeteria."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The winter, it snows. They didn't close campus for a 4 degree, negative 12 windchill day when no one in this town knows how to drive in snow and ice. Sometimes, off campus, water pipes freeze and burst because the homes were not built to withstand cold weather. As for summers, they are hot. We used to get nice rains throughout the summer, but as of today, 6/22/11, we have not received rain since the previous September. We're in a drought, and all the plants are dying.
Also, we have recently had a spell of grass fires that have burned the surroundings of the town. What used to be green rolling hills is now black."
College Sophomore,1,Your Living Off-Campus? Where!? Most places in alpine available for rent or sale are highly unlikely to become the property of a college student. Most citizens in alpine don't like rented to college students for the fear of what damages may be inflicted upon their property.

Senior,5,Johnson C. Smith University is a good HBCU college to attend since it's considered a private university the campus ain't that big compared to other HBCU's. But the campus is very peaceful and cleaned the environment there is refreshing you don't have to worry about anything because if there is a problem and you need to contact a certain department the staff is always helpful to ensure that you're taken of at the end of the day. I am proud to be a Golden Bull  and will forever keep representing my HBCU legacy.
Freshman,5,Great historical black college.  Very helpful to all students. The schools location is beautiful and close to uptown.
Freshman,5,I loved taking my course online.  It allowed me to work during the day to support my family while working towards my degree
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Johnson C Smith university is amazing I’ve learned so much about myself and others. They are very supportive academically and physically. I am from Florida so the atmosphere was very different. The professors are loving but professional in other words tough love. It’s very easy to get to know new people, you won’t ever feel like the oddball. The food could be better but it also reminds me of back home. They are very supportive of all athletics. It has great scenery and a lot of entertainment to attend.  I personally think that the best part of the school is standing on the “block” which is where everyone meets up after class ."
Niche User,5,mY EXPERIENCE WAS EXCELLENT BEACUSE WENT I WENT FOR THE VISIT THEY WERE VERY PERSONABLE. I LIKED THAT EVERYONE NEW EACHOTHER BY NAME. I GOT HE FEELING THAT THEY REALLY CARED ABOUT WHAT I WANTED TO DO.
Niche User,5,i love the way the students treat each other and how close the teachers are with the students how wonderful the campus is and how its in such a great city
Senior,5,Johnson C. Smith is an amazing school to attend. I’m so happy they finally decided to have a online program for working adults!
Junior,5,"I transferred to JCSU in fall of 2018, transferring to a new year wasn’t very easy for me but once I got there it was like home. The classroom size is very small and the professors is very hands on. While being at JCSU I was able to become a campus ambassador, being on the gospel my first year there, and I also am apart of a honor society"
Sophomore,5,The professors they try their best to break things down to make sure you understand everything before moving forward.
Sophomore,5,I do love Johnson C Smith University in result to the environment and how the students and staff all come together like family. Johnson C Smith University is a very great school to attend and is very historical. In my opinion their is never a dull moment on campus. Just like any other college we do have our flaws but one thing i would most certainty change is the cafeteria food and conditions inside.
Alum,5,Was definitely the best time of my life. Welcoming and caring staff and administrators. A knowledgeable faculty-base with plenty of opportunities to help a student thrive. Location is a good mix of city and country living. Student life was fun if you get involved.
Sophomore,5,"it is like a big family. I like how everyone is connected with one another. there are some professor that really care. the advisors are really great and make sure that you are in the correct classes and that you are on track, as well as staying on track."
Senior,5,Well as a transfer student it is a good experience be part of this HBCU and seeing people that look like you. To me personally that is a good look and you can get so much further in your life be great and walk away happy knowing that you have people there that go through the same thing as you go through and it’s amazing seeing people help each other out and push them to go further. If anything has to change I would say good because it is unhealthy and people need to eat more healthier. We are as a nation are on the chain of obesity and lazy people and we need to change our ways of eating.
Freshman,5,Johnson C Smith is a nice school. It’s one of the very few HBCUs. It connects you with other people within your culture. I enjoyed being around my own people. The dorms could be nicer.
Senior,5,Community focused and convenient commute for me.  I am a fulltime evening student and professor help me balance my work life and family life and classroom expectations.  Professor give me a enough time to complete my work and provide appropriate resources to help me accomplish my tasks.
Niche User,5,"I toured the school on Monday, October 29, 2018.  The student-tour guide was great knowledgeable about the school.  Each incoming freshman gets an Ipad and a passport because the school is promoting becoming a global community."
Freshman,5,I attend Johnson C smith University. I love Johnson C smith university it’s very diverse and I might met a lot of lovely people there. I’m still enrolled into the college I’m a rising Sophomore I have more years to go and I’m going to make them my best. The college is not that big and I love it. Cause Who wants to walk for and be late when you can a just be right there at the class. The events on campus are lit. Everyone makes it funny and funny I love having fun especially on the weekends because I tend to focus on the weekends. College is not all about the fun events it’s also about the work. You ain’t just go to college to come and have fun you there to do your work and be what you want to be in life. My times at Smith were fun. What JCSU can change about them is Burger King and the cafe. The cafe should have better food and Burger King never had meat but that’s the only thing that was wrong with smith. Other than that my experience was great and many more to go.
Sophomore,5,"My experience as a college student at Johnson C. Smith, this past year has been very valuable to me, because The University is a HBCU, that fosters academic achievement and success, for students like myself who wants to achieve the American Dream of obtaining a College degree.

Freshman,5,"Johnson C. Smith University has given me an experience I would never forget. Being from a poor family as well as neighborhood once gave me the impression that I would not leave that situation. Battling depression and other feelings were indescribable as far as words go. I visited JCSU during my preteen years and could only dream of a chance to enroll. Well, 2017 I was accepted and experienced college at 27 years old. That was the most exhilarating, unbelievable, phenomenal moment in my life. I strongly recommend JCSU to anyone looking to make a change for themselves or study in a pleasant environment.JCSU saved my life.  My name is Eric Darcey Flowe and I want to personally thankJohnson C. Smith University!"
Freshman,5,Well orientation was good I met the staff and the student leaders. They were very helpful and really honest. I’m excited to start school in 15 days.
Senior,5,I love Johnson C Smith because of the close nit relationships between the students and faculty. Everyone knows just about everyone so if you need help with anything you know where to go or your peers know where you should go. The professors are very dedicated to seeing you succeed and offering help; another advantage of the small class room sizes. I would like to see more student involvement when it comes to school spirit and campus events.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the culture of the institution. The professors work with you, and are available when needed. The class sizes are small, but it will work in your favor. The professors know their students very  well. There are a lot of Student Affairs Activities. Great location as well."

Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Johnson C Smith and the thing that I love about smith is that it's very family oriented, things that we would work on would be the student activities and the different organizations. People should be more active in the school."
Freshman,5,"My all over experience with Johnson C. Smith so has been wonderful, campus life has been great. Meeting students from different states and different culture has been awarding experience. The dorms and the cafeteria need a little bit of upgrading. The dorms I understand represent history but a little bit of renovation would not hurt. The wireless system needs to be upgraded. The menu could be change also, the food is not that great but manageable. All and all I love my school I would not change it for anything."
Alum,5,The best experience one could hope for in a HBCU! I am a proud alumnus of Johnson C. Smith. I am successful in my field and owe it all ole JCSU.
College Sophomore,5,"There is nothing like game day! From football, basketball, track and field, tennis, etc. Our teams always gives the crowd what they came for.

We love all sports and support all teams."

I would love to keep coming back and recommend that others do as well.
College Junior,5,"We have a fairly diverse campus with blacks, whites, and hispanics."
College Junior,5,"Johnson C. Smith has risen in their career prospects. They install professionalism in the students encouraging them to dress professionally and exposing them to different internships and opportunities for the summer or even through the year. Older Alumni students greatly give back to the school a lot, some willing to help as much as they can. Career services work close with the students helping them find financial help for school, help with coursework and extracurricular activities throughout the school."
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience at my school so far is I am still learning how to manage my time wisely and geting enough rest so I will be able to get up in the morning for class. My favorite thing about my college is that I like the one on one with the professor anytime, anytime I need help with anything They just time me to set an appointment and they will be glad to assist me with anything I need help with. What makes my school unique is the small classroom sizes and the history of the school. I wouldn't choose another school to attend is because I like how my school have professor that truly care for and about their student to help them out and there are not just here for the pay but to help us become better men and woman in our community."
College Freshman,5,Basketball is what we are the best in. Can't wait for CIAA to roll around.
College Sophomore,5,Not to worried about my safety

Its a Historical Black College University and the community is proud of it. We are located near uptown Charlotte so you get to see the bobcat arena and the Panthers stadium. At night you can watch the city glow from campus.
College Sophomore,5,We just got a new health plexus that you can go into and its open to the community. We do community service which was part of our requirements to graduation however its best to learn how to give back. There are different lecture series on campus for different issues and reasons.
College Sophomore,5,They issue laptops to all students and as a senior you will get your own. If you would like to bring your own laptop that's fine as well however the free one is included within your tuition.  It does cost to print and that's included into tuition as well.
College Junior,5,I love the business department. Many of the professors are there to help out as much as they can. I believe that I have learned so much in just my first two years at the school. I am looking forward to learn even more in the upcoming fall at Johnson C. Smith University.

THEY ONLY TAKE THE BEST
YOU ARE SEEN BEFORE A REVIEW BOARD
THEY LOK AT YOUR GRADES, RECOMMENDATIONS, REASONS WHY YOU WANT, OR DESERVE TO BE A PART OF THE PROGRAM. 
IT IS PUT TOGETHER WELL
IT PREPARES YOU FOR THE FUTURE"
College Sophomore,5,"They are very active about campus safety,
 very diverse and cohesive campus comunity
student and faculty awareness
big on community service projects"
College Senior,5,"We are very fashionable and up to date on the latest fashion. Everybody is there own individual and have their own unique thing going on but that's why we are separate but equal. We have city girls and boys, country boys and girls, and a mixture of both."
College Freshman,5,"They loan each student a laptop which is a very good plus. you can pretty much get wifi anywhere on campus, which is another great thing"
Senior,4,"My online experience with taking my classes was difficult since it was my first ever choosing like two courses to take online but I still managed to make sure all assignments were completed on their due time and if I had any concerns or problems my professors were always there to email or reach out through google voice call to get a more thorough understanding on how some of those specific assignments needed to be done correctly. With taking all of my classes online due to COVID-19 was in between, the only problem I had was with my Intro to Stats class due to it being a math  course I'm used to the visual learning through zoom where I can be able to see how certain problems can solved. But my professor never had any scheduled zoom meetings to see if we needed any additional help but learning from my classmates helped me out a whole so I wasn't stressing out rarely."
Freshman,4,"There staff are really nice and patient.
They understand everything I ask and never made me feel awkward. The only thing I don’t like is how long it take to get my fafsa awards"
Junior,4,"Due to the pandemic. Classes were switched to Zoom. Classes were basically at the same level they were before switching to online. With online classes, professors try harder to make sure their students are well accommodated and prepared."
Junior,4,"I attend Johnson C. Smith University. Since my first visit of the campus, it felt like home. I always knew I would attend a HBCU. Now in my junior year, I can say that I remain glad I chose Johnson C. Smith University. Although it is a small campus, the environment is welcoming and family-oriented. The atmosphere is amazing."
Niche User,4,Johnson C Smith University is a HBCU college and has a overall rate of being in the top 10. I want to go here because of  the fact it is a HBCU college.
Senior,4,This is a great school to go to when your want that familial environment and close relationship with professors to get that access to great opportunities that you wouldn’t receive at a bigger university.
Freshman,4,"I had a great first semester experience! the campus felt like home and the people I encountered were nice ! a few minor issues need to be changed but it’s an overall good school. majority of the staff are nice & understanding to situations as long as you do your part and stay focused on your academics. Expectations are high but not hard to get with , keep sight of what you came to school for no matter what event or situation that’s happening on campus. Overall Johnson c smith is a great school for those who like a smaller setting with a family based establishment."
Freshman,4,I feel like JSCU has a very good campus environment. The teachers and students are very welcoming when I first arrived on campus. The only bad thing about JSCU is that there cafeteria isn't really that good and they need to improve their athletics.
Sophomore,4,"My first year of college was the most hardest. I wasn’t used to being away from my family nor being on my own. When I got to Smith, students made me feel welcomed. Students showed me around and took me in as their little sister. The professors are very helpful and they also are willing to work with you when you need help. Smith has tutoring services for each major so that students are receiving all help that they need. Also, if you attend to those tutoring sessions, you may be eligible for scholarships. Most colleges don’t do “field trips” like elementary- high school, but MY HBCU does. Every semester, they give student the opportunity to explore more than just what’s offered on campus and sometimes just to have fun. Of course you would have to work in order to receive these privileges but it’s all worth it."
Junior,4,Johnson C. Smith University is a great school to attend. They have such great programs that will get you to where you need to be as far as graduating. There are some nice professors that will help you through the hard times and struggles and then you have some professors that don't show any type of sympathy. The professors are well driven and straight forward.
Sophomore,4,"Being that I am a transfer student, I don't not engage in a lot of on campus activities. I go to campus for my purchases in the bookstore and my classes."
Senior,4,You are treated with the upmost respect and the staff are very willing to help you financially and academic.
Freshman,4,"What I like about Johnson c Smith university is the way you feel loved everybody is willing to make you settle in, feel like your home, but most importantly you can be yourself. I also like that the teachers are always there for you. I would like for the food to change and some of the dorms."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy attending Johnson C. Smith. This is my freshman year and I am happy to be attending this school. There are all types of help for students in need and everyone is very friendly.
Senior,4,This University is a greater school of higher learning. The overall experience is very good. I am glad to have selected this school.
Sophomore,4,"Johnson C. Smith being an HBCU I honestly didn’t know what to expect, but it lived it up to its name. Giving students plenty of oppurtunities to expand their knowledge and skills in a diverse environment."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Johnson C Smith was splendid for my first. I have met some amazing people during my first year. The people there are friendly than you think, all you have to do is say hey. Me being apart of the track and field team made my experience even better by hanging out with friends."
Sophomore,4,"While attending Johnson C. smith, I've made life long friends and had the opportunity to also have a helping hand in the community. Johnson C. Smith University is a small HBCU that makes everyone feel like family, making this university special to me."
Freshman,4,"Jonhson C. Smith University is a nice school. It is relatively small, which allows for the professors and advisors to focus on the individual student better.  Their students come from all over the country and some international to go to school. The professors at this school care for their students as if they were their own. The advisors tailor to your needs but also make sure that you are well prepared for what you want to do after you graduate. The school makes sure that every student feels important and tries to help them achieve their goal."
Sophomore,4,I love the school. It has a great atmosphere. The only thing that needs to improve is nutrition and housing.
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the closeness and the atmosphere. I felt very welcomed especially with me being so far away from home they made me feel right at home. I feel that the cleanliness of the cafeteria can be more food safe and watched more closely for bugs and such things like that.
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at JCSU and it’s a great school very friendly school, just like to see more of a safe environment"
Sophomore,4,Overall My first year at smith was pretty good . I learned a lot of things as a freshman. Managing my time was a big issue at first when I got to school but as the year went on it hadgott n better.  Smith professors actually care about you and that's what I like about this school so much
Freshman,4,"The bonding with friends, the professor are willing to assist you academics are challenging . The meals need to be upgraded. They are horrible we should have what the big Ivy League schools Starbucks  chick-fil-a etc."
Freshman,4,"Johnson C Smith is an amazing HBCU to attend, i've grown and learned so much within my 1st year. i believe everyone at Smith is a family, professors know you on a personal level, classes are no bigger than 40 students, typically ranging from 10-30 students. It's a very small campus which thats exactly what makes it feel like home. Johnson C Smith gives students another chance and they always are there to help you when you need it. I've only been here for one school year and i'm excited to look back on these days, because i strongly believe that i will succeed in everything i decide to do while being at Smith."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Johnson c. Smith university has been short given that I got here in January. Nevertheless it is still an experience. The community here is very small so everyone knows everyone. An students and faculty genuinely care about eacherother. When you come on he campus it is very warm and inviting but because the campus is small. Everyone knows everyone business and it does cause a problem here and there. The only thing I would change about JCSU is the activities they should have more things for the students.
Niche User,4,I really like visiting Johnson C Smith campus and their college style is really my style so I would love to be part of the Golden Bull family.
Freshman,4,The school is a very safe and good technology school. I really enjoyed it. Through the time I've been here everything has been really good. The professor and student body are very together.
Freshman,4,"I actually like Johnson C Smith University, it's very helpful, and fun school, and I also like how we only less than be minutes away from downtown Charlotte,because where I came from was a small town, and the city life is so much fun."
Sophomore,4,"Johnson C Smith is a great school. The people are friendly and very helpful. The teacher to student  ratio is great. So that means that you'll have a lot of one-on-one time with your professor. Also you can talk to your professors at any time to receive help or to just check up on your grades. I do wish that they would change the menu for breakfast,  lunch and dinner.  It seems like we eat the same stuff almost every other day ."
Senior,4,I like that the school is in the city of charlotte but i also would like for the school to have more events for the students to be more engaged with the campus more.
College Sophomore,4,Administration works hard to make sure each student is assigned to an internship or a job. Career center/services at my school are high quality.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love my school especially the connection with my professors!"
College Sophomore,4,Greeks at my university show integrity by doing what is right when others are not watching. Community service is a huge part of Greek life. You must be determined no matter what obstacles are brought forth
College Sophomore,4,"Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina, is unique because it provides an outstanding education for a diverse group of talented and highly motivated students from various ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic backgrounds.

College Sophomore,4,i am a Greek myself and its pretty amazing

College Sophomore,4,It makes the campus I'll tell you that.
College Freshman,4,The people are nice and energetic.
College Freshman,4,Great environment. Just needs more up to date facilities.
College Freshman,4,Academics here are wonderful. Needs more update facilities though.
College Junior,4,"Besides all my gripes, I love my school. It has a nice charm to it that I can't explain."
College Junior,4,Athletics at Johnson C. Smith is very big. Being a traditional HBCU you see that they take it very seriously. Most of the Varsity teams at my school are really passionate about their sport and determine to perform to their best ability. The schools performance overall has been great so far with the exception of the football team.
College Senior,4,"This school is what you make it, you must take advantage of everything that is offered to you. Alot of time you have to look for the good things but you must also read you emails to discover more things that is offered around campus. It is a great school but you must get close to your professors because they have alot of connections that can take you fsr. This is very beneficial because the class rooms are smaller which makes it easy to be social."
College Senior,4,Johnson C. Smith is a very dominant school is Charlotte and the connections are endless.  They will gladly look out for any student for reaches out for them with intentions of help. The alumni show much love towards the school and the current student body.
College Senior,4,It's the atmosphere that makes it great!
College Freshman,4,The classroom sizes are perfect! You really get the one on one time with your professor.
College Freshman,4,"The Greeks really gets you to be active with the school. They promote every event the school hosts, even study day."
College Freshman,4,The unity at my school is very interesting. It's what makes the school a great school for networking.
College Junior,4,"Coming up on my junior year of college, I can say that my college experience has been interesting. I have been able to travel to different states with my school as well have a close relationship with teachers because at my institution, there are small class sizes. I honestly wouldn't choose another school because I have met almost ever person on my campus and made connections with administration here at my university."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience in High School was great. My favorite experiences was participating in the school's performances , and being involved in the choir , and hosting educational events for the seniors . The things that make my school unique is , it being so small but still being a productive and fun school. Even though the school was so small the staff made education the number one priority in the school. Many kids came from poor holmes and bad neighborhoods but when they came in the school they could feel like they were in a safe environment , and they would have a free meal to eat in the morning and afternoon.   The school didn't have a gym or auditorium or huge classes. We had our gym classes in the cafeteria and so were our school assemblies. If i had the decision to stay or choose another school , i would stay at the school i graduated from . Overall i met amazing people , I've learned so many cool things ,  Iv'e gained a lot of knowledge . The whole school is a huge family , i don't regret choosing Wmst at all , it was an awesome experience , and I'lll miss all my graduating seniors and undergraduates."
College Freshman,4,"my experience was great, i really enjoyed the atmosphere and the people. i enjoyed the small classes as well."
College Freshman,4,Campus police do an outstanding job protecting the students on campus.
College Freshman,4,There are many options. I never repeat where I eat in the same week. There are a lot of options.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is really sectioned off. The Greeks really don't hamg with other Greeks. (Example- AKA's and Deltas). The Greeks are very friendly and outgoing though
College Freshman,4,"The school is located in an area that has a good bit of crime but once you get out of that particular area, everything is beautiful. There is so much to do in Charlotte, NC."
College Junior,4,Homecoming is great but the biggest parties are centered around CIAA.
Junior,2,I don’t really like the school. I feel as if they don’t welcome new or transfer students in a welcoming matter.
Junior,2,"Run. Don't do it.
Before I go on my rant, shout out to the professors in crutchfield. They are so great. But now
*the dorms are moldy
Over the winter break, they were supposed to fix this problem but failed to. School started 2 weeks late, we had to stay in hotel rooms far away from campus, the shuttles back to campus were unreliable, we didn't receive moving aid once our dorms were fixed, and the staff had the nerve to get attitudes with the student and parents during the entire situation
*the food is bad
The cafe employees often apologize and talk about how terrible the manager is. We often run out of food and the managers do nothing to fix it.
*the alternative food option (buger king) never has food either (you WILL go hungry here if you rely on your meal plan)
*staff is unorganized and unprofessional 
*the security isn't effective"
Freshman,2,experience kind of terrible. our school is on academic probation. we are on the news for having mold rightnow.
Freshman,2,This would be my first year at Johnson C. Smith and so far i am not excited . about attending the school. The advisers are never in their offices to answer phone calls or return them.
College Sophomore,2,Security should be more strict for the students safety and also for faculty and staff.
College Senior,2,Students at my school have a lack school spirit tremendously. They usually only show up to basketball games and they still don't really show support while they are there. The facilities that we have for our sports are really outdated and need remodeling.
College Sophomore,2,"The amount of security on campus needs to increase. It is a high level of crime on and around campus, and it is too much for the few officers we have to handle."
College Junior,2,"Johnson C. Smiths campus is very social and safe student wise. The only flaw is that like many HBCUs it is in not one of the best neighborhoods in Charlotte. Once in a while students aren't always safe outside of the school, even though I personally do feel safe. A lot of the security issues on campus come from the campus police and them not staying on top of their job. They don't closely monitor who comes on campus allowing people that don't belong on the campus, on campus. This has contributed to a lot of crime incidents that have happened on campus."
College Freshman,2,The building are very old which means rust and mold.
College Freshman,2,They only have one building for off campus housing and it is full with a waiting list. This is the worst part because I transferred from a less expensive school to come here for their housing.
College Sophomore,2,I believe my school is a little to strict. Sometimes I feel as if I'm still a kid. Some of our rules on campus are very stupid and immature. I dont feel we are treated as adults
College Sophomore,2,I never get the finical aid that I need and it's always something extra I have to do
College Sophomore,2,The hall I lives in I felt was way too strict along with a lot of other people that lived there . We barely got treated like adults
College Sophomore,2,On campus living for me was worst than when I was at basic training one dorm we lived with bats and the other one they moved us to the bathrooms were nasty
College Junior,2,"it seems like the people that work, get know help at all."
College Freshman,2,"Drugs are so accessible at JCSU. So, if you participate in it, you'll love it. However, if you don't participate in drug activity you will often be an outlier and sometimes usually the only one not doing drugs."
College Sophomore,2,"low moral, lots of hand holding though."
College Sophomore,2,if you want to go uptown during the day it's great. if not you better drive
College Sophomore,2,the bandwidth is low so it can be frustrating and slow
College Sophomore,2,unless you wait all year for ciaa.
College Sophomore,2,so here's the rundown on this... for all the money that goes into that school the average that they spend on students is about 9k. think about that when you write that check parents. the moral in the faculty is low and the buildings are falling apart on the inside but boy will they spend a couple of grand on a lunch for the admin of the school.
College Junior,2,"There should be better facilities for athletes. In the 21st century there should be better equipment available. I am an athlete and I feel as if that my high school gym was better than my college gym. In college you hope to get better equipment, however at JCSU this was not the case. "
College Freshman,2,The computers at y school are old and network availability as well as speed are poor. There's times when the computer would shut off on students during assignments. Some computers wont turn on after awhile or wont charge properly. The wireless connection is weak and personally I would recommend any student to bring their own computers.
College Junior,2,We have flex dollars on campus but the burger king on campus is not done with construction. So we have all of these flex dollars with no where to eat. Plus the cafe closes at 7pm so you will be hungry later on with nothing to eat but noodles.
College Junior,2,I honestly love my college classes and many of the people here are great. The professors are mostly fair and reliable. However the people running the school are not. The finance department will try to cheat you out of your money so you have to keep an eye on them at all times to makes sure you do not give them more money than you have to.
College Junior,2,"I feel that JCSU is an old school. We should be trying to catch up to the other universities in the Charlotte area. Not only have we been left behind, we need better living environment. We pay so much to go to a private school that we should have better living arangements."
College Freshman,2,Visitation rules are too strict.
College Freshman,2,My dorm has an infestation.
College Freshman,2,Our dining hall is always running out of food and there is not a very wide selection of foods.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid office is understaffed and ill equipped to deal with the inflow of students.
College Junior,2,"This school is great, just not enough to experience "
College Sophomore,2,Well it took a minute to get my financial aid but i mean i eventually got it and just make sure you turn in all your stuff on time in order to receive the financial aid you need.
College Sophomore,2,The guys and girls at my school seem to get along very well and most of the guys try to flirt with the girls but other then that they are all actually nice people. Most of the girls can dress and they have their own style so everyone is different.
College Sophomore,2,My school is located in an urban area of North Carolina.
College Freshman,2,I don't really enjoy this school to much because there are a lot of problems. 
College Freshman,2,Nightlife is definitely for those who have a car on campus. 
College Freshman,2,"The art program here is relatively new, so there's not much to expect. "
College Freshman,2,Everyone is pretty similar. There isn't much diversity unfortunately. 
College Freshman,2,JCSU is an HBCU so diversity isn't really going to happen here.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid process is a lot more complicated then first assessed. Forms were lost and paperwork was heavy. The amount of financial aid I received wasn't enough either so I still had my family come out of pocket to help with my college education. 
College Senior,2,We do have a free trolly that takes you to uptown charlotte free of charge. I do wish they had a trolly or bus that was free to students to get them around the city since most of us work off campus.
College Senior,2,"Although our school is a ""private"" institution it is still open to our surrounding areas which is NOT always the best solution."
College Senior,2,Since some of the dorms are down the street and across the bridge walking at night feel unsafe. Once outside the gate at night the safety feel goes way down. Also some of the police on campus looks at certain females as they pass by.... disgusting.
College Sophomore,2,"They tell you Smith is a dry campus, that doesn't mean anything to some of these students if they want it their going to do it. However if they find you doing it on campus you will go before the judicial review board and from there who knows."
College Sophomore,2,"During the fall semester of 2012 the school did not have extra money to give to their students but found extra to build extra buildings to the school. As a biology major I had help from the science department to help me stay in school. They loan me $4, 000 that I have to repay back but with their help I made it through my fall and spring semester making A's and B's."
College Freshman,2,they give you laptops at the beginning of the year and you return them at the end of the year.
College Freshman,2,The weather is so unpredictable. One day it will be about 20 degrees and the next 65.
College Freshman,2,Unless you have a car there is bearly anything to do. However on thursday night they have a shuttle that comes on-campus and takes people to the club. its called college night and all college kids get in free.
College Freshman,2,"There are not many off-campus housing. The only one Johnson C. Smith has is Mosallic Village, which is down the street. The school had to kick some students out because they was on a payment plan. Safety could be better but there is a hole somewhere people from outside can get in and sleep in the restrooms. There are no problems with parking."
College Freshman,2,I am happy with the program I chose. My career goal is to specialize in game designing; I do have some concerns about finding the job of my dream but I will keep at it till I am satisfied with any offers I may get.
College Freshman,2,"I really wouldn't know about this because I haven't heard about any scholarships , I feel like when scholarships are available they should get the news out much better."
College Freshman,2,"Not much student life. You'll find people in the union playing pool, but outside of the union or the block you'll find people going between each others rooms or going off campus"
College Sophomore,2,"They do not have a shuttle bus to get students around campus. They do have a gold rush that is free that take students off campus and they can go down town. I gave the school a C because even though the campus is small and does not really need a shuttle bus, it would be nice for some students who need  the access with some type of disability."
College Freshman,2,"The food is edible, but you quickly get used to eating the same thing routinely and it gets old. Not only that but the food will make you gain the dreaded freshman 15 very quickly if you dont exercise constantly."
College Freshman,2,"downtown charlotte is right down the street, not that theres much to do there. the school is actually located on a really bad street in a horrible neighborhood."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather at JCSU is very different.  It rains a lot and very heavy like the rain forest, and surprisingly it gets pretty cold to to in the southern region."
College Sophomore,2,Johnson C Smith University is a great school. However it needs to improve on its resources and classroom structure and organization skills.
College Freshman,2,There is a lot of designated parking on JCSU's campus but  when it gets full there is a lot where many people park.
College Sophomore,2,"Many blacks but are very nice to the few whites, others."
College Freshman,2,Strict ? There is no curfew what so ever but however freshmans aren't allowed to have co-ed visitation first semester and when it is allowed for second semester it's from 7-11pm
Sophomore,1,"I definitely do not like online school and with this pandemic that’s the only thing we have right now and it is so hard for me because I cannot learn like that. I wish I could do face to face, last semester we did online and my GPA dropped horribly and I don’t too much like that so I definitely prefer face to face classes than online schooling"
Freshman,1,I’ve tried to do online classes before to get a fitness trainer certificate  lets just say I hated it I didn’t understand anything and I never finish my classes  the teachers   Never really helped but it was not with JCSU Maybe there’s is different but I’m scared to do online classes because I’ll fail and don’t nobody want to ruin there GPA.
College Sophomore,1,"The first week, I got a bladder infection from the shower. I've never gotten one prior to living here. There is mold in showers, rust in showers, bugs everywhere, cold water mostly, and flooded showers."
College Freshman,1,Internships are mostly offered to the upperclassmen which is unfair.
Recent Alumnus,1,shuttle bus stops running to early and limited times on the weekends
Recent Alumnus,1,you have to pay every semester and the spaces are limited and some are extremely to far from campus
College Freshman,1,The financial aid office needs a whole new set of workers. They never returned my phone calls. They are the worst .
College Sophomore,1,old campus soooo expensive for what you get. i feel like i've been cheated out of something that could be so much better
College Sophomore,1,small majors not a good variety.
College Sophomore,1,"heavy workload, but really i wouldn't worry about it like i said this place is a degree mill"
College Sophomore,1,old spread out... no parking near them
College Sophomore,1,very old. one of the dorms had to be closed because of bats all over the place.
College Sophomore,1,um the police... i see their cars but never anyone in them or around them
College Sophomore,1,most students are minorities. lots of foreign students
College Sophomore,1,"i stand by my point, i could have done far less work and gotten just as far. very discouraging"
College Sophomore,1,degree mill... i saw people in my pass who did minimal work with minimal effort poor exam grades still pass out of the computer science department
College Sophomore,1,"you can usually find a spot without an issue, however, driving around campus looking for a spot is ridiculous. pot holes and speed bumps everywhere. not to mention the fact that people will randomly walk out in front of you and will just randomly stop in the middle of the street in cars."
College Sophomore,1,yeah... if they catch you (which they never do)
College Sophomore,1,it's pretty non-existent after 7
College Sophomore,1,"well if you are looking for no structure, or a lot of ""turn your head and pretend it isn't happening"" this is your place"
College Sophomore,1,this process is ridiculous at the school
College Junior,1,"not much activities, always want to party and not engage much with students and community. very poor "
College Sophomore,1,Well down the street you have a couple of restaurants but most of them aren't walking distance.
College Senior,1,Parking is terrible.. It's very limited. Majority of parking is designated for staff members
College Freshman,1,The facilities need to be renovated because they are old and need to be cleaned. At this rate the campus life is boring. There is hardly anything to do . Besides the campus life being boring there are great opportunities to for internships with different people of different professions.
College Junior,1,When alumni show on campus is the only time food acceptable.
College Junior,1,"I went to Johnson C Smith University for a year and I feel like if you aren't interested in things they expose to you then you are not going to enjoy yourself at all. They do have their good days, however it can be difficult when certain clubs and organizations require that you be a certain classification/ have a high GPA. Very diverse campus. Food is decent, heard they are now partnered with someone else. Financially the school seems to be a bit shady you do have to watch your money because they will bill you for nothing! Dorm life is okay."
College Junior,1,parking on campus is not good...needs alot of improvement!!!!
College Junior,1,The campus is like a ghost town. The only place you see people is in the union playing pool and that can only accommodate certain numbers.
College Freshman,1,The only unique thing I can give JCSU is that the campus is small and it makes it easier to get to classes on time
College Freshman,1,The school is mainly African American Democratic Christians
College Freshman,1,I dont really see them around and they dont have much of a presence on the campus. I dont even know if there's a frat house to be honest. The frats at JCSU seem to be a nonexistant joke
College Freshman,1,"There isnt much diversity since this is an HBCU , there are a few kids that go here that are of different races, but the primary thing you are african americans. i would love for there to be more diversity"
College Sophomore,1,Its very hard to find a parking space and the pavement is very raggedy with cracks and bumps everywhere.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus can be the worse. You have to always make sure if you leave campus to come back after dark, if not you won't have a park or you'll be at the bottom somewhere. If you stay off campus then it's better to come about 30-45min before class start in order to have a park."
College Senior,1,"Commuting Pests Food Rent – its not as easy to make ends meet living off campus because you have to pay for everything, unless you get water or gas taken care of. also, you have to maintain yourself, including food. and gas is not cheap."
College Freshman,1,Need to transfer – I really dont like the dorms its very out dated the bathrooms I looked in the old yearbooks and the sinks are the same. Mostly everything is in the same model since the 70's (you can look in the yearbooks in the business office) and we have chicken every other day..its not many food choices...the campus is very boring...they let any body walk on campus(even dogs)...and the street outside the gates is packed with homeless people. In my opinion I would have been better off staying home. 
College Freshman,1,"The Food Seems Good at First, but Then You Get Tired of It. Breakfast and Lunch is way better than dinner. The food gets repetitive to the point where you know on which days what will be served. There is also a Papa John's on campus too, but even that gets old."
College Freshman,1,Not a Drug Free Campus – Weed and Alcohol is not foreign at this university even though we have a no tolerance policy. Students openly do these these things.
College Senior,1,Parking is the worst... And if the parking is convent they then say you can't park there and love towing and giving out tickets
College Sophomore,1,The Nasty Cafe – The cafe is nasty. Every Wednesday they have fried chicken and every Friday they have fried fish. On Thursdays I believe they make an attempt on Chinese. I'm so over that cafeteria.
College Freshman,1,They're only a few options nearby and they're are no student discounts.
College Freshman,1,Acceptable..Better Than Nothing – The internet is extremely sow and the majority of the lap tops have defects.
College Junior,1,"Computers on Campus – Computers
The computers are od and to slow. I feel like all the money i spend to go here there should be a better WI- FI service"
College Freshman,1,The different branches of administration seem to not interact with each other. It's like the Buisness Center only deals with the itself so go find out what you need. As far as tips: be persistent and keep ALL of your paperwork because this school lacks communication between it's superiors.
College Freshman,1,"Very limited especially on very popular events. Also, this pavement is a turn off when trying to manuver through this campus."
College Senior,1,there are few parking spaces and the roads are terrible
College Senior,1,Campus Activities – The campus isn't a bad campus; its just at night sometimes there isnt really anything to do. Well at time guys would go the gym to play basketball but after that its like your only option is to go to sleep. We do have a student union with only one choice of food. Which is Papa Johns Pizza. It would be kind of cool if there was another option.
College Junior,1,No Dinning – You have to get on the bus to get to places downtown or drive its like 5 mins away
College Junior,1,We dont have any options for that unless its further away from campus.
College Sophomore,1,Pretty Bad – Parking is almost a horror. There never seems to be enough parking spots.
College Freshman,1,Most things are far and the free trolley stops running early and the buses dont give college students discounts.
College Freshman,1,A Problem – The computers run slow and the internet is always going out.
College Freshman,1,It's a Joke – Security on campus is a joke to me. I never see them out patrolling campus and I feel if something bad happened they would be no where to be found when needed.
College Freshman,1,"Its the worst, there's one cafeteria lady who is rude all she says is "" What you want?"" like she does not want to serve the food. They don't even serve vegetarian food, nor have they opened the Latin Inspired section."
College Junior,1,"There are not many options to choice from around campus. The cafe is gross the variety is terrible, we continue to eat the same meals. And our student union menu is boring! THe pizza is not made how the real Papa Johns company makes there food. Our flex dollars should be able to be used at KoKoMo's to so we can have a variety!"
College Senior,1,The school policies are getting a little better. It used to be bad! Made all the students feel like we were in some type of jail. It shouldn't be like that at all!
College Junior,1,"greek life is present however, i dont feel that it is all that accessible to the non-traditional students"
College Freshman,1,"Freshman Dorms Suck – The freshman dorms and I don't get along because too many girls use the same bathroom and not everyone picks up after themselves. I can't wait to be an upperclassman, so I can live somewhere else."
College Sophomore,1,"There's certain areas where Smith is TOO strict and then not strict enough...Like when it comes to campus police NOT CONSTANTLY patrolling around campus...THAT'S TOO LENIENT. Some of the cameras don't work and I don't feel a sense of comfort when I get my car broken into. Smith is WAY TOO STRICT on taking FOOD OUT OF THE CAFETERIA! I mean, I PAID FOR IT! And then they say it's to keep the campus clean, but I feel like limiting students that have classes at certain times of the day, so on and so forth, is ridiculous."

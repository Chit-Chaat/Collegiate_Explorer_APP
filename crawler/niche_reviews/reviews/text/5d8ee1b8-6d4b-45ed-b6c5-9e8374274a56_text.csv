Junior,5,"I took all of my classes online and everyone has been an amazing experience. The people at Ashland University are there to assist in all matters and this is evident in their excellent communication skills. They regularly touch base with me and ensure I don't have any questions or concerns. This is especially important as I am 40 years old, head of a household, supporting 5 people, and serving in the US Navy and my time is extremely valuable. Overall I could not be happier with the support Ashland University has giving me though out my time working with them and I would highly recommend them to any non-traditional student out there trying to make a better life for themselves and their family."
Junior,5,The thing I like most about Ashland University is from the moment you apply they are there walking you through the process and making sure you are completely settled in before you even take your first class. Registering and getting started with them could not be easier and I would highly recommend.
Alum,5,I loved the community that I was apart of. I made a lot of great friends and got a great education. The food is excellent!
Sophomore,5,"Personally, I liked that Ashland University is a small school, but not too small in the sense of everybody knowing everybody. I also like that Ashland University is a community on its own, which has a warming culture. There are plenty of on school activities to do on campus and everyone is so welcoming, it makes you adapt quickly and becomes your home away from home."
Sophomore,5,"Before the pandemic happened, I was already taken online courses at Ashland University. The professors at Ashland University adapt very well to the student's needs. They give you leverages you wouldn't expect and make it so the learning is convenient and easy for you. They want to see you succeed and demonstrate this through their online learning. They extend deadlines if the internet connection is poor or if you're overall struggling. They make it so learning online is not a hassle for you."
Freshman,5,"The staff are amazing. The food is amazing. The campus is fresh, clean and well developed.  The education is the best."
Freshman,5,Ashland University is a great college. All of their professors are great and will help all students to be successful in their time there. Its got small enough classes that you can talk and everyone can ask questions to their teacher throughout class and talk to them after If you need to. All students are able to have one on one sessions with your professors if a student struggles on the subject they discussed. All the professors are open to change their ways of teaching to help the students benefit more. I would change nothing about this university.
Freshman,5,"I loved how tight knit the faculty was. They are all there to help each individual students achieve their goals. The campus feels extremely safe, which is a major key to me as I have a lot of anxiety with big open public spaces."
Sophomore,5,Very Nice Campus and Teachers take the time to get to know their students! The campus is always kept in great shape and always kept up with. The dining options are also very nice. I have made so many new friends at Ashland University! Choosing this campus was one of the best things I have ever decided to do!
Freshman,5,Very nice campus! It has been such a pleasure to attend there. The campus is nice and cleaned up. All of the professors are helpful and ready to serve. Wouldn't want to attend anywhere else.
Niche User,5,"I fell in love with Ashland University. I come from a small town and Ashland is similar to where I come from. When I got there, the offered beverages and we got a lot of information about cost and majors/minors. Then they offered free T-shirts for our first-time tour. While we were on our tour, we ran into a professor that stopped us and was very friendly. She explained about her and the class she teaches along with the one on one you get with the teachers. I love that it is close to home. The best part of Ashland University is the food. It is Amazing. Everyone is friendly and the environment is great."
Freshman,5,Went on a visit there and the Ashbrook Scholars program really sparked my interest. They have a nice music program as well. I'm not a music major but I do enjoy singing.
Junior,5,"My overall experience at Ashland University has made me so happy. I came from a community college where the teachers were not as personal as the teachers in Ashland University. Its amazing because after my first years I found out that Ashland was a private Christian college. Who knew!!!! God placed me here and everyday I wake up, I appreciate where he has placed me and that is Ashland University"
Freshman,5,"If you are looking for a small college with a great environment this is the place to go. Out of all the colleges I visited, Ashland University was the most honest and upfront with me, and that's why I intend to go here. The people there were friendly to prospective students and invited us with open arms. I can't wait to go here and meet some amazing people and become one in the process."
Junior,5,"Ashland University is a welcoming campus. It is a smaller university, so it feels more familiar than a larger university. All of the professor get to know you personally, instead of just being a number. Every student has the opportunity to really receive extra help from professors when needed, and all of the professors are more than willing help as well; they want want is best for the students, and they want them to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"Ashland University has many different opportunities for all. Being an education major is great because you dive right in making you feel confident about becoming a teacher after graduation. Also, the food is amazing!"
Niche User,5,"I love the close community feel, the one on one learning with the professors, the athletics are great, and how close to home it is."
Freshman,5,"Ashland University was the best choice that I could have made as a college. Coming from a small high school, Ashland has a perfect size campus and perfect classroom size as well. Professors are always willing to help whenever a student needs it and dedicates what they know so that the student can learn in a positive school environment."
Freshman,5,"Honestly just a fantastic college and feels like home, nothing could be better in personal opinion. Food is amazing, professors are very personable and the campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"Great school located in a very safe community.  This aspect alone puts AU above most of the schools in Ohio.   Professors are good at helping and explaining things.  Classes are not huge, and individual attention is given to students.  The dorms need updated and more need built, doubles need to become singles.  Great community of students that look out for each other."
Freshman,5,Ashland University is awesome. My experience at my school is the best. If I am having trouble in any class I can ask for a professor help and get questions answered or even get a tutor. Finding friends is easy as well. There are so many at the school who share your major that it is easy to make friends that will be life long friends. Also there are many students from other countries who are welcomed at the school like any other student who is born here in the States.
Freshman,5,Ashland University is an excellent school. I am a non-traditional student and have found the university to be very accommodating to my needs.
Sophomore,5,"Ashland University is big enough to ""get the college experience,"" but small enough to make you feel valued. The professors know your name and care about your success. Every staff member in every line of work is dedicated to the University and it's students."
Junior,5,"I just love Ashland! It is the perfect school for me. The professors at this school are kind, helpful, and personal! They teach you things for not only your future profession but take the time to get to know you personally."
Freshman,5,Ashland University is a wonderful place. Everyone on campus is very nice and inviting. The food is great and there is always something going on to keep you busy. Class sizes are small and the professors are great.

Sophomore,5,I love the environment of Ashland University. I like to call it my “home away from home” I feel so safe and like it is the right place for me. I have never had a bad experience while attending Ashland.
Niche User,5,"I have had the opportunity to attend Ashland University classes as a High School Senior. The staff, campus, and students were helpful and welcoming. The cafeteria is top notch and I have been accepted as an incoming freshman for the Fall of 2019. After visiting nearly a dozen other college campuses, I found everything from student support, a beautiful campus, and a top rated program at Ashland University."
Niche User,5,"Will be incoming freshman in the Fall 2019.  I selected this school because of their strong academic and athletic programs.   The campus is amazing offering all the benefits some of the larger universities, but with a  small town feel."
Junior,5,much closer to everything important in my life. and grants my the possibility to stay in my lifetime home. the professors are very helpful.
Alum,5,Ashland is an amazing University! I loved the close knit campus and amazing free tools and resources. I loved having ministry in my education experience.
Sophomore,5,"You get out whatever you bring into this University. If you bring hate, drama, and introvertedness, then you will not get what you want out of this University. However, if you work hard, join clubs, and have a positive attitude, then you will enjoy your experience and learn a lot about life and it's experiences."
Sophomore,5,The campus is beautiful. My first year was good. Although it was a struggle adapting to academics...I think all freshman go through this. The teacher interaction made it so much easier. Always responded immediately to my emails and available anytime to meet and explain anything I was needing additional help with. Very personable campus.
Freshman,5,"The college is well organized, clean and has a good professional look. The staff is very kind and is willing to help in any way. The campus is very safe and relaxing."
Freshman,5,I loved Ashland University. The atmosphere seems amazing and the people were very nice. I'm excited to live on campus and the college life for the next 4 years!
Freshman,5,"Ashland University has a large campus and an even larger variety of people. both students and staff are very friendly and understanding people. AU offers  numerous resources for students weather its tutoring, finacial help, or just need some tips on writing an essay. It is definitily a college that ask for its students's finest work efforts because you won't earn a degree or graduate by just sitting around."
Junior,5,I love a lot of things about Ashland University. The campus is beautiful and I enjoy being here. The class sizes are small and the professors make it very personable. They also put in a lot of effort to try to get every student a job when they graduate. I also love the food here.
Freshman,5,Ashland University is a great school! Their nursing and education programs are really prominent and very informative. A little expensive and I'd like for tuition to be cheaper but for it being a private university it is still pretty affordable.
Niche User,5,I was only there on a college visit but I did like everything they had to offer. The programs that I am interested in have a really good staff and facilities to enhance students learning and experience at college.
Freshman,5,"I am a current college freshman enrolled in my second semester here at Ashland. It is a big jump from high school, but it is a good experience. College has taught me how to be more responsible and independent."
Niche User,5,"I've only gone on visits to Ashland University and I can say with complete confidence that I love this school. Everything was so nicely put together, they were very organized, and answered every single question I had."
Freshman,5,There is a real family feel to the college. Everyone is so nice and welcoming when you come for orientation weekend and especially after. People there are so willing to help you feel welcome and to succeed. The professors are always willing to help you and talk to you about the material. The campus is great and the classes are challenging.
Freshman,5,As a first year student things have been great. I have been able to balance my class work and stay active in a club sport as well as join a fraternity.As a freshman in college I was concerned about how I would fit in but my experience has been fantastic and the faculty and student life has exceeded all of my expectations.
Junior,5,"I love ashland and the atmosphere here. It’s such a loving and tight knit community, I definitely made the right choice to come here"
Niche User,5,Ashland has a 2nd chance program which I am apart of.  My tuition and books are paid in full for three month.  Ashland has bless my educational life.
Junior,5,I truly love everything about Ashland University. The size of campus is perfect for me because it is in the middle range where classes don't have as many people in them but it's also still big enough to have plenty of activities and things to do. I also just love that everyone is so friendly and welcoming.
Freshman,5,I liked that whenever I needed something they got back to me rather quickly. The orientation team is a very nice group of individuals. There isn't anything that I'd really like to see changed since I haven't been involved with it long enough to know if anything needs to be changed.
Niche User,5,"I had visited, Ashland University numerous time and it was by far the best experience ive ever had I absolutely loved the campus and the people there."
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year at AU, and it was one of the best experiences I have ever had. I cannot explain how much this school has impacted my life. I have met some very unique people, professors and students, who have greatly improved my life. The professors truly care about your education and your success after graduation. I have spent plenty of time sitting down with my professors during offices hours while they explain a concept to me, and they will completely rearrange their day to help you if needed. I really love having a faculty as my advisor because I learn more about what it is really like in my field. My current faculty advisor has been working with me to make sure that my current major is what I will be happy and successful doing. Also, most of my professors will send me links to new findings or anything related to my interests. They truly care about their students at AU, and I could not see myself anywhere else."
Junior,5,"Ashland University has such an awesome community.  Professors are very helpful and know you on a first name basis.  Due to smaller class sizes, you get so many opportunities to shine.  Our athletic teams, food, and facilities all excel."
Junior,5,I like the small classes and how involved the professors are with every student. I would like to see more professors take their time to actually help the class improve instead of making it more difficult to understand.
Alum,5,"The professor at AU truly care about you as an individual, especially in the business department.  Personally, I got to know my professors as individuals, and it helped tremendously when I went to look for a job or a graduate program.  I could ask professors their opinions, and they were catered based on their knowledge of me as an individual."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Ashland University has been great so far! At this college I don't feel like i'm just a number to a professor. Here I feel like a Important student because the professor's at Ashland care enough to try and build a personal friendship with their student's. Not only are the professors nice people, so are the students and faculty that make up Ashland University. And in all honesty, there is nothing that I dis-like or wish to change about Ashland."
Sophomore,5,The professors are professional. The school work is great.  I've learned a lot I. He past year from taking my classes.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, it's gorgeous. The class sizes are small and students get a lot of one-on-one attention. There aren't a lot of parties but that keeps me focused. The people here are so nice and quick to lend a hand. I feel as though I've thrived in this environment and I cant wait to spend the next 3 years of my life here."
Freshman,5,Ashland is a great school to attend. The professors encourage students to succeed and are willing to help them achieve their goals. 
Freshman,5,I have only attended this college but from my experience it has been great.  The facility is great and the campus is beautiful. I have made the best friends here and its only been 6 weeks. The professors actually take time to make sure you understand the content and it is greatly appreciated. I am a Nursing major and i was struggling at first but i started going to office hours and got a tutor so i think i am doing very well at it now. I am so excited to see what the future holds at Ashland University
College Junior,5,"The campus atmosphere is top notch. I love walking around campus and seeing how beautiful it is. The dorms are really nice. Financial aid is really helpful, and the cost is reasonable."
College Junior,5,Everyone that I've talked to has been very nice and accommodating. The staff seems very knowledgable and eager to help.
College Junior,5,Beautiful campus. Wonderful professors. Great opportunities. Ashland university has shaped me into the woman I am today and has prepared me for my future. The diversity has opened my eyes and I can't for my future as a RN.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful, and the staff/professors there are super friendly if you put forth the effort into your own education. Note, I said put forth your own effort, as this is a D2 private school in which the faculity are there for you if you are there for them. Some don't see this at first within there freshman year, and lose out on opportunities and help along the way for their education. Definitely a good school for those wanting to major in Education, Nursing, Comp-Sci and Business.... the other majors aren't nothing to be known spectacturaly for."
Sophomore,4,"With online experience becoming more prevelant during these uncertain times. I can't lower the stars as most schools are struggling across the country to get a grasp for online education or funding. With this in mind, Ashland has taken a great approach for the new online atmosphere compared to many D2 and D3 schools (not comparing D1 as it's a totally different enviroment)."
Sophomore,4,My overall experience at Ashland University  has been unforgettable. The faculty and staff care greatly about all of the students and campus community. The classes and academics are challenging and enlightening. The friends I have made here will last a life time.
Freshman,4,I do not take any classes online at the moment but working with the staff through Ashland has been stress-free!
Junior,4,Most online classes are super easy to understand the topics being taught. I have taken multiple online classes and would prefer them over in class since I can complete them on my own time.
Sophomore,4,"Ashland University is a wonderful school for those are used to smaller campuses. With only 5,000 undergrad students and a maximum of 25 students per class, Ashland is a great university for one-on-one relationships with professors and others in your major. There are so many ways to get involved on campus through Greek life organizations, community service, on-campus jobs and community service opportunities. You never really run out of things to do."
Freshman,4,I’m a freshman so I can not say too much bad about the school. I will say that the teachers make connections with their students. This ensures a good education as well.
Freshman,4,It is a very small school so it is so easy to navigate. It took me less than a week to know everything that goes on and get my best friends for life. This school has a lot of opportunity for on campus employment and lots of things to do. The only downside is they are like every college and want your money. It costs a lot to live there and they kind of force you to live on campus and get the most expensive meal plan every year. Otherwise it is a great place to be and I feel like I have a lot more opportunities there than if I went anywhere else.
Junior,4,"Ashland University is a good place to go to college. It has opportunities for academics, study abroad and mission trips. The cafeteria food is great."
Junior,4,I recently transfered to Ashland and it has been a fairly smooth transition. The teachers have been able to offer insight and help me throughout the course of the transition.
Senior,4,Most of the teachers are great! Campus is clean. Really like the atmosphere. The professors really try to help you in any way that they can to make sure that you succeed
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far has been good. Ashland University is a welcoming school when choosing friends and when getting help from professors. Although Ashland is an expensive school, there are always ways to earn scholarships and other types of funding to help pay for school. AU is also a school full of clubs and activities on and off campus to do."
Graduate Student,4,"The Professors are excellent, capable and caring. they show a genuine interest in you and, how you are progressing. My classes have been mostly online so, communication is important. Great effort is put forth to ensure  that lessons are clear, due dates are understood and help is available."
Freshman,4,"Ashland University is a great place to go to college. I love the business school and all of the professors I've had so far. All of the people I've met are so nice and student life here in Ashland is great! I just wish that the campus was a little bigger and there were more things to do off campus. I feel that if I want to go off campus to do anything like shop or go out to dinner I have to drive so far. But, overall Ashland is a great place to go to school and I'm very glad I decided to come here."
Niche User,4,"Close knit community on campus. AMAZING FOOD. great music department, while a bit small. small class sizes make it easy for you to feel included and cared about by your professors. This also makes it easier for any questions about the content you may have get answered by your professor. The community surrounding campus is small and spread out, but there are several nice restaurants in town."
Sophomore,4,I like the campus and professors.  Since it is Brethren I expected it to be more conservative than it is.
Sophomore,4,"I love being at Ashland University. I have experienced some great professors and met some amazing friends. There are usually decent levels of student involvement available for all kinds of people. The athletic teams here are outstanding and exciting to watch. There are a few things that need to be changed at Ashland. There are some very lazy employees in the financial aide office that don't seem to take their job seriously. There also isn't much happening on the weekends, which in a way forces a number of the student population to go home every weekend. Another issue at the university are the dorm conditions. Some buildings still need to be renovated so that living can be at its peak for all students, not just the freshmen and seniors."
Sophomore,4,"Ashland has become a second home. When deciding a change in majors, I knew my new current major would lead me in the right direction even though we are the smallest in campus."
Freshman,4,"Ashland University has been great to me so far, the faculty is so nice and the campus life is vibrant. I believe I made the right decision to come to Ashland especially for their nursing ."
Niche User,4,"In my first semester, on line, and it’s been great so far! Courses have been fR and there are lots of courses to choose from."
Senior,4,"I love being at Ashland University. I am an athlete and I could not have picked a better school to continue my education and athletic career. I am able to work hard at school and on the track. This school is small, but it is very easy to get to from place to place fairly quickly. The class sizes are small too, which means you get one-on-one attention from professors. If you have to miss a lecture for athletics, professors work well with that and make sure you do not miss anything important for that day."
Alum,4,"Ashland University has a wonderful education program and opportunities for growth as a pre-service teacher. They place you in a classroom your first year to help the students make sure they know what area of education they want to go into. Outside of academics, there are many opportunities for growth and to explore interests."
Graduate Student,4,The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They are responsive and efficient. It's been an absolute pleasure dealing with them.
Junior,4,"There are many things that I did like about Ashland University as well as a few downfalls. First, there are a lot of positive aspects about academics. I liked that there were small class sizes, lots of hand-on-experience in classes, no TAs, and you could easily build relationships with professors. Another positive is that the dining hall has an excellent selection of food and is top rated in the country. I liked that there was many ways to get involved on campus such as Greek life, Volunteer work, and other clubs and organizations, as well as athletics. The Rec Center was also extremely nice. Downfalls of Ashland include a lack of parking (and lots of parking tickets), the fact that it is a dry campus, and poor quality in housing/dorms. The dorms are mostly small, old, and many do not have air conditioning."
Freshman,4,"Ashland University has a very hometown feel. It's located in a small community, with the college being the center of the town. Class sizes are small, which makes it very easy to be engaged with your professors. They are all welcoming and it is very easy to ask questions. I love that the university focuses on each individual student, and that you don't become lost in a sea of people. I would like to see improvements to some of the academic buildings though, as some are slightly out-dated."
Senior,4,I love the close relationships I have been able to foster among my peers and professors. The small class sizes help to familiarize myself with my fellow students and also make it easier to go to a professor's office hours.
Senior,4,This school is a place that has the nicest students and also the best faculty. These professors and the school in general want to see their students succeed in everything they do which is good because being in a situation like sets up everyone for a good future.
Freshman,4,I love that our campus is such a close community. All of the teachers and pastors in the town really want to know how we are doing and make sure that we succeed.  A few things that should change is the setup of campus. We have few trash cans around campus but we are paying a whole bunch of people to clean our campus. We should just invest in trash cans and save money.
Sophomore,4,"It's a good size school with classes of about 30-40. You get the one on one with your professors, and the walking distance to your classes are no longer than 10 minutes. My favorite is the convocational center where you eat every day. They are award winning for their food and you get to choose from so many different options. They have pizza and pasta everyday, they include a daily special, they have a hot bar, salad bar, and they have so many different desserts, and much more."
Freshman,4,"I love Ashland University for many reasons. Because we are a small private school, the professors know you very well. The professors are also very dedicated to helping their students with their futures. I also love our Center for Academic Support. The Academic Advisors help each student in creating a four year degree plan, which helps each student plan out their major/minor courses as well as their cores. AFter the first year each student is assigned to a faculty advisor; the advisors also ""green lights"" the student to make sure they are on the right course. Overall, I just love the school because of the faculty and the types of courses offered. Not to mention, the food is fantastic."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about the University is that it is really easy to find help on campus with schoolwork, finding a tutor, or even getting a part-time job. I also like the small class sizes so getting help from a professor is easier."
Sophomore,4,It's a pretty small school with a lack in diversity but the students and academics make up for its faults. It's extremely safe and the community is outstanding!
Graduate Student,4,"Ashland university is a  school  that facilitates  diversity, creates an environment for  mental spiritual and  holistic development. It has  international students who are  willing to share their cultural experiences, competent professors and polite students."
Senior,4,Ashland University has professors that care about your achievements. The only problem I have is they do not offer the classes that you need to finish minors after you are half way done with the minor. 
Freshman,4,"I've only been on campus for a month and a half, but I'm pleased with my experience so far. My roommate and I get along good, and I've made several other friends so far. The professors here seem like they really want the students to succeed, and are very helpful. Ashland is a very nice, small campus. I've become involved with several activities already, and I really enjoy them. And finally I'm enjoying the award winning dinning facility."
Sophomore,4,"I love Ashland! The small campus makes it feel at home and it is so clear that all of the professors care deeply about you. I have loved getting involved in religious life, as well as several other organizations on campus. Ashland is truly a great place to be."
College Junior,4,The number of courses that are available is amazing. So many different options. The professors seem very knowledgable and care about the students.
College Junior,4,Many teachers that I had in high school graduated from Ashland university. They are very proud of their Alma mater.
College Junior,4,I really like that escorts are available at any time. They even gave us the phone number right off the bat in student orientation.
College Junior,4,"I see a lot of signs and activities regarding Greek Life. It seems interesting to me, and I might consider taking part in it."
College Junior,4,"The school spirit is amazing at this school. Every where I look I see Purple and Gold and Eagles. Whether it is tshirts, sweatpants, or lanyards, student and staff always seem proud of this school."
College Sophomore,4,When I was looking to attend graduation I looked at how many graduates found a job or went to graduate school. I learned that 93% of graduates find a job or are accepted into graduate school within six months of graduating from Ashland University.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the professors are very enthusiastic and encourage learning. Each student does have to put a fair amount of work into each class in order to get a decent grade.
College Sophomore,4,My room was good for a Freshman year dorm. It is one of the newest buildings on campus. This past year I stayed in Kem Hall which was very close to the convocations center and the tennis courts where I spent a lot of time. The bathrooms were very nice and the room was a decent size considering it was my Freshman year. Some of my neighbors became my best friends.
College Sophomore,4,"Football is a big sport at our school. Many people attend the games.All of Ashland University's sports art NCAA Division 2. I played on the tennis team this past year. The coach was not very good, but he retired at the end of the season. The new coach is expected to be incredible."
College Sophomore,4,"Ashland University has great education classes. They are very helpful in preparing myself and other aspiring teachers to work in the field after graduation. Ashland has several fun activities, however, it is somewhat secluded. It can be hard to find new things to do. Mansfield, the nearest city, is 30 minutes away by car. With an active imagination, it is possible to entertain oneself when all the studying is completed."
College Sophomore,4,I did not go to any clubs or parties my freshman year so I am not sure. There was a bus that drove them to and from the bar that I thought was great to keep them safe. I feel very safe when walking around campus at night because your rarely the only one and their are security guards out and about.
College Sophomore,4,Most professors are very friendly and understanding. They understand that college is difficult and they try and help you the best they can. I like the study rooms in Amstutz although that is an all freshman dorm so I'll have to find another place. I am very grateful for the study labs available anytime in Kettering.
College Senior,4,"Ashland has been known for its sports team so when it comes to fan support and school spirit the community is always there to show it's pride and support. Also, because Ashland is known for its sports teams that is what most of the university is, athletes."
College Sophomore,4,Career services will help to get students into the work force with no issues.
College Sophomore,4,"I have never had an issue with safety on campus, but if anyone ever needs anything, every student is given Safety Sevice's phone number during orientation."
College Sophomore,4,"I am very happy with my housing spaces, and I have been able to meet a lot of new people due to the get-togethers on our floors."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm loving the experience so far! Everyone here is so friendly and helpful, so it makes me feel like I made the right choice."
College Sophomore,4,Career services actively tries to get students jobs and internships by having different events and sending out emails all the time.
College Sophomore,4,I have never had any problems on campus and generally feel very safe.
College Freshman,4,The teachers are really helpful and I learn great from them
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus and I am comfortable walking alone at night. Wish there were more lights. The safety guys are so nice and are always around campus. Feel pretty safe!
College Freshman,4,"I believe the alumni are still very involved with Ashland and I cant wait to be one but, I want my college years to go by slow because I am having such a great time. Career services are pretty good and I might get another job on campus this year."
College Freshman,4,"The class sizes are great! One of the best part about Ashland is the professors know you by name. I have had some great professors but, also some not so great. They are great in their area and very smart but, some professors do not know how to relay that information very well and just read right off of their PowerPoints. Also some professors push their views on you which is okay but, if they disagree with you then your grade is well affected."
College Freshman,4,Our field is very nice. Our rec center is also amazing. I have only been to a couple of home football games but our team was great this year. I enjoyed our pep rallies this year and will definitely go next year/
Senior,2,This Campus lacks diversity. The teachers don't care about anyone but the students on sports teams. There is NOTHING to do off campus and barely anything to do on campus but eat. Books and classes are way overpriced. Would not recommend this school. There are better ones out there.
Sophomore,2,"Very little to do, administration doesn't care about students' happiness or wellbeing - just the money they're making from overpriced room & board and bookstore. The atmosphere is very sheltered, conservative and Christian to the point where it smothers diversity and discourages free-thinking. The local area is extremely impoverished, and makes no attempt to connect with the school. There is no ""street"" for students and nothing to do off campus, especially if the student doesn't have a car. The only positives I've experienced at Ashland are the sports programs, the food, a few professors, and a few friends I've made (but you can make friends anywhere)!"
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is safe for the most part. A vast majority of the students are against sexual assault, but there have been two incidents of which I know about through the grapevine. One was at a party off campus. I know little to nothing about this case. However, there was a case towards the end of the spring semester. An article made it into the school paper. The girl was choked and assaulted in her dorm room. She did not want to press charges, but she did want the offender out of their mutual classes. The school instead made the victim seem like the problem. The victim was forced to write a 3-5 page paper of what she was accusing her classmate. I do not know if he was kicked out of her classes or out of the school as he should have been. There were protests by the students after word was released about this problem."
College Sophomore,2,I had to leave Ashland for a year and go to Eastern Michigan so I could afford to go back to Ashland. I am now joining the National Guard in order to pay for the tuition.
Recent Alumnus,2,There are a lot of rules that need to be followed.  The worst would be the parking.  They are very strict.  Even when car snowed in theres a possibility of you getting a ticket..
College Sophomore,2,Minimal scholarships for general students
College Sophomore,2,The RAs are friends > enforcement most times
College Freshman,2,"Most of the food off-campus dining is fast food. The cafeteria has really good food, so there is no need to go off-campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is high priced, good quality"
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot of life- but for a small college town, they know and like to have fun and throw parties"
College Freshman,2,There isn't really anything around here. You have to go about 20 minutes to get to the nearest mall and other shopping. The closest thing to us is a Wal mart.
College Freshman,2,"There is not much to do off-campus. There is a local area about 20 miles away where you can go to the movies and eat at restaurants, but that is about it."
College Freshman,2,The permit is $20 and the parking lots are far from dorms. If you are parked in the wrong lot the fine is $25.
College Sophomore,2,"I will have trouble finding and internship, let alone any job.  I wish I had fully understood this before I chose this school.  But, I love it here!  I feel like I'm too far into my major at this point."
College Sophomore,2,Not much of any of the above.  transportation is also an issue.
College Sophomore,2,It's all repetitive and there are very few places.  The better places are expensive when you want something different.  There arent' many student discounts and I think things closer to campus are expensive.
College Junior,2,"This is the major downfall of my school!  The dorm I stayed in my freshman year was extremely small and for the cost of housing, it was terrible!  It's one of the main reasons I decided to live at home and commute."
College Sophomore,2,"If it was a bigger campus the weather would definitely affect your campus experience, but since we are so small it is not that bad. My longest walk to class is barely ten minutes."
College Sophomore,2,"There are numerous opportunities to get one, but it is unlikely that they pertain to every major and/or minor."
College Sophomore,2,"It is a decent cost, but the restrictions are crazy. The parking lots are also very far from classes and you cannot even drive to class here."
Niche User,1,I would not recommend taking any classes at this school! Save yourself the trouble and hard earned money!
Graduate Student,1,"I used to be student at Ashland University. If I would be you I would run. Long story short in order to pass classes be prepared to kiss ..... I you are not white be prepared to take exam in clinical and in class for piece of mind of your professor. At least 4- 5 people fail med surg II class every semester and few more people failed OB . We had class of 64 just 57 was able to graduate. A lot of people was few points away from failing med surg II

---------------

Be prepared to travel for hours for your clinical (for peds )

Be prepared to be in your clinicals on Saturday and Sunday (they would give you Monday or Tuesday off)

You would not be very skilled nurses your instructor would pick favorits and they would get all the skills

I hope you do not mind that some clinical instructors date their students? To bad if their lover also flirt with you, because you will fail this clinical rotation

 

Research what people think because you would be gambling with your future"
Junior,1,"If you are looking for a small enough school for offices to know your name, but large enough that they also don't care about you, Ashland is the school for you. The Residence Life program and office at Ashland is nothing short of terrible. Expect to be treated like a child by both the office and your RA. They are very strict on deadlines and will assess fees for just about any minor infraction. Don't expect them to stick to their end of the bargain, however. Requests you make to this office are routinely not fulfilled; expect them to be fulfilled late at best. This pervasive attitude includes Safety Services and Student Life. Don't expect them to be of much help to you during your time at AU. Each of these administrators view themselves as quasi-police, so you'll find that with nearly every interaction with these departments, you'll be racking up charges on your Student Account.
 Steer clear and save yourself a lot of frustration and dollars."
Niche User,1,"I have yet to meet someone from Ashland who doesn't constantly remind me they went to a private college. Yeah it's noble and all that everyone is so straight edge and Catholic, but of you even remotely want to have any sense of fun (it is college afterall) just keep looking."
College Junior,1,I hate living on campus. It costs entirely too much for entirely too little. The dorms are very old and ugly and small. The average double room is like living in a box with a person you don't know. Bugs constantly get in because the screens don't fit right in the Windows. You can feel every wire and spring in every mattress and it really destroys my back and my arthritis joints. It really stinks that we only get an oven and microwave in the kitchen areas. I think a mini full kitchen would be much more beneficial and useful.
Recent Alumnus,1,There are so many things that you have to qualify for in order to even try and live off campus.  Very strict..
College Freshman,1,"Right now, I believe the policy is that you have to be 22 or married to live off-campus. Most students just live on campus all four years."
College Freshman,1,We aren't even allowed to live off campus unless we're over 22.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do on campus during the weekends. Or weekdays. I frequently go home.
College Freshman,1,There isn't much to do. I'm transferring in the fall to somewhere that has more things to offer socially.
College Freshman,1,I get no help financially and it is very frustrating because I do need financial aid.
College Freshman,1,Ashland doesn't allow students to live off campus till you are 22 years old. Unless you are in commuting distance then you can't live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,"I not only won't be able to find an internship, apparently they don't pay YOU, YOU PAY THEM and it costs more than your first born.  It's like paying more tuition.  These internships are just not readily available."
College Sophomore,1,THe problem is FAFSA.  My parents have their own businesses and it always difficult for them to get their tax returns done in time to apply for FAFSA.  I have a scholarship that is only 1/4th of what I need.  THis school is expensive.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus housing really is not available at Ashland unless you bend the rules. You also have to be 22 to have a house on campus, or you have to be a commuter. Also, our campus is a dry campus, so their are very strict on those rules within the dorms, and everywhere on campus."
College Freshman,1,Ashland is a small town and so there aren't very many places to eat off campus. There are the normal fast food places that are within walking distance from campus but there aren't a whole lot of places to go.
College Junior,1,Our campus is pretty strict about drinking on campus and have opposite sexes on each others floors after 2 am. Our RA's enforce the rules and sometimes don't understand that we are college students who do not live with they're parents anymore.
College Sophomore,1,"It's Almost All the Same! Pretty much everyone is similar. We do have international students, but a lot of the people there are a little mean to those who are different or have different beliefs than themselves. The school also won't even have a club that will support the gay community. Its ridiculous."
College Junior,1,Not Much Help – The financial aid process is horrible. The only help that I receive is FASFA. I am struggling getting through school and have no help.
College Sophomore,1,NO Night Life – There is nothing to do in Ashland. It is a dry campus. You can not have parties barely anywhere with out getting in trouble. Be careful where you party. No place for people that are 18 on the weekends either.

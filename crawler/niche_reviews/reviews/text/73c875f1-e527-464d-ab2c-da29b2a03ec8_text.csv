Sophomore,5,"Well, Penn State is a large school. Some people do not feel comfortable at these big schools and can sometimes get overwhelmed by the number of students that attend here. It is easy to find a group of friends, but you should evaluate if you easily are overwhelmed and determine the importance of small classes. I was surprised at how much I liked the large classes, as I was always a class participator in class. The further you get in your major, the smaller the classes are which is always nice. In the past, whenever I told people I attended Penn State, the reaction was always a positive one. People always seemed to hold a high respect level for Penn State, which helped me build my sense of pride in my school."

Freshman,4,"My experience with is so far, a teacher went out of her way to get me into a couple classes, that were interfering with each other. So far it will start off the year with a bang I hope anyway. What I would like to see change? I believe If they could work on  better app for phones, to help out other students."

College Freshman,4,"Many of the professors are great, but because it is such a small school, sometimes, you are ""stuck"" with a professor, whether you like them or not."
College Freshman,4,"As a small school, I have been able to participate in off-side projects that are usually only reserved for upperclassmen. It has been great."
College Freshman,4,"As a small school, I have been able to participate in off-side projects that are usually only reserved for upperclassmen. It has been great."
College Freshman,4,"As for financial aid, my package was great. Aside from my own textbooks, I am currently not paying for any of my college education because of substantial help from federal and state grants as well as scholarships from Penn State itself. I am, however, worried, because my household income has recently increased significantly. This will surely mean I will not receive as much aid for my tuition next year. While our income has increased, it does not necessarily mean I can afford to pay for college without help, and it is making me worried. I will now have to rely on taking out loans, especially when I move to University Park."
College Junior,4,Some professors are really bad but then others are good. Everything is OK.
College Freshman,4,everyone one is very lay back
College Freshman,4,"The diversity of the school is awesome, there are no discrimination against any group of people and i think that's what makes this school great"
College Freshman,4,I'm not really comprehending this question
College Freshman,4,is a great school to earn your degree from
College Junior,4,"Based off friends attending Penn State and the reputation they have, I would say the students that go here are proud to go to Penn State and want to be there.  Also, based off how large it is I would say there is a diverse group of students!"
College Junior,4,So far my experience with transferring to Penn State has been great!  The staff in the administration building has been very helpful and made transferring easier for me!
College Senior,4,The campus is pretty much like any other campus
College Senior,4,"The overall service is great.

The printer fees are a little excessive (how does my tuition not cover printing?)

The wi-fi is spotty."
College Senior,4,"The resources are available to all students with reasonable hours.

Some activities are scheduled during classes."
College Senior,4,"Some of the classes were pretty easy and didn't offer a ""test out"" option"
College Freshman,4,"The best resource center is the library, there'e a lot of resources in there for projects and they have textbooks for classes so you don't have to buy one."
College Freshman,4,The wifi is great but should also be in study rooms.
College Freshman,4,"Despite how expensive the school is, getting to know people and passing classes makes it worth while."
College Freshman,4,"The student body is very fun, the small campus allows everyone to know each other so it's like a family."
College Freshman,4,The academic buildings were built beautifully.
College Freshman,4,Professors are great and the small classrooms offer one to one connections with them.
College Freshman,4,"Classes are fun but as a science major, the work load is hard but it's not hard to earn good grades."
Freshman,2,"Penn State Hazleton is a very small campus with great class room sizes, and you have a strong relationship with your professors."
College Freshman,2,They had a lot of bugs in the system.
College Freshman,2,"I haven't taken online courses at Penn State but I took online courses in High School. They were a huge waste of time, the teacher was never around, and our adviser could not help us without the school's permission. Assignments were often late, and students could easily cheat."
College Junior,2,Their isn't many people so there is only one section of each class. Therefore if classes are at the same time its not good. And if they are a couple hours apart you have to deal with it.
College Freshman,2,"Never taken online, they're extremely expensive and offer no financial aid."
College Freshman,2,"School tuition is extremely high, especially for out of state students."
College Freshman,2,If they do offer these services I don't know about them
College Sophomore,2,"Its very expensive which not everybody can afford without help. Especially me, where i dont come from a decent amount of money background. But with fafsa kind of helping and my out of state tuition its very difficult to keep up"
College Freshman,2,All there is to do is homework or go to parties. Not a very good place to be.
College Sophomore,2,"Specifically, Penn State Hazleton ranks among the top in the nation for hardest math professors.  This is both a good thing as we generally are more prepared for when we go out to University Park and into the real world.  However, the workload and the presentation of the material from these professors will present a challenge to you like no other.  If you need a math course for your degree and absolutely hate/can't do math, take the lowest level course possible.  Engineering majors, get ready for 2 years of hell and beware of Dr. Jimenez."
College Freshman,2,The campus is pretty small so there are not enough courses to be very flexible
College Freshman,2,The only financial aid that I received are loans.  I did not receive any grants or scholarships.  I did not know what I would expect when I started my financial aid process but I would think that there would of been more grants or scholarships to give.
College Junior,2,Financail aid is good and you get your monenys worth by your education but scholarships are heard to find on campus mainly because they dont show us any or specific facuilty aren't that willing to show you what your eliagable for or lead you to someone else who can help you
College Freshman,2,I find that depends on what students are taking. For me I like everything they they have and the jobs they have many.
College Freshman,2,"Well some students haven't matured so it can be a little hard sometimes, but for the most part they are really friendly to everyone."
College Freshman,2,Work With Class – I mainly chose this school because it has always been a dream for me to graduate from Penn State and i picked this campus because its the closest one to me. Plus I have a family member that went there and she told me that she loved it. The job I have there is working in the Cafe which they work around your class schedule. All the teachers are great and very nice.
College Freshman,2,Professor-Student Interaction – I do not think that the professors here take charge in what happens in the classroom. Students will talk and the professor will just dismiss class. It is not the best possible thing to do if you are one trying to learn.
College Junior,1,We don't have many online courses
College Freshman,1,"This place sucks – This place sucks: the food is crap, the lab equipment is junk, the surrounding area is garbage, and some professors don't move at a decent pace (because students here will fail miserably). 
Enough said....

but wait, there's more... DON'T TAKE A SINGLE PHYSICS COURSE HERE... you're better off teaching yourself.
"
College Sophomore,1,"Too Expensive. The amount of money out of state students pay for tuition is decent for someone going to University Park, but we get 1/3 of the perks and it's just not worth it. Penn State is the most expensive public school in the country, but the branch campuses suffer the most. I don't see where my money is going. On the plus side, Hazleton does offer a lot of financial aid."
College Junior,1,Not Worth It – the education i am recieveing her is not worth what i pay. it is worth half if anything. this college is basically a diverse community college. they look for any way to suck your pockets dry. they charge us for everything litterally.
College Sophomore,1,"TERRIBLE TUITION – ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. if you are a middle class family struggling to afford out-of-state tuition, do not come here. especially to waste 30,000 on just hazleton."

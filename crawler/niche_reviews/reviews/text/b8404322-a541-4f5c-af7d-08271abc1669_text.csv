Junior,5,The people there a really friendly. The campus is kind of small compared to universities like LSU but thats what makes everyone there more like a little family.
Alum,5,"Nicholls is affectionately called, ""Harvard on the Bayou"" because it produces some of the most qualified students in South Louisiana, especially Nursing and Education. It has a small but vibrant campus community."
Senior,5,"It's a good school. A lot of walking but I've enjoyed my time there as there is plenty to do with dorm activities and it isn't too far from Houma which has lots of things to do if you need a break. Their culinary program is great, with many options and paths to choose from."
Sophomore,5,"I love Nicholls - the sense of community is amazing here.  Thibodaux is such a cute small town, but there is still so much to do there.  The professors are amazing and so helpful."
Freshman,5,I love Nicholls so much because it truly is like a community not just a college. Everyone is so welcoming and the school is just awesome!
Freshman,5,I love attending school at Nicholls University. It offers extra help to bring up grades. There are many quiet places to study. The faculty are all super nice and friendly. I have never come across a faculty member that was rude or had a bad attitude. one thing I would like to see change would is that I think that there should be more study groups on campus. Most freshman students are too nervous to walk up to a group and ask to join. There should be a study group for each class. I think this would make a tremendous change is confidence and in grades.
Junior,5,"I love going to this school. Highschool wasn't very fun for me, but college has been completely different and I feel Nicholls has offered me countless opportunities which I have taken to get involved. I feel included and I love the school setting overall, the campus is beautiful, the staff and teachers are friendly, and a lot of the people there I have known before so it is easy to make or re meet old friends."
Niche User,5,"Upon applying for Nicholls state university, my parents and myself took a tour of the Campus together. We talked to admissions office, took a golf cart tour of grounds, and also toured housing. The deciding factor that had us all sold on Nicholls was the nursing department. The technology that the nursing department possessed far surpassed anything we had seen at different universities. It offered hospital-like training facilities complete with electronic simulators and high tech mannequin patients . The college is clean. The dorms feel cozy and safe for students. The atmosphere is full of southern hospitality and feels like home. The city of  Thibodaux has some of the best places to eat, shop, and a beautiful library full of resources, a beautiful museum. The pride of the students in the college is highly displayed. It seems easy to be involved in many activities, clubs, and organizations. I can’t wait to begin my journey with NSU."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Nicholls has been great. The university is incredible and I like everything about it. The professors have a open door policy and I have everything that I need accessible to me. There's a cafeteria and also a place where I can sit outside, eat a snack, and study. I like the fact Nicholls has a public library with flexible hours. I would like to see a few things change. There needs to be more parking spaces because the it's hard to find a place to park in the morning. Sometimes I have to walk long distances to get to my class."
Freshman,5,Nicholls State University has been an amazing experience for me. Everyone at the university is very nice and always willing to help. Nicholls State University does everything in their power to make sure that everyone feels included. The professors are so kind and always willing to go the extra mile for their students.
Freshman,5,Nicholls State University is a very family oriented campus. Classes are small and professors are helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I love being at Nicholls. The environment on campus is amazing. Everyone is super friendly and respectful. Professors are super helpful whenever you need them. All professors make sure to explain the subject thoroughly in order for you to understand. Even if you do not understand, they offer for you to meet them in their office during office hours to further help you understand the subject. Food in the union as well in the cafeteria is amazing. The union is a great place to sit down with friends and chat and eat or do homework."
Senior,5,"I am currently in my fourth year at Nicholls State University. It is a lovely place. Most classes are reasonably sized and the professors are great at what they are teaching. The campus is located in a clean and safe environment. There is always some activity going on around the campus. The only flaw is how hard parking can be for commuters at certain times of the day. While I do not live on campus and do not have a meal plan, I do go to some of the stores and restaurants in and around the campus. They are a little overpriced but they are clean and the staff is very friendly and welcoming. I absolutely love being a student at Nicholls State University. It has opened my eyes to such a unique way of thinking and I have made many valuable friendships and memories."
Sophomore,5,"Based off of my experience at Nicholls State University, I can comfortably rate it with a 5-Star, Excellent review. The classes are relatively small in size, anywhere from 30-175 students in undergraduate courses. I feel the class size contributes to more efficient learning and communication amongst professors and students. If living on campus is something you are interested in, they have accommodating options such as family housing; not to mention, the food is AMAZING!
I would comfortably recommend Nicholls' friendly and educational campus to anyone, as it has become a wonderful home-away-from-home for myself. 
GEAUX COLONELS!"
Senior,5,I love this school. It’s close to my hole so there is very little drive time. All the teachers are very nice and everyone I’ve had has always been willing to give extra help to any struggling students. Applying and registering is easy. The only drawback is that the fees are pretty high.
Junior,5,"The small student to teacher ratio.  The only thing I would like to see changed, is the mandatory dorm living for upperclassman"
Freshman,5,"I didn't start yet, but from what I've been hearing its such a great school with an amazing nursing program"
Niche User,5,I went on a campus tour there and I loved the atmosphere there. They have a great culinary program. I love that they have a day called Colonel Day where potential students get to go and see what it's like to be a student there for a whole day.
Freshman,5,Pretty well. Most of the teachers care about you because they classes are small and you can get a good relationship with them. They are all prepared and can answer most the questions you have.
Niche User,5,The small family atmosphere is what I enjoy the most. The campus is smaller than the larger universities and that makes it easier to get around. Campus life has many opportunities to get involved and stay busy.
Senior,5,"I am going into my senior year at Nicholls as a Culinary major. The professors at Nicholls are so hands on and invested. I absolutely love my classes and enjoy the day to day life. Thibodaux is a nice town very small but close enough to New Orleans if you ever need an adventure. The athletics on campus are always breaking barriers and winning championships, the football games are so fun to go to."
Freshman,5,"I love the community surrounder by Nicholls State. The city of Thibodaux is a very wonderful place! But at NSU, I would love to see the campus change. I believe the students deserve more food choices and the flooding is a major issue for commuters."
Freshman,5,I liked that Nicholls is more organized than most colleges i’ve visited in the past year. The campus is amazing and has all the resources needed for someone to pursue their career.
Niche User,5,This was the best university I have been a part of.  One hundred percent the type of campus you need to get involved in and be a part of their growth.
Freshman,5,Im still just a freshman here but so far the faculty are great and helpful. The campus is beautiful. The people are supportive. I truly only have positive things to say. At this college it is what you make of it. They also have a great football team. Geaux Colonels
Junior,5,WHat I like most about NIcholls is that it seems like they genuinely want you to suceed and graduate to pursure your chosen career. That cannot be said about a lot of colleges.
Junior,5,"I enjoy the professors and the atmosphere at school.  Being a non-traditional student I appreciate that I am not made to feel out of place but a welcomed addition to the campus.

I would like to see some of the activities that they do only on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays, be done on Tuesdays and Thursdays too for students who only attend on those days."
Freshman,5,For me Nicholls is good for me due to the locality and the quietness. Once graduation comes around I can actually attend the graduation and not have to wait for my diploma to be mailed. The easy going campus life is real easy to manage.
Alum,5,The professors at Nicholls care about their students and want to see them succeed. I will always recommend this university to anybody!
Niche User,5,My experience has been great. The students there are very out going and avid to get you involved within the school. There is something for everyone and if they don't have what you are looking for you can start it up. The faculty is very kind and  is always available to help work with you to get things you need done. They also have a tutoring center on campus for $25 a semester to help you with any subject you are struggling with. Nicholls definitely works towards your benefit and allows you to have a memorable experience.
Sophomore,5,"Nicholls State kept me close to home with my family and friends, but continues to enroll students of such diverse backgrounds which is where I found my family that is away from their home."
Niche User,5,"Nicholls State University is a student's home away from home. Joyful faces flood the campus with an amazing student body. There are many amazing opportunities for students of all ages, such as: Sororities, drama club, student government, etc. Staff and Administration on campus are well equipped to help any student with any issue. Incoming freshman have a opportunity to tour campus with a worker and experience an in-detail explanation of what Nicholls has to offer."
Junior,5,"If you like a small university, this is the place for you.  Excellent academic programs and knowledgeable staff."
Senior,5,"Nicholls State Univeristy is a great univeristy if you’re looking for an amazing college experience. The teachers and administration provide the students with the tools necessary to succeed. The teachers know most of the students by name ( 20:1). My college experience has been fun. Nicholls provides over 100 clubs that you can join. If there’s not a club that you like, you can CREATE your own. (Bass fishing team, now ranked nationally) 
Greek life is very unique at Nicholls. The Greek students focus on being successful in the classroom and helping out the community. 
Nicholls State University is definitely growing in popularity. The  Nicholls football team has had two great season (back-to-back) almost upsetting the Georgia Bulldogs(26-26) and losing to Texas A&M on a close battle game that A&M took in the 4th qtr. (24-14) 
If you’re looking to have a great college experience filled with many clubs or organizations to join , and a great friendly community,  come to Nicholls!"
Niche User,5,I love Nicholls. They have a beautiful and very safe campus. Their teachers are very understanding and amazing. They have a lot of opportunities to get class help and many things to get involved in.

Freshman,5,"My experience so far with Nicholls State University has been outstanding. Their recruitment process is wonderful, they explain everything and make you feel like family."
Freshman,5,Nicholls was a great change for me and I love it. The only thing that should be improved is the WiFi in housing.
Junior,5,I love Nicholls! It is a very unique college and not too small or too big. We have lots of majors and activities and with having such small classes it makes learning easier
Freshman,5,It’s great go there. Great food great people great teachers. Football is life there. The housing in great come take a visit....
Freshman,5,"Nicholls has many opportunities for everyone to branch out and find their place. Overall, the classes are easy to find and for the majority of the time they are close together. Student activities are everywhere and always available throughout the day. One of the best places to go is the rec center to participate in so many activities from individual workout sessions or an exercise class. I would like to me more events in the cafe."
Alum,5,Great university which I highly recommend! The campus is quite big and the dorms are awesome too. The most important thing is that the environment is friendly and you will get support from many fellow students as well as avpersonal attention from professors. The staff and faculty is great! You won't regret being at that area either. The Cajun people are very friendly and kind.
Niche User,5,"I absolutely love Nicholls. It is a small campus so the classes are small which is good for me. My mom graduated from Nicholls, so I was basically raised going to the campus. I also attended summer camps and soccer camps every year. Everyone there is super nice. I have always had great experiences at Nicholls. I don't have anything that I would change about it."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year at Nicholls as a freshmen. I live in a dorm with four roommates, we all have been friends for awhile so that was pretty cool that I was able to choose my roommates. I am studying premed and the classes are a little hard. I have never had so much homework before. lol I have made new friends as well. I have only been here for a short time so I really think the best is yet to come and I will make the most out of it. I'm always in class when there is certain events going on around campus that I would like to see change so I would be able to check out. But beside that overall I like it here."
Freshman,5,Nicholls is an amazing college. Highly recommend to anyone looking to expand their knowledge and add on the their education. They make anyone feel welcomed and everyone is appreciated.
Sophomore,5,"I just started at Nicholls last semester. I love that when I try to contact anyone, they are always helpful and actually respond to me."
Sophomore,5,"Nicholls State University is a great university and great in education. It is also known as Harvard on the bayou. Besides the academics, there are many different activities that are available for us to enjoy ourselves, especially during the homecoming. There is a big bonfire with great music and food and so many other things. Most people at this school takes it very seriously and you are always seeing people going to the library to work as well as teachers helping the students with whatever they need help in. I loved it there my first year and I am very excited to go back for my second year. The first two semesters seemed hard because I was not used to college but as it went on it got better and I'm ready to have a better experience at this school and do many activities."
Sophomore,5,I love my Nicholls! They have a wide variety of majors and they treat all students like family! Nicholls is our Harvard on the Bayou!
Sophomore,5,Nicholls State University is the perfect college for you if you are looking for a small university that you can connect 1 on 1 with professors and students. The bayous of Thibodaux is the perfect cajun atmosphere and coming to Nicholls is truly an experience.
Sophomore,5,"Nicholls state is the perfect school for many students who want to go to an affordable 4 year college that isn't too big. Thibodeaux is a home away from home for most people. The community is very welcoming, and the administration does a very good job of making Nicholls state feel like home."
Freshman,5,"I love my school and the culture. It is a very diverse campus and I love the atmosphere. Growing up in New Orleans in a city and then moving to a small town made me do different things than before. For example, like for our homecoming there was a bond fire which I had never experience. I think it is a very great school for people to go to if they want to experience new things. There is nothing that I would change about my school except maybe more things."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman this year and I am so glad I chose Nicholls State! My biggest fer coming in was that I would be all alone n campus and it would be difficult to adjust to college life. But everyone at Nicholls and even the surrounding city of Thibodaux is super friendly and they really care about your well being. And the faculty go out of their way to help you get adjusted to college life and the professors are always available if you need extra help with anything. The residence halls are all really nice and some are more laid back (Zerinue, Scholars, Ellender) while other are more on the strict side (Millet) ut they are all really easy to live in. The food is amazing and if you don't like the cafeteria food there are other options that are also really good. Nicholls also has a lot of clubs and my advice is to get involved in as many as you can because its a lot easier to make friends that way. Nicholls also gives away a lot of free food which was a huge bonus for me!"
Freshman,5,"My experience at Nicholls State University has been a wonderful one so far! I've met many other students from around the country. I'm not extremely familiar with the area, so it feels great to know that I am attending one of the safest universities in the state of Louisiana. There's also plenty of opportunities for students to get involved on campus and make new friends. Nicholls is a great choice!"
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman student at Nicholls State University. I really love my school because there is so much to offer for the students. One thing that I was worried about when choosing a college was will there be great resources to rely for each career plan. Nicholls has the best college of business program so far. I plan to succeed in my new journey moving forward. Nicholls also have great faculty/staff that are people friendly and will help you around and find information for you if needed. Because we're not as big of a campus, that is also a plus because it is easier to get around and find different networks of people. I would recommend this school to anyone. "
College Junior,5,"To live on campus, it is very clean and nice. The buildings where i am at is so easy to get to my classes, i can never be late. It is easy to go to the convenient store that is a minute right by my building. The pool area is great and there is no trash around"
College Freshman,5,"If you can't find a job outside of campus, you can always pick something that is on campus so that you can make money. If you want it, its their for you."
College Freshman,5,"The class sizes is ok, my professors are nice and always their to help. They have tons of courses that you can pick from so you don't have to pick from something you don't want to."
College Freshman,5,Nicholls is the safest place to be. Not only in classrooms but in your dorm and walking around on early mornings and late nights. I feel that everyone is safe when you step into this community. The campus police is always around and always a call away.
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus is something everyone should do, you get to meet tons of people, and everyone is friendly."
College Freshman,5,"I like the school that i am attending because not only is everyone happy to be here but, by it not being a very large campus you get the know everyone."
Junior,4,The professors there a pretty cool and very understanding. I did have to take a few online classes due to my work schedule but they were just as easy as actually being in the classroom
Freshman,4,Open and fast communication amongst faculty and staff! Affordable payment plans and opportunities. Nichols keeps its students and faculty informed on all campus activities and school work on its various social media accounts.
Freshman,4,"My online experience was great because my professors were quick to answer my questions regarding all my courses. Also, the format of my online courses was well thought and organized. I had easy and ready access to get to my online courses."
Alum,4,"I learned so much at Nicholls and I am very fond of it. I am the teacher I am today because of the preparedness that was drilled into me while a Student there. On the academic side of things, the education was very practical and precise, but there is a vast difference between academics in the classroom and running your own classroom."
Alum,4,Professors used online learning to provide a hybrid campus/online learning environment for students.
Alum,4,A small campus size and supportive faculty allowed students to feel like an individual and not a number.
Senior,4,"the online classes, depending on the teacher, are easy to keep up with and finish up, even if you feel as though you've fallen far behind."
Freshman,4,I love Nicholls State University because everybody on campus is willing to help you just can't be afraid to ask for it. On my first day walking around campus my friend and I were lost and one of the head people of the school took the time out of their day to stop what they were doing and show us around.
Sophomore,4,"I'm super glad I chose Nicholls State University. Professors are honestly super easy to access. Personally, I prefer smaller universities for this very reason. The campus is clean and easy to navigate around. Overall, it just feels like home."
Freshman,4,"I just finished my first semester at Nicholls, and I had so much fun!! I am a student athlete so we travel a lot and miss classes often. Teachers always wanted to help as well as students. It is a great environment, very friendly- home away from home. Everyone is so kind and southern hospitality is amazing! Caf food could be better though. Dorms are clean and cozy.."
Graduate Student,4,"Online course is great and at my pace, grades could be done quickly, but over all I love it!! Organized, consistent and easy to work through!! Great online experience."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at Nicholls was a whole new environment and world i wasn't used to, but I enjoyed it. The students are friendly and the teachers are very understanding and considerate. The only thing I'd like to see change is the financial aid office, fee and collections office, and the records and registrations office. I feel as though they should have funds set aside for emergency when a student is really in a bind financially. I feel they should be more caring, considerate, and more understanding."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy how Nicholls State University is somewhat family oriented and the professors are very helpful. My freshmen year at Nicholls State was amazing, thanks to football games and welcoming events."
Freshman,4,I've been to Open House and Freshman Orientation at Nicholls for the Fall 2019 semester.  I look forward to attending Nicholls.
Niche User,4,Nichols is very welcoming to its new students letting us get the best education we need. making us become prepared for the jobs we hope to strive towards when  we graduate and are introduced to the real world. i would highly recommend going to nicholls for their programs as you will become ready for your career.

Junior,4,"I've always loved the quaint nature of the University. The campus is rich with diverse cultures, while exzuding a small town aura. I've met some of my best friends while attending Nicholls."
Freshman,4,"Nicholls a a small college in a small town and me being fromna big both I thought I wouldn’t like it at all, but once I went on my first tour and to orientation it was so welcoming. It sounds kind of odd but no one is left out not even a shy girl like me."
Alum,4,Fun experience. Local small town rural feel. People are warm and welcoming. The professors care and bring out the best of your abilities.
Senior,4,"Nicholls is a wonderful University. It has a small campus that allows one to feel ""at home"". The food on campus is amazing."
Junior,4,"Overall, Nicholls State is an wonderful academic university. Though, if a person desires the “college experience”  Nicholls may fall short compared to other universities. Nicholls State is located in a small town about one hour away from my home town. The laid back nature, and the positive environment proved to be the best match for me."
Sophomore,4,"I am a international student so everything here was new to me. However, i never felt alone and lonely in this university. The professor and students are really good. It is a small campus with small number of students which make this university quiet and peace."
Freshman,4,I am only an online student; therefore I wouldn't know much about the facilities. However Nicholls is still a very good school with great teachers.
Sophomore,4,What I like about Nicholls State is there is a lot of activities going on. I think the best activity is crawfish day.
Senior,4,"I really enjoy that Nicholls is a smaller University. This allows professors to get to know the students in their classrooms, which is important for the learning process. One thing I would change would be advising, who performs it and how to make it more effective for students."
Freshman,4,"I like almost everything. Nice and more caring teachers would be nice. The Housing office is horrible. They do not care about your needs and wait last minute for everything. Also, a lot of people just want to get you out of their office as soon as possible. But, there are a few wonderful teachers who are helpful. It just depends on the day and the issue."
Freshman,4,"When I first got to Nicholls, I had no idea what I was doing since I was the first in my family to go to college. Several of my professors and new friends taught me how to develop study skills and find out what I actually wanted to do in life."
Senior,4,"Small campus, student-focused. Not a big party school except on Thursday. Affordable. Does have scholarships. Sodexo is the only food companies on campus but tastes good sometimes if you ask me. Some people complain about it all but cant satisfied everybody."
Niche User,4,I've never attended to the school but I've heard good things. I cant give information that I dont have.
Sophomore,4,Attending Nicholls State was a great way for me to finally experience life. I made lots of friends through out my first semester.
Junior,4,Active community with heavy sports influence. Cajon culture and cuisine also influence this college. Dorms vary in price range and quality.
Senior,4,"Overall, I like Nicholls State University. The professors for the most part are caring and want to see students succeed, the courses are informational and a good load for the college level. The dorm I stayed in (Ellender) was terrible. The floor I was on was loud and people were still coming up the elevator at three a.m. and the RAs picked and chose what to enforce. The campus overall was absolutely gorgeous. As far as the party scene goes, I personally wasn't all that involved in any groups or anything so for me there wasn't much of one, but that doesn't mean it's nonexistent, you just have to know people. The local area is small and there's not much to do, but it's cute. The campus food can be a little bland sometimes, but it's surprisingly good. My biggest problem is with the attendance policy in place. I feel that since we're adults paying for our education at this point, there shouldn't be an attendance policy, we should be responsible for ourselves."
Sophomore,4,"Nicholls State University has several opportunities as far as academics and student life. I found myself learning more and more about things on campus over the years. I enjoy the campus life and I wish there were more organizations such as, sororities for African American females.  I hardly ever see a African American female involved with the many activities involved with being apart of a sorority. I enjoy participating in activities on campus and everyone is friendly and willing to meet new people."
Sophomore,4,So far Nicholls is proving to be everything I wanted it to be. The small campus and class size really help the students get to know their classmates and professors.
Freshman,4,Faculty is encouraging. People are awesome. I never felt like away-from-home whole semester except for the food there. I could not match my taste there and thats understandable too. I am happy I chose Nicholls for my journey.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Nicholls has had its ups and downs. There were times where I knew things could have been easier for me or I could have gotten more help. They pile up a lotta work on you over there. The food wasn't very good at the Student Union; sometimes  they had their off days also. I wish the burgers were better. Especially after I have been stressing out over exams all week.
Freshman,4,"I like how Nicholls State University has a home atmosphere. The community of Thibodaux is very helpful and looks out for one another. Nicholls tries very hard to do anything they can for their students. The only thing that would be good to change, is many students commute, some even an hour. Nicholls is an overall great college."
College Junior,4,The classes are very easy. The variety of classes are pretty good. The professors are there to help you. They help you if you are failing anything or not getting anything. Depending on what classes you have determine the size of it but overall the size is pretty good.
College Junior,4,Everybody participates in a greek event or non-greek event. It is all about having fun and enjoying it with friends. Everybody is liked by everyone. There are no differences between greeks and non greeks because we all go to the same school and everybody just get along so well. We support one another when others are in need.
College Freshman,4,We have meetings all the time where the cheerleaders and other dancers perform often.
College Freshman,4,I am a first time freshman and every professors are very welcoming and explain things thoroughly.
College Freshman,4,We show our pride in our school athletics. Everyone goes out to support the school.
College Freshman,4,my school is unique because no one is afraid to be themselves.
College Junior,4,I've never heard of any issues.  I feel very safe and at home on campus.
College Junior,4,I've never had a problem getting a job in my field.  The oilfield has been rich with jobs.
College Junior,4,"I have toured some of the dorms, but never lived in them.  I live at home."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, the safety of our campus is very strong. We rarely have safety problems because the faculty and staff strongly administers safety procedures to the students."
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is basically like living at home. Its very comfortable, clean, and a very friendly and family felt environment."
College Sophomore,4,Its pretty great. The faculty and teachers are very helpful and living on campus makes you feel right at home.
College Freshman,4,Sports are encouraged on campus but are not rated as more important than academics.
College Sophomore,4,"From what I've seen they're pretty great, there's a lot of school spirit, they are very cheerful, great team performance and fan support."
College Sophomore,4,Great step shows and friendly people
College Sophomore,4,"I think Nicholls State University is a great school, I've only had limited time a the school being that I'm a freshman but over all I would say that the students and the teachers are very welcoming and cheerful and respectful."
College Sophomore,4,The classes usually aren't huge unless it's gen ed or astronomy. You learn a lot and the teachers are wonderful and passionate. I've made friends with almost all of my teachers.
College Sophomore,4,"The education department is wonderful, but it doesn't accommodate high school students because most professors taught middle school and younger."
College Sophomore,4,I'm in SAI and I love it. I tried to go through normal recruitment and had been cut and the girls at SAI are wonderful.
College Freshman,4,"School has really been good for me so far and after gradation in 2019, I hope to be able to go to school again and get a Masters Degree."
College Junior,4,I like the housing life.
College Freshman,4,There is a great amount of courses to take and there are amazing professors for each course. Class sizes are very good and easy to learn with.
Niche User,2,"Do not come here if you want to work in top-ranking companies out-of-state further along the road. In my opinion, Nicholls is only for people who want to probably get a job in-state/nearby for the rest of their lives. No one here has high-reaching goals. 

The school's Education, Nursing, and maaaaaybe Business programs are the only ones worth anything. The music department is EXTREMELY under-developed, Art is excellent if you're wanting to focus on traditional mediums vs. computer animation.

I only had two teachers in the Mass Communications (my major) department that I felt like 1. cared 2. prepared me for an actual career. Other than that, highly disorganized, don't know their own curriculum, and never answer emails.

Coursework is very basic, there's no student orgs except poorly organized greek life and SGA, dorms are ok, and good luck finding stuff to do nearby that's not drinking downtown.

Really make sure if you actually want to go here. I transferred after my second year."
Sophomore,2,Nicholls doesn’t seem to care about their students. It seems they want was to do bad or that all they care about is the money and not our success
Freshman,2,"Nicholls State University is the school to attend  if you do not mind being in the country. Other people who grew up in the big city, I do not recommend you coming to this university. The main thing personally I would change is the location. Many more students would come if it was more known and easy to find."
College Sophomore,2,I don't really know too much about greek life around my school because they are somewhat invisible to our campus.
College Sophomore,2,It's what I hear people in class talk about a lot.
College Sophomore,2,"I know a lot of girls who have been victims of rape and sexual assault and almost nothing is done, especially if the boy who did it is in a fraternity."
College Freshman,2,I don't really care about any of the university's athletics. All I know is that most of my tuition money is going toward football. The football team sucks I heard.
College Freshman,2,The only good thing I have to say about campus housing would be that I do not have to get up very early or worry about parking.
College Junior,2,Not to many advantages and perks going along with being a student but its okay.
College Freshman,2,They can be pretty strict
College Junior,2,It's ok. I'm not a part of it though.
College Junior,2,"The campus police have the i have power complex. We had a ""bad weather day"" where the campus was closed due to ""ice"" it south louisiana a bridge got some ice during the middle of winter and they shut down the whole city. The cops wouldn't let you walk to different buildings after 8 (it's light till 9) and at night they would drive around and shine there lights into the windows of dorm halls…it's 1 in the morning don't you have anything better to do than wake me up with your spot light shinning in my window?!? We call them the Nazi Police at my school."
College Junior,2,"Don't live in Ellender it is considered the getto at Nicholls. The on campus apartments are ok, I think that they enforce the having guest over rule to much and we have a pool on campus but it is always rented out and so the student don't have the ability to use it ever..."
College Freshman,2,not much just mostly fast food and hole-in-the-wall types of places
College Sophomore,2,There are not many close off campus dining options that doesn't involve a drive.
College Student,2,Louisiana weather is bipolar. Period.
College Sophomore,2,"If you want to do basically anything you have to go to Houma which is a good 20-30 minutes away. That's where the mall, movie theater, bowling alley, skating ring, and everything else is. There are a few stores in Thibodaux including a Rue 21, Citi Trends, and a Shoe Dept. but everything else is pretty much in Houma."
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few options when it comes to going out. You could wait for one of the greeks to throw a party, or you can go to basically the only club in town which is Last Call which is small but still pretty fun if you like that type of thing. There's a pool hall called Cues which is fun and has really cheap drinks, and there's  a few bars around, but if you're under 21 it's not worth going to. There is a bus that costs a dollar but it stops running after 6 pm so if you want to go out at night you need to find a ride or have a car."
College Sophomore,2,They never provide you with the right information you're trying to get.
College Senior,2,Most of the computer are very slow
Niche User,1,I didn’t take any classes online all on campus I really hated taking classes there because it’s so unprofessional
Niche User,1,This is the worst university I’ve ever attended they actually don’t care about their students they have the worst faculty and staff there’s always fights there they would literally kick you out just for owing money to the university they don’t even give you a chance to pay it they’ll just kick you out right away there’s so many rude faculty and staff members & students the only thing that’s good about this university is the food nothing else.
Niche User,1,"Very little help from advisors in making decisions and registering for class
felt like they did not really care about my interests for my future"
College Freshman,1,"I have a car on campus, because we do not have a campus bus. We do have taxis but they can sometimes be pricy."
College Freshman,1,"Rain, humidity, it smells, is pretty hot too."
College Junior,1,"A lot of scholarships are for certain degrees, some you have to have a federal grant. Some families have to pay for more than one kid. Just because the parent's income is a good amount, doesn't mean they can pay all the bills, tuition for catholic school, & college + books, supplies, gas, etc. easily. It's ridiculous. Give us more options!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"The older dorms are small and very rarely get cleaned,"
College Junior,1,what nightlife... after the first two weeks of being here you will have more fun in the 24 hour walmart
College Junior,1,"decal are to high, if you live on campus you can only park by a residence hall and if you live off campus good luck finding a parking spot. parking fines are unreasonable and you better pay them or you will get booted"
College Junior,1,they so strict students don't do much... and student participation is low
College Sophomore,1,"Parking Is a Hassle – The parking at the university is very limited. The teachers and visitors have more parking spaces available than students. If a student is parked in the wrong area, a ticket will be given out to that person and a $50.00 ticket will have to be paid just for parking in the wrong area. Then the students parking area isn't no where around the classes they have to go to, so if you don't live on campus you would have to get to school an hour early just to find a parking space."
College Sophomore,1,"Night Life – The night life at Nicholls is very boring..No one goes out anymore ;therefore, the parties are very boring."

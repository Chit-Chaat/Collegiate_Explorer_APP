Niche User,5,I personally find Marshall University very welcoming and open to all students. The campus is easy to get around while still encountering new students everyday. Free time can be spent around campus as there are several things to do around the campus. I cannot wait to continue my education at Marshall University to become a pharmacist!
Niche User,5,"I have been several online courses with Marshall University. Very easy to access classes through Blackboard, as well as all classes being time considerate. I hope to continue my education at Marshall as it is ideal for me and my living situations. Marshall also offers are wide arrange on majors and is accepting of all racial, ethical, and cultural backgrounds!"

Other than the course material I've learned so much from the professors and their careers and personal experiences."
Junior,5,"If you love friendly people that feel like family then Marshall University is the place for you. I have always lived in Huntington and when I graduated high school I wanted to leave to get a different atmosphere however, I am so glad I did not I have made so many new friends and rekindled relationships with old friends. With the experience I had at Marshall University, I would make the choice to go to Marshall all over again. The only thing I believe can be improved is safety. I believe that MUPD should be patrolling through campus at least twice every hour of the night. While there are not many dangerous situations reported, MUPD should get a handle on it now before something does happen. anything. As a female I  want to feel more safe walking at night."
Junior,5,I only had classes online during the pandemic. My experience was not the best because I had bad internet service so I was unable to hear most of the time.
Sophomore,5,"Coming from out of state I was nervous about starting at a new school, especially college. After completing my first year I couldn't be happier! Marshall University makes it effortless to find friends. Across campus, there are numerous places you can go whether it be for studying, grabbing something to eat, or simply hanging out."
Sophomore,5,I liked that they seemed to care about the student. They also have a program that fits my specific needs whereby I struggle with autism.
Sophomore,5,"Marshall University, is a campus that allows you to learn who you are and who you want to become. MU has many opportunities that permits you to making friends, and receiving the most education."

Sophomore,5,Marshall University is a great college to attend. All of the students and faculty are nice and willing to help  you the best they can. I have only attended for a year so far and I am enjoying my experience.
Senior,5,Only basic classes are offered online. The teachers instructing the courses are helpful to any questions. The classes are passable with average effort and can get an A with a little bit more work.
Senior,5,"The best their always ontop of their online system and always working on fixes and improvements. I took 24 hours summer online classes becouse I changed my major and wanted to graduate early. I did not have an issue, and professors seem to know what they doing."
Senior,5,"It is a nice collage. They take care of students if a professor was not fair to them.
The thing that damages marshall university is hunginton. I like to call the city crack heads grounds. Theft, shootings all of the unexpected I saw while I'm their."
Sophomore,5,"This was my freshman year and I love everything about Marshall. The campus is beautiful, the community is great, and the classes are easy. For classes that are rated harder, they offer a free optional class to study in with your peers. I can't wait to return in the fall as a sophomore."
Junior,5,Amazing professors who truly care and go out of their way for the students. Marshall creates a tight-knit community and makes everyone feel welcome!
Senior,5,Professors were great. Campus is cozy. Veterans liaison was amazing. Facilities were well maintained.
Alum,5,Marshall University was one of the best choices I've ever made. Everyone at MU wants to see you be successful and will do whatever they can to help. MU is more than just a school; it is a family.
Freshman,5,Marshall is a great college for those who want to feel at home. The advisors and professors take an interest in every student who comes in and truly want to see them succeed.
Senior,5,"Marshall University is the perfect small college town environment. Everyone is very inviting and outgoing. It is an easy atmosphere to meet new people daily, it is also a great atmosphere to see people you know all the time. The sporting events are a lot of fun and get packed. The school fully supports sports and so does the town. Academics are not on the harder side, some teachers in the science department are hard so you need to look up reviews. Online courses are easy and professors will do a lot for you if you speak up. The dinning halls do not have the best food but there are many options. Starbucks, chick-fi-a, Dennys, sushi, and many more options on campus. There is also a lot of food in walking distances. Frat row is in walking distance to campus and the stadium. The night life is also in walking distance or a short cheap Uber away. Overall, I met so many good people and had a great time."
Freshman,5,"Marshall is a great place to continue your education, the well known name of Marshall University creates a connection to between everyone! The large campus makes for lots of things to do but the small class sizes gives you the opportunity for one on one learning time."
Alum,5,"Beautiful school, awesome party scene, large Greek scene, D1 athletic events, beautiful freshman dorms and suites, brand new remodeled student center"
Senior,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Marshall. So much so that I plan to pursue a graduate degree at this university.
Freshman,5,"It's a great school with a lot of motivated and friendly people. The school has excellent staff, and the school is immaculate and beautiful, too."
Sophomore,5,I love how the professors and staff at Marshal University make you feel at home while you are away from home.
Freshman,5,"Marshall University is a amazing school. I am on my second semester at Marshall and am having such an amazing time. Everyone at Marshall is really nice and very helpful. Marshall offers a textbook loan program for students who can not afford to buy their textbooks. Marshall offers a writing center in the library for the papers you would write. At the writing center you can schedule a online or face to face appointment. These appointments are for you to have somebody to read over your paper and give you feedback to help you revise your paper.  Marshall also has several great meal plans for the students that live on campus. Marshalls student center has several places for us to eat such as a Chic-fil-a, Steak and Shake, and a La Familia. Marshall also has a Dinning Hall for students to go and eat at. I would definitely recommend Marshall University,  Marshall offers so many opportunities and campus activities for us and has the best staff members."
Freshman,5,"The campus is amazing, the staff is top of the line, and everyone is focused on your success here. The location on Huntington is near a lot of the major attractions and you do not need to go far to have some fun. The food here is great and there is a lot of fast food places near and on campus."
Sophomore,5,"I had always wanted to attend Marshall University. Both my brother and sister attended the university and I fell in love with it at a young age. I love the history of the school and the ""family"" feel it offers. The tragic plan crash in 1970 is what makes everyone feel feel like we're apart of a family. You get the experience of attending a big university but still having a close relationship with everyone. That's what makes this place so special. No other university has a story like Marshall University."
Freshman,5,I just would like to see better safety measures on campus. The area is sometimes not the safest to be in.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing experience! The engineering program is wonderfully set up and the professor are amazing! The students are helpful and it is a joy to attend the events such as football, basketball, and the rec has so much to offer"
Sophomore,5,"I've only been with Marshall for a small while, but my mother is a professor there and I've spent a lot of time here now and I can confidently say that I love it here. For being in such a small city comparatively to others in the nation, I say it holds up well. The professors I've had are excellent and I think the facilities are great too for the area."
Freshman,5,"During my experience at Marshall University, it has been amazing and a great chance for me to grow more as a student and as an adult myself. The people I have come into contact with have given me so much help and I am very grateful for them."
Senior,5,"Marshall provides a comprehensive education and has strong ties to it's community. The campus is beautiful, and is staffed with a very kind and knowledgeable faculty. My Marshall experience is invaluable to me and is helping me to prepare for a successful future."
Freshman,5,"Marshall University has a beautiful campus and friendly staff. There are plenty of clubs a person can join and making friends is easy. I myself deal with social anxiety so being put into social situations make me anxious, but everybody on campus is so kind I was able to make long lasting friends. I may only be a freshman, but I already know that this campus has potential. Go herd!"
Senior,5,"We are family at Marshall University! The atmosphere is amazing, which as a student makes me feel like I am a part of something very special. Marshall is very student oriented, and since the university offers hundreds of clubs and organizations, there is something for everyone, no matter their interests or passions. I genuinely believe that every staff member and professor truly cares about their students and is there to help them grow and achieve their personal and educational goals! We are... MARSHALL!"
Freshman,5,"I love the beauty within the campus and the professors are so helpful. Huntington is a bad area, however, and that would be the only flaw that I have to say about it."
Niche User,5,"The campus is very welcoming, with a decent amount of space but being compact enough that it doesn't seem like a small city. It has a large variety of majors to choose from and is a graduate school, so you can get your full education at the university and not need to switch schools later in your education. The city it is located in, Huntington, is very clean and welcoming, with many activities scattered throughout the city, such as shopping, dining of all kinds, bowling alleys, and escape rooms to name a few. Overall Marshall is a very welcoming school with a lot to do, and room for anything you could want to pursue in your education."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Marshall so far has been extraordinary. I have been very involved in student organizations and have been keeping up in all my classes. Coming out of state was somewhat challenging the first few weeks, because it seems like a lot of people here are from West Virginia, but the students have all been welcoming. In high-school teachers would tell me that the professors don't care and you are just a number, but that is not the case here. The professors will help you as much as you ask, as long as you are not a troubled student in class and show up. What I would like to be changed here at Marshall is the amount of places to eat on the campus. Your choices are somewhat limited if you are a picky eater like me!"
Niche User,5,"I love the small class sizes, the security, nice dorms and most of all quality education.  I plan on becoming a speech language pathologist and I feel Marshall University will deliver an excellent education to prepare me for the future.  I have several friends who go to Marshall and they have nothing but great comments about their experiences at Marshall.  I like the diversity of the student population and I'm excited to immerse myself into different cultural experiences that Marshall has to offer.  I have been to Marshall several times to tour the campus.  I've been part of gear up university 2018 and this is what sealed the deal for me to attend there. I feel that Marshall delivers a quality education for the money when compared to other universities that offer my field of study."
Niche User,5,Everything about this college was enjoyable. Their campus is setup in a very convenient layout and have amazing dorms.
Freshman,5,I love my college experience here so far. The campus and the other students are all great and I’m so glad I chose to go to this university
Alum,5,"I struggled in my first year at Marshall, and the help that I received, even when I didn't ask, meant that I regained the confidence needed to be successful.  I felt supported by every professor and administrator that crossed my path, and lived in a nice dorm with a sense of community.  Even out of state, the cost was less than it would have been for me to attend many in-state schools in my home state.  The campus is walkable, and I never felt unsafe while on campus.  I gained a sense of self, a skill set, and had unforgettable experiences here.  Truly proud to be a Daughter of Marshall."
Niche User,5,Marshall is a very affordable school with a wide variety of majors to choose from. Marshall also has a very beautiful campus.
Sophomore,5,"Marshall University is a great school! located in Huntington, WV, its right in the city, so its close and convenient to get around. The area is pretty safe, lots of things to do, and tons of dining choices. The campus itself is clean, safe and easy to get around. Everyone is so friendly and easy to get along with. The staff is wonderful too, always willing to help you out. From registering with admissions to financial aid the staff goes above and beyond to make the process as smooth and stress free as possible. The student advisors are just as helpful when you need help with schedule changes or just advice on what classes you will benefit from taking. The guidance is wonderful! New student orientation was great, I felt so welcomed and really felt like a future daughter of Marshall! Go Herd!!!!!"
Freshman,5,All my professors are very helpful.  I am taking a summer course but there are lots of activities.  I'm in the college program for students with ASD and everyne has been very welcoming and helpful.  It's a great school.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Marshall University. I’m so proud to be part of The Herd! It’s such an attentive & including school. They help all of their students with whatever they need and tend to minority’s issues.
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Marshall University! The campus is really easy to navigate, the professors are nice and very helpful. Most have taught there for many years. The football games are so much fun! Marshall fan's are loyal to their team and stick together through the good and the bad. Marshall's academics are great! I've never met a person who hasn't benefitted from their degree from Marshall. Most Marshall graduates immediately land a job upon graduating."
Freshman,5,"The people are genuine and nice. Their campus is so beautiful and homely. There is always something to do on campus, such as the LGBTQ community, Greek life, Agricultural Club, Marching and concert bands, various choirs and so much more. I’ve never had a bad time or bad experience at Marshall University."
Sophomore,5,Great experience  and very helpful students and staff! I have been attending here for the past two years and I have enjoyed every second of it. Anytime I have any trouble or questions I have no trouble trying to get help. I am going for my BSN Nursing degree and feel as if I have already learned so much more here than I would have anywhere else. The teachers really take time to help their students and individualize their help when needed. I would highly recommend Marshall University to anyone seeking a great college to attend. I am happy with the decision I made!
Sophomore,5,"Marshall was not my first choice of a college. Like most high school seniors, I was ready to be farther away from my parents and on my own; I originally wanted to go out of state. They encouraged me to stay in state and go there, so I did. I can honestly say that this was one of the best choices of my life. I am currently going into my sophomore year at Marshall, and I absolutely love it. The professors are so passionate about their students learning, and many will go above and beyond to help students when they are struggling. Campus life is absolutely great; it isn't too big or too small, and there is always something interesting going on. I have made so many new and diverse friends since being at Marshall, making it even more wonderful. Marshall is home to me now, and I couldn't imagine being anywhere else."
Freshman,5,Marshall has a wonderful campus and they do their best to make sure you are happy with your environment
Freshman,5,I enjoy Marshall University very much. This University has so much to offer and has allowed me to branch out and become the person that I am in current day. I would not have chosen any other college and I believe that Marshall University is a great choice for furthering your academic career.
Freshman,5,Love my experience so far except for my FYS class. That is like a college 101 class and it is not taught the same by each teacher. Mine taught it with more assignments and requirements than other professors require
Freshman,5,The campus is lovely. The staff and students are very friendly. Marshall makes you feel like you are a part of a giant family. The thing I would change would be the size of the dorms. The dorms are somewhat small but you still have enough room to put a few things in the dorm.
Niche User,5,Marshall University has been an excellent school to my family. I have 3 family members who are currently or was a student at this University. Each of them have loved their experience with this school. The professors are extremely helpful and the campus is very nice. They even have emergency phones spread all throughout the campus to ensure all students and staff members are safe. The cafeteria also provides multiple options for their students who may not be sure what they want. Overall Marshall University is an amazing school and I am honored to become a daughter of Marshall this coming fall.
Sophomore,5,"Marshall University is a great Science school. Has one of the best forensic programs in WV, and is also quite affordable. There is also a great Med school program here, as well as a really good digital forensic program."
Senior,5,"Overall is a very good university. The location is perfect in WV, tri-state area with good view. Diversity campus, many international students from all over the world."
Senior,5,"My over all experiment with Marshall so far is amazing, I can’t wait to go there this year! I went to Marshall not to long ago to visit there campus and see how things working around there! And I loved it soo much, it’s so beautiful and they have so much stuff and so many things to do! I just can’t believe I got accepted!"
Sophomore,5,"Marshall has given me some of the best friends in the world. The experience I have had here already are unreal. Out of all of the professors that I have had so far, only a couple of them have been bad. Most of the others have been extremely nice and make learning easier and better for the students within the class. I have had a few professors that have caused me to want to learn again and that is such a good feeling in college. The work is hard, but that is something to be expected when in college. The campus is also well taken care of and we have such a great community here."
Junior,4,"For the most part, the professors have been very helpful with the transition to online. There are some still though who don't quite get that wifi sometimes goes in and out. In general, I don't like online though because it doesnt seem like I am learning. It is just assignments and more assignments."
Junior,4,I am a junior this year and academically am doing well.  I commute so I feel I miss out on social activities having to drive back and forth so far.   COVID-19 has definitely changed what I felt like was a normal routine and made it academically more challenging.
Niche User,4,"Not had a chance to develop my own opinion, but hopefully after graduation 2021, I will get my opportunity."
Niche User,4,"I like Marshall due to the fact that it is a great school for biology, plus it is close to family and my church ."
Graduate Student,4,The faculty at Marshall are well educated and have the personality to move a classroom.  The environment is a calmer one which allows students time to recharge.
Sophomore,4,"It is actually a pretty sweet university to go to, and while it is the only one I've been to, it is still really good when taken into account. Sure, there are issues that the school has, but then again, what school doesn't have its issues? I would definitely recommend it for others."
Sophomore,4,"In the second half of my second semester, all my classes were online. The university along with my teachers made a amazing effort in helping students since classes were no longer in person. Although I enjoyed the way classes were taught online I would say it made it a lot easier for procrastination to happen."
Sophomore,4,My online experience with online classes with Marshall University was a big change at first because of the Coronavirus striking the U.S and taking a toll not on just my life but every citizen in the country and world. I first had to adapt to the big change but after a while online classes weren't so bad.
Sophomore,4,My overall experience at Marshall University has been life changing so far. While being a student at Marshall University I got the opportunity to meet new people and get to make new friends.
Sophomore,4,"In the Spring term of 2020, Marshall University took a stand and changed to online courses for the remainder of the semester due to COVID-19. MU did everything in their power to make the transition to online courses as smooth as possible for all of the student body."
Niche User,4,"My experience was overall a fun and enjoyable experience, got a chance to meet new people and break out of my shell. I liked that the campus was sort of closed off cause it gave everyone the opportunity to actually mingle and interact. What would I like to see change is maybe have more diversity at the school"
Freshman,4,so far the online learning experience has not had any problems as far as i can tell.It has continued to be a great experience for me.Everything is extremely helpful and thoroughly explained.
Freshman,4,From the moment i saw the campus and visited I knew that it was right for me.It has a family-like community.The autism support program here has helped me very much.
Sophomore,4,"The only reason I had to take classes online was due to covid-19. In my personal opinion, I do not enjoy online learning. I understand more in the classroom where I can easily talk to my professor and classmates. For the short time that I did do the online classes, my professor was very helpful and made everything simple enough for me to understand."
Senior,4,The only 2 online classes I took prior to COVID-19 had very helpful professors that made sure we had everything required to succeed. After COVID-19 when everything transitioned to online learning the faculty made sure everything ran smoothly and we were prepared for every test.
Senior,4,Most of the professors are helpful and very good teachers. I do not live on the main campus so I do not know much about what goes on there but Huntington is certainly not the most safe area in WV.
Junior,4,"I haven't taken many classes online, but many professors do most of their school work online. Blackboard is very easy to navigate and most professors give clear instructions about what to do."
Junior,4,"Marshall is a smaller campus which is great for walking to classes, especially in the cold. They have great traditions and very friendly staff. Some classrooms need updated and the dining options on campus are very slim causing you to grow sick of the food very fast. The dorms are very nice and many people enjoy living in them. All students get into all the athletic games for free giving even more things to do on campus while not in class. I would encourage everyone close enough to Marshall University to visit."
Senior,4,"Professors are mostly helpful and good teachers. Campus is nice, surrounding area is a bit run down. Plenty of organizations to become involved in."
Freshman,4,The overall experience at Marshall has been good. They offer many different types of programs and clubs. They also have many different things to help students whether it be with academics or their lives in general.
Junior,4,Most professors did not do zoom/online class meetings. Professors were incredibly supportive and helpful. Appropriate refunds were made and additional grants were given out to aid students through difficult times.
Sophomore,4,"Marshall has a very welcoming staff and student body. They have a club for everyone and the campus is not too big or too small. It is very easy to find a place where you fit in. The facility truly cares and if you chose wisely, you will have a fantastic experience both academically and socially."
Senior,4,"I like the diversity of Marshall University. The college is close to my hometown, Charleston, West Virginia, so its overall convenience is helpful. When I attended Marshall for the first time in the Fall of 2011 I loved the campus. I truly felt welcomed and like a daughter of Marshall."
Sophomore,4,"Marshall is great overall. Most of the classes are fun or at least decent, and the students seem to enjoy themselves. The only area of improvement I see is keeping the bathrooms stocked with toilet paper, paper towels, and feminine products in the ones that offer them."
Senior,4,I recently got into Marshall University at the beginning of the Year of 2020. It is a beautiful college and I am honestly honored to be enrolled. I did transfer in from Stony Brook University since I was moving to West Virginia. I so far in the month I have been here I don't have any complaints.
Freshman,4,"Overall experience at Marshall is excellent. Most of the professors I have met are great and dedicated to working with you, so you can get a proper education during your time in their classrooms. Only complaint I have is that the WiFi is unreliable at times in the dorms, but that issue can be fixed by going to the library because the connection is rather reliable there."
Alum,4,"I loved Marshall. The campus is great and a good variety of courses- online and on campus. As with any campus, some of the professors could use a lot of work. They also look for countless ways to stick you with more fees. So expensive.  Overall, my experience was great."
Graduate Student,4,"I am a returning grad student after a military career since 2003 and have completed a years worth of online-only Master's in Leadership Studies. Dr. Bethel of the Leadership Master's program is amazing.  Application, blackboard, writing support center, and professor engagment have all been smooth."
Junior,4,I am a transfer student and Marshall University took all of my credits. They have been very helpful in making sure I am in the right track to graduation. The campus is also very pretty.
Niche User,4,I have been there a few times and it is a nice place. I know some people that have gone there and they have done good and liked going there.
Senior,4,"Very friendly atmosphere and the Marshall ""culture"" is very exciting and fun. Especially at football games. There's a little something for everyone really."
Graduate Student,4,I liked the cultural diversity. How friendly the local atmosphere is plenty of restaurants to choose from. The multi cultural festivals they have. The teachers are very helpful they really want to see you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Marshall University has a lot of incredible experiences that you can gain. There may be some rough patches, but they can be easily smoothed over once you get comfortable with the campus itself."
Sophomore,4,I love the people and professors! Everyone is super kind and willing to lend you a hand to help you be successful. The campus is small but full of life! It is very easy to get around the beautiful campus quickly.
Sophomore,4,Marshall University is a very welcoming place. The atmosphere is homey and the professors are kind. The only issue with Marshall is that the buildings need updated.
Senior,4,"I like my experience at Marshall for many different reasons. I like seeing people of different interests and backgrounds. I also like that the professors here are helpful and are eager to help you plan your future. One thing, I wish there are a few more Major and Minor options available in certain fields."
Senior,4,"I love going to Marshall. Class sizes are small, which allows people to develop speaking relationships with other classmates and professors. It has been a lot of fun attending this school. I never lived in the dorms, so I can't rate those."
Freshman,4,Marshall is a welcoming and encouraging university with tons of events when you aren't in class. They have tons of classes to attend. Sporting events are always energetic and enjoyable. You'll always meet new and interesting people at Marshall.
Graduate Student,4,I like the classes and my professors are very helpful and understanding. I wish that some of my classes weren't at locations other than campus sometimes because it is harder to find parking at the VA hospital sometimes.
Freshman,4,"Marshall is a small enough school that you feel able to make connections to other students and staff, but not so small that there is no diversity."
Freshman,4,"I love Marshall University. I am a  second generation Marshall student, and I feel as though Marshall is one big family. It has nice facilities and a great staff of professors. The only thing I would like to see change would be to have better dining options, but that is already being worked on for this coming semester. I love my college."
Senior,4,"Marshall University provides a great education, offering a large variety of fields to study. I feel Marshall does effectively prepare students to enter into the job force. The facilities are all either average or above average.Some state of the art. The rec. center being one if those. Overall, the Marshall campus is very safe and is ninitored well by the campus police department."
Senior,4,"Marshall is one of the more affordable universities  in my area. I've gotten many opportunities to improve myself both within my major and outside it. It feels as if a new opportunity of some sort is advertised each week. The professors are, for the most part, very helpful. Nearly all of the faculty and students I have met are friendly. The city it's in has a lot of crime, however, but Marshall has quite a few campus police to make up for this. I recommend Marshall University highly if you're looking for an undergraduate degree!"
Freshman,4,I love the campus and the people. It is an amazing environment and everyone is actually as nice as they seem. The only issue I have is the food at the dining halls.
Freshman,4,The facualty is lovely and actually cares about their students. The only reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 is because of their 2 years living on campus requirement
Freshman,4,Marshall has great academic opportunities and truly cares about student life. They also provide many religious organizations that students can get involved in if they choose to.
Junior,4,It has taken me a few years to really get settled in and on the right path but i do love my school. I do wish our university was located in a less crime area.
Sophomore,4,"The education and social atmosphere that I have been involved with so far have been very pleasing.  Teachers are cooperative and offer study groups, plenty of credit opportunities, and personal assistance to struggling students.  I wish that there were certain credits that were not required for all majors, such as music, so that students could hone their experience more on their careers.  However the campus has extended safety measures considering the part of town it is located in, a diverse campus, plenty of learning opportunities, and excellent extracurriculars, counseling, and social opportunities."
Alum,4,Feels like a family! Everyone was always super helpful to be able to complete my dreams. There are plenty of different majors to choose from and many opportunities to try out something new if you feel that you do not fit in a certain area. The offering of online courses has been excellent for anyone not able to travel to campus or for those who work full time and cannot attend like a normal student.
Graduate Student,4,"At marshall university, the atmosphere of diversity and quality goes above and beyond. Marshall makes sure their students are well rounded and taken care of in any way or form."
Sophomore,4,"I believe Marshall University was the best decision I made when I graduated high school. The friends I have made during my time at Marshall will forever be with me throughout my career. I also have networked with so many experts in my field of study that I believe will make a complete difference in the years to come. I am happy with the experience of Marshall, and encourage anyone who is looking for a great college to apply."
Niche User,4,"Very nice college in a great little city with lots to do, great food and shops in Pullman Square, and a great community atmosphere."
Freshman,4,"Marshall University is a very open place.  The campus is self is very open and clean.  The professors are easy to talk with, and they are willing to help most of the time.  The campus food on the other hand is not the best.  I wish they had more variety of options.  The freshman doors are super nice.  I enjoy going to the football games on the weekend and hanging out with my friends.  I am looking forward to see how my future years will be as a daughter of Marshall."
Junior,4,"Marshall has a good-sized campus, with adequate class sizes. There are opportunities to engage with professors and ample on-campus activities provided. The university promotes student involvement and offers the resources needed to excel during your four years, as well as in the professional world."
Graduate Student,4,"A good medical program, though is in need of some solidity in terms of programs. Everything here is always changing and in flux, and this has worsened with the passing of the dean of preclinical education."
Sophomore,4,"Marshall feels like home. No matter who you are or where you are from! The professors are encouraging for the most part, but the actual town it is located in needs work."
Junior,4,"Marshall University is a good school...but it is not safe to be outside OFF CAMPUS at night. It is located in downtown Huntington, WV which is honestly a pretty dangerous place with the drug and crime epidemic that is happening there right now. Other than that the education is AMAZING and the professors are so caring and genuine. I have never met professors that care as much as they do. They have helped me out so much when I had to miss class for medical reasons. Although safety could be a concern, it is safe on campus."
Alum,4,"I think Marshall is a wonderful university.  It fits on about four blocks in Huntington, WV. It was easy to get to classes without feeling too big or too small.  The Marshall community was very friendly and it was easy to find friendly faces around campus."
Freshman,4,Coming from the small neighborhood of Westmoreland and going to such a big university like Marshall has definitely been a culture shock. Witnessing the diversity and becoming a part of this family like school has been so good for the soul. Marshall has continuously been my home away from home (even though home is only 20 minutes away)
Junior,4,"I really like Marshall University and how most of the professors will wok with me as a non-traditional student.  I have a family and have no choice but to work close to ful-time, and my professors understand that life gets in the way.  I would like to see more available times for tutoring for students like me who are non-traditional and have a harder time working around a schedule."
Senior,2,"Marshall University seems like it offers outstanding services in other areas, but as far as COLA  goes, it was terrible! I am a psychology major and I literally had to do EVERYTHING on my own. My advisor was absolutely TERRIBLE and the  majority of the Psychology staff does not teach anything useful."
Alum,2,"As an transfer student and out-of-state student, I would consider Marshall University a poor option for continued education. Additionally, their visual arts program rushes students through material that requires extended practice.

I experienced a lot of trouble with getting transfer credits accepted, forcing me to retake many of the courses I already took. Effectively contributing to my already high tuition. 

As a visual arts student, with former experience at another art institution (One that auditions students, Marshall does not) I would consider the curriculum in the arts as being below sub-par. Basic drawing, painting, 2-D and 3-D art, etc, and are each squeezed into a meager 8 weeks. This is simply not enough time for a student, particularly ones with no former experience, to learn and execute these skills with proficiency. Furthermore, professors are inconsiderate towards students with special situations (transfers) and do not view students as capable peers."
College Freshman,2,Marshall is full of drama. Beautiful campus.
College Sophomore,2,huntington itself is bad with drugs
College Sophomore,2,they want you money. the newest ones are okay but if you dont get in those you are out of luck
College Sophomore,2,not safe campus isnt safe huntington isnt safe
College Junior,2,"Most of the times, my university will own the house of a greek organization; in others, the fraternity or sorority, or its national corporation, will own the house  and be responsible for maintaining it."
College Sophomore,2,"I have had very good experiences with most professors and their grading strategies. I have also had a few very bad experiences with professor's teaching styles, workload, and grading strategies. Some professors, particularly nursing professors, grade on a very unreasonable scale allowing only a small portion of the class to pass exams. 

The physiology department is very lacking, in teaching and quality of courses, or at least it was in the spring of 2015.

Class sizes are reasonable."
College Sophomore,2,"While on the average day nothing goes on on campus, in Huntington theres at least one incident every day. It's called Little Detroit around the area because of the out of state drug trafficking and the crime. Sadly, the police try but some are in on it and little can be done. The safest place in Huntington is on campus. There are train tracks that box in campus and students are told if they stay in the train track box they will be ok. Which is true for the most part... if you don't mind you car being broken into, followed to and from your car or building, being harassed by panhandlers or catcalled. MUPD and HPD's are more concerned over who parked where without a permit or if your meter ran out than actual safety. Personal safety falls on the students which makes it difficult when there is a zero tolerance policy on weapons of any kind. You can be expelled from school if you are even caught with pepper spray on campus. That is the issue. If the authorities aren't going to protect us, DONT remove our ability to do so ourselves!"
College Freshman,2,"I am not a fan with the buildings. I am a person that likes a bathroom, and a kitchen. Most colleges I have been to have an apartment option with a kitchen and a bathroom for the group of students living there. I was shocked to know that there are zero options here. I can honestly say that if that was to change more people would want to live on campus and Marshall would gain more profits from that. But most people are forced to move off campus if they want that. Especially with the food not being good on campus I want a kitchen to at least make my own. Buskirk, where I am now, wouldn't be so terrible if you put some tlc into the bathrooms and kitchens. They are way out of date and pretty gross."
College Freshman,2,We have tall stands on campus with blue lights to push if we need help but only one of them actually work and if you're across campus it will be way too late by the time someone helps you. I have never seen a cop on campus just around it. Never see them at night.
Recent Alumnus,2,Just remember there much more to do in college than join a frat or sorority and play beer pong on weekends while your grades suffer
Recent Alumnus,2,"The faculty is great , but the administration is out of touch focusing more on research and athletics instead of educating the students"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The food is not good quality, and the majority of foo places are fast food options. It makes sense because students are on the go, but it is not good for there health."
College Sophomore,2,Not enough space for more than one resident
College Freshman,2,Late night option at Towers sucks. The late night hours are bad too. And so are the weekend hours
College Freshman,2,There's been many sexual assaults this school year
College Freshman,2,I don't live off campus
College Junior,2,"For my intended major, I feel as if a degree here is pointless. After I receive my bachelors here, I plan on going to a much better school for further study."
College Senior,2,High price and low quality coupled with grouchy mean workers.
College Sophomore,2,There are some internships but not one available for every major.
College Sophomore,2,"They do not have the specific major I would like to take, but they have all the classes."
College Senior,2,There are not enough parking for all the students.
College Senior,2,I have applied for various scholarships but do not know if I have obtain any. My major does not offer scholarships and most offered are for freshman.
College Freshman,2,"tuition is high for out of state students, there are not a lot of available scholarships and financial aid for those who are out of state.  This has lead to many student loans."
College Freshman,2,"It seems to rain all the time, campus sidewalks floods bad."
College Junior,2,Marshall hardly supplies scholarships and the biggest ones hardly help.
College Freshman,2,"sucks, everything is out dated.  roads are pot hole ridden, and unless you are clubbing then all there is, is bowling and movies"
College Freshman,2,"I'm not a partier, but if you are then this is party central.  Just about 75% of campus gets drunk, high, and laid every weekend.  But if you're not into that, good luck making friends....."
College Freshman,2,"No one knows who you are and few care to help you.  I don't know who my adviser is, and I'm a sophomore! I went to ask who my adviser was, and they gave me the wrong one!! So frustrating! Also thanks to 'wonderful advising', I am going to have to be here for three more years, even though i have 60 credits.  I wish someone would have gave me better advice on which classes to take first and maybe i wouldn't be in this mess.  The education major, in any specialty, is ridiculously long and unnecessary.  Not to mention, bachelor's teachers have to sub for two years once they get out.  How will I ever get a good job?"
College Freshman,2,Wireless networks are very unreliable and are down in the dorms the majority of the time.
College Freshman,2,"When it is sunny, it is one of the prettiest campus's I've ever seen. But that is only occasionally. It likes to rain and snow a lot on campus. Have an umbrella with you at all times. You could walk into a two hour class not a cloud in the sky. Walk out and it's a down poor. They haven't cancelled in years. You have to be prepared in all aspects of weather. "
College Freshman,2,the financial aid office is not extremely helpful. 
College Sophomore,2,"All the classes are within walking distance which is nice but the bus needed for transportation off campus doesn't come very often. Otherwise, you need a car to get anywhere."
College Junior,2,"Parking is too far away from dorms and classes.  It's expensive.  Permits sell out fast.  Parking is enforced hourly, so you could potentially have a big bill to pay, and if you don't pay the parking tickets, you can't register for next semester."
College Junior,2,"Most places to rent are over priced, with no \amenities, no off street parking.  Obtaining a place, usually requires a background check and a credit check, proof of funds/incomes, and if you don't have it, your parents have to sign to be legally responsible for your rent.  No where accepts pets and 1 year leases are hard to get out of when you go home in the summer."
College Freshman,2,"if you live on campus or in apartments near campus, its not hard to find a spot. however, if you commute and you don't have classes till later in the day, it can be extremely hard to find a spot. sometimes you may have to park far away from campus and walk for a while"
College Freshman,2,"there have been some pretty bad stories about Greek life. however, there have also been some positive stories about them. some of them are good and others are bad."
College Freshman,2,"the off-campus housing selection at Marshall University is fairly decent. There are a lot of choices and almost all of them are really close to the Campus. it can be cheaper than living on campus but you also have your own food expenses which can be very costly. Overall, Marshall does a good job assisting students with off-campus housing."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Our campus offers a shuttle to the hospital and student health as well as a shuttle to the downtown area.  These shuttles are free, which is great, but sometimes it is hard to fit a ride into your schedule."
College Junior,2,"There are bars and restaurants with bars in them. if you want a club, you'll need to go to the next town over. If you're just looking for cheap beer on tap, this town's a good place for it though"
College Junior,2,"There are a lot of bars and pubs.. the river is within walking distance, but there isn't a whole lot to do off campus. Fortunately, there is always something interesting and awesome going on within the university"
College Sophomore,2,"I received a decent amount of financial aid, but I am still having to take out loans. I have won a scholarship to another school but Marshall wasn't able to meet it nor did they try to help."
College Freshman,2,"The price is kind of ridiculous. I've always been able to find a spot, though I have to park a little out there sometimes."
College Junior,2,At night on campus I feel very unsafe about walking alone. The crime rate on campus and around campus is pretty high. For my personal safety I usually carry pepper spray. A security guard offered to walk with me from dorm to dorm late one night to make sure I made it safely which made me feel a lot better.
College Junior,2,"Campus police are egotistical and power hungry.  There's no smoking, which isn't the worst thing in the world, but that does seem strict to me.  The dorm security is fairly lax however."
College Sophomore,2,very difficult to find parking.  Need to arrive early.
College Sophomore,2,"They don't make it well known at all that there are many you can apply for. Really, the only ones you hear about is the Promise Scholarship. Other than that, I don't even know what scholarships they accept. I don't have any scholarships because their way of trying to distribute them in high school was incredibly confusing and ineffective."
College Senior,2,I was off campus for a year and did not enjoy it. I prefer on campus housing.
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus dining consist of a lot of fast food places just down the street. There are some very good restaurants that are great to go hang out and eat, but it's bit of a distance."
College Sophomore,2,"Huntington is on the colder side for over half of the year, most of which is in the school year. It rains fairly often in the late fall through spring. Even in the winter, there is more rain than snow, and plenty of slush and ice."
College Sophomore,2,"Although having a car isn't a necessity on my campus, it does make certain things, like getting supplies, easier since there aren't many stores near campus. There are multiple parking lots on campus, but they are small and only one is conveniently placed. Unluckily, half of this lot got demolished to make room for a new building. This has made parking a nightmare. If you aren't there before the first set of early morning classes, good luck getting a spot in this lot!"
College Senior,2,"I feel like we are average in all of our sports, but I secretly feel like many students participating in football get an easy way out when it comes to school work. there are times when I feel like they wont attend a class for weeks but still pass. seems unfair they can miss so much for sports."
College Junior,2,"They just removed a lot of student and teacher parking to build the new Engineering Building.  Parking is getting crowded and hard to find, but not impossible.  Permits are pretty expensive, and parking tickets rack up quick.  Bus isn't very reliable either, so a car is a necessity to get anywhere on time."
College Sophomore,2,"A parking permit at MU is prohibitively expensive, and most parking lots are a good distance from classes with no public transportation offered, also if you want to park in the parking garage which has a walkway to campus you have to pay even more on top of the usual permit. The only other option is city meter parking, my personal choice, since it's closer than any of the permit parking area and by the end of the semester much cheaper."
College Freshman,2,"It RAINS ALL THE TIME! The way the city is built they have a poor drainage system, so their are many flash flood warnings. During the winter it can get pretty cold."
College Freshman,2,"Now that their is a new foreign exchange program that is mostly why Marshall can some what be rated as diverse, other than that the sports teams are what bring diversity to the school. Many people at the school commute so campus can be pretty empty at times. As far as sexual orientation I come from the Washington DC area and from what I saw it Marshall it is not even close to the diversity of sexual orientation to where im from."
College Sophomore,2,"I am a commuter, so I really only hear about things from other people. However, I hear that there are some really strict rules set in place in the dorms. The biggest one being the rules concerning alcohol. I do know they even have room checks for it occasionally. I know that would stress me out."
College Freshman,2,"The campus had a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol, which I think is great. But most people get away with it because they're friends with their RAs. It is very easy for residents to hide their illegal possessions because RAs don't check in desks of drawers during room checks because of privacy issues. The strictness would be better if they actually enforced the zero tolerance policy."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't enough parking for students and the parking passes are overpriced. Ever since they eliminated an entire parking lot, parking has been a fight for students on the street who don't already have a spot. Students are now willing to take the risk of getting tickets because they are so desperate."
Sophomore,1,"You don't learn anything at the end of the day compared to on campus. It wasn't my first choice, and I wish I never even had to take that choice. End of story."
Niche User,1,Better than actually showing up to class. You have a better idea of understanding the material if you read it online. The professors do not know how to teach
Niche User,1,"If I could rate this school negative 5 stars I would. Please protect yourselves or your loved ones and do not come to this University. You will most likely get shot at when you step off-campus. Student life? Don't you mean sorority and frat life? That's all your gonna get with Marshall University. I got mauled down campus by them and treated horribly by people for me to even give more money to the school. The  people on campus really only care about themselves and are a different breed of West Virginians. No one cares about you or your chances of sucess. The teachers are mediocre and only care about 
assistant to teach you the class. Please if your reading this and you care about your safety and happiness, GO TO West Virginia University or your parent's basement because anything is better than Marshall."
Freshman,1,I am an out of state student and I have had hated every minute I have spent at Marshall University. The food is awful. The people are untrustworthy. There is nothing to do around campus. Any party gets shut down. I am getting a high school level education while paying thousands. All of the services refer you to another. I have never been more depressed in my life if you choose to go here good luck.
Senior,1,"Marshall is an awful school to attend, and it was a huge mistake to come here. The professors are either low-quality or don't speak English or both. The people in charge of student activities talk things up in their emails and then it turns out to be poorly designed or way over capacity. The classes are 90's era information, and you had better hope your employers don't know the poor quality of the schooling here or you'll have a tough time getting a job afterwards. The area it's in (Huntington) is atrocious and only those who've lived here their whole lives would find it even remotely desirable to be here."
Freshman,1,"A student with disabilities I find Marshall University very unaccommodating &  stay away from that HELP program.  The professors are more concerned about Trump than teaching the class.   The most dangerous place.  ""Little Detroit"" is what we call it.  I lived in off campus apartment, literally a stones throw from the entrance, and had nightly shootings, fights, meth users walking up and down the streets, in fact when my parents came to visit they were disgusted at what they saw and insisted I transfer before I was killed walking to my car.  Never received campus alerts for the multiple robbery's that occurred or shootings.   Nothing to do around town, police dept being cut in half.   As far as academics, I passed both semesters and they still said I was not eligible for federal loans due to ""their standards"".    BEST DECISION EVER is to transfer!"
College Sophomore,1,I hate Marshall so much. all they want is your money $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
College Freshman,1,Every day I am given a new reason to hate this place. I am absolutely miserable here and extremely dissatisfied with the way I have been treated. I feel like I am looked at as a credit card number more than a person.
College Freshman,1,The workload was harder in high school when I took AP and honors courses. I don't know if I am even smart anymore or if I'm just surrounded by stupidity.
College Freshman,1,I have never been in a place with as many bigots in one area until I came to Marshall University. The amount of Trump supporters scares me.
College Freshman,1,My entire floor always smells like weed and no one cares when I complain about it.
College Freshman,1,"If you are not an education, nursing, premed, engineering major, you are going to be stuck with a pretty low paying job. Sorry. You can find much better prospects elsewhere."
College Freshman,1,"Don't make the same mistakes I did. I am making it my life's mission to dissuade kids from coming to Marshall. If you barely got into college, congrats! You'll blend in with the general population of imbeciles. Don't think you will save money because you do not get much bang for your buck. I have been miserable this whole year and look forward to next year when I go to WVU. 

Professors are the only thing that keeps me from jumping out my window in the morning. They're nice and willing to help. The classes are easier than ones I took in high school. I'm still deciding if that's because I was an AP student or because Marshall has very low expectations for students.

Huntington is not safe. Period. They'll tell you ""as long as you stay on campus you're fine!"" but I have been asked for money by seriously sketchy people INSIDE THE STUDENT CENTER. Also, the campus is very small so it's easy to get cabin fever within a couple of weeks. 

People that work in the offices are not only incompetent and can't answer any questions, but they are also so rude.They're people that are unhappy about their lives and they take it out on the students that pay their salaries. 

Just promise me you won't come here. I went on a tour my senior year and thought it was fine but then I actually lived here and I knew it was not where I would get my degree."
College Freshman,1,"Overpriced for what you get. I do not really feel safe living in Twin Towers East. There are no security cameras so someone could strangle me in the middle of the hallway and then when someone accuses them of it after my passing, the strangler could say ""No I didn't!!!"" and they would have to believe the strangler because they have no evidence of it. Everywhere smells like marijuana. Rules are enforced in some areas to an unnecessary degree while others have so little rules that it is reminiscent of an ape exhibit at a zoo that starves their animals. 

I am in the Honors College and did not receive priority on housing at all. They put my in the dingiest building on campus while imbeciles that hardly got into college get to live in the nice First Year dorms out of pure luck."
College Freshman,1,"If you are not in Greek life, you will not have anything to do. If you are in Greek life, you will only associate with people in Greek life."
College Freshman,1,"Athletics take up all of the money we give this institution. Life is probably pretty swell for people involved with football and basketball, but there are more important things in life."
College Sophomore,1,"From a non-Greek I can tell you, good luck making friends without some letters! Non-Greeks are basically ignored on our campus until the Greeks are fundraising or recruiting. For some people, its just not economical to be a Greek. The fee's are equivalent to a few credit hours! So because I want to save what little money I do have for classes for CLASSES, I can't enjoy life at school? No you can, just be prepared to do it alone."
College Freshman,1,From personal experience I rushed a sorority and they made comments about every girl behind their backs. Wouldn't let a girl join because she had a gay sister. Wouldn't let a girl join because she didn't wear enough name brand clothing. Very judgmental and rude.
College Sophomore,1,"I absolutely hate being so close to home and not gaining the ""true"" college experience. I hope my view of my hometown and university change in the next few years or else I know I will always regret this part of my life."
College Freshman,1,"there are no room searches for drugs/alcohol.  no one checks to see what you're doing.  you rarely get in trouble for making noise.  BUT you will always get a parking ticket, and you will always get cited for plagiarizing so don't even try to get around it."

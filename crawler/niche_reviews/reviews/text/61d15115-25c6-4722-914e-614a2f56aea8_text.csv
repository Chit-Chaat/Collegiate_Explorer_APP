Graduate Student,5,Ospace was fun. A lot of professors email you and stay connected at all times to help guide you and make sure you succeed.
Graduate Student,5,This is the best school in the whole world.  If you are an artist or designer looking to go into a professional design career then this is the right place. You have to really want it because it is challenging and worth it. You will create your best work here. You will become your best self here and find your path. Best professors ever.
Sophomore,5,I'm a new student but I've been able to see how Otis has operated during the pandemic and things have been incredible. They managed to host a few webinars informing students of what to expect and invited alumni to join. It was a great experience and very informative and most of all the school's faculty do seem to have a genuine caring nature for their students.
Freshman,5,I am an incoming freshman at Otis College and I have no complaints. They have been extremely supportive with the change and are open to answer any questions and are very quick to help you with your problems or questions.
Freshman,5,"If you want to do something that involves art this is the place to go. You’ll learn a lot, not only from the professors, but from just living on campus. They have many activities that will make you feel extremely welcome. Foundation year may be hard, but once you get through it, it’s extremely worth it because you will be doing what you want to do. Otis is also extremely diverse and will definitely help you in finding a job wether it be in or out of campus."
Senior,5,Otis college of art and design really is a great art college and what i have seen and heard of it it really is good college especially because other art colleges are either to fare to attend or not in my state besides art center Otis did come to my school to talk to students about Otis and help us find a career in art so i have my hopes set on Otis
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the faculty and programs they have here, the curriculum is great and you get a good amount of creative freedom with your work. The only thing I'd like to see change is the amount of work load and amount of money one spends"
Niche User,5,"I love the new dorms, they were a great addition. Not that the school can do anything about it, but I wish it was a little closer to downtown Los Angeles, all the art is more there, not at the airport haha."
Freshman,5,"As someone who is looking for a rigorous school , Otis College of Art and Design was a great pick. As a college freshman at Otis, the Foundation year has roved extremely helpful in refining my skills and easing me into the workload and high expectations. The schools' small and compact campus gives this very unified and focused environment that differs strongly from other schools with larger campuses and enormous enrollment rates. Furthermore, Otis has extraordinarily talented professors with years of professional experience within their area of skill."
Freshman,5,Otis is a great school with a good freshman program. The professors are professionals in the fields that they teach.
College Sophomore,5,everyone i know is employed
College Freshman,5,Great education on health and safety and not overbearing but just enough for everyone to be aware on campus.
College Freshman,5,Quality attention and teaching from each professor.
College Freshman,5,Students learn to network and get internships while being a student.
College Freshman,5,It's beautiful living in Southern California in the amazing housing at Playa deal Oro.
College Freshman,5,"I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. The courses, professors, and peers complement where I am in my life right now and I find myself enjoying life more than ever before."
College Sophomore,5,"The security on campus for the most part is very diligent. Of course, there are some cases of a stolen wallet or keys. There is always a security guard at the front desk and security cameras on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors at the school are very passionate about what they are teaching, thus resulting in a more inspiring learning environment. The courses become more interesting and valuable to me when I see that the professors really put effort effective teaching and making sure the students understand it."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone had been incredibly kind and helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"Everything was synced through my FSA profile. 

The office administrators were incredibly helpful as well."
College Freshman,5,The persons working in this department make sure that you know who they are and that you feel confident to go and talk to them if needed.
College Freshman,5,"I'm planning on going to Toy Design, and have an internship in Mattel or any other great Toy Company, I've heard that Otis is a great place for this major, since there are only two colleges in the US that have Toy Design as a major."
College Freshman,5,"Since I registered late for Campus Housing there were no spaces in the two Buildings extremely close to school, so I live 15 minutes away by bus, but the school is helping me get a monthly bus pass, so it is good, the apartment is big enough, it has all the services so it is really good."
College Freshman,5,"Los Angeles is a great place for the Toy industry so I think Otis has a great location, besides that the area is really safe it has good transportation, so it is good."
Recent Alumnus,5,"So helpful and quick

Very clear on every step and documentation I needed"
Recent Alumnus,5,"There is so much support from your program leaders and from other students and staff.

If you have  question anyone will try to help.

Teachers are incredibly knowledgeable and intelligent.

CRITICAL THINKERS HERE"
Recent Alumnus,5,EVERYONE IS SO NICE AND HELPFUL!
College Senior,5,"There are eight majors, and specific subcategories in each major. I'm in digital media and we never sleep but it's cool because we are a big family."
College Senior,5,"It's a small art school in Southern California so naturally it's pretty laid back. Otis throws really great events and is a fun place but at the same time, everyone is very focused on working and creating beautiful work."
College Senior,5,"I have received so much help with the financial aid process. I visit the financial aid office frequently and have my questions answered quickly and efficiently. Other than government financial aid such as FAFSA, another great way to find scholarships is to just ask faculty, teachers, and staff to keep you noted. I get emails and notifications of other great scholarship opportunities. Another note is to do good in school BEFORE COLLEGE. Doing well in high school and on SATs was a big bonus for me."
College Senior,5,My school is very diverse. I've met so many different people from all around the world. It's great to get a first-hand interaction with different people from different cultures.
College Senior,5,"Although the campus life is not that exciting, since we are always busy, campus activities do try to make campus fun, by holding fun events. (For example: during finals they serve us free food and brought dogs to play with. During Halloween, they had a whole week set. Each day themed.) Besides that the facilities at our school are great. We have access to so many labs and shops, such as wood and metal shop, letter press lab, screen printing lab, computer labs have all programs, 3D printing, laser cutting, etc. It is exciting that we get to learn many things and have access to them."
College Senior,5,"Otis is truly diverse! I have met many people from around the world, and it is great."
College Freshman,5,"Always parking at the main campus and free, but at the fashion campus parking is 200 dollars a month now that is ridiculous."
College Sophomore,5,I am currently a sophomore in college. I am planning to have my internship next semester.
College Freshman,5,I have learned so much and have grown as an artist. Liberal art classes and studio classes overlap ad my foundation year has been amazing. Im learning to see what my style as an artist is and I can't wait till is start my major in Fashion. The fashion program here is the best in California and the school is highly known for the fashion program.
College Freshman,5,our school is the best on helping their students look for jobs and students are already working before the graduate. Students all work with internships as well.
College Freshman,5,I have never seen anyone or heard of people taking drugs. If anything the students here smoke so much. There is always a group of students standing in front of our school and smoking.
College Freshman,5,"There is a great amount of computers enough for everyone to use. The library is filled with them and on the fourth floor almost every room is filled with them. It does make it easier to bring your own laptop because there is free wi-fi, but if you are going to need one of the school computer, there is one always open, but don't wait to use it during finals week."
College Freshman,5,The school is generous depending on your portfolio and need. There are many outside scholarships that the school will tell us about.
College Freshman,5,"There has never been any danger my time here at Otis. This school is very safe. If anything, we are near the LAX airport so if there is a safety concern we are alerted if anything is going wrong at the airport, and our school will mostly only be affected by a heavy traffic if the airport is closed off."
College Student,5,"It's California, of course it's great weather!"
College Student,5,campus life is one of the best.
College Sophomore,5,"It's in the city of Los Angeles, and close to the beach. There's always something cool to walk or take the bus to. Or even catch a movie!"
College Sophomore,5,"Since it's located in Los Angeles, California, you can expect sunny skies almost everyday."
College Sophomore,5,"Once FASFA is completed, you really just wait. The financial aid office is friendly, and they helped me apply for the CAL Grant."
College Sophomore,5,"The housing here is great, yet only available for the first year, otherwise you have to continue to apply for it. Very expensive!"
College Sophomore,5,"People smoke here, but outside the campus.  There hasn't been anything serious so far."
College Sophomore,5,"The school is quite near the beach, so the weather is slightly humid and usually cool.  Sometimes you can smell the ocean, which is great."
College Freshman,5,"Tons of international students, particularly Korean. Because it's an art school, it is very accepting sexually and ethically."
College Freshman,5,"Otis is located within 2 miles of LAX, which offers many busses too."
College Freshman,5,There are always computers available in one of the labs. The computers have all needed software and hardware such as tablets.
College Freshman,5,"Southern California's coast has perfect weather, year round!"
College Freshman,5,We have amazing labs and technology available to anyone at school.
College Freshman,5,I love LA weather. It's always nice even if it's raining.
College Freshman,5,"Our teachers are amazing. A lot of our digital media teachers work or have worked at companies like Naughty Dog, Dreamworks, Disney, Pixar etc. Everyone works in industry and are very inspiring."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is extremely chill. Obviously there are some people who are nasty but overall, everyone is really nice and won't pressure you to try anything. But it is art school, so drugs, mostly weed, are common. But you can have fun in so many other ways."
College Freshman,5,Our apartments are amazing and I'm sad to leave my room next year.
College Freshman,5,We have lots of international students as well as students from all around the country.
College Freshman,5,I've never witnessed drug abuse.
Sophomore,4,"Otis is one of those schools where what you put into it, is what you get out of it. There isn't much time for partying or socializing if you are busy with your studies and studio classes (which works for me as an introvert). If you are busy with outside life, such as socializing, then you pass through your classes but your portfolio won't be the strongest. I would recommend going through foundation (freshman) year if you can afford it, so you can refine your general skills and learn to think and see in a much more artistic, designer-ish way. If you can, also get housing on campus, so that you can save on high LA rent. The area around Otis is a bit dead, but with a car (carshare and ubers)  you can access a lot more of LA. The administration seems eager to help and is overall very friendly. Professors are understanding if you communicate with them, and are very professional and critical - with hopes of helping you become the best artist or designer you can be."
Alum,4,They are easily one of the best art schools for fashion design (well above FIDM) but I wish they gave more digital design classes. Hand drawing figures is great for portfolios but not used in the workforce.
Sophomore,4,Otis College of Art and Design provides a space for anyone wanting to get into the creative field. The school is open for everyone and it also has their own art store. The library is vast with many books ranging from art history to guide books.
Sophomore,4,"OTIS is a very good school, where I have always felt welcomed and respected. There are some things that the school lacks and can improve on, but overall I feel that I am learning and growing here as a designer."
Freshman,4,"Otis College of Art and design is a very unique and diverse school offering a multitude of majors, minors, resources and educational benefits. I would like to see more financial assistance offered to students who attend."
Niche User,4,"Well, I'm still not a student there, but the school is stunning.  I visited the school for an open house, where I learned that the school is very invested in helping and seeing their alumnus succeed.  They have very cool art programs that help students discover their artistic abilities. The only thing I wish Otis would change, was it's expensive tuition."
Niche User,4,A creative small campus that offers diverse courses for students. There is an art gallery and cafeteria on the campus. The annual graduating class exhibitions are a great way to see all the great work by the talented students.
Junior,4,"What I loved about Otis College is the progress I've seen in my artwork, The professors care and want to help their students to reach success. But only if the students themselves shows determination, desire and progress to work and face challenges. The professors will not waste, time and critiques on students who do not show initiative.  At this school, if you want to reach your goals you must have the will to do what it takes. 

At Otis college, the professors either are or were in the art industry and share their experiences and advice with us, the students. This means we get taught, advised and given assignments as if were already working in the industry. 

If you did not know the basics of color theory or anatomy, Otis college will prepare you for. Otis college is one of the very few colleges who have a Foundation Program where first time students will learn the basics they need to advance their skills in the long run while also showing students what Otis College has to offer."
Alum,4,Otis is a small school with a great community. I learned both academics and technical skills there. The best part of being a student at Otis was the people I met. The alumni community at Otis is very strong.
Senior,4,Otis College has a good faculty that genuinely care for each student. All of my professors were very encouraging and caring for each and every student making sure they succeed in what they want to achieve.
Freshman,4,"This school was better than I had hoped for, it was surprising to me how little people knew about this school. The school is well connected to the art world, and I have already been in contact with people in my desired field. The teachers here are all working currently in the art field. They go from work to teaching the students. Every class I have taken, although tough, has significantly improved my art and I look forward to seeing more improvement in the future. The school holds many events on the student behalf such as dog distress day to take care and reward their students. The environment at the school is so open and free and has such sweet and caring people. It is a friendly community of students and teachers who support a help each other. The school also has great credibility in the art world, so I know that getting a job will be easier"
Niche User,4,I attended Otis College of Art and Design for the first foundation year and I had an amazing experience learning from my fellow students and finding who I was as an artist.
College Freshman,4,"The academics are very rigorous, and the students very hardworking."
College Freshman,4,There's a lot of diversity and international students on campus! People have so many different stories to tell because of their backgrounds; it's great.
College Freshman,4,Drugs don't really happen on campus; they occur more outside of campus. No one pressures anyone into doing anything.
College Freshman,4,"A lot of students get offered jobs while in school, and the teacher has to urge them to continue their degree. The school also often has fairs where companies come and showcase the opportunities they have to students. Most internships go to juniors and seniors, though sophomores can find opportunities as well. The career center is really helpful, albeit they could do a bit more to advertise how helpful they are, because a lot of students are unaware sometimes."
College Freshman,4,"Now, we're a pretty specialized school, so there's a limit on courses offered in that regard; however, within that purview, the variety of courses offered and available is pretty darn great. The teacher's are passionate about their work, and always willing to talk and help out students. Class sizes are really nice, since it's usually 16-20, and you get to know people well. Some of the classrooms could be more comfortable, but some of the uncomfortableness is necessary logistically for the things we're doing."
College Freshman,4,"Security on campus is pretty darn good! Our school takes sexual assault really seriously, putting all the students through informational activities so we can stay educated."
College Freshman,4,"Housing is pretty great! We live in an apartment complex among residents near the school, so that's pretty cool. They've built dorms for next year, though, so that'll be different."
College Freshman,4,"It's so hard to choose one experience that has impacted me significantly, because my whole time at Otis has been life-changing. It's a place where different people's lives intersect, as we all try to find our place in the world through art and friendship. And there are so many more experiences to be had and things to learn."
College Freshman,4,"There are some problems with the school but they are mostly registration and admissions related. All I can say is sometimes I wish that ""tenure"" didn't exist."
College Freshman,4,There have been many problems that I have sent work orders for at the beginning of my Foundation year that have not been addressed yet even though I have put in many work orders. Other than that the location and accommodations are fine.
College Sophomore,4,"dorms are very strict, it wont be a worst option for pepel younger then 21. they have lots of resident events every year.

very convinent to reach the RA's."
College Sophomore,4,"best digital media department, i would totally join the school again if i had to, because of the department head, he is awesome and friendly to all."
College Freshman,4,I think a lot of students get a job right after their graduation. I believe that Otis helps students get jobs because of their connections.
College Sophomore,4,The acceptance in regards to things such as economic backgrounds and sexual orientation is awesome. Most students have open minds. I would only have to say that the gender and ethnic diversity brings the rating down a star because it is not quite as stellar as the acceptance levels.
College Sophomore,4,There are security guards and cameras in each building one campus that honestly put one’s safety as their priority and are more than happy to assist if you ever feel unsafe.
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the variety of classes offered Otis and love that I have an opportunity to take such classes. They introduce new perspectives and clearly connect to one’s major, teaching a skill set you know you’ll use for the rest of your life."
College Sophomore,4,"I am so glad I chose this particular art school, it just feels right and I know I am getting an exceptional education."
College Freshman,4,"Perfect for just learning, nothing hitting you hard, and quiet."
College Sophomore,4,"The career center has an online job board that you can upload a resume and other information on. However, it is quite difficult to find on-campus jobs unless you make an appointment at the career center first. Job opportunities after graduating are very competitive and the actual number of job offers vary between the different major departments."
College Sophomore,4,"This school overall is very helpful and challenging. It isn't too competitive to the point that discourages community bonding, however, we are under enough pressure that inspires creativity."
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of guards and workshops for sexual assault.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy this school.
College Sophomore,4,"The alumnis are awesome, and there are internship offers."
College Freshman,4,In my opinion I think this school is great when it comes to academics and also very strict with their policies. There's alot of events and always something new and exciting going on. However there is a lack in promoting these activities and not much school spirit when it comes to the student. Otis has a unique mix of students that are interesting to get to know. So far so good just hoping to get out of this area more often.
College Junior,4,"Great teachers who give real-life stories of experience in the current job market. Very small, so you get to know students and teachers very well. Lots of opportunities to learn new skills as well. Only reason for 4/5 is because of the high tuition."
College Sophomore,4,"Made great friends, great experience, but some teachers act too diva."
College Junior,4,The only negative is that it is near LAX's traffic.
College Senior,4,"Several local places to dine include as low budget as fast-food drive-throughs to vegan/healthy options to great places like Humble Potato, Chicago Ribs, crepes, Cinque for great Mexican food but a little pricey. Some places offer student discounts like Humble Potato"
College Senior,4,"Campus doesn't have actual dorms but utilizes a luxury apartment rentals (with student dorm pricing for 1st year students) a few blocks away. The buildings have a gym, pool, bbq grills, parking garage, high security, apartments are very nice with granite countertops in the kitchen and balconies with good views of the grounds."
College Freshman,4,"Got almost half of tuition covered last year from the Otis scholarship alone. With grants and other types of aid, I was able to reduce the cost of school to about a fourth of what it is."
College Freshman,4,"Roommates are friendly, we share opinions about classes and teachers but we have our own private space to do our own thing."
College Freshman,4,"There are plenty of dining options outside of school within 20 minute walking distance, but some places can be pretty expensive."
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid officers are great at helping with any financial aid needs, and will offer any assistance. The process is very long though."
College Freshman,4,There's a great place called the humble potato I recently went to and loved!
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe while on campus, there is always a security guard at the front door."
Recent Alumnus,4,cheaper than school housing but further away
College Sophomore,4,"Basically everyone is friendly to everyone at this school, but I'm not surprised considering we're artists of which need to be open-minded in order to pursue our artistic goals."
College Sophomore,4,"The school's dorms are actually not on-campus. They're actual apartments that are approximately a block away from the school. These apartments or dorms are excellent. When I first walked into one of the apartment buildings, I thought I was in a high-class hotel but the actual dorm/apartment that I shared with three other students was smaller than I thought it'd be. Other than that, they're great to live in because us students were given the privilege for open access to the apartment's facilities such as steam room, 24-hour gym, beautiful pool, pool-room, coffee room, and computer room. The semester payment for housing was pricy but to be expected."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is great for students who really wish to pursue a goal because despite its size, there are many opportunities to go abroad and internships. Students who aren't even close to graduation can sometimes ensure a job during school since the school is visited frequently by recruiters from various companies for different majors."
College Sophomore,4,"I like my professors and fellow classmates. Because the classes are small, it allows the professors to give their attention to each of their students (us). Even if the course is difficult to keep up with, we can always easily ask for help from our nonchalant professors."
College Senior,4,"The internship fair is kind of unorganized in my major but it would be difficult to not have a job upon graduation. At the end of the four years you have here, there is so much great stuff you can put in your portfolio."
College Senior,4,The teachers are unbelievably talented people. Otis definitely isn't a school for people who aren't serious about pursuing the arts and making creative pursuits a full time career. The classes are small enough for you to actually get to know each other and the instructors usually have time to help everyone out individually.
College Senior,4,Digital Media is awesome at Otis. There are a lot of people in the major and we have the best electives.
College Senior,4,There is a lot of food around but mostly not in walking distance.
College Senior,4,"For the most part I feel pretty safe on campus. There is a sufficient amount of security, but I am not sure how effective they are. A few times, homeless people have try to come into the building, but security escort them out, so it is not too bad, Across from the Product building there are many bums that hang around, sometimes they bother students, but as long as you ignore them, they do not threaten you or anything in that nature. At night it does get a little scary since our building is right on the street, but I have never heard of anything serious happening safety wise on campus"
College Senior,4,"My school allowed me to open my eyes to the path I really wanted. I went into Otis thinking I wanted to do Illustration. But I later realized I wanted to do Product Design. Our school is great with letting you get in touch with every major they have before you choose. If it wasn't for that, I would have never found my passion."
College Senior,4,"As an art student, you're most likely to be spending most of your time on campus working on projects. Students stay there all day, all night, so we're okay with the lack of ""social life"" surrounding our area. There are a variety of student activities, clubs, and workshops to participate in to have breaks. I think the best part is that our school is open 24 hours a day, so students don't really care if it's day or night. Otis owls!"
College Senior,4,"My school provides many free workshops to attend that are on school, at other campuses, at the beach, etc. The labs are also a great facility that every student should take advantage of. There's the model shop (3d printing!), the wood shop, printmaking lab, letterpress lab, and so on. Anything you need is provided for you on a timely basis with a schedule that allows everything to be available in a fair manner. The library is also great. My school also provides free food opportunities all throughout the year. The student lounge is also great because it has gaming systems, TVs, and other entertainment."
Sophomore,2,"I am an incoming transfer student. I will be coming in as a sophomore in their fashion design department. So far, my experience has been poor because we are receiving our education 100% online and are required to pay ""on-campus full tuition"". This is completely unacceptable since the quality of education that the students are going to receive is not going to be up to par as an in-person class education. Also, when we are paying for full tuition (while being only online), we are also paying for the network and community and relationships. Students will not be receiving that."
Sophomore,2,"This is one of the least creative places I’ve ever been. It is a shame to call it an art school; you are put down for thinking outside the box. Prepare to sacrifice sleeping, eating well, exercising, having a life outside of school. The social life is nonexistent and there are very few people. If you have depression or anxiety don’t go here because you will be really stressed out. Professors sometimes start demos when we are supposed to be let out for the day so we have to stay. If you are sick you still have to come to class because you will be marked absent and you can only get 2 absences a semester. There is a 50% dropout rate. Don’t go here unless you are a perfectionist who wants to be a part of a company."
College Freshman,2,"Most people work through the night... at least, I do."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't really a party scene... I mean, you can find it, outside of school, but not on/near campus."
College Freshman,2,It's not a typical college. Students are more focused and concerned with improving themselves and their work rather than getting wasted every night.
College Sophomore,2,"Because of the location, there really isn't anything one can do."
College Freshman,2,"We resubmitted the FAFSA twice and although the school was very helpful and the people were nice, the actual process was hell. And it was all to no avail."
College Freshman,2,I usually go back to my hometown and hang with non-school friends
College Freshman,2,"I am part of the largest incoming foundation class and the biggest downside has been housing without a doubt. The normal dorms were booked so I have been placed about 3 miles away from campus. It is one of the worst apartment  complexes I have seen and although my neighbors are nice, my parents were not too pleased leaving me on move in day. Luckily, I'm from LA and used to the grosser parts of the town but it is completely unreasonable to pay $900/ month for such a sketchy place."
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much to do off-campus. The local area is pretty poor and bland to look at. There's a park right across the street from my school, but I wouldn't walk through there alone during the day let alone night. I suggest entering only when accompanied by at least one other person unless you're very confident with your self-defense skills. The only nearby attraction to look at is LAX since the school is within a mile of it. The people of this area are reserved. They'll talk and/or look at you if necessary."
College Senior,2,Finding a place to live around campus is very difficult. It is either too expensive or in unsafe areas.
College Senior,2,"The menu is pretty limited, and there is not many healthy choices. It is very pricey as well!"
College Freshman,2,"I come from Northern California, so the weather difference is quick different. I love the rain and to watch the season change but in Los Angeles that is very hard to find considering how its basically 365 days of summer."
College Freshman,2,Los Angeles transportation is not the best.
College Sophomore,2,"It is really expensive to live around my school. Often, the aparment has limited parking, I need to share parking space with my roomates, sometims I do street parking."
College Sophomore,2,"The area in which the school is located is notorious for high rent costs, so it is not much of an option for students like me who cover their own rent."
College Freshman,2,"Other than a basketball hoop outside, there is no school-run sport opportunities."
College Freshman,2,Really hard to find roommates and rent is expensive.
College Freshman,2,"No varsity sports, it's an Art school."
College Freshman,2,So many students take drug at school and their dorms.
Sophomore,1,"I cannot state on this since I have not started online classes with them yet. However, I have talked to several students that did have online classes with Otis since the pandemic started and it was terrible in their opinion."
Freshman,1,"Otis is a very sketchy place. I attended here foundation year and dropped at the semester. They didn't tell anyone until midterms (after the refund date)that the BA in Costume Design which is on their website and was advertised in their tours is not at all what they say it is, and it is practically non existent. The fashion department is based around doing work for ""mentors"" which are industry people who you basically work for but you have to pay to do their projects. You are expected to spend a grip doing their work on top of tuition. The department head basically said the people with the most money to spend on mentor projects have the most success... very backwards. The other admin didn't seem too surprised by it when I brought it up. I ended up spending $30,000 on one semester and couldn't get a refund. I wrote a long detailed letter to the school and no one even responded, yet I still get emails about on campus events after leaving. They STILL have the costume BFA on the website."
Niche User,1,"Their administration office is poorly run. When I applied to the school, the counselor that is supposed to work on getting me went on vacation, and handed my case to a different counselor, the new counselor I guess forgot about my case, and until I called the school he did not get anything for me done  still the last minute. The counselors also seems to know almost nothing and has to keep transferring me to different departments only to be bounced back to them. Who the heck is this school hiring? I'm glad in the end I decided not to come to this school. Its bad enough their tuition is so high."
College Freshman,1,Just make friends and be yourself. I havn't seen any huge parties. Just great times with good friends.
College Junior,1,There's no one to interact with or nearby that is close enough to really create any type of friendships or community.
College Junior,1,its just way too high in price. Many students just live hours away to avoid the price and end up communting. With traffic most people take hours to drive and get to school.
College Junior,1,"Chain food stops and then over priced low qulaity foods. There's nice places to eat, but way out of the budget for a college student."
College Junior,1,When a party scene exisit please let me know..
College Sophomore,1,Greek live is nonexistent at my school. I'm not even sure if we have a mascot.
College Sophomore,1,"There aren't any parties at the school since it's so small and reserved. It also an art school-not your average college. If someone wants to go to a party, it's recommended to attend one of LMU's house parties instead."
College Senior,1,We do not have a single athletic team. We probably don't have enough people who are into one sport to have any athletic team.
College Senior,1,"The only athletic activities I see are occasional students shooting some hoop. There are also a few sport clubs such as soccer club and bike club, but other than that my school is not a school that promotes athleticism."
College Sophomore,1,My school is a private art school. We don't have any sports.
College Sophomore,1,"You have no time to party, say goodbye to social life. ""Partying"" here mean staying up all night with friends doing homework in the computer labs."
College Sophomore,1,"I really wish OTIS offered some kind of shuttle or bus, but since it's in Los Angeles you really do need a car if you don't have housing. I take the bus everyday and it take me about an hour and a half."
College Freshman,1,we don't have any club sports or athletic facilities.
College Freshman,1,There is no dining program on campus. You should either cook or go out and eat.
College Freshman,1,There is no sports team at our school since it's small private school.
College Junior,1,"There are dorms offered the first year foundation students. Other then this there is no other dorms offered to students. Everyone else has to find there own apartment off campus. In my opinion the housing program is over protective and to strict. I have traveled from the east coast to the west coast to attend school, and I must say I had more independence in high school then I was given in my foundation year of housing. I was kept from learning about the culture in the city of Los Angeles until I moved out and found my own place. Housing is a serious issue at Otis College of Art ad Design. "
College Junior,1,"The cafeteria offered at Otis is extremely small, and is not functional, there is not even a walk in cooler. Prices are to high, and there is not a meal plan, or flex dollars. There is a minimal charge on debit cars for ten dollars, so in other words they are cash only. Prices are changed frequently so as a buyer you must keep your eyes out for being over charged. There has been numerous incidents of food poisoning, and low ratings by health critiques. I try to boycott the cafe at all costs; except for coffees. The cafe is closed after 8 or 9 pm. So late night working students and classes do not have access to anything. You would think this cafe is convenient to student and faculty because it is out college cafe; yet it is not. The cafe is also ran on its own contract separate from the school. The topic on the cafeteria has been an ongoing issue for years.    "

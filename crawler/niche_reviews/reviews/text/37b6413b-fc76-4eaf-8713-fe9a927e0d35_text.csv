Junior,5,"The University of Rochester has an incredibly liberal and inclusive campus environment. It was very easy to fit into, even as an LGBT international student. The quality of instruction is generally good. The most common gripe is the weather and how hard it is to be mobile during the winters. It'll much be easier to live in the area if you drive."
Senior,5,The professors and instructors are very understanding of the pandemic and all the struggles we are facing.
Sophomore,5,"The school has been very on top of their online learning experience, primarily because they were very accepting of asynchronous teaching systems. The diversity we have has more or less forced us to do this, as we have a lot of international students in different parts of the world. This makes synchronous classes difficult, hence the systems we've implemented."
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman and Rochester is one of the best schools I have communicated with through out my college process. I can't afford college, but Rochester has become one of the most affordable colleges for me even if I have to do work study and take out loans. I really love the staff I have interacted with and the students I know from rochester."
Freshman,5,My overall experience attending the University of Rochester has been outstanding. The professors are excellent and do their best to provide the students with everything they need to succeed and strive for classrooms to feel like a judgment-free community where everyone is able to speak their minds. The community sense is also excellent in the aspect where we all treat one another with the utmost respect and generally care for one another thus making the Rochester community a great home.
Freshman,5,the university provides a variety of resources such as free one to one tutoring and a lot of office hours to ensure that everybody has an equal chance of getting good grades. It's fascinating how much money they put into the wellbeing of their students.
Freshman,5,I have really been loving my experience at Rochester. The atmosphere of the campus is altogether very friendly and the students want to help each other out. A lot of the introductory courses in the STEM fields are overly hard to weed out students however which is unfortunate.
Freshman,5,"It is an excellent school for any person looking to go into the sciences and offers an abundance of different majors, minors, and cluster. The students and faculty at this school are amazing and friendly, the school cares for the success of the students ."
Freshman,5,I like the University of Rochester because of its school culture and community. It makes students feel like they are wanted on the campus because of that feeling of belonging to a community that doesn't know you make life at the University memorable.
Niche User,5,"So far I love everything about the University of Rochester: the people, the campus, the dorms. During my tour of the school I did not see anything I disliked. When I went to visit Rochester, I had not planned on visiting the University of Rochester at all but I am so happy I did because it is now my top pick school to start the 2020 school year in the Fall."
Freshman,5,"Really great atmosphere in general! Everyone here is supportive and wants only the best for their peers. There are so many classes to choose from, one can still explore their interests while completing their specialized degrees no matter what their major may be. The school of music is world-renowned and as a student there, I am inspired every day by the people around me and the legends that were created right here in Rochester!"
Sophomore,5,"What I like most about the University of Rochester is the fact that it is in New York. Although far from NYC, it is easy to connect with people working in jobs at NYC as most people that graduate end up working there. Because my major is Finance, working there is what I want to do and joining the Greek Life community here has really helped out a lot with that. I like how the campus has all 4 seasons, the classes are challenging but not enough to fail all of them and how many diverse people there are."
Alum,5,"I attended Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester. An awesome school with outstanding faculty. The social life was about as good as could be expected since it was primarily a high music conservatory where everyone practiced without regard to social amenities. And in the sixties there was, of course, no internet so the only thing to do was to work and study.

A 5-star school!!!"
Freshman,5,"Everyone is very friendly and helpful. I haven't found anything to complain yet.
They have great resources to help the students in their lives. From mental health center to career advising."
Junior,5,"I really enjoy this school. The academics are challenging, so be ready. The school is competitive but the fellow students are very supportive and friendly. It's not hard to make new friends and find people with similar interests as your own. The professors can either be a hit or miss, but when they are a hit, they deliver a great education. One of the main things I think for prospective students to consider is the weather. If you are able to go to a sunnier place during Spring Break, take the opportunity to do so. The stress can tend to add up when you're sitting inside all day because it's too cold out and haven't seen sunlight for some time. Basically, make sure to take time for yourself!"
Alum,5,"The University of Rochester provides a liberal arts college experience in terms of the size of the student body, but has the resources of the large research university that it is."
Senior,5,First year and experience has been excellent.  Supportive staff and professors. Enjoy Rochester - lots of good food and things to do.
Alum,5,"I had an excellent 4 years at Rochester. Between the academics, the campus, and the school's laissez-faire style, it's a great place to grow as a person and prepare for a career and life after college. The student body is definitely academically-focused, but there is still a solid social scene. 

Return on investment all depends on how much you paid. IME, U of R does a very good job with financial aid. People who complain about the cost should have gone to a more affordable school. You don't buy something really expensive and blame the person selling it for not being able to afford it later on.

The campus and it's study facilities are beautiful, the dorms are above average compared to other Uni's on-campus living, and the food is average to above average.

Rochester is a cool (and underrated) city to be in post-college as an adult with an income, although most students spend the majority of time on campus, since everything is right there."
Alum,5,"My journey through college was a winding one where I accumulated more majors as I went and I struggled to finish in 6 years because I took a year off for medical reasons. The highlight of my time was studying abroad in Italy twice, which changeged the course of my life. Fourteen years later and I’m fluent in Italian and headed to university there for a grad degree. I’ll always look back at my time at UofR fondly"
Graduate Student,5,This is a very nice school. State of the art library. Health center on campus and connected to a major medical hospital. Professors are very welcoming
Graduate Student,5,"I like the community and how invested the teachers are with making sure we understand everything. All the staff is devoted to helping MBA students get internships and full-time jobs, even before coming to school I had already been contacted by faculty members to prepare me for job searching."
Junior,5,"An incredible University for academics, where students really care about their work. The flexibility of the curriculum allows students to tailor their journey in order to focus on their passions and get a firm grasp of their fields. Not the most social or fun school and definitely not the warmest (it gets really cold up here), but a top research institution that prepares future professionals."
Senior,5,I haven't started yet but i was intrigued by the fantastic reputation the University holds in the upstate NY region and all the great work the hospital does on a daily bases for all the patients and children of upstate NY
Niche User,5,"Very friendly to prospective Undergraduate students.  As a high school junior and senior, I have visited the campus.  I am always impressed by the atmosphere that is present among the students and the faculty.  I have also interviewed with admissions, and it was a very positive experience."
Freshman,5,"I've only been here for about 2 months but so far I love it. They usually give out v good scholarships despite the high sticker price, the dorms are bigger than average (some of them are incredible, such as Genesee, but some are older like Hoeing and Gilbert). Academics are great (I'm taking 2 classes with fewer than 20 students my first semester) but it is a very demanding school. My biggest complaint is that the library isn't open all night, but other than that, fantastic school."
Sophomore,5,"I Really think that University of Rochester do provide a great study environment and give us plenty of opportunity in research and studies. In my opinion, in every college, is up to us for getting things right and I think University of Rochester do provide us all of the necessary things to get to where we want. It is up to us to do it or not."
Sophomore,5,Nice University with great faculties and great students. The environment is awesome. Yet the location is not very convenient and the Sue B Hall is not very comfortable to live in even though it has a store and a canteen.
Junior,5,Competitive academics with passionate professors. Great opportunities for research and advanced scientific discoveries by professors.
Junior,5,The University of Rochester is a great school and I highly recommend it to anyone pursuing a degree in history or the arts.
Sophomore,5,"I love the welcoming atmosphere of Rochester. All the peer mentors on the hall are so efficient yet kind. Rochester provides so many networking opportunities, tutoring options, and professors are always open to help you. I wish they had more resources for humanities students, who get overwhelmed by the loads of STEM majors."
Junior,5,"Very diverse in the culture, people, and everything else that goes along with it. Consistently challenging students and professors in innovation and improvement."
Senior,5,"I've loved my 4 years at UR. The people and academics there are outstanding. The students are supportive, active, and engaging; the staff are friendly and always willing to help you out; and professors are world-class, approachable, and accessible. The academics here are some of the highest quality in the U.S. and competetive with some of the larger schools around the globe. Rochester may not be the first university you think of when you think of an impactful, top-notch, and influential university, but it certainly holds those labels near and dear. It continuously has exceeded my expectations and I'm sure it'll continue to do so for future students."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Rochester is a widely diverse and multi-talented institution, with astounding academics and an impressive array of instructors and educators to engage all levels of student learning."
Freshman,5,"The University of Rochester has become a second home to me. I found comfort in the little things: the two swings we have in the middle of the school, the beautiful buildings especially the breathtaking Rush Rhees Library, the dance studios, the basketball court in Spurrier, etc. The university found a way to make you feel so welcomed as a college freshmen by hosting multiple carnivals, free giveaways, and orientation week. One thing about Rochester that I would change is more diversity on campus. As a Latina, it was hard trying to fit in and find my crowd first semester. With more diversity, the school should be set."
Freshman,5,"My life will be forever changed by my experience at U of R in the most positive way possible. This fact is mostly due to the student body, with the fact that so much of the student body is international. The system of academics is also amazing, given that there is a liberal arts aspect as well as a huge emphasis on research and the STEM fields. I feel completely able to explore different subjects other than those which I expected to study, and feel inspired and encouraged to join clubs and organizations which make up so much of the student life."
Freshman,5,The University of Rochester is a very well established institution with amazingly nice staff members. The students and the faculty are nice overall and genuinely care about your success.
Junior,5,"Being a transfer student from a community college, the transition was great. However, I feel that the culture between transfer students and students who had been enrolled at the Univeristy of Rochester is completely different. This results in a rift between the students."
Niche User,5,"I loved how the culture was so diverse. I was able to meet so many people from different cultures, so i was learning in and outside of the classroom."
Sophomore,5,"University of Rochester isn't for everyone. However, for those that visit or hear of the school and find something to love about it - whether it be the beautiful campus or the dedicated student body - I can promise that you'll want to stay. While the school isn't known for parties, the unity and rich student life on campus are incredibly refreshing. Students come from around the world to invest in the difficult and rigorous academic program. Those that love to learn will find themselves among students with similar drive, and professors that expect the best, hope for the best, and give us their best."
Senior,5,"I love this school. It is filled with super smart, nice, and kind of quirky people. Everyone who goes here seems like a perfect fit for U of R. Beautiful campus, great faculty, lots of clubs and activities, and an academically rigorous environment all characterize what I've seen here as I enter into my senior year."
Graduate Student,5,"During my time at the University of Rochester, I have seen a quality graduate program improve. While some classes are challenging, the majority of the instruction is of high quality and many professors are fantastic resources that are responsive to student needs. We are very close to other great schools, and many collaborations exist, which gives students a great chance to learn how to build such relationships. A highlight is that we are one of the handful of schools chosen by the NIH to pilot a Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training program. I have seen and taken new courses that give students a well-rounded education. This program has made a huge impact in preparing graduate students for the future. 

The University of Rochester truly a university of the highest order."
Sophomore,5,"It's been great so far. I can actually take classes I am interested in, it's a great community, and the transition from high school to college has been really easy so far."
Sophomore,5,This school is an incredibly unique institution that allows students to explore and learn what they are passionate about.
Senior,5,"I came to U of R for the campus feel as well as the world renowned academics.  While my classes have been tough, I have learned so much and have been given opportunities I wouldn't have dreamed of anywhere else.  U of R is my home, and I'm so thankful for the experiences I've had here so far."
Freshman,5,My experience at University of Rochester has been nothing but great. It is definitely a place where the professors and advisors encourage the students to be there best and pursue their passions.
Sophomore,5,"I love it here! There's is always some thing to do, or get involved with. Everyone here really cares about their classes and are always trying to make each other better. A very collaborative, as opposed to competitive, environment."
Freshman,5,"Amazing school. Academics are excellent, campus is beautiful and people are  diverse and kind. Offers many opportunities and help in all aspects of academics, health and life."
Freshman,5,"The University of Rochester is a very challenging school. I love the academic environment because everyone is here to learn. The cluster system at this school saved me. I was originally a Bio major on the Pre-Med track and I found out that I hated Biology and there was no way I was going to finish Pre-Med. Luckily I had taken a Political Science course for my social science cluster the same semester and realized I loved it. Also because you don't declare a major right away, it is easy to change your major. It is so easy to explore your interests here. The campus is beautiful, though I would not call it very handicap accessible. The food is pretty good for a college. The professors all have many office hours and if you can't meet with them, the TA's have office hours too. I love this school and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is applying to college."
Freshman,5,"Academics at the University of Rochester is really great. The professors are really helpful and thought it's not particularly a small school, it's really easy to meet professors and they will remember you after you meet them. Diversity at Rochester amazed me, there are tons of international students and I fit in perfectly. Parties are also fun from time to time. But all in all, most of the people in Rochester come with a purpose academically."
Junior,5,"I love the University of Rochester. I applied Early Decision to the U of R, I knew it was love at first sight. Although I am native to Rochester, NY, the same exact school could have been in a different state with a different name and I would have still attended. I am so proud to be an undergraduate at the University of Rochester."
Alum,5,"The school is top-notch in academics, research, and student resources.  The combination of being a leading research school with its small-to-medium student body size allows U of R to offer many research opportunities to undergraduate students."
Freshman,5,It's community is truly in a league of its own. It balances social life with the strong academic life.
College Freshman,5,It has a very flexible curriculum and the community is truly in a league of its own
Alum,5,"Academics and research are what make U of R stand out among some of the top universities in the country.  Professors are experts in their fields, however some are hit or miss on quality as a lecturer.  Outside of academics, your experience at U of R is what you make it.  There are plenty of extracurricular activities to get involved in, from athletics to musical clubs to Greek life.  The party scene isn't that of an SEC school, but compared to other schools my friends went to, U of R is above average.  There are parties on the frat quad, off campus, and there were buses that took students downtown to bars (not sure if this is still a thing). The people are what makes U of R.  The student body is very diverse and I think most people embrace this. Dorms are average to above-average. Food is about average, but there are plenty of choices.  While U of R is an expensive school, it's important to remember that it is known for providing great financial aid packages.  "
College Sophomore,5,"I've made connections that would be hard to make elsewhere, the networking opportunities have been rewarding."
College Sophomore,5,"I am probably going to accrue about 100 grand in debt from attending this school since my family can ""afford"" to pay for about 75% of the tuition. However, going into an engineering profession with a U of R degree, I'm practically assured a starting salary of over $65K (average starting salary with BS in engineering), and I took some econ courses in highschool so I have already planned ahead a bit. I'm certain I can comfortably cover those loans thanks to the respect a U of R engineering degree earns, and I can likely do so in under 9 years. 

I got a TA position my freshman year which is very unusual, and have already gotten work over the summer in at least engineering related stuff, which is also hard to do as a freshman. I have heard some departments (especially ECE) pay very well for TAs, and that experience in generally great for a resume. I'm sure my prospects for the future will be far better since almost no companies take freshmen seriously, regardless of how awesome you were in high school. I also found the career center at U of R exceptionally helpful. They helped me get the job I had this summer just a week after visiting them a final time, and I went there two times prior for excellent resume advice."
College Sophomore,5,"I love this school. It's super easy to get involved with clubs and other student groups. Everybody is welcoming and I have met all manner of people here. As an engineering student, classes can be tough, but that would be true for engineering anywhere. Most of my professors are awesome, and I'm free to skip class for those that aren't so it's NBD. I've done well in classes where I attend every single day, and those where I skip all but five days - I find the subject itself will determine my grade more than a professor. I have made so many great friends in just my first year, and look forward to all the rest."
College Freshman,5,"amazing school ,teachers, staff, friends clubs"
College Sophomore,5,University of Rochester is an extremely hard school. All of the students are very smart and focused on academics as well as extracurricular activities. Many students complete their undergrad at U of R and go to even higher ranking universities for graduate school.
College Junior,5,The best. I wouldn't have chosen anywhere else.
Junior,4,The university has provided professors with online lecture guidelines. All courses have moved online - even if the campus is partially open - and most professors have successfully transitioned to online learning.
Senior,4,It has been very good to me so far. I am currently in the RN-BSN program through the school of nursing.
Alum,4,Great school with lots of opportunities if you know the right places to look. The campus is beautiful and the library is great!
Alum,4,"Some professors were able to adjust really well to the online scene and had lectures really well organized, other professors were not so good with adjusting, and the video and audio quality of the courses were not that great."
Sophomore,4,"I love the Rochester campus - it's not too difficult to learn to navigate and the tunnels are wonderful for getting from place to place. I also like the open curriculum and although it can be a little confusing to understand at first, it offers a lot of freedom as compared to my friends at other colleges. 

One major downside is the cost of tuition. Albeit, UoR is a private university so it's to be expected. However, I feel like there's little to no room for negotiation regarding financial aid. Unless you're from an impoverished household, generous financial aid is hard to come by, even for middle income households."
Sophomore,4,"Like many other universities and colleges, UoR used Zoom as the platform for online learning after the transition to remote learning, and in my experience, my professors adjusted pretty well to the change. Most of my professors were also understanding about grading during the pandemic which I appreciate after seeing other students share their experience."
Sophomore,4,"Honestly, I have enjoyed my time at Rochester very thoroughly. The student diversity alongside the multiple club opportunities brings a very community orientated vibe and I genuinely enjoy the fact that I can experience the things I do here. My only slight gripe is the lack of diversity within faculty, especially among professors. The tilt towards tenured professors has diminished the schools teaching quality somewhat and this affects curriculum because the outdated material we learn makes it hard for younger professors to teach their classes as core courses taught before them were no longer completely correct (or had some information that was outdated)."
Freshman,4,I would like to see more diversity for the minorities and for the University of Rochester to diversify its staff.
Junior,4,"The professors did an excellent job, but i just hated the entire experience. I feel like I didn’t learn as much as i would in a classroom"
Junior,4,I love the university and everyone in it. I just sometimes wish they could offer more financial help
Junior,4,"I'm a Junior at the University of Rochester- Eastman School of Music. Both campus' have unique and important opportunities, especially in the medical, engineering and musical arts fields. Many professors with whom I have studied are well-versed in their fields, and the small class sizes make things more manageable. The Eastman School is one the best conservatory environments in the U.S., and will provide an excellent education."
Sophomore,4,"It's a little overpriced, but I have had great experience here. Academics are great, and there are a lot of options for people wanting to go into a biology or medicine-related field as the College has a lot of options for students to work and intern at the Medical Center nearby. 
Where they can improve is how they choose to spend their money. The University is always remodeling buildings and areas, which look great, but aren't really necessary renovations when in reality they should get more frequent bus transportation to outside of campus, or to improve the Wifi."
Sophomore,4,"There are some passionate professors but also professors who have a terrible course structure. I would also like to see an improvement in the quality of food served. Sometimes the food is so bad that I decide to skip dinner. There should also be greater resources for students with rare difficulties, such as issues with their citizenship status. However, overall, the school provides a decent support system for students but much of that support is very superficial and does not address the root cause. There should also be more opportunities for Summer funding so that students who come from a low-income family can pursue research opportunities over the summer without worrying about paying for it."
Freshman,4,My freshman year at UofR has been extremely rewarding. I met a great network of students and helpful TAs and professors. It's a very competitive yet supportive environment.
Senior,4,"Note that the campus is not very accessible for students who have physical disabilities though. Also, there is a housing shortage in which some returning students had to find options off campus."
Junior,4,"I love this school. The campus is absolutely beautiful and there are many quiet and collaborative study spaces. College Town is within walking distance so you can get anything that may not be available on campus. If you're a transfer student you might find the social life around campus a little lonely because the other students have known each other since freshman year. But if you're coming in as a freshman you will have a great time and make a lot of friends. The classes can be difficult and will require your full effort. Also, the campus isn't so much ""diverse"" as it is mostly Asian students."
Alum,4,"I met a lot of great people there and really enjoyed Rochester. On campus and in certain parts of the city it's very nice (although the food scene is pretty dead). There were a few scandals that occurred while I was there (look up Jaeger incident) but in general, I've felt safe on campus. I was randomly assigned housing my first year (was placed in a forced triple)however I still ended up making lifelong friends. The psychology teachers are really nice and great. Biology teachers there are smart (but a lot give off a really superior vibe and aren't the best when it comes to helping students). The UR medical center is a short walk from campus and I was able to get a job there, which is really convenient, and I actually enjoyed it a lot. Athletics is definitely NOT the strong point of Rochester just so you know."
Freshman,4,"The smaller environment of U of R was super helpful to meet people and always see a friendly face. The smaller environment also makes it feel sometimes like a bubble and like you are doing the same thing all the time. For the most part the students are passionate and interesting, but also rich and don't realize it."
Sophomore,4,"Love the culture, love the people, the school is one of those diamonds in the rough where you wouldn't believe just how intelligent and hardworking the students may be there, and due to that the rigor is nothing to be laughed at. It has its moments as anywhere else, but UoR is still an academic contender"
Graduate Student,4,The UofR is a prestigious institution. Your mind is definitely stretched in your programs as you are thrust into finding the answers or knowledge you need independently from day one.  The billing system is a bit antiquated however.  You cannot pay for tuition with a credit card here.
Freshman,4,"I love the cluster system in school, getting rid of traditional systems that waste students time and credits on courses not relevant to their major. Food could be better, but it isn't that bad."
Sophomore,4,I thought the atmosphere was very welcoming and lots of effort is put into acclimating new students to the school. Professors set aside an adequate amount of time and resources for students seeking help or extra review on materials.
Sophomore,4,"We're pretty good academics-wise. Not so much for athletics. If you're interested in research, there are tons of opportunities for that. However, if you're not, then this might not be the university for you. Although I'm only a sophomore, the teachers I have had are passionate about their fields but some of them seem more focused on their research than anything else.

Food's okay, the city's meh, but there's free transportation to some areas if you're willing to wait. Would recommend living off-campus as soon as possible."
Sophomore,4,Having studied at UR for a year I can confidently say that I have made the right decision in choosing this school. There is a perfect balance of emphasis on academic success and bettering yourself on a social level. This school has more resources than I could have ever asked for. Additionally the campus is the top five most diverse campuses in America given the international student rate. It is not one of the top ten schools in America but certainly feels like one. I would suggest considering applying to this school to any and all who don't mind the cold!
Sophomore,4,"It is an incredible school with a great reputation and incredible resources. The diversity is huge, the classes are fair and very educational, and the professors are generally helpful. However, advising, food, housing and the local area are not super ideal. Advisors are unhelpful, food is iffy and housing is small and sometimes limited. The local area of Rochester is not what can be described as a 'bustling city' as it is rather empty and there is not much to do in it. However, if you are willing to travel a little bit, the surrounding rural areas are breathtaking and there is a lot of sight seeing and exploring to be done."
Sophomore,4,"Great professors, but terrible administrators. Academically a great school, but if you need anything from, let's say, the housing & residential services department, good luck."
Senior,4,"Small liberal arts college in upstate NY. The only thing I never got used to was the long winters, however, the administration most times seems to care about the students, and the academics are challenging enough but not too much to drive one crazy. It also opens several doors to top grad schools, internships and jobs"
Junior,4,"The university has a very friendly and welcoming environment; my experiences with fellow students and the professors have all been very positive, and the campus culture is one that supports diversity and encourages inclusion. The campus is quite cold for the majority of the year due to being around the Great Lakes area, which is probably the biggest factor that might discourage someone from enrolling. Campus safety is excellent based on my personal experiences, and the school is a place I feel safe and comfortable learning in."
Niche User,4,Visiting here was a great experience. The campus was great and easily accessible. Buildings were clean and orderly. Everyone was super friendly and approachable.
Alum,4,"Overall, I had a nice learning experience. My professors and counselors were very approachable. After I graduated in 2011, I went to visit not too long ago and A LOT of changes have been made to the campus and it looks amazing. A lot of restaurants in the area and places to chill and have a good time. I miss it from time to time."
Sophomore,4,The academics is excellent with very good diversity among the student body. More support for international students would be nice though.
Sophomore,4,"All around, Rochester is an amazing institution. They should make an effort to engage the low-income community that surrounds the school and find better administration with little scandals."
Sophomore,4,"I love most things about my school. The curriculum is well designed, the professors are (for the most part) great, and there is a lot of campus pride from the students. The only negative experience I had was with the handling of the sexual assault case involving a professor."
Graduate Student,4,"I have attended the University of Rochester School of Nursing for my Bachelors degree in nursing and am currently enrolled for my doctorate of nursing practice degree to become a family nurse practitioner.  The school has flexible class times, including evening class time for students who work traditional day-time hours.  Many of the classes are completely online or hybrid courses.  The professors are often practicing nurses or advanced practice nurses, which allow students to obtain the best possible education.  The school is across the street from Strong Memorial Hospital, which makes it convenient for students to juggle work and school schedules."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my time here at the University of Rochester because of the people (students and professors) I'm surrounded by. There isn't too much I find interesting in town to do so I am usually on campus with my classmates, hallmate and friends. the very diverse student body means that there's never a dull moment because there are so many interesting people from amazing cultures to talk to and have fun with. 

Our professors are also very approachable and when you go out of your way to know them, they treat you like family instead of like students. The UofR isn't that big andthe way it's set up, with all these great people, makes me feel liek I'm part of a family"
Freshman,4,"A very nerdy, PC, liberal school. However, if you are not nerdy or are not PC or are not liberal, you will always be able to find people with your same interests. It's big but not overwhelming. You actually feel you exist"
Sophomore,4,"Academically speaking, the college is great. however, I would like to change the administration a bit. There is a lot of bureaucracy  that mess things up."
Sophomore,4,"No general education classes makes it easy to explore different fields and find out what you want to study. Give good financial aid, even though in my case they decreased it significantly after my freshman year (even though my financial situation only got worse). Campus is a good size. Surrounding area isn't the best, some crime and bad neighborhoods."
Alum,4,"My experience was great! It was full of diversity and supportive of peers who want you to succeed. The faculty and staff are exceptional and the library access to get you what you need knows no bounds. Yellowjacket Festival at the beginning of the year sets off the mood of the school year and the alumni are very helpful and interactive with current students. Classes are always interesting and you can merge your major with your interest in any field. U  of R wants to explore and has a range of courses, like Beginner Piano and the Psychology of Sex. There are tons of awesome clubs to be apart of. There isn't a huge multicultural greek life presence and school bus system could be run slightly better."
Freshman,4,"Rochester has a little bit of everything for everyone. It has great academic and extracurricular opportunities. The University has services that are a great benefit for students such as career and internship, social networking, community service, tutoring, mental health, etc. While the party scene is not as grand and crazy as some state schools, it still exists and is fun. Students have a good return investment as long as students make sure to utilize the school's services and have fun. The open curriculum allows for a not strict to code course schedule and allow students to explore other areas."
Freshman,4,It is a prestigious school where some of the professors are good. There are plenty of resources that are available to students but students must show their willingness and determination to reap all the benefits of the school
Junior,4,"I love to study. The professors here are helpful and their exams are challenging. You know you are learning a lot indeed. Overall, everything is cool here except, umm... food"
Sophomore,4,"Nice campus, not that big nor small. Easy to walk from class to class. You just have to meet the right people to make worth of this place."
Sophomore,4,"What's nice about U of R is that it has an open curriculum. This allows freedom to choose your classes, rather than being constricted with general education requirements. However aside from the education, campus food is below average, and student life is limited due to the weather ."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Rochester is known for it's amazing academics that come without a core curriculum.  If you ask students why the chose the UofR, that's one of the answers you'll hear most often.  If you're looking for a school with good sports and a lot of school spirit, this probably isn't the place for you.  I sadly miss coming from North Carolina and loving college basketball and going to a school where no one goes to any games.  The dorms are okay, there's no air conditioning though so it's really hot until mid-October. Overall, great professors and classes. Campus is absolutely beautiful also."
Freshman,4,"The University is a great place and the professors are really invested in your education. I wish I could see more diversity and more campus life because even though it is there, it can still use more."
Freshman,4,"Rochester is a very homey school. There is always something to do on campus whether it be studying, movies, or other activities. With everything on campus it often is hard to find time and ways to get off campus and explore Rochester. The city of Rochester is quite spread out so its hard to get around very easily. The University does supply buses, however they often only run to central shopping locations on the weekends. Study spaces on campus are limitless and comfortable. The overall feel of the campus is very pleasant with lots of green grass and beautiful trees. At the center of it all is Rush Rhees library which can be seen and heard (through bells that play every 15 minutes) from miles away. University of Rochester is academically challenging, but there are lots of resources you can use to get help if you need it. Overall U of R's campus and personality have made it a wonderful place to attend!"
Freshman,4,I like the curriculum and programs they have to offer and the fact that it challenges me.  I would like to see more change in the dorms so they can be a more comfortable living space.
Freshman,4,"Studying as a dual degree student at the Eastman School of Music and College of Arts and Sciences, I can say that the dual degree program itself is very well constructed. My peers challenge me daily to improve myself and put my best foot forward, and the school really lends itself to a positive and competitive atmosphere."
Freshman,4,"The campus is small so the community is closely knitted.  The dorms are very good, having a large selection of single rooms even for freshmen.  The school is relatively dry on alcohol and safe, but note that the local area, not in the vicinity of the campus, can be frequented by crimes."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the University of Rochester is a great place to study. There are enormous academic opportunities. If you are into research, there are hundreds of ways to get started. Most of the professors are friendly, approachable, and are really passionate about the classes they teach. Don't be afraid to challenge yourself by taking challenging courses. The students are competitive, but they also are willing to help each other out. Rochester gets pretty quiet at times and the party scene on weekends is AWFUL. But this also encourages you to make friends and do your own things with them on the weekends, instead of relying on parties to dictate your social life."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Rochester is excellent academically, and has a beautiful campus with generally great professors who wish to challenge their students to think and learn. Food is decent, dorm rooms are not so great. The flooring in rooms that I've seen is tile and the walls are white painted cement, but freshman housing has pretty large open doubles which can be rearranged if you don't like the set up. Singles in the upperclassmen halls are tiny, probably not recommendable for anyone who gets claustrophobic easily, though there is housing slightly off campus that has much larger rooms as well as carpet which can be used after sophomore year. Overall my experience has been generally good though. The classes have been engaging and taught by dedicated professors. The people are generally friendly and great, I've made tons of friends so far and keep making more every semester. Overall the UofR is a great school with great people."
Freshman,4,"I love the academics of the University of Rochester. They're rigorous but very rewarding, and the professors are dedicated to your success for the most part. However, I do not like the social vibe of the school. It's hard for me to personally fit in because the majority of the students are either party-crazed or athletes."
Freshman,4,"University of Rochester is a great place for those who love to learn for the sake of learning. The open curriculum allows students to take a wide variety of class and pursue unique majors, minors, and clusters. Also as a top tier research university, U of R is a place of discovery, breaking barriers, and stretching the limits of knowledge."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have come to love the University of Rochester. Their open-curriculum allows you to use intrinsic motivation to decide your true passion for a college major. Our diversity will allow you to meet people from all walks of life, and allow you to see the world with multiple different perspectives. We place high value on our efforts for social justice, and we are a very politically involved school. You will learn to care about the world more than ever after attending the UR for four years."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently in my 2nd year at U of  R. I really like the open curriculum, the fact that the school doesn't require students to take general education class with the exception of one writing class. The school has a lot of tutoring services and staff that are willing to help their students. I haven't had any issues with my professors and I hope I won't have to. The campus is generally saving and clean. I love the diversity in the school."
Niche User,4,"I would love to see more opportunities and places to go in the surrounding, Rochester city area. The University of Rochester (especially the Eastman School of Music) was phenomenal. "
Freshman,4,"This university is great for academics and diversity. A lot of people feel as though the athletics and social scenes are bad, but in reality, a lot of the women's teams are great and there are parties and activities to attend most weekends."
College Freshman,4,There are so many clubs with various sports and activities. There truly is something for everyone
College Sophomore,4,I've met some great professors and made amazing personal contacts while here.
Freshman,2,Polices here are weird. This school kinda sucks. Avoid it. The food is meh and the dorms are okay but teachers and the department are bad. They randomly place you in math classes even if you already took them. Not an amazing school like others say it is
Alum,2,"If you want to avoid study and/or work in an unfair, toxic, and racist environment where bullying is acceptable and a part of their culture, stay away form this school and this city."
Alum,2,"I will preface this by saying I received an incredible education from this institution and made many dear friends in my time there. That being said, the school administration is horrible and makes absolutely everything difficult if not impossible to get done. There have been many sexual harassment allegation for which the University only pretended to handle once it hit the media, and even then continue to employ a professor who has had inappropriate relationships with students, causing them to leave the University. If you want to go to a school of rich privileged kids pretending they understand what it is like to struggle and talking over those actually struggling, with an administration that is convinced it is charitable, you WILL receive a great education so feel free to go here. Otherwise, steer clear. Oh, and look forward to them asking you to donate to them the second you graduate."
Senior,2,"All people ever talk about in regards to the surrounding city is how Kodak, Xerox, and B&L USED to be prosperous and how this USED to be a tech hub. It really is far from now and is constantly brought up which is annoying. Also the students at this school always its huge endowment and they always pretend to not know what it is and always overestimate. One other negative factor is that they reduced my FA package each year for no reason. 
On the positive side however... Rochester does have a lot of diversity and this alone separates it from many other schools in the US. Professors are USUALLY helpful and reachable but yes there will be many who are miserable. Rochester also has a nice shuttle system. Garbage plates are good. Campus is really pretty but got really boring to look at over the course of four years.  Athletics are a joke. Good Luck."
Freshman,2,"Personally this school is average in my eyes. Academically the school is really good and will definitely challenge everyone who attends it but college should also provide a fun and exciting experience. The city of Rochester is pretty dead, honestly, and I would rather have a college experience filled with both adventure and challenging academics. I will be transferring out of the university for mainly those reasons. Also it is really expensive. The campus is nice, but it is really small and within one semester I have explored most of it. Many of my friends are transferring out of the school for some of these reasons. Honestly its just not worth its price."
College Sophomore,2,There are few frat parties and bar nights and compared to bigger schools the parties suck.
College Sophomore,2,Not too many people go out but when they do it is a frat party on the weekends. Compared to big schools like Cuse or FSU our party scene is a joke.
College Sophomore,2,"University Health Services is a joke, as is the CARE Network that they hold up. Mental health is handled very poorly"
College Sophomore,2,"The housing lottery is a nightmare, and there is not enough room for the increase in class sizes"
College Junior,2,"Depending on where you live, you could have it amazing or you could have it pretty bad (most of the time pretty bad). Almost all housing on campus is really really old and needs to be updated, but they just continue building new buildings (very poorly mind you, the buildings are actually sinking into the ground because the foundation is so poor) instead."
College Freshman,2,"The Dlion never does anything for us, and the RA is not up-to-par."
College Freshman,2,The freshman dorms are old community bath with pretty small rooms. There aren't private bathrooms in any dorm with the exception of handicap or special exceptions. We are all spending way too much money to live in these dumps where you can get a great apartment close to campus and save 5-10 grand a year.
College Freshman,2,"I am not white.  Coming from New York City, Rochester is as white as Tom Cruise's bleached teeth.  Though the school brags about its diversity, for those acclimated to extremely diverse situations, it feels like there is none.  20% of the student body comprises of international students, yes.  Additionally, my non-POC, suburban raised friends tell me they've never been surrounded by so many different people before.  In that sense, the school is extremely diverse.  If you're a minority student, however, you will definitely notice the lack of diversity."
College Sophomore,2,Athletics/sports is definitely not the focus of the university.
College Freshman,2,"I don't think that the cluster system was properly explained during the admissions process. Furthermore, I feel like I can find more interesting courses at other universities. There is nothing really that interesting, and everything actually seems pretty standard. I think some of the teachers are ignorant towards international students, and lack critical thinking skills."
College Freshman,2,More people attend speaker talks and a capella concerts than sport games. There is hardly any support from the school community.
College Freshman,2,"People are very unfriendly. Even during orientation, I found that I was the one that always had to approach people, and nobody approached me. I felt, and still feel, very unwelcome at my school. When I smile at people, even people I know, nobody smiles back. Although these incidents are very small and insignificant, it really stacks up day after day. Students are very small-minded and do not have a broad worldview; there is not a very strong international third-culture kid community at this school. That this is a school of ""nerds who know how to party"" is false. The parties are horrible, and people are not as smart as they think they are. They may be hardworking and passionate about their studies, but they lack critical thinking skills. Thus, ""Meliora,"" the school's motto, is not taken as seriously as one may think, considering how pervasive it seems to be on campus and in campus culture. ""Meliora"" seems only to apply to academics, if anything."
College Senior,2,"The weather and the overall ambiance at this school is so depressing. Where I came from, I had never met someone on anti depressants. Here in Rochester it seems to be the norm. People are generally unattractive. The food in the dinning halls is not the best quality, and the dorms pretty much suck compared to other schools around here like RIT. Even though I don't like it here, I am getting a good education and am thankful for my network of professors."
College Freshman,2,"No one cares at all about sports here. It's kind of sad, actually."
College Freshman,2,I don't go to parties.
College Freshman,2,"I have never been to UHS before, but most people go in and come out feeling no better or without any medication to help them feel better. If you want quality health care, go to Strong Hospital."
College Sophomore,2,Compared to schools that I have visited friends at the part quantity/quality seems very exclusive and poor.
College Junior,2,It doesn't help that tuition keeps going up.
College Senior,2,Not much to do on-campus. You need to know people to go to decent parties.
College Senior,2,"The school is a business and as such it sees its priorities as making money. As far as the financial aid office goes, there aid gradually decreases with the years at the university."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't really have much of an athletics following, but I don't think many people care."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not great sports involvement at school. Softball is good, but few other sports make the news. Horrible football."
College Senior,2,"We aren't a Division 1 college, and the athletics reflect that."
College Senior,2,The UofR has a lot of work to do.
College Junior,2,Campus security is very inefficient and people actually are more distrustful of them for it.
College Junior,2,Not much variety. Dining halls vary a lot on quality; couple good days mixed with many bad or mediocre.
College Junior,2,"They get money out of you one way or another, although being need-blind is nice."
College Freshman,2,Minorities will have a hard time here for a lot of times.
College Freshman,2,It's really cold and some nights are very dull.
College Freshman,2,"I am not a huge part of this scene so I can't say much. There are often parties on the frat quad. The drama house has good parties. But there isn't much to do, especially off campus."
College Sophomore,2,not many computers to use THE WIFI IS HORRIBLE
College Junior,2,"If you are not involved in a fraternity, sorority, or on a sports team, the night life is limited."
College Sophomore,2,"I often wish the school offered a B.S. in Public Health, but they make you choose between Epidemiology, Bioethics, Health Behavior and Society, and Health Policy. It worries me that I won't get into the grad schools I want with a B.A. in one particular field."
Recent Alumnus,2,Snow snow snow....cold cold cold....But Fall and Spring are GORGEOUS on campus!
College Freshman,2,"IT GETS REALLY COLD. Rochester is the snowiest city in America, right above Buffalo, NY. So be prepared! I came from a tiny island in the Pacific where we didn't have winter, so winter here can be brutal for some international students. I understand why people get SADD because it does get gloomy. It's weird getting used to the sun setting at 5 pm, however, if you are from the Midwest or Northeast, the adjustment shouldn't be that hard."
College Sophomore,2,"Not that many good options, and they gouge you on the meal plan. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Permits cost an arm and a leg. It's easy to get a ticket or a boot on your car and pay even more fines on top of your already large permit cost. Parking is limited to only your designated lot before 4pm and lot spaces fill quickly. Also, there are few parking spots to begin with. There is a parking lottery for the worst spots, and most people have to park at least a mile from most buildings. It sucks in the freezing cold! "
Recent Alumnus,2,Food is so expensive and meal plans are even more expensive. It's so much more economical to just buy your own food and cook it. A box of cereal is about $7 in the campus store. 
College Sophomore,2,"Yeah, there's quite some alcohol. There's really no escape for it. Even I tried it, and I can seriously assure you, I was one of those goody-goody pre-med types."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like the school's ridiculously strict in certain areas that should be less than others. I think increasing the level of strictness in those areas also fuels the number of people who want to violate those rules and successfully do and then enjoy the high they get from escaping the through the holes of the system. There are times that the school should really put more restrictions on other areas that are easier to control, like the noise level and the capacity to demonstrate freely."
College Sophomore,2,"I have worked very hard to complete the financial aid process, and am nowhere near receiving the amount of aid I need without being in significant debt after graduating. I had to take out several expensive loans. My financial aid counselor is fairly clueless. The tuition is disgustingly expensive and the financial aid is nowhere near where it should be."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking permits are expensive, and there are no guaranteed spots. Parking is not very close to dorms or classes."
College Sophomore,2,"Ever since the UR administration has been cracking down, the parties here suck nowadays, and there are few good options. After freshman year, most students do not party anymore, unless they are in a fraternity or sorority. "
College Sophomore,2,"While I do feel that UR has a great student community, and great facilities, I would not come here again because of the outrageous cost, and the poor ROI(return of investment). Although going to school in a big city may be more expensive, more companies recruit in those universities, and thus it is easier to find a job post-graduation. On the other hand, if you are looking to go to graduate school right away, UR has an excellent reputation among other research universities, which makes this process easier for those students. "
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few options off campus, but mostly just fast food and cheap options. Food is not a strength of this city or university. "
College Sophomore,2,"The dating scene at this school is bad, the best word to describe it. I know few people in relationships, but most I know of are with someone from outside of school. Otherwise, a good relationship is hard to come by, as people are focused on their studies. "
College Sophomore,2,"The campus transportation does exist, but it is very unreliable, as it is never on time, and takes more than 2 hours just to get simple things done such as going to the grocery store. "
College Freshman,2,Not a big party scene outside of school
College Sophomore,2,It's cold for a long time except for 3 hot months 
College Sophomore,2,Not the best weather. Very bi polar and if you are not accustomed to cold and winter - be sure to gear up with all your winter clothes. 
College Sophomore,2,Not the best off campus dining options. Chipotle and a few small chains. People mostly order in.
College Sophomore,2,"It is very unpredictable. Cold winters, hot summers."
College Sophomore,2,On campus the atmosphere is great no matter the time. Off campus during the day the atmosphere is great. We have parks and people are always out and about being friendly. However during the night (off campus) you are warned not to travel alone or at all. Campus security will give you rides instead but there have been a few bad instances during the night in the surrounding areas.
College Freshman,2,"The level of diversity of UR is relatively low. Most students that I have met are white and from the east coast. To be fair, there are many students from different backgrounds and beliefs, but they comprise a minority."
College Junior,2,The cost is good but personally I don't think it's worth the risk in terms of safety. Campus is very safe and I have never felt in danger on campus but once you get off campus it is a very different story.
Freshman,1,"The University of Rochester=Heaven for thieves. The only thing authority do is to ask people ""did u take her stuff?"" and expect the thief to respond ""yes! please go check my room!"" Mandatory on-campus housing for offering thieves money."
Sophomore,1,I'm pretty sure this school partakes in charging as much as humanly possible for attending. Can't afford it anymore so will have to transfer.
Sophomore,1,"I'm a guy and I'd rather party at RPI since Rochester's party scene is that bad. Driving to nearby colleges, or even farther ones like cuse' is worth it."
Freshman,1,"School is eh overall. Meal plan sucks, food varies in the dining hall but the meal plan is way overpriced. The sports suck but squash is good but who cares about squash. The good student diversity plays a role in the schools indifference towards sports and school spirit. Parties are really boring. Professors are extremely smart but that doesn't mean they know how to teach. Also many athletes walk the school and act as if they own it which is annoying. And frats think they are cool since they throw the parties."
Freshman,1,"The main university positive is that the student body is intelligent and high achieving. However the professors in my experience have been relatively poor and disinterested. My academic advisers new little about my major and I couldn't turn to them for advice. The food has improved recently but the food should be outstanding considering that the price per semester can be 3k for most freshman. 
Whenever asking close friends and even strangers about their favorite thing about the university they will say, ""leaving it."" And at first I thought it was just funny but it's become a quite common joke and as I continue attending the university I realize its truth. There aren't very many things to do in the city and the surrounding college town is dead most weekends. It takes a very quirky and usually introverted person to enjoy u of r. The parties also suck and are ridiculously repetitive."
College Junior,1,"Athletics are not a thing here. We're D3. Our football team and most varsity teams are meh, no one goes to games. We are D1 for squash and a few other things, but people study so much that they don't have time to go to sporting events, or even want to spend their time there."
College Freshman,1,"I don't care about athletics, but the only important sport is squash."
College Freshman,1,"I am an athlete. I can attest to the fact that sports here are seen as a joke, football players get made fun of and no one besides parents go to the games. On most occasions the visiting crowd is larger than our home crowd."
College Junior,1,"The prices of the meal plans are outrageous for the limited number of options offered! The food isn't cooked well and the options aren't all that healthy or diverse on a daily basis. The lines are crazy long. Seriously, you need a strategy to get fed because the lines are so long. Then, when eventually they swipe you in, you usually end up leaving because none of the food stations are ready, or the food is just inedible (burnt, funky tasting, etc)."
College Senior,1,They simply do not give enough aid.
College Senior,1,The professors don't teach or cancel so many classes it is a waste of my money
College Senior,1,Food is awful no healthy options and food service people are rude
College Senior,1,Needs improvement all of the policies with no regulations
College Junior,1,Go to any 'worst weather' lists for the US and Rochester will be there.
College Junior,1,It's dangerous. It's not abnormal to get an email about someone being mugged off-campus.
College Junior,1,"I worked as part of reslife, and it was the worst year of my life. My room flooded over a break and someone put my damp clothes in bags so they developed mildew, and they were planning on doing nothing about it until we threatened. Finally, my room was de-molded. Rooms are outrageously far from campus if you're not a freshman, and I hated the environment."
College Sophomore,1,very unwilling to work with people to give enough
College Sophomore,1,"Very little space is available, and thus the cost of parking it outrageously high. "
College Sophomore,1,What financial aid? My financial aid counselor wouldn't even answer my phone calls or emails when I had loads of questions that neither I nor my high school drop out father knew how to deal with.
College Sophomore,1,"The weather here SUCKS, be warned that you will go weeks at a time without seeing any sunlight whatsoever, and it does get depressing. Also, having to walk to class in a foot of snow is a pain, and UR will never cancel classes for ANYTHING. "
College Sophomore,1,"I don't have a car on campus, but I know several people who do. The parking here sucks, and it is very easy to get a ticket. "
College Sophomore,1,"The dining on this campus sucks. Yes, it's all there for you, but it's not healthy, tasty or appetizing. "
College Sophomore,1,"The school shuttles are the worst! The bus that goes to the mall only comes on the weekends and everyone tries to get on board so it ends up crowded and over filled. Sometimes if you are on your way back to campus and you are waiting at the stop, the bus will go straight past you without stopping. Most of the drivers are rude and never on time. Public transportation is available but is really sketchy! Cabs are your best friend but you need to find a good one. Marketplace Taxi is advertised on campus but they are completely undependable and frustrating to even TALK to. Find a different company and stick with it. If you like a driver, talk to them and get their personal number so you don't have to deal with idiots."
College Sophomore,1,"Oh god. Parking is the worst! First you get on a loooooooooooooong waitlist to get a parking spot then they will probably give you the worst one for you. And if dare park anywhere else, you get a nice, big ticket."
College Senior,1,"There is nowhere to park on campus unless you have a parking permit, which costs about $300 a year. It's are $20 if you park there anyway."
College Junior,1,It snows and is gloomy for the majority of the school year.
College Student,1,"When you arrive at school in August the weather will be Amazing, and it will probably stay pretty nice till October - mid-November. Fall Winter and Spring are largely defined by one thing: cloud cover. Yes during the winter it is cold and it snows but this doesn't bother me that much. The school does a great job of maintaining pathways and such. If you like seeing the sun I suggest you look elsewhere. Rochester has ~300 cloudy days a year and most of the sunny ones are during the summer when you aren't here.  "
College Sophomore,1,"Dealing with financial aid is always a hassle. Every student that I have talked to about financial aid at the University of Rochester has said that they always come across issues. I would suggest making appointments with your financial aid counselor to talk face-to-face because sometimes, emails are not effective. Phone calls aren't effective either."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is hard because during the week, there is only one place to park and it is pretty far from everything else (a far walk). There are more options on the weekend but those fill up quick."
College Sophomore,1,What off-campus dining? Oh you mean Chipotle and the Distillery that take a half hour to get to both ways in the freezing cold? Rochester has great restaurants but you can only enjoy them if you have a car. No college town here.
College Freshman,1,"There are only 2 dining halls which both consist of not the best food to eat. The dining hall located in Sue B, known as Danforth or D4 to most students allows the food to go in for around 30 minutes before you are through with your entire meal if you know what I'm saying. The stations consist of half sandwiches and half baked potatoes for a whole dinner, and the workers get upset when you take more then 1. For most students that is not a full dinner, or lunch. The other dining hall, Douglas, is about the same. I find myself eating pizza and ice cream whenever I have to go there. They serve the same chicken every day, and I know for a fact that they use the left overs from the day before. Also when there is good food at Danforth they charge you a $5.00 fee to get in. The dining at the U of R earns a D- on  my list."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not a Big Sport School – I believe our best performing sports were squash and soccer. Regardless, fans support was not a big thing. I'm fairly sure some high schools have larger bleachers. Intramural participation was quite high though."
College Junior,1,"The parking at University of Rochester is terrible. There is virtually no parking available for students, and people get ticketed all the time. At the Eastman School of Music parking is a breeze. There is a garage next to the school and a parking lot across the street as well as plenty of street parking."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is very expensive and hard to come by. For upperclassmen with cars on campus, they are parked very far away from residences."
College Sophomore,1,The student body – The frat parties used to be decent until they started severely cutting down the number of people allowed inside the houses and the amount of beer being served. This all equals a terrible social scene with awkward parties where the only people invited into the frats are frat brothers and attractive girls. Good luck being a guy and even more luck to unattractive girls. It's all horses***. And god forbid you get caught drinking too much or playing pong. The school has cracked down so hard on that bulls*** that most students are put on a severe probation. Basically if your looking for awesome college parties where you can drink and have fun DO NOT COME HERE!!! Look at schools like Bucknell and Lehigh that are equal if not better academically than UR and have a thriving party scene and school spirit
College Sophomore,1,"Mixed, Below Average – Frats are relatively pathetic at Rochester with a good party rarely."
College Freshman,1,"90% of the school is tragic looking. Unless you want to go for one of the gross frat guys. Expect to be single for the next four years unless you significantly lower your standards or venture over to other schools in the area. If you go outside of the Univeristy, you might find some guidos. If you're into that."
College Sophomore,1,Parking sucks.  The parking employees are just out to get you all the time.  Don't bring a car.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking Is Horrible – Parking is hell.  It's honestly the single worst aspect of UR.  It's outrageously overpriced, and you can only park in the lot to which you're assigned (usually at least half a mile from classes)  You're ticketed early and often.  Don't bring a car if you can avoid it.  The buses tend to work well, and a few lines are free to students, though they rarely run on schedule.  The airport is nearby, and a bus/train station is only a few miles away.  It's easy to go long distance, or even short-distance, but on-campus parking is terrible."
Recent Alumnus,1,"UR talks about being diverse, but it's mostly upperclass white people, and lots of asians.  Tons of students are from NY state, especially from around Rochester or around NYC/Long Island.  There's a racially diverse presence on campus, but for the most part, it's somewhat self-segregated.  It's also very liberal, so political conservatism (especially social conservatism) is scorned pretty heavily. Thus, there's lots of liberal pet projects around.  The gay groups on campus are pretty substantial, and the religious groups tend to be pretty lax in their approach."

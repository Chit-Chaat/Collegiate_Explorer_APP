Sophomore,5,it has been really easy actually and the professors are really understanding. my online experience has been truly rewarding.
Freshman,5,I really don't have an opinion formed yet on online learning because I have yet to take online classes.
Freshman,5,I truly do love the scenery and the campus at Syracuse University. It's big yet has a welcoming vibe because everyone is friendly and very spirited.
Alum,5,"My 4 years at Syracuse were amazing. From the amazing academic challenges, to the sports programs an events and the long-lasting friendships, SU provided a well-rounded foundation to prepare me for success."
Niche User,5,"I did not take any online classes. However, most professor's make good use of online communication and post grades in a timely manner. My online experience was good."
Alum,5,Professors flexible for a student athlete. Lots of challenging coursework but  enjoyed every minute.
Alum,5,"Took and exam and some homework online, did not have any issues, the apps used by the school worked sufficiently."
Sophomore,5,"I did my spring semester online. This was new for some professors, but overall, I believe they did a good job by making classes more fun and interactive."
Alum,5,"My online experience with Syracuse University was great! The courses that I took were fairly easy courses; and by ""easy"" courses I mean courses that did not require such a ""hands on"" approach. It would've been difficult, in my opinion, to have taken courses such as Biology or Chemistry online due to the difficulty level, as well as the subsequent labs that are usually required for those courses. However, I took a Nutrition course and a Psychology course online, and those classes were great! My professors were very nice and extremely helpful if I did not understand something. They were available to have phone conversations or video conversations, if I wanted a more personal meeting. The courses were also very interesting and very inclusive of all students. Lectures and notes were both placed online, to be able to refer back to if needed, as well as videos that included examples of the topics that we discussed.

Overall, I really enjoyed my online experience with Syracuse University!"
Sophomore,5,I’ve had a great learning experience. The professors are easily accessible and really want to see you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"I am a part of the School of Architecture at Syracuse university, and I feel that they do a good job at preparing me for what I want to do. Resources are readily available if I need assistance with schoolwork or am overwhelmed and need some clarification. No class feels like a waste of time and I learn valuable lessons in each of them."
Freshman,5,I loved the many different classes that Syracuse offered and the fact that they allowed me to be able to take them while still in HIgh School.
Freshman,5,Every single one of my professors were amazing and they were always there for me if I was struggling and they made the class way better/
Sophomore,5,"I definitely made the right choice by choosing Syracuse University. They say college is much more than just the academics you learn in a classroom: you also develop as a person. This is so true since, after just 2 years at Syracuse University, I have become completely unrecognizable from my 17-year old self first walking onto the SU campus. After the first two weeks of ""awkward transition,"" I guarantee that you will love the atmosphere so long as you are openminded and willing to meet new people."
Sophomore,5,"I took a few classes online during the summer of 2019 and again in Spring 2020 (due to the pandemic). The school is expensive, yes, but it is defiantly worth it in times like these where they have little to no problem adapting to different circumstances. Whether you are learning online or in the classroom, you get out of the effort that you put in, so for me, I had no problem transitioning online. In fact, I enjoyed it."
Alum,5,Great experience while I was there. It is one of the last old school colleges left and I felt like that made it all worth it. My counselors and professors were all great. If you put in the work they will work with you. The school is very cold so as long as you're ok with that you'll have a great time.
Junior,5,Syracuse has such a large community of diverse individuals and it was easy to make friend. Everyone in my major gets along well and the professors are always ready to help students.
Niche User,5,It was great when I visited! Love the campus and environment. All professors I met were very accommodating and nice.
Freshman,5,"Syracuse has been the absolute best place for me to thrive.  I'm a first year Forensic science and psychology major with a Spanish minor and have enjoyed every single minute I've been here.  The campus is gorgeous, the facilities are amazing, and the professors I've experienced are passionate and care about their students.  The the atmosphere of the campus alone is amazing, I feel right at home and have definitely met some of my best friends for life.  I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.  Syracuse was the right choice for me."
Freshman,5,Syracuse University is a beautiful campus. I fell in love with this school so much that I used to stay up and watch the sunrise with friends on the Quad. Classes difficulty vary from course and teachers. This school offers a wide variety of things to study in and also many organizations to join. Freshman year is the year to enjoy yourself and try different things. Throughout my years at SU I am expecting to figure myself out more and excited to meet more diverse people.
Alum,5,"Class of 2012 graduate. Did well here (Fraternity president + Graduated with honors in dual degrees from Newhouse School of Communications and Whitman School of Business.) 

Truthfully, college today is about ""credentialing and networking"". Syracuse is easily one of the most ""well-known"" and ""network friendly"" private institutions in the Northeast. Fair or not, a diploma from 'Cuse certainly will open doors where degrees from lesser-known or supported institutions might not. 

As a bonus, great ACC sports teams help with national visibility and drive ""school spirit"" both on campus and with alumni relations when senior year comes around and it is time to find a job (and pay for loans). I'm settled in the southwest now and employers still know about Syracuse."
Niche User,5,"Amazing school. Great experiences and memories. Excellent programs with most majors. I have always felt safe on this campus and it's been impossible not to find anything to do when you're bored, feeling sick, sad, or stressed. There is ALWAYS someone to talk to or see."
Alum,5,"Loved everything about Syracuse! My professors were all amazing and really cared about the success of their students. There are so many opportunities for involvement through Greek life, clubs, athletics, etc. The school spirit is also unmatched."
Sophomore,5,"The classes are informational and the professors are professional, thorough, and well versed in their knowledge."
Freshman,5,Coming to Syracuse University was one of the best things I did! SU has become a home for me. There is always something to do and there are so many opportunities for students. The amount of school spirit is amazing and brings the whole campus together.
Senior,5,"When I first visited Syracuse I felt welcomed. The students, civilians and workers on campus all treated me so well and I really felt at home. I found about Syracuse from the Falk college and the college really blew me away when I walked in the doors. The countless opportunities for my future that Syracuse provides is really cool and special and I can't wait to go to school there in the fall. Syracuse is the perfect fit with it having a decent amount of ids, not too big or small,  the dorms were really nice, and the campus was very easy to get around."
Senior,5,"Syracuse University has been such a great community of support and has uplifted me to where I am today. I feel at home in the University and the professors and staff have treated my cohort with sincere respect and belief in us. I recommend Syracuse University to anyone looking to take their education and community experience seriously. Stay in Cuse, dreams come true here."
Junior,5,"Amazing atmosphere, great campus life, strong school culture and identity, great academics, helpful and knowledgable professors, tons of ways to get involved"
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, I have absolutely loved Syracuse University so far. I am in the Newhouse school, and I feel that I am learning really important and relevant information within the communications field. With that said, if your parents are not insanely rich and paying for your college, it is definitely worth considering if the cost of Syracuse's tuition is worth it for some of their less prestigious schools. Party scene is nice and there is a lot going on, but it is a little overrated. As a person who does not like partying, it did take me a little longer to find a solid group of friends with the same values as me. However, the people here are amazing and insanely supportive of one another. I have made some really close friends."
Senior,5,"I've had an amazing overall experience here at SU. Yes, it snows a lot and can get cold, but that's what you're signing up for. There is surprisingly so much to do in the area, whether it be on campus, downtown, and even some hidden gems outside the city. It's athletics are top notch and lots of fun to go to. There is nothing like the Carrier Dome. The professors challenged me, yet were there for support when I needed it. It is the top school in the nation for school spirit, and of course, for partying. I've made some of my best, life-long friends by not being in a frat. Do the right things, make good friends, stay organized, and it will be the best decision you've ever made. Work hard play hard - Roll orange!!!"
Graduate Student,5,I like the convenience of taking my classes on line. The professors are really knowledgeable and the students attending are very helpful. The academic advisers are very helpful with scheduling and getting you on the right path to start off your academic career
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, Syracuse University has given me a lot in the terms of academics and a place to feel at home. I have met great friends through the University. You need to do some searching to find friends but I know I have found friends that I will have for a lifetime. Syracuse University will always be a part of my life and I will always be grateful."
Niche User,5,"I adored Syracuse University when I ugh it was a Saturday and I saw few students, I could imagine myself being in people’s shoes - studying on the quad, going to see therapy dogs, eating at the food truck etc."
Niche User,5,"It is a beautiful school with great people. I have loved my short time there, and I hope to return in the fall."
Sophomore,5,"This school is pretty awesome with dorms, foods, etc. people are friendly here, many restaurants around the campus."
Alum,5,"I liked the connections that you could make via the professors at the school. They were able to help connect you with other professionals to advance your knowledge and gain experience in your chosen field. I would like to see more diversity on campus and the integration of that throughout. It was more of a divide on campus in regards to diversity and culture. Also, unless you looked for those specific cultural events, you would not know that they existed at all within the school."
Sophomore,5,Syracuse University is a thriving campus filled with opportunities for everyone. At SU your professors know on a personal level and are always there to push you in academia and help you along the way. The campus is beautiful all times of the year and you will always people repping there college!
Junior,5,"LOVE Syracuse University. Great school spirit, everyone is attending games and showing how much pride they take in the school, and that is not for nothing. Every time there is an issue on campus, faculty steps in trying to help. Although the school is huge, you still feel known by professors in classes and that you can walk around campus seeing a familiar face. Great education programs and staff is kind and genuine."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, an amazing school. I chose Syracuse because of the scholarship they offer to local indigenous peoples. They have provided me with a way to receive an education with other amazing people of all different cultures. Their study abroad program as well it above others as well in that they help you step by step. Overall, the area is great, housing is affordable and the university has events occurring week that help you slip right into student life."
Freshman,5,"So far I love it!  Great school spirit and opportunities! Lots of resources exist, and they have some really unique programs.  Students are from all over the country and the world.  So are the instructors!"
Sophomore,5,"Amazing opportunities and endless ways for students with any interest to pursue them. There are so many different majors to choose from, as well as many great off campus involvements and ways to find your place on campus."
Alum,5,"Syracuse University provided an exceptional experience and a better education. From the students to the staff, everyone provides a welcoming environment. The different facilities available from modern to old, also gives you a timeless feel which was refreshing."
Graduate Student,5,"Syracuse University is an excellent college for graduate and undergraduate studies. I would recommend the Social Work Program. Specifically, the advanced standing program."
Freshman,5,Syracuse University is an amazing school that offer multiple majors for students everyone. In Syracuse there is also multiple clubs that anyone can join. There's always space for people to be themselves and be who they are at this University.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is good, but the food is somewhat terrible. The architecture is beautiful and the campus is well built for students. School spirit is very prominent on campus and makes the college experience all the better. I cannot wait to see how the rest of my college experience goes, as so far it has been nothing short of amazing."
Sophomore,5,"First off, I love all the resources the campus has to offer. If you’re struggling academically, mentally, emotionally, or even physically, there are many different departments in which can help fix that issue. Academically, there’s tutoring everyday of the week. Mentally and emotionally, we have a great department for counseling and human services. And physically, if you want to improve your daily health, body, or well being we have personal training services on campus as well. We have access to dining halls where there’s amazing food being served throughout the day. Being a transfer, the transition to such a prestigious university was difficult at first but Syracuse and its resources definitely helped a whole lot and I couldn’t be more thankful. Also, the networking on this campus is great. Finding an internship can be difficult, but the wide amount of Syracuse alumni working in different companies around the world definitely boosts our chances."
Alum,5,"I graduated from SU in 1988.  I can't say enough good things about it.  It has everything - a beautiful campus, excellent courses and devoted instructors, great Greek and sports life, if that is your preference, great dorms, tons of activities you can participate in.  In addition, SU is a very generous school - it offers excellent financial aid for those who need it.  I would HIGHLY recommend SU to you!"
Freshman,5,"Great school. I am an incoming freshman and went to visit a couple of times and it truly is a great school. If you're looking for a school that has a great party scene but also does not mess around with academics and schoolwork, definitely consider Syracuse. I also loved the campus, it is pretty big but that's what I liked about it. I also loved the number of clubs that you can choose from. It really does give you an opportunity to meet other people and get involved in the school."
Freshman,5,Great campus. Instructors are very helpful for the most  part. Academics are very good and a lot of open opportunities.
Sophomore,5,"AMAZING FINANCIAL AID!!!! The professors can be a bit rough at points, as they all have their own styles of teaching but it's worth it in the end. Also, the courses are tough but you'll get by if you focus and study! The surrounding local area of Syracuse, New York is extremely unsafe but the university is private so there's security booths/kiosks before entering the university to see why you're entering. The Department of Public Safety (DPS) constantly drives around the campus, and is quick to the scene. There is a lot of restaurants and places to shop though, in the more safer areas of the city, and in surrounding cities."
Niche User,5,"It's a well-rounded school with everything. Greek life, sports, great academics, a good reputation, and a beautiful campus; Syracuse has everything to offer. At Syracuse, you'll get a great education during the week, and a great social life on the weekends. Great experiences with most classes and instructors, and feel that I have networked and learned more than I could imagine since my first day of class. Toured the college this summer and I absolutely loved it. The campus was amazing and everyone we spoke to was super nice. Syracuse's academics, student life, and athletics allow any student to explore their forte and find others with similar interests and life goals."
Sophomore,5,"So far everything has been great at Syracuse. If you're interested in a classic college experience with strong academics and a connected student body, then you'll fit right in. The campus is beautiful and the snow is terrible. If you have a warm coat and some boots you'll be fine."
Sophomore,5,The reason why I love Syracuse University is the student life and school spirit. It is uncommon to find someone on the campus who does not bleed orange. Students here love both the academics and party scene at Syracuse.
Sophomore,5,"I love Syracuse University. It has allowed me to not only explore my interests and choose a major that fits me, but it has allowed me to meet new people and make new friendships and connections. Every moment I spend at Syracuse is always exciting and interesting. There is so much to do on campus and the people you meet there and relationships you form are unforgettable and bonds for life."
Sophomore,5,"I love every aspect about Syracuse University, there isn’t one bad thing that comes to mind when I think of the university. Although the professors I’ve came across can be hit or miss, their ultimate goal is for you to learn and grow which makes it all worthwhile. The food at the dining halls is better than most, and the students are some of the sweetest groups of diverse yet very different people one will ever find."
Freshman,5,"At Syracuse University, there are tons of opportunities and paths to allow each and every student to succeed in their desired path and destiny. Through creative learning and direct approaches, Syracuse truly is there to assist their students and allow them to flourish."
Junior,5,"It's literally out of an American movie, there are so many student resources, abroad resources and depending on your major, the experience varies. Pretty campus, school spirit, tons of clubs and sports, greek life, on-campus life mostly. My only complain is the location, meaning weather and far from everything in NY, otherwise great university."
Sophomore,5,"AMAZING EXPERIENCE I literally couldn't sleep the first few nights because of how excited i was. First few days the ornientation is really chill, and at night kids flood the street and there's a big outdoor party. 
I was happy to find that there is SUCH an amazing mix of kids, not just Jewish kids from New York, but there are literally kids from all over the world from all kinds of countries. 

If your the type that may be interested in Greek life - this is the school. The type. to work hard and take classes seriously, but get your work done and hit the bards go for it. A perfect mix of work and play. Not to mention game days when the entire student section turns orange ..

As long as you are the type that will study hard and have FUN when your out, you will love it"
Niche User,5,"OrangeHousing.com thinks the SU Campus is beautiful even in the winter months.  Of course Fall, Spring and Summer months are even nicer.  Lots of hidden jewels on campus."
Sophomore,5,"Nothing but love for this school. Everyone feels welcome here. The professors are amazing, the food is gross, the city is gross but the campus is gorgeous."
Alum,4,"Syracuse was an amazing undergraduate experience. The student life, academics, and beautiful campus made it a great place to spend 4 years."
Alum,4,"I attended a four years in person and lived on campus. The university consistently improves the academic programs, building infrastructure, alumni network opportunities and corporate partnerships."
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus and I never had a bad experience with a professor. There is so much to do and so many things available it is hard to keep track of. Overall, I had a good experience."
Sophomore,4,"I love SU, but like any school it has it's problems. It's expensive, greek life is pretty toxic, and it can be hard for minority students. However, for many it's a great place to get an education. As a music student, I would like to praise the the Setnor School of Music for it;s cutting edge education. The faculty there are truly preparing us for the future."
Alum,4,"Syracuse University is a wonderful school, and I have no regrets attending, whatsoever. Being at that school helped me get to the place where I am today. I give my overall experience 4 stars because of how my beginning experiences were, first coming to the school.

I am originally from South Carolina, and moving all the way to New York for college was both exciting and challenging. There was a big adjustment period for me, being in a new place far from home and trying to balance a whole new lifestyle that was different than what I was used to. Getting to know new people, and the nuances of New York life made for a difficult freshman year. 

I say all of this not to discourage, but to give an honest opinion on how my journey began at that school. It was difficult to balance having a new lifestyle so far away and starting fresh at a brand new school. However, I would not change a single thing! Everything happens for a reason, and I am so grateful to have this school underneath my belt!"
Niche User,4,"I was a student at the SI Newhouse School of Public Communications. I enjoyed my classes and my professors were all very successful in the field, some coming from WaPo, New York Times, and the like. The school itself is very expensive and very white. There was a little bit of diversity, but people tended to stay grouped with other students of their own race, which I found discouraging. The administration didn't do enough to ensure safety and equality."
Senior,4,"My experience at Syracuse has been nothing short, but amazing in terms of the connections I have made with friends and professors in my major. Originally I was born in Canada, then moved to Florida for most of my life, so moving myself to a whole other state with the passing of my father around the same time was very difficult. Through the relationships and supportive community, I have grown as a person. Also, I do believe the resources from Syracuse university is very beneficial. However, there are some aspects that I strongly dislike, such as the mindset of some officials with regards to how they handle conduct and situations that become present on campus. It is unfair as I feel like it is students against the higher up officials of SU. In addition, some advisors during my freshman and sophomore years were really no help in guiding me to my career"
Senior,4,"For me personally, I strongly disliked online classes due to me gaining a better understanding of course material when directly or in-person learning. However, Syracuse did to a tremendous job organizing and making sure online classes went smoothly"
Sophomore,4,I’ve had a great time at Syracuse! The professors are great and encouraging. I’ve loved all of mine so far.
Sophomore,4,"Syracuse University is a large university that is centered around sports. I came here for the architecture program which I love and am proud to be a part of, but in my opinion the school itself is too concerned with sports. It doesn't get 5 stars for me because the tuition is high and most of it seems to be spent on the dome."
Sophomore,4,"Syracuse University is a college with many resources. There's definitely something for everyone if you're willing to put yourself out there and try new things. I really enjoy the fact that it reaches out to people with many different types of interests. However, I strongly believe the University isn't  transparent with the students and there is a huge lack of communication. There's a sort of love hate relationship where there's a lot to do and you can get a lot out of the experience and the general atmosphere of the college can be enjoyable but there are moments where the college isn't really helpful or doesn't give you as much attention as you need. But honestly on any college campus you can find an advisor, professor, and group of people you're comfortable around and to help you gain new opportunities and solve any problem."
Graduate Student,4,"Professors are really nice, the city is affordable to live in, and the campus is beautiful! Although the university lacks in some areas of engineering it is good in others. Is the place to go for student athletes, with one of the best teams and stadiums in the country!"
Alum,4,"Very diverse, very cold, but overall very grateful for having Syracuse University because it is one of the last old school colleges in America"
Alum,4,"Being a student at Syracuse University, especially a woman of color and first generational it was very hard to navigate through spaces that took a lot for professors to understand. However, I stand for what I believe in and make my presence be heard and the professors who help amplify my voice by encouraging me to either join clubs, organizations on campus or letting me be creative with my writing."
Sophomore,4,Supportive staff.  Intelligent students who want to learn.  Many opportunities for volunteer work.  Many resources and opportunities for pursuing dreams and goals. Disorganized academic clubs.
Sophomore,4,Supportive professors.  Good online platform.  Extended office hours.  Access to extensive online library resources.
Sophomore,4,"So far I have loved my experience at Syracuse! The people I have met, the sports, my classes have all been great. Despite my love for the school like many universities around the country, Syracuse did a terrible job at handling hate crime incidents and protests in response to the crimes that took place throughout this past academic year. It was very disappointing to see how ill-prepared the school was to handle the hate crimes and the way they treated protestors was awful."
Sophomore,4,My online experience so far has been the best it could be considering the circumstances. I'm very thankful for my professors and appreciative of their hard work.
Freshman,4,Overall I had a good first year. There was just a lot going on at the time such as protests on-campus and then the spread of coronavirus which forced us to transition to online classes.
Sophomore,4,The first couple of weeks at Syracuse was great fun. The university planned many events and made it very easy to connect with people. I made a friend group pretty quickly and it helped me become independent away from home. The actual learning has been great overall as well too. Most of the teachers actually care and want to see their students be successful.
Freshman,4,The format of my classes was great for me and the adjustment was very manageable! I think if my teachers hadn't proceeded like they did it would have been much more stressful.
Freshman,4,"I like the feel of campus at Syracuse. I also think it is good academically. Of course there will be some professors who aren't the best, but overall I feel good about the education."
Freshman,4,I love the campus community. I'm doing well academically but I can easily receive help if I'm struggling academically. I have a life outside of academics and I'm just happy overall.
Niche User,4,"Syracuse has a good balance of academics and party, as long as you know how to balance your schedule and manage your workload."
Sophomore,4,"I love the school spirit at Syracuse University! The academics are challenging, and make me feel very prepared for my future."
Freshman,4,"I would like to see a greater shift towards diversity among student body -- the scary situations that students faced in the fall semester is appalling to me and not something we can simply overlook. It terms of the school itself, I have had some of my greatest experiences on campus and with friends."
Senior,4,"Loved my experience at Syracuse University. I definitely received a great education. It is a great college campus with a nice downtown with many amazing restaurants. Although off campus and area of Syracuse might not be the safest, the campus itself is very safe. Great students, mostly great faculty."
Graduate Student,4,"I had a great time at Syracuse University as an undergrad. The courses were interesting and the faculty were always helpful. Therefor, I look forward to returning for my Masters degree. The only thing that I would like to see change on campus is the over emphasis on 'Greek Life' as I feel that it is a hindrance to both the academic and social development of students."
Niche User,4,Syracuse has more pride and energy of anywhere I've ever been. You are all together facing the weather especially at 7am. You can definitely find your own community. I treasured the relationship with ESF as a science student.
Alum,4,"Overall, I had a great time here. Is it too expensive? Yes. Do they have some serious issues going on between the students and administration right now (2020)? Absolutely, yes. However, I can only speak on my time there and I feel as though the education I received made up for some of the obvious issues. Newhouse is a little overrated, outside of the alumni network, but Maxwell is a school worth admiring."
Niche User,4,"Syracuse University changed my life. As a legacy, my mom and I have bonded over finally having something in common. I feel ready for my life after school and prepared for anything the world can throw at me."
Freshman,4,"It's very pretty here and even though it's a predominantly white school, it's more diverse than most."
Sophomore,4,"Syracuse as a whole is fantastic. Classes are engaging and challenging. The school does a great job getting students involved on campus. Campus itself is beautiful and easy to navigate. It's positioned in a great spot out of the city but close enough to where you can walk to it and enjoy the city aspects. Partying is a huge thing on campus. Most of my teachers have been good. Some professors aren't good and, depending on major, are hard to understand or communicate with."
Freshman,4,The academics may not be top notch but the professors and academic counselors are very accommodating and really helpful at guiding you towards your career goals. Also the student life is very active. There's tons of student organizations and lots of school spirit. It's a big party school and it may not be for everyone but overall it's lots of fun.
Freshman,4,The people here are not very accepting of others. The professors have no consideration of others and how life is affecting them. Administration only cares about it's white student population
Junior,4,"The atmosphere at Syracuse is incredible, walking around campus to classes I always feel like I belong, there are so many opportunities to get involved with clubs and other activities and game day crowds are always loud and proud to be Orange if course. The biggest thing I would change is the cost to attend, it can sometimes limit my ability to join certain activities and sometimes I have to work during events to be able to afford to attend here."
Niche User,4,"Great experience, did early grad study for data analysis certificate. Which counted as credits for later. Good D school and academically inclined. Only need to open another location, the school is heavily populated."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very beautiful and honestly, if you really use the resources that they offer wisely and not be a lazy student, then you have nothing to worry about. Work hard and enjoy the campus!"
Alum,4,Syracuse University has something for everyone. It that perfect size that is large enough to have opportunities but small enough to feel close nit. The campus is beautiful. Though definitely more expensive than college needs to be. A party school to the core. Academically it good depending on the major you choose.
Niche User,4,I toured the college this summer and I absolutely loved it! The campus was amazing and everyone we spoke to was super nice.
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my time in syracuse. Great campus great people, and plenty of activities during the year. Only downside is the cold!"
Freshman,4,"The academics, athletics, party scene and professors at Syracuse are all excellent. The university needs to work on its diversity and campus food. The dorms are nice but seem to be lacking for a school that is $70,000+ a year."
Senior,4,"Syracuse University is a university built for those who have a drive to learn. As a multi-college university, students have the ability to take classes from a wide array of choices (i.e. health, music, finance). While typically associated as a party school, Syracuse's academics, student life, and athletics allows any student to explore their forte and find others with similar interests and life goals."
Niche User,4,"Syracuse University is very close to home so the commute is very convenient for me as well as other for other local students. I really like how there are restaurants and stores and other things that are just a five minute walk from campus. There is time to grab something quickly or buy something that you might need for a class in that quick hour you have between classes. The dorms and buildings are a little old but are good enough to live in and stay in. There aren't really any safety concerns, unless you are outside by yourself. Also, the food is good for the most part."
Sophomore,4,"As an architecture major, I am not very fond of the school culture that strongly encourages severe neglect to physical health, in spite of what a handful of instructors say.
All time I spend off-campus is either at a grocery store or the Everson Museum. Food that meets my dietary needs is occasionally available, but my meals at the dining hall were nutritionally  insufficient and not worth what I paid for them. I have had a great experience with most classes and instructors, and feel that I have networked and learned more than I could imagine since my first day of class. 
I love snow and ice, so I didn't have much trouble with the windy continental climate and heavy precipitation, but it made commutes difficult for many people."
Sophomore,4,"Syracuse University is a wonderful, diverse campus which I feel everyone should visit at least once. There is so much to do on campus and off. All buildings and residence halls are constantly being reconstructed and improved. The sports are a huge deal for the school and they bring most students together right in one place (being the Carrier Dome) and if not the Dome, then on the beautiful south campus. Greek life is recognized and widely participated in. There are a wide range of clubs and organizations to get involved in. One thing I would improve for the school is the construction going on. I believe it should be done when most students are home for the summer, and not during the school year."
Junior,4,"The college itself is very professional and well-run.  Several of my teachers have been very helpful and caring about their student's success.  The music program does not get enough credit for sure.  Particularly the music education degree is very demanding , but it is also one of the best in the country, I feel.  They try with safety, but they can't help the fact that Syracuse in general is not the safest area."
Sophomore,4,Great! Socially and academically a great school but some professors and staff are subpar. There are many clubs and organizations to be involved in. A lot of connections to alumni and opportunities outside of the school.
Freshman,4,"What SU may lack in education, it certainly makes up for in experience. With so much school pride, the color orange has never looked better in my eyes. Even if you’re not a fan of the party scene, once you find a good group of friends, life could never be better."
Sophomore,4,"Syracuse is a pretty great school! One of the things I like the most about this school is that it has great resources for students, especially when it comes to maintaining good mental health. It also has a beautiful campus and plenty of fun events to go to that pertain to a great variety of interests. Something I don't like as much about this school is how they tend to try to cover up things that might damage the reputation of the school, even if it threatens the safety of students. However, the school has begun to correct this and I believe it is headed in a great direction."
Sophomore,4,"Syracuse University, although a great school, lacks diversity. I struggle to find an in crowd because of this reason. That being said, I enjoy the learning environment in the business school more than any other educational experience I have ever had."
Junior,4,My experience at Syracuse University has been very good. I enjoy the diverse activities that I have the opportunity to get involved in as a student as well as the excellent academic assistance available to me. The campus is great as there's always somewhere to grab a bite or sit and study.
Freshman,4,It's very accepting of people of all backgrounds. I wish the meal plan has a better system. The teachers are phenomenal.
Alum,4,I liked how diverse it was and the many different opportunities it offered. I felt that overall it had what I wanted in a college.
Freshman,4,"I am only in my second semester here at SU, but I have already fallen in love with it. People will find any reason to complain, but I think Syracuse is doing a great job in trying to accommodate to everyone's needs. The dining halls offer vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options, as well as a variety of options in general including a salad bar, yogurt and fruits, pasta, grilling options as well as a daily buffet. They are doing a great job"
Freshman,4,"The school itself is very good. The professors for the most part are always willing to help you out. The food is ok but there are a lot of dining halls and options to choose from. The athletics are very good but besides this and partying, there is not much else to do in terms of things that don't involve academics. There is very little diversity and if you are  a minority there is a high probability that you will be one of the only minorities in many of your classes, but there are many organizations that are designed to bring minorities to together."
Junior,4,"My experience at Syracuse has been amazing so far. I have met some great people, learned new things and discovered great concepts to better myself in the years to come. Without question, I am glad that I came to this school."
Freshman,4,"Syracuse's school spirit is unmatched. The school feels smaller than I expected, which is great. Some of the dorms have single stalled bathrooms which is an enormous improvement over multiple stall bathrooms and showers."
Graduate Student,4,Extremely dedicated and skilled professors. Exceptional peers who help facilitate great discussions.
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful.  The food in the cafeteria could be better more diversity.  It seems the Professors are either outstanding or horrible.  As I have yet to enter the job market it is unknown if the cost of the education will positively impact my search for a career.
Freshman,2,Too easy to cheat online. Professors try their best but if you know people in your classes you won’t learn much because everyone will just cheat off each other.
Freshman,2,"I went to Syracuse my freshman year and it is a good place for you if you enjoy partying, want to get involved in Greek life(!) and don’t have much desire to do anything else. It’s a very classic college experience but the surrounding area is not safe. Many students who go here have a lot of money, so you will have to adjust to being around a lot of rich people if you’re not used to that. If you like the outdoors this is not the place for you— it’s too cold to go outside for most of the year. There is an obvious lack of diversity and if you’re a POC you will feel out of place. You definitely have to look for the right people (I transferred)"
Sophomore,2,"Syracuse does have a lot of school pride which was part of the reason why I applied, however it does get REALLY cold which could take a toll on your mental health. The campus gets depressing in the winter time honestly. Also there are a lot of racial incidents here which is starting to give the university a bad reputation. Bio professor sucks at teaching but is a nice dude. if your rich, white and preppy cuse is for you"
Junior,2,"After being thrown into the online schooling, Syracuse did not do a very good job with helping students transition. I did not really learn anything from being online."
Sophomore,2,"The Professors didn't accommodate to international students who live in different time zones while holding their zoom classes. Also, it was hard to ask professors questions and to get an immediate response due to the time zones."
Senior,2,Not too diverse. Bad at addressing racism and other issues. It only cares about money. Costs too much for some of the dorms you have to stay in. Average food. I would not recommend to minorities.
Freshman,2,"Syracuse University is a good school that offers many different majors and minors. However, don't come here unless you love snow and freezing temperatures. There is some safety concerns with the surrounding town, but overall I feel fairly safe on campus and going to class."
Freshman,2,"It's very clear that there's a certain type of person that attends Syracuse: preppy, party animal, and everything associated with it. The school itself doesn't seem very eager to crack down on this reputation. I didn't feel welcome here and was miserable while I attended."
Senior,2,"If I had known about the undeniably toxic culture and lack of a caring community at Syracuse University, I would have never even applied. Sexual assault is an all-too-frequent occurrence (especially at fraternity events), and school administrators actively work to cover it up rather than promote open discussion. Students of color and members of the Jewish community are constantly targeted and made to feel uncomfortable. For more information on the violence and active protests that are happening today on campus, I would urge all interested high school prospects to read more via our campus newspapers: including the Daily Orange, Jerk Magazine, and Renegade SU."
Freshman,2,"Syracuse is not the place for you if you don't like to party or smoke every day. People are always going out even if it's a Wednesday or Thursday. Most people are from New York, especially Long Island. The classes are amazing but it's hard to make friends if you're not very outgoing. It's also extremely cold."
Sophomore,2,"If you want to go to college parties but don't want to join Greek life or at least athletics of some sort, this isn't the school for you. Classes here are actually pretty easy and overestimated in difficulty if you ask me. I don't see how people could fail them unless your more focused on having a social life than classes."
College Junior,2,People in greek life can be annoying at times
College Sophomore,2,Frats and sororities are mean to everyone who aren't in one.
College Freshman,2,"Could be nice. But too expensive. People have two choices, living on the main campus in a dorm, or in an apartment on South which is very far from classes"
College Senior,2,"The school has place  posters everywhere on campus to seek help and the numbers to call, but i really dont know how effective it is when someone is  already a victim."
College Junior,2,I have heard bad things about Greek life. I am not apart of it but there are some very superficial things that go on.
College Sophomore,2,It can be annoying. It's only for rich people.
College Sophomore,2,"When I think about safety on this campus, I automatically think of all of the crime alerts I have gotten from DPS on my email. The number is astounding. Although the campus is safe for the most part, the city is not. And the amount of townies that are able to access the campus, especially at night, has resulted in a mass amount of robberies and assaults. I appreciate what DPS does, but I honestly do believe that more can be done to keep the campus secure and keep townies away from campus."
College Junior,2,The greek life image at Syracuse is somewhat negative. Both Fraternities and Sororities often times discriminate and seem to be superior to the non-greeks.
College Freshman,2,"More often than not, I feel very unsafe on campus. I do not feel like I can walk alone at night safely. Though we have security systems in place on campus, I wish I could feel safer on campus."
College Sophomore,2,I don't care for Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"Health services isn't reliable, many of the people I know go off campus for medical services. Campus crime usually occurs off campus but still in close enough proximity to scare anyone."
College Sophomore,2,"They tell you if you need to be escorted to call DPS, 2 of my tires were flat, asked DPS if they could give me and my 3 friends a ride to our dorm a mile away in the snow and cold. They refused and said we were safe enough. How can you trust them to protect us when they won't even help some stranded kids?"
College Freshman,2,"Is bad not in the sense that happens often, but in the sense that people don't seem to believe that it happens."
College Sophomore,2,"The varsity teams are all good except football, and they think they are the best. I like to play soccer, we have like 6 soccer fields that the school won't let us use. Instead they make us use a really crappy field for all the students. They gyms are also not good, they are kind of mediocre for the amount of money we pay to go to the school."
College Freshman,2,Security is a big issue on campus as there have been some serious crimes since beg of the school year including sexual assault and murderers who killed gang members and escaped from the police near campus and were never found.  We need more street lighting on Euclid and Comstock along with extra officers present in the evenings and extra safety call boxes to make students feel safe/protected.
College Freshman,2,"Even though this school was not my first choice, I did come here trying to be as positive as can be, but ever since I got here I've been miserable.  Everyone is very cliquely.  The whites are with the whites, hispanics with hispanics, and so forth. The girls do not want to really make new friends once they have their group and the guys are either rude or trying to get at you.  I guess the academics are pretty good but to me that's about it."
College Freshman,2,"People are either extremely snobby, foreign, or not-all-there in the head. Take your pick."
College Sophomore,2,The dining halls do get repetitive and they serve the worst food on weekends. It wouldn't be so bad if the meal plans weren't as expensive. My best advise is save up money so you can eat out on weekends. Go downtown or to destiny or to marshall street and eat something different once in a while; maybe once a week.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the housing is run down near Euclid. Also, the properties are expensive. I am having difficulty finding an apartment that is decent inside and has a good price. Most of the bedrooms to rent out in a 6 bd house start around $500. One bedrooms start around $700"
College Sophomore,2,needs to be more healthier fresh options. like cut fruit in cups for sale at freshens. more on the go food is necessary too like already made peanut butter sandwiches
College Freshman,2,It may start with a party but every night they end up at the bars. Very repetitive and it gets old.
College Senior,2,"It is convenient for most of students who live in North Campus. However, the mean plan is too expensive for students and most students can't spend it for every week. Second, the menus in different dining halls are different, but they are still highly repetitive."
College Junior,2,There isn't enough selection especially in schine
College Freshman,2,It is somewhat tasteless. But sometimes they put something good out to eat.
College Junior,2,Don't leave the campus at night. Not the greatest place to wander around.
College Junior,2,"not much variety. usually the same things over (chinese food, chipotle)"
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of robberies and assaults near off campus housing.
College Senior,2,I'm glad I have a boyfriend from another school because if I had to find one here....
College Senior,2,"VERY tied to Greek life, which have closed parties between one fraternity and one sorority."
College Senior,2,"The Syracuse Police Department and SU's Department of Public Safety (DPS) work together and patrol the area very well. That being said, it's never enough. There are SO many home and on-person burglaries on campus and in the surrounding area. While I always feel safe on campus, I live five blocks off campus and do not feel safe walking home at night."
College Freshman,2,Getting aid is hard and the school is very expensive.
College Freshman,2,Financial aid has been a struggle here especially because it's such an expensive school and without significant aid there's no way for me to attend.
College Freshman,2,"The dining halls will seem okaaaay the first couple weeks of school, then you'll slowly HATE them."
College Freshman,2,"There are a LOT of good-looking people, but they're all rich and snobby and almost intolerable."
College Freshman,2,"Marshall St has like 7 places (3 of them are dessert places) and the dining halls are horrid. You don't even get a decent escape.

Like, yeah, Dinosaur BBQ and Pastabilities are great, but they're in Armory Square (in the city) and it's a hassle to get there and there aren't even that many options. It's so tiresome."
College Freshman,2,"Syracuse blows. Honestly. There's Marshall St (a tiny street with some food) and Destiny USA (one of the biggest malls in America) and that's it. And you have to take a 15 minute bus ride to Destiny.

The area is sketchy and there are places you're not supposed to walk (Thornden Park aka Rape Park).

The winter comes quick and lasts long. I am telling you right now: there is nothing as bleak and soul-sucking than Syracuse winter. And I come from New England, so I'm used to winters."
Recent Alumnus,2,"High rent, run-down houses, untrustworthy landlords"
College Freshman,2,DPS doesn't really care about our safety as long as all of the parties are broken up. A few robberies and assaults but they can't do anythiny about it
College Freshman,2,"DPS is really annoying, they bust every single parties and don't do anything for real crime"
College Junior,2,its very quiet and not a lot to do
College Junior,2,"Beautiful people, but don't expect a relationship."
College Senior,2,"Drinking is a constant problem at a school that has so much going on socially. Other than that, I would say I trust most students but there have been lots of reports of off-campus home robberies and gang-related violence coming from the city of Syracuse.

I addition, the campus recently dissolved it's center specifically for sexual assault and abuse counseling, which did not sit well with students at all."
College Sophomore,2,"Don't do it. Unless you live at home, just live on campus. It's more fun, and it's safe."
College Sophomore,2,"Lower middle-class --> $28,000 of debt..."
College Junior,2,I have been applying for financial aid for three years now and I always barely receive any financial help.
College Sophomore,2,i literally just answered this question so go back and look at it.
College Sophomore,2,"its a pretty generic east coast college for rich kids. bars, greek life, sports. academics is not high up the list"
College Sophomore,2,the school has many rules regarding the use of drugs and visitation rights yet they do not usually follow through on them
College Sophomore,2,alcohol and drugs are very popular around the campus and not much is done by the school to prevent or control it
Alum,1,"Syracuse Univseristy is a joke. For a private school where’s plagiarism should be taken seriously, plagiarism was taken lightly. I was in classes with students who would continuously plagiarize on their projects but somehow still are at good academic standing with the school. Syracuse University wants to protect its high reputation by hushing horrible incidents like an almost school shooting this past Spring, plagiarism, and Greek life incidents that are now coming to the light. Syracuse may be diverse but the student body is composed  of segregated diversity. I’ve never been more disgusted by a school that truly is in it for the money and can not hold true to its standards."
Alum,1,"Beware of this school it is filled with hate. From the moment I stepped into Bette Thoreck office I was treated with the most disrespect in my life. This college will not help you to grow. And also there is a lot of stuck up nasty women and scary d-bag frats who will harass you and even threaten you. I even got threatened one time by a group of men and I'm a 5'2 female, they were clearly drunk but this is the culture at SU. Look great on the outside while crap on inside. Not to mention. It is way to expensive for what you are getting and you are treated like a number. Stay Away"
Freshman,1,"I really did not like Syracuse...not being from the east coast is difficult because the weather sucks and on top of it there is nothing to do except drink. I felt trapped while attending Syracuse and all I wanted was to get out.  I really didn't feel safe, don't go if you are an arts and science major because Syracuse only cares about Newhouse and Falk students. The only plus is you don't really gain the freshman 15 because there is no good food in Syracuse or none thats easy to get. I really wanted to take a business course but my counselor wouldn't let me...in fact she left Syracuse too."
College Freshman,1,"Literally everyone drinks. I'm one of very few people who don't, and it's definitely weird"
College Senior,1,I am not a fan of the flamboyantly rich
College Freshman,1,There are A LOT of drugs on campus and even more alcohol.  Half of the liqueur and package stores could care less if ur 21 or not. They'll sell to anyone
College Sophomore,1,Syracuse is a hell hole. The people are mean and will do anything to get ahead academically and socially. The staff are unhelpful and only interested in the paycheck not the students. I wouldn't wish this school on my worst enemy.
College Sophomore,1,you need more scholarships for upperclassmen who do well in school
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone is willing to ""talk"" with you about it, but no one will do anything to help. They follow FAFSA very strictly, and don't offer many options outside of state grant money."
College Senior,1,"As an international student, it was difficult for me to get financial aid because it was too competitive. School would consider the American citizens first and students who have the top performances. Because of this, it makes me decrease chances of getting the financial aid."
College Freshman,1,All the Greeks think everyone else wants to be involved and that's so far from the truth.
College Senior,1,"I was Greek for two years and hated it. It a massive time and financial commitment. The entire foundation of Greek life is based on horrible notions of social acceptance and they will sell, sell, sell it to you during recruitment, lying about everything, e.g. saying that you will stay very close to your friends who join other houses (you won't), that they do not haze (they ALL do), that it's not all about partying (it is), that you will be totally accepted and still make tons of friends if you aren't a big partier (you won't). I wish I listened when I was told how big Greek life was at Syracuse University before I attended."
College Freshman,1,I hate it! and having a meal plan is required when living on campus
College Junior,1,"Syracuse is terrible with giving out financial aid. It is disgusting that a school with so much money is not willing to assist many. Just because both parents are employed doesn't mean that they can afford to pay for me to attend a 60,000 dollar college."
College Sophomore,1,the weather makes it difficult to motivate myself to go to class
College Senior,1,the weather can be such a disappointment for most students. winters are brutal.
College Sophomore,1,"THE SNOW IS TERRIBLE AND WE NEVER SEE THE SUN, IT IS SO DEPRESSING AND DISHEARTENING WHEN YOU HAVE TO WALK TO CLASS IN A BLIZZARD."
College Sophomore,1,"It is really difficult going to school with so many wealthy people when you're personally not one of them, because it feels like you are playing a never ending game of catch up that you will NEVER win."
College Freshman,1,"The city buses and campus buses are alright but it sometimes takes HOURS to get somewhere it could have taken 15 minutes if you're trying to use one of the buses (the schedules are sometimes horrible to coordinate). If you're going long distance, DON'T USE AMTRAK. I'm from Milwaukee and had a 13 hour train to Chicago from Syracuse (getting a ride or taking a taxi to the station) which would ALWAYS be at least an hour to 3-4 hours late, then I had a connecting train from Chicago to Milwaukee (thankfully, this one was usually on time - if I didn't have to wait for the next train because I missed the one I was supposed to be on). You may be asking why I used this so many times and that is because it is sooo but cheaper compared to flights (which are usually $500 and up one way to anywhere in the midwest). But if you go against my warnings and are as broke as I am and decide to use Amtrak, get the student discount. It costs like $20, but you'll more than make up for it in your first purchase.

One thing to keep in mind, get on the Syracuse webpage or any of the facebook pages and look around to see if they buses going either to somewhere close to where you live or to the train/bus station and the airport. They usually do during the big breaks but they don't advertise it as much as they should."
College Junior,1,"Summers are hot, and winters are bitter cold. Alot of snow, which isn't bad, it's the wind. The wind is absolutely horrendous and it makes everything so much colder. There isn't too much humidity in Syracuse, but the weather can get a little intense at times especially during the winter time."
College Freshman,1,"I hate the weather. This week alone, it was as hot as 80 degrees on Monday and today it snowed an inch."
College Freshman,1,"It is always snowing in Syracuse. I didn't believe it when people told me, but it really is cold all of the time. Fox said Syracuse was the coldest school in the US, I should have believed them before I came."
College Junior,1,The weather is the worst part of attending this university.
College Sophomore,1,"I'm sure people who like large parties with huge amounts of alcohol and noises so loud that it is impossible to have a conversation five inches from the other person's ear will enjoy the night life of Syracuse University.  Anyone who prefers a small bit of maturity, and wants to be able to hold a nice conversation with friends or strangers over a drink or two will have to look hard to find it."
College Sophomore,1,It is either too hot or too cold in Syracuse. It also snows almost everyday from January until March.
College Freshman,1,"Only like 5 places within walking distance, it gets boring quick."
College Freshman,1,Absolutely sucks. You will not want to go anywhere when it is -11 degrees. Walking to class is terrible.
College Freshman,1,"The music school here sucks. All local kids, mostly interested in music ed. The professors don't give a crap about you. The only class that I have had that was enjoyable was a science course. No internship or job opportunities."
College Freshman,1,"There are absolutely no attractions or activities in the area. Relatively unsafe neighborhood, with occasional muggings and break-ins of cars and offices. There is one huge mall, Destiny USA (believe me, it gets old fast) which is a sketchy bus ride away. Otherwise, have fun taking a 5 hour train to NYC because that is all the fun you're going to have."
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing to do here. Like, actually. The only thing is walking to frat row or taking a bus to South. All of this in absolutely freezing weather, besides the first 2 months. No other attractions, besides Destiny USA (the mall, which is only available through a sketchy bus). The same 5 restaurants and that's it."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life dominates. If you're not interested in joining but want to have a social life, this is not the place for you. Exactly how you would imagine a stereotypical frat party nation. Everyone on my floor gets wasted and/or smokes pot in the bathrooms every night of the week."
College Sophomore,1,"It is very cold and windy all the time. Also, the weather is constantly changing; one day it'll be warm and beautiful and the next day it is snowing. "
College Sophomore,1,"Rated ""Worst Winters in the Country"" But the snow is gorgeous and the snow removal system is second to none; and everything else about the school makes it completely worth it."
College Senior,1,"Syracuse is the most-snowed-on metropolitan area with over 100,000 people. We were ranked the ""worst place to winter"" in the country. The snow is intense, but the city is prepared for it. Roads are well-salted, though sidewalks rarely are"
College Senior,1,"Buses only run once an hour, and sometimes don't show. Routes change once the snow falls, so if you're down a hill, the bus will not come to your stop. In the ""campus corridor,"" rides are free, but if you go outside about a 5 mile radius, a ride is $2. "
College Junior,1,It's only very bad to me because I transferd from CU Boulder (a perfect college town) for my major in the famous communications and design school. 
College Junior,1,ABSOLUTE WORST WEATHER EVER! ever. ever. ever. 
College Sophomore,1,"Getting physically blown away by the wind is not an overstatement. Carrying those heavy books and laptops might come in handy when battling against the harsh winds on top of the snow and rain. Walking to class can be a drag, but once you're in that large lecture, that ""warm and toasty winter"" feeling can keep you cosy while you sip on your Dunkin' Donuts coffee and simultaneously take notes on some class you were forced to take. "
College Sophomore,1,"You're better off not having a car unless you live on South Campus or in a house/apartment. Permits are expensive, plus, there aren't many parking spaces anyway."
College Freshman,1,"I was told that as a Newhouse student you probably won't get financial aid  (merit) even though you deserve it because of the prestige of Newhouse-- if you don't pay what they're asking, someone else while. I have found this to be true unfortunately, it's an ongoing battle with the aid office. "
College Freshman,1,"It sucks. It's very cold and snows heavily from October until April so the only nice weather you enjoy while in school is late August, September, late April, and May. This is annoying for walking to class and partying, everything in general."
College Junior,1,"It is very hard to find  convenient parking on campus, but there are buses that make travel around campus easy."
College Junior,1,"there is a bus system, but it is very unreliable.  would be okay for day travel but to risky at night"
College Junior,1,It is very difficult to park on campus and expensive. Most students will park at Manley Field House on South Campus and then ride the bus-- this parking pass is also much cheaper. Most students do not have a car with them and it is easy to get around without one.
College Sophomore,1,"I hate to say it, but Syracuse is not very diverse and I think they may be working on it. Economic-wise, it is a very upper-middle class school. I think there is a wide variety of political beliefs. The campus does have a service for almost every religion known to man, but I do not think there is a wide variety of students whom attend those services."
College Sophomore,1,there are actually people walking around the parking lot to write parking tickets
College Sophomore,1,"pre-law
it is actually a track not a major
no prep classes for it
nothing"
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible weather, there is no consistency and it is unpredictable. To give an example, we had two days when the weather was in the mid 60's low 70's. Later that weekend it snowed..."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The city sucks. There's nothing to do, public transportation is awful - you need a car. There's a few good restaurants scattered across Syracuse. Students usually stay on campus or go to the huge mall, that's it."
College Freshman,1,There is very little parking on campus. Many tickets are given out for parking violations. There is a need for a car on campus to get into the city to visit Target/any other stores.
College Sophomore,1,"I personally feel that the dining halls on campus are awful. I actually dread having to go back to Cuse after breaks because I am not a fan of the food and I hate going to bed on an empty stomach. I think it is irritating that students living in a dorm are required to have a meal plan. While the dining halls are in good locations and they are handy, the food just is pathetic. I can not wait to get home to a home cooked meal whenever I can."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't know very much about the system but they are not very strict. You obviously don't want to get caught by the University Police but I haven't heard of anyone getting caught since I've been there, but they do try to enforce on frats."
College Sophomore,1,"Such a low grade is for safety. Campus itself is fairly safe, but we get weekly emails about off campus robberies and assaults. It is best not to venture out alone after dark, and be aware of your surroundings and who is around you at all times. Syracuse is a poverty stricken city and college students, carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars of electronics at any time, are easy targets. You need to be smart."
College Senior,1,"Parking is expensive. Ridiculously expensive, at that. 800 to park in the garages, 350 to park in a lot near campus, and 76 to park in the lots on south campus and Manley. If you live off campus you'll be lucky to find a spot. DPS is real good about handing out parking tickets. Park in a wrong spot and you'll see the stub on your windshield. If you need to stop on campus anywhere for a couple of minutes or hour, expect to pay. There are no free lots anywhere to park, except on Sunday."
College Senior,1,"]If you find a parking spot, it is like you won the lottery. I have to pay $800 extra a year to park in a garage. Though having a car on campus is definitely amazing, the parking is ridiculous."
College Junior,1,"On any given day, you will experience every kind of weather. It will snow in the winter, and the wind is so cold it takes your breathe away. The sky is always gray or filled with the most amazing looking clouds. This place is nick-named ""where clouds come to die."" You may wake up, and it'll be 60 and sunny, then it will hail, then rain, then be sunny again. This actually happened. And happens a lot. Buy yourself a heavy parka and a good rain jacket, also rain boots are a must!"
College Sophomore,1,"It's easy to adjust to consistent cold or snow. The problem is when you dress according to the weather and it does a complete 180 from summer to winter, or vice versa, within an hour or two."
College Senior,1,"There is so much snow. On top of that the wind is terrible. The cold itself isn't bad, but once the wind starts blowing, and it will, things get very chilly quickly. This is compounded by the fact that most buildings are not in close proximity of one another. Or at least none of the buildings you seem to need at the time. To emphasize the point though, if you don't like the cold don't go here. Literally bucket loads of snow fall from the sky, some days it's like someone is playing a trick on us. Also, school will never get closed for weather, never, never, never."
College Senior,1,"On-campus parking is hard to come by. However, if you are living in the dorms there are designated areas to park in, which are reasonable until there is a sporting event, then parking is fair game to everyone, including the fans."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus food is seriously bad.  There are limited choices, and it just tastes awful.  Also, the dining halls are not all open late enough in the evening."

I got to tour everywhere! Nothing I would of changed."
Alum,5,"Mayville State University really is the school of personal service. Every employee on campus is involved in each student's education as well as ensuring they are happy and comfortable outside of the classroom. It is in a remote area, but is close to both Grand Forks and Fargo when you're in need of a bigger scene."

Overall I believe that Mayville may be one of the safest campuses I have been to!"
College Sophomore,5,I believe that all dorms are very livable and nice.  I would just suggest that Freshman live in Aggasiz in order to meet people and make friends and higher class should be in Berg in order to have a quieter atmosphere and be able to study but also to keep friendships close.
Sophomore,4,Online learning with Mayville State is very easy to navigate and the professors were always willing to help by supplying contact information. It was very helpful throughout my learning experience.
Sophomore,4,"I think that Mayville deserves a 4/5 review because of many reasons. Mayville's classes are small, and the professors are always willing to help. The professors here are also very personal and try to push success for every student. Mayville also has great dorms to stay in. The only downside about going to school in Mayville is that there are not many places to go if you need something and not a lot of activities to do in the community. If you are looking for a small, affordable college, I highly recommend Mayville State."
Freshman,4,"I am a college freshman at Mayville State University, and I am loving school so far! The professors are so kind and helpful, and there are lots of different things to do on campus! It is small, but you can get to know so many people, and build great relationships with them!"

College Junior,4,From what I've seen campus life is very active from intramural to study sessions to bingo.

College Sophomore,4,"Drug safety at Mayville State isn't too big of a deal. There is a bit of marijuana use but the majority of the time everyone around here prefers to drink. With people taking care of each other and cutting someone off when they know their buddy has had enough to drink, it helps everyone have a safer night."

College Sophomore,4,All meals are edible.  I do think that they should mix up the options but overall I believe that they do well!

College Sophomore,4,the diversity on campus is off the chart. there are people from all over the world and has been a great experience getting to know different cultures.

College Freshman,4,Always Caring About My Future – All my teachers are really caring about how well I do in my classes so i can succeed in my future goals.
College Freshman,4,"A Fairly Diverse Campus – When i walk around Mayville state i notice it is fairly diverse, but most of the students are white or colored. There are not alot of students from the middle east though."
College Freshman,4,"They Are Very Good – They don't get a whole lot of people in trouble, really. They are fair and respectful to other people. They really are good with punishments."
College Freshman,4,It Was Decent – I never really had a problem with the food. I at off-campus a lot because of my schedule. They only thing I had trouble with were the dining hours. Sometimes my schedule wouldn't allow for the time that I am used to eating. That was a little inconvenient.
College Freshman,4,"It Really Is Not Bad at All – The parking around Mayville is usually open. The only place there may be any trouble would be the parking lots around the dorms. They do, however, always have spots open. It is also free."
College Freshman,4,"I Had an Easy Time – Getting financial aid was not as hard as I thought it was going to be. I stayed pretty organized, but the staff at Mayville State are also so helpful with things like this. They will talk you through any process that confuses you."
Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do here in Mayville besides go to class after that all you do is sit around. On weekends everyone goes home. Parties are sparse and cops tend to bust them.  Food here is the same basically every other week, and sports are okay most students attend them because there isn't anything else to do during the week if they are playing at home. I don't think I would recommend this school to anyone"
College Sophomore,2,"It's a town under 1500 people, but at about the half way point between both Fargo and Grand Forks, so we frequently go to either for some fun."
College Sophomore,2,"It is what it is. It's not a very good atmosphere for a college, but you still get the college feel. You learn to deal with it so it's not so bad in the end."
College Sophomore,2,"Only 1 fast food restaurant (Subway) so very limited on getting food quickly and easily. Other places are pretty good, but there are only a few. They're worth going to every now and then with some friends."
College Junior,2,I go to school in North Dakota so we have a lot of issues during the winter.
College Freshman,2,"It's North Dakota weather, it's never been the greatest."
College Freshman,2,"Academic wise, Mayville is strick and conserned that their students do well, but about drinking and other things they are not that strict about."
College Junior,2,"alot of out of state students, a large amont of football players in the male gender and a larger female to male ratio"
College Junior,2,"None Exsistant – most of the students go ""out"" for the nights. not a lot of students stay in the dorm and try to get people to have CLEAN fun."
College Freshman,2,"Not Much – There really isn't security on campus, not much goes bad here on campus. But the school provides one free visit to the clinic if you get sick, but the nurse is only on campus for a short amount of time a week."
College Freshman,2,"Not Much to See – Not much to do at all where the school is actually located, due to the fact the town is smaller than small. There is one stop light in the entire town. If you want interesting things to do, bring a car with you. The people are real laid back out here though, but the campus needs a little more ""color""."
College Freshman,2,Anything New? At the college here the food is the same thing every other week. There isn't much of an option which isn't really good when a person only has a meal plan. The food get's old fast but some of the times it is good.
College Sophomore,2,"More Space Needed – There is a need for more student and visitor parking, but the options for that are limited.  The campus sits right on the edge of the residential community, so there really isn't vacant space for construction."
College Sophomore,1,Subway at the local Cenex is probably your best bet
College Sophomore,1,"The caf is disgusting, besides their breakfast, and the snackbar is alright, but they only have two fryers and a small grill, so it takes a while"
College Sophomore,1,The only good looking girls her play on the volleyball team and they all end up dating a douche bag baseball player
College Senior,1,"People are really nice, butits suh a small town and theresnothing to do in town at all, except fora 2 bars to go chill at on the weekends"
College Freshman,1,"Same food over and over, its all you can eat but you see a lot of them food repeated week in and week out."
College Freshman,1,"Not many options, small community so no other choices but 2 restuarants"
College Freshman,1,Not much to do but go to the bar and if you're under 21 your left with nothing to do.
College Junior,1,it is a small small  local atmosphere and a small small town  to live in
College Junior,1,there is little to no nightlight at mayville state
College Freshman,1,"Same Old – The people on campus here are all alike. There are a few people that sticks out but most of the girls are hypocrites, and they are all mostly stuck up. They like to drink underage and the guys aren't much different. There are just more guys that don't follow the crowd."

Your future is just about to begin! Can't wait to see you their with me next year!"
Niche User,5,"I haven't had an online experience and haven't even started at Campbellsville yet, but can tell you that the school is the school of your dremas!"
Senior,5,I love my advisor and instructors at CU. Everyone is friendly. Almost all of my classes transferred from Ivy Tech community College. I did have to send in course substitution forms for some of my classes. I went straight into the social work classes.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Campbellsville so far has been one of the best experiences of my life. I love the campus life. It's more than I imagined it would be. When I first started I told myself that I would just maybe check it out for a year or so to see if I like it and if not then I would transfer somewhere else. Now that I'm here I don't think I'm going anywhere else, I can definitely see myself going here for my whole four years! There's nothing really that I would change about Campbellsville, it's the perfect place to be for me!"
Freshman,5,My online classes are pretty simple and straightforward. They were easy to understand and easy to get to online. The professors make sure that you understand what you're doing the whole way through. They always ask questions and encourage you to ask questions if you don't understand something. The professors also take you through the steps of an assignment until they know for sure that you understand the assignment. Sometimes resources are listed also that relate to the assignment that you can check out just in case you need more info to complete the assignment.
Sophomore,5,I take online classes. The professors and Dept. Heads work hand in hand to make sure the students understand and are able to be successful in their study courses. The online aspect is easy to navigate. They continually modify and update the sites to make it more understandable.
Sophomore,5,"Online experience with Campbellsville has been an extremely positive learning experience. I have always had someone walk me through the process. From a Student advisor to a professor or financial advisor; they have always answered any questions or pointed me in the direction of where I can find the answers. Studies are always available, accessible, printable, and posted when needed. Email alerts are given when assignments have been received and or graded."
Junior,5,I have taken many online classes here and all have went great. I take as many classes as possible each semester.
Freshman,5,I like the convenience of Campbellsville University. The learning is amazing and the professors are also amazing. I have a dual enrollment there and the learning opportunities are amazing.
Sophomore,5,This is an amazing college. I have great support from my teachers and since this is a smaller school no appointment is needed and everyone is always willing to help me with whatever I need.
Sophomore,5,"Campbellsville University has changed my life and is continuing to do so. I recently completed the medical assistant program and hope to start the RN program in the fall if I’m financially able. Campbellsville University has amazing teachers who really care about their students and it is also a Christian school, which is one of the things I love about my college."
Graduate Student,5,Campbellsville University provided me with all the tools necessary to have a successful academic career and gain significant knowledge that can be applied directly to my career field. The professors and staff at Campbellsville are unmatched; this is probably the aspect I liked most in my experience.

Graduate Student,5,Campbellsville University supported me throughout my masters program in a number of ways.. from the professors and coursework to the administrators.. I feel so ready to take on the opportunities ahead.
Senior,5,Campbellsville University is great for a degree in ministry. I have loved learning more about God and religion in general through the very educated professors and Christian staff. They genuinely care about their students too.
Alum,5,"I am Rajani, I did a master's in ITM at Campbellsville University. I get to learn interesting courses related to IT management. The academic curriculum is designed well with the team which makes students learn in a timely manner. The courses we have are IT systems security, Team Management, disaster recovery, Management Infomation systems, Current and Emerging Threats. My favorite course was disaster recovery and current and Emerging Threats."
Alum,5,"I loved getting a quality education in a private college that offered the opportunity to truly build relationships with professors and fellow students. The class sizes were intimate, so I didn’t just feel like a number."
Graduate Student,5,"CU was a great place to be. What it stood out the most was how they welcomed international students. Being a foreign student myself, I would have never thought I would have found such a place in the middle of KY."
Alum,5,"Great atmosphere, students, faculty members, local area, safety and knowledge. 
I had a great time at Campbellsville University and I wish I can go back there soon."
Junior,5,I love the opportunities offered for student involvement and the fact that everyone treats you like family. CU is more than just a school; it’s a community!
Freshman,5,"This University is a diverse, multicultural community that is willing to provide for my needs and treats me as a person and not just a statistic."
Freshman,5,"Campbellsville Univeristy is a small school, but the professors and other students truly make you feel at home."
Niche User,5,It’s a smaller college where you get to know people from all walks of life. You can develop close bonds with your professors and administrators. The college provides lots of academic help and lots of options for you to succeed. They are really dedicated to putting you in a position to succeed.
Alum,5,"Amazing, friendly and Christ-centered atmosphere. The teachers are devoted to educating their students and developing good leaders for the world. It encourages diversity and allows for different cultures to mingle with one another. CU provides multiple ways for students to get involved academically, socially, educationally, and religiously."
Alum,5,I like the fact that CU is a Christian school. I like how they have smaller classes. I like the fact that I know my teachers.
Freshman,5,"I'm in my first semester of Campbellsville University and I absolutely feel this is the college for me.  I love it here.  The school is not huge and the classrooms have a teachable amount of students in them.  I feel personally for me this is a blessing.  I'm held to a higher standard, I get one on one teaching if I need it and my professors share my love for Jesus.  This campus is beautiful and quiet.  I honestly feel at home while I'm away from my home.  The staff were all very helpful in helping me meet my educational and financial needs."
Sophomore,5,Classes are a perfect size. Great opportunities for getting connected. Teachers usually communicate well and are available and willing to meet and talk about anything. There is a great sense of personal connection.
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the people. I love that it’s ten minutes away from the lake. The people and the professors truly care about you and want to see you succeed. They make you feel as much as home as they can. They made the transition really easy from high school to college. The campus life is awesome. They’re always going something or hosting something. Athletics on campus is free admission and for athletes the trainers are awesome and they do a lot for you.
Sophomore,5,Campbellsville has been a place where I have been able to grow and learn. I've made several lifelong friends and discovered who I am. I have truly been blessed to be able to come to this university and become closer to God and transform into the person I am today. Campbellsville has truly showed me what the word family really means.
Alum,5,I loved Campbellsville University. It was a place where I felt accepted and loved and it allowed me to grow and flourish. Campbellsville University is filled with a loving and supportive faculty and staff that truly wants you to succeed. There are so many opportunities to get involved on campus and to travel the world.

Alum,5,"Campbellsville University is a great place to call home. The campus is beautiful, and their academic programs are top-notch. They have small class sizes and wonderful professors that ensure you receive the best education experience possible."
Junior,5,"Campbellsville university is a wonderful, small Baptist campus. Easy to get to know people, great athletics, wonderful professors, and activities all the time!"
Works Here,5,"It is a life-changing environment where spiritual growth and academic excellence are at the root. Life-long relationships were made on the first day as a CU student. The institution is continuing to break enrollment records, giving students a second-chance while equipping them with the tool to make a difference in the world today."
Alum,5,"I loved the size of Campbellsville University. The school is big enough that it offers great resources and ways to broaden your educational and personal horizon. But at the same time, it is small enough to where you actually get practical opportunities to put those skills to practice. This plays into the classroom as well. With a pretty awesome teacher-student ratio, my biggest class was maybe 30 people. The professors care and are willing to help."
Graduate Student,5,"I started school here in 2012. I was nervous, but quickly felt at home. The nerves went away within the first week. I knew I was exactly where I wanted and needed to be! I made lifelong friends there, and found my calling in social work (which I love!) I have also obtained my masters in Social Work through CU. CU will always hold a very special place in my heart 💜"
Alum,5,Campbellsville University is a beautiful campus with lots of student activities.  Plus it is Christian based!
Senior,5,"Campbellsville University is an amazing school. The professors are very knowledgeable on what they teach and they care about each and every student. The class sizes are large enough but also small enough so that if you need that extra help from a professor, it’s easy to get it. The campus is beautiful and they are always updating landscape. New buildings to accommodate the influx of new students are always being built, which shows how well the school is doing and growing."
Graduate Student,5,I love Campbellsville because of the community and the atmosphere of the campus. Everyone knows each other and is always there to help each other. It’s one big family to me and I’m blessed to attend this school.
Alum,5,"LOVED my experience at CU. I grew academically & spiritually. It is such a friendly atmosphere, and I really miss it!"
Senior,5,I love campbellsville and everything about it! There really isn’t much I would change except the dorm rules and the quality of the food in the cafeteria.
Alum,5,"I loved CU! I made tons of friends that I am still close with today. Going there prepared me for the career in nursing which I love so much, and allowed me to grow closer to the Lord."
Graduate Student,5,"Small university and kind people. better experience, as the classroom sizes are small. better relationship with teachers."
Alum,5,I had a wonderful experience at Campbellsville University. I earned my Masters in Social Work. I feel like it prepared me well. I passed the CSW exam the first time and have landed a job as a therapist.
Alum,5,"As an adult learner, I was so grateful for for the small campus feel and the one on one time with the professors and the staff. Without Campbellsville University, I wouldn't have been able to go back to school and complete the degrees that I always wanted. Thank you CU!"
Freshman,5,I like the smallness of the school. It creates a personal feel that I enjoy. Class sizes are small and allow you to connect with everyone. Diversity is very prevalent here. Which is very great. You get to meet people from everywhere and experience new things.
Alum,5,I love how Campbellsville felt like home to me. Never once did I regret my choice of college. I immediately became immersed in the community and family that Campbellsville has to offer
Freshman,5,"I love the religious aspect of Campbellsville University. They have thoroughly helped me grow in my faith. I also love the diversity around campus, there are students here from all over the world. Everyone is very kind and the professors are more than willing to help you with any issues you have in and out of the classroom."
Freshman,5,"Campbellsville University is a very Godly centered school. I have never heard a single complaint. The campus is just the right size, and the facility and staff are amazing. When showing interest in CU several people reached out to me and helped me step by sep to prepare for college. I cannot wait to be a full time tiger!"
Junior,5,Campbellsville University is an excellent school. There are many career choices that are offered here with amazing professors along the way. I have had many great experiences at this school and I definitely recommend people to choose this.
Graduate Student,5,The campus is always beautiful and the people are always friendly. It's very much a family atmosphere where everyone knows your name and the professors truly care.
Alum,5,"I gave Campbellsville University five stars because it has been a second home to me.  Once I got here, I never wanted to leave. 

After moving here in 2014 my freshman year, I haven't left. I stayed on campus every summer to work as a lifeguard and received free room and board along with 10 dollars an hour. As a college student without much work experience, it was a job offer of a lifetime.

After graduating in 2018, I was hired full time by the university. I have been provided with opportunity after opportunity from this institution and I owe a lot to it. Not only has Campbellsville University provided me with a first class education, but it has provided jobs (three, to be exact: two part time and now one full time), experience, friendships and a relationship that has turned into a marriage. As a student I was able to meet people from all over the world and gain knowledge and experience even outside of the classroom."
Works Here,5,I had a great experience at Campbellsville University as a student athlete and now as a employee at Campbellsville Unviersity!!
Graduate Student,5,Campbellsville University is a beautiful campus in the heart of Kentucky. The atmosphere is welcoming and the faculty/staff are phenomenal. 100% recommendation!
Junior,5,"I love the sense of community at this school. It feels like you can walk up to anyone, start up a conversation and quickly become friends. The chapel on campus is great and services are always inspiring. There are also lots of great events and concerts held there."
Alum,5,"I always imagined myself going to UK, but I wanted to play baseball in college. CU gave me that opportunity. I grew to love everything about CU! I wouldn’t trade my experience for anything!"
Freshman,5,So far the staff at Campbellsville University has been amazing. They have provided me with the guidance and support needed to pursue my goals
Graduate Student,5,Campbellsville is a diverse school that offers great opportunities for learning. I received my Bachelors of Science in Psychology here. The atmosphere was very conducive to learning and my teachers were awesome!
Niche User,5,"I will be attending Campbellsville University after I graduate and I have never been more excited for anything in my life. Campbellsville has the most beautiful campus and the kindness people you could ever meet. They will go above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and valued. The church is amazing, the food is amazing, the academics are amazing, there are job opportunities for anyone and everyone, overall it is one of the best colleges you could go to. Also, they are the 2nd easiest college to pay off student loans in Kentucky. 11/10 would recommend to not only start your future there , but to really connect with God there."
Freshman,5,"I love the online programs. it is a very nice college. the professors are nice, and the guidance counselors are very helpful."
Sophomore,5,I love how I can complete my degree 100% online.  I am able to have flexibility with my schedule of being a full time mom as well as having a full time job.  I have enjoyed my experiences with this college so far.
Senior,4,My only issue with their online classes are the voice threads due to how large the files are. They take over an hour to load with good internet. My instructors have been understanding and helpful in situations.
Junior,4,Great school with great professors and staff. Happy to be getting my degree there. Only thing is I went from receiving money for going to school to having to pay a lot from school in 2 years.
Freshman,4,I took history online and it was very easy to follow. The site that we had to take our classes on was a little bad and I had trouble using it. Other than that our professor was very nice and lenient.
Alum,4,"Campbellsville is wonderful. There are some things that are not fantastic, as with any other school, but overall it is a wonderful place to call home for 4 years. While I can’t speak for all departments, I know the business department is full of an amazing staff, for the most part, and is always willing to assist in any way possible. Life around campus is great and so are the people. The only thing is sometimes the cafeteria is not amazing, but you learn to work with it!"
Alum,4,"Excellent program for students who fit into the mold expected of students here. People who are ready and able to jump into an active campus life will find it an incredibly rewarding college experience, but students who don't conform to the archetype of a popular conservative student at a predominantly white institution may find it difficult to adapt to a campus that does little to welcome in those who are outside its target demographic. Excellent international program, good opportunities to travel for those who can afford it, fairly easy academic tasks and very helpful professors. Overall, a good experience."
Freshman,4,"Small classes
Pretty average food and dorms. There could be more dorm options for girls. 
I have had experience with amazing teachers and not so amazing teachers. 
The music school is fantastic"
Alum,4,I liked the small class sizes and the relationship I had with my professors. The enrollment process was very simple. I also liked that the school of Social Work so had many options when it came to real life experiences. I was able to attend many mission trips and also be involved within the community. The pinnng and graduation ceremony made me feel really special and accomplished.
Senior,4,"Overall, Campbellsville has a great and friendly environment with great staff that makes college life a lot easier. The campus is beautiful and there are always events going on. The diversity in the student body is truly what makes this campus so unique. There are some negative aspects on campus in terms of leaders in ministry but God is still moving in student lives daily."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed Campbellsville, their departments overall worked hard to help you in any way possible.  There are some disconnects between different departments which could greatly help smooth out a lot of students degree plans more easily, but overall it was good.  Of course there's always good and bad teachers but for the most part each teacher wanted you to succeed and you weren't just a number ever.  Small class sizes and friendly people."
Sophomore,4,I overall have had a great experience with Campbellsville University. I love how small the class sizes are and how personal the professors  are with each and every student. I also love the campus and how easy it is to navigate. We have also added an awesome to a Wellness Center and athletic building to the campus. would like to see more majors offered to students.
Junior,4,"The best thing about the university is the relationships you’ll develop. Whether it’s professors or other staff everyone there really cares about you and will be important contacts moving forward in life or academic career. They give great scholarships and it’s very adorable for a private school. The thing I like least is the town itself, it’s very secluded and small with little to do, shop, or go out to eat. The thing I would change would be resident life, the dorms aren’t good and there are so many pointless rules that sometimes get enforced and sometimes don’t. Also if you want to move off campus, they make it very hard to do so but when I finally did it saved me an insane amount of money. Student life tries to keep people involved but since it’s a small campus, there’s really not a whole lot going on besides class. A new wellness center was just built so now there’s at least a place for students to work out."
Alum,4,My husband and I met there 8 years ago as freshman. We loved the Christian atmosphere of CU and loved the small town feel.
Alum,4,"It’s a really good school! Small enough for teachers to invest into their students, but big enough where you don’t seem trapped! Good opportunities and good people!"
Senior,4,"Pretty much a home away from home. Good community, friendly teachers, good values. The location can be boring, but for people wanting to focus on academics, very peaceful and ideal. Overall, a good experience!"
Graduate Student,4,It is a good campus. Really safe and calm. You can be able to study with no distractions. If you are looking for a place where you can study with no distractions it is your place.
Alum,4,Campbellsville is very personal and if you want to succeed it is possible at this university! The school is very diverse and allows for you to make friends from all around the world!
Alum,4,"It was a really great school, and had wonderful classes that were small sized. The only thing that was a downside was  that some classes are only offered one time every other semester."
Freshman,4,I like how it feels like a family. I know If I have a problem I will have someone to go to. No matter what the problem is.
Senior,4,"I love the campus, people, staff and teachings of Campbellsville University! One thing that I wish would be better, would be parking."
Freshman,4,I love being surrounded with wholesome christian people and they are always willing to help me with anything I need.
Sophomore,4,"In the heart of Kentucky, Campbellsville University offers lots of diversity and culture while being in a small town. CU offers lots of help to provide you with the education that you deserve."
Senior,4,"The majority of professors I have had in class have been very helpful. The classes are small and I usually feel like I can go to my professor if I am struggling. The housing here isn't very good. Some of the dorms have had no water in the past. The dorms where I live aren't taken care of by the previous students who lived there. There's always marks, dents, and dirt on the walls and I've had lots of plumbing issues. I also don't agree with the visitation policies and wish they would make it less strict."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at Campbellsville. Had great relationships with my professors, the campus was gorgeous and was always kept clean. I studied business for undergrad and masters and thought the program was set up well and very rarely ran into professors I disliked. Campbellsville became a second home to me, I'll always be thankful for my time there."
Sophomore,4,There's alot of people from so many places  you meet all kinds of people. It's small enough to be able to make a friend group with a good variety. I would like to see more professor/ student bonding activities.
Sophomore,4,"Small community very welcoming community, and they make you feel like your part of a family. they are there when you really need them. They helped me get out of a very bad home situation and I own them my life. I have no idea what i would have done if I wasn't here at Campbellsville University. The teachers help you one on one and the campus security knows you personally always making sure you are safe and not having to deal with bad situations on your own. They have personally helped me on several situations. Helping me separate myself from my parents and become independent. They helped make me into who i am today. I now realize i have power and i can stand up for myself instead of letting others push me around and walk all over me."
Niche User,4,"This college offers the best professors and campus environment for commuters. Trying to balance work, family and college was a lot, but the professors listened to me and worked with me to help me best succeed at school."
Junior,4,I love Campbellsville University. I have had very few problems and they have all been solved in a timely manner.
Sophomore,4,Campbellsville University is a small school in a tiny town that demonstrates christian values.  The professors truly care about their students and wish the very best for them. Because of the University is small the class sizes rage from 15 students to 20 students in each class. At this university you are more than just a number. Students from all around the world come to study at this college. Looking around the campus you will see a very diverse crowd of people. Campbellsville is very adamant about keeping the students and community safe.
Sophomore,4,"I get a lot of financial aid so it's mostly paid for, but I swear they use most of our tuition money on landscaping. CONSTANT FLOWER PLANTING. I don't care about your perennials, Michael, just get us better dorms."
Freshman,4,"I love Campbellsville University. However, I played for the varsity volleyball team and did not like that. The coach is very demanding and not very friendly."
Sophomore,4,"I like that it offers online classes. The admission staff was helpful and courteous. I have been learning alot. Classes are easy to navigate through. The syllabus is provided for each class, keeping you informed of expectations."
Alum,4,"Like anywhere else, you'll find amazing people and not so amazing people. The college is in a tiny town so your experience is really dependent on finding those awesome people. I would like to see a few more options for late night entertainment so students are less likely to find trouble."
Junior,4,"Great faculty and students with great programs!  My only issue is that you are forced to attend certain events in order to earn ""chapel credits"" in order to graduate, where other schools don't require this; making it harder to graduate on time."
College Junior,4,My school offers great programs for all students.
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are a big part of this University. Everyone supports everyone, and tries to be involved as much as possible."
College Freshman,4,"We always have someone from professional schools coming to lecture, which gives us an opportunity to make connections earlier on."
College Freshman,4,"You can take pretty much any class you could ever imagine and the professors are pretty much all willing to help you at any time. The class size isn't the smallest or the biggest, so they know by you by first name."
College Freshman,4,We have pretty good teams all around. Basketball and Football games are definitely the favorites and everybody goes crazy when we win!
College Freshman,4,"There's opportunities everywhere and the professors are great! However, free time is not a thing and it can get very stressful. But I love being on a Christ-centered campus where people help each other out!"
College Junior,4,I love that there is always something going on at campus even though I'm online it looks like it would be great to live on campus plus I love the fact there is always a prayer chain going on
College Freshman,4,"Although I live in one of the older Villages I love my housemates, the rules are nice because they enforce cleanliness, and only having to share a bathroom and room with one other person is really great."
College Student,4,Music is my dream. It is awesome on this campus.
College Student,4,"I have not really heard of any sexual assaults, but preventative measures and help are available."
College Student,4,I love my school. My professors were awesome. I learned a lot in my classes. I am looking forward to learning more.
College Student,4,This school has a great reputation and I hope to honor that when I graduate.
College Student,4,My little room was great and close to my classes.
College Student,4,I never really think about the Greeks. They are not a big issue.
College Student,4,The games are great to go to. A stress relief. I hope to play in the band. It is awesome to listen to.
College Student,4,I love Campbellsville University and the atmosphere. Everyone is so friendly.
College Senior,4,I see diversity in the student population
College Senior,4,I enjoy the Theology department
College Senior,4,I have recommended the school to others.
College Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my relationship with the school. However, I think sine of the books we use are not user friendly."
College Sophomore,4,It has grown from a small college to a very awesome university.
College Sophomore,4,C.U. is a very good school. The professors go out of their easy to help students.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience at Campbellsville University has definitely been an unforgettable and very interesting. I've learned many things, not just academically speaking, but also socially speaking. I've learned that I am, indeed, not the center of the universe as my teenage self tended to believe. I've been humbled many times and I've learned how to actually ask for help. One of my favorite experiences, a very humbling one, was with the Church Outreach Team. I expected that we were going to a large church (500+ people); however, when we arrived, much to my surprise, I found that the church's congregation consisted of only about thirty people. They accepted us with open hearts and open minds, giving us a welcome befit of royalty even though they didn't have much to offer. It definitely made me appreciate what I have."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience of Campbellsville University has been outstanding. Freshman Orientation (LINC) was a great experience. Incoming freshman were provided with multiple dates to choose from in June or July that allowed them to come to campus to schedule classes, be able to stay the night on campus and meet other freshman, receive their student ID, and just learn what CU is all about. 

I'm playing Women's Soccer for Campbellsville this fall and the team and coaches have been very welcoming and straightforward with their expectations and guidelines. No other school has made me feel more comfortable and at home; that is what made my college choice easy."
College Sophomore,4,Wonderful campus views with endless opportunities all around.
College Junior,4,"I am participating in the Online Degree Program. The process to get the application turned in was quick and easy. I like that I can call or email my enrollment counselor whenever I have a question about the program or what I need to do next. I also have a tuition advisor that I can call or email with questions or concerns about filling out the FAFSA paperwork. I am currently enrolled in classes, and just waiting for them to begin."
College Freshman,4,Having starbucks on the campus makes me happy
Niche User,2,The instruction was good. Enrollment and billing was poorly run. It was like buying from a used car lot.
Niche User,2,"My experience was through online instruction. The instruction itself was of high quality. The business office provided misinformation at every stage. They were confused about the costs of their programs. In the midst of an ongoing discussion, the office referred a disputed tuition account to collections, adding around 30% to the already inflated bill. The office refused payment, communication, and even participation in their own grievance process. I can't imagine that that the on campus students are treated so poorly."
College Junior,2,we are in a dry county
College Sophomore,2,"The lower price dorms are very uncomfortable to be in, and hard to focus. The nice dorms are overpriced, and still difficult to have a decent study environment."
Recent Alumnus,2,The football and basketball teams are disappointing to watch compared to other schools in the area. School spirit is almost nonexistent; most students are probably annoyed at the amount of money our school spends to have these bad teams.
College Senior,2,"Small town, not really a lot of options. decent food though."
College Senior,2,They dont seem to care. Its all about rules and money.
College Junior,2,"There are very few choices for off-campus dining near my school. The restaurants that we do have are fast food and chain restaurants. There are very few that offer healthy choices and as far as late night options, you are left with McDonald's and nothing else."
College Freshman,2,There no clubs in the town. Also it is dry county and to get alcohol you have to drive about 20 minutes to the closest liquor store.
College Sophomore,2,There are not very many restaurants to choose from in Campbellsville but everything is pretty close and easy to get to.
College Sophomore,2,Campbellsville has a no alcohol tolerance and the fines are hefty. Taylor County (which is the county that Campbellsville is located in) is a dry county. There are no bars or clubs that I have seen and most of the students go home one the weekend or they go to different colleges/universities to party.
College Junior,2,"Financial aid took away some of my aid stating I had earned ""too much"" so I had to pay out of pocket. However, I know of athletes who receive residual checks. I don't think the financial aid is fair across the board. "
College Junior,2,"It rains pretty much every Sunday, Monday and Wednesday in Campbellsville. People with umbrellas take up the whole sidewalk. The blacktop around campus gets slick to walk on when wet. 
When it snows/ices the school's unofficial motto is, ""If Jesus can walk on water, so can you."" "
College Junior,2,"Facilities need some renovations. They serve their purpose, but they aren't competitive among the public universities. "
College Sophomore,2,"pros: get to be with friends 
pros: play basketball
pros: eat out
pros: shop

Cons: some of your friends may not have cash
cons: may not want to go off campus
Cons: scared to spend money
Cons: worried about their safety"
College Sophomore,2,fall and late spring it is very nice weather which allows people to go to the lake and hangout outside. During the winter it is nasty. It can get really cold with no snow at all. It rains a lot and weather can be very bipolar.
College Sophomore,2,The food isn't great for one thing though the café is relatively clean. The worst part is that they do not have many options for people like my friends that have special diets or vegetarian needs.
College Freshman,2,The wifi here on campus is absolutely horrible. This past week I couldn't even access the internet at all when I needed it.
College Sophomore,2,"Available but Not Easy – Their are plenty of apartments and houses for rent near Campbellsville University. However, the likelihood of moving off campus before becoming a senior is small. The offices are not willing to work with you, nor do the make the process smooth. There isn't a worry about finding one, there is a worry about being able to make the switch because of the rules and regulations Campbellsville upholds."
College Freshman,2,"2 Big Streets – Campbellsville basically has two big streets with every fast food restaurant, except a kfc, but you got a mcd , bk , taco bell , arbys and wendys. if you wanna dine really, which is as a college student often not the case, there are limited possibilities, we do not have any of the big chain places , like applebees , just a daltons steakhouse , rather limited..."
Graduate Student,1,"if you enrolled Masters course here and international student, BE AWARE OF LATE FEES. I paid $500 late fees here that before two months end of semester"
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek Life.
College Senior,1,"Bad professors, poor quality of education."
College Senior,1,"People are attacked on campus frequently, mostly abused by professors verbally and I wouldn't doubt they are also physically abusive as well.  Robert Gaddis is a person that taught at the school that has been verbally abusive to students, and made them afraid to go to class.  I have heard this from many students."
College Senior,1,"Didn't use, but facilities look bad"
College Senior,1,"A waste of time and money.  Poor school, lack of knowledge, discriminatory and highly unorganized."
College Senior,1,"The music professors at this institution are among the worst possible.  They are highly unmotivated to present a professional appearance, always making excuses of how busy they are and cannot adhere to grading deadlines or help when students ask for it.  They are unfair and discriminatory in their grading and treatment of students.  They have one professor, Robert Gaddis who actually participated in harassment of students and nothing was ever done.  This is by far the WORST music program you could ever attend."
Recent Alumnus,1,"This town is considered moist, which means alcohol can only be purchased with food at restaurants. There are no bars, clubs, or liquor stores. The closest nightlife is an hour drive."
Recent Alumnus,1,There are very few parties; most people leave town to go to parties.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The academic quality of the school is deplorable. I had to invest very little effort to achieve an A in any class. I assumed that the cost of the school meant that the academic rigor would be high; wow, was I let down. This school is a classic example of a degree mill."
Recent Alumnus,1,I have seen a lot of other college dorms when visiting friends and Campbellsville University has the worst for the price that I have ever been in.
College Senior,1,Dont expect a crazy good time. The campus security come and shut down off campus parties.
College Sophomore,1,There is no nightlife at Campbellsville.. unfortunately girls are not allowed in dorms so they restrict us from even hanging out. Everything in the city closes at 10 oclock.
College Sophomore,1,They need more healthy food and fruits. I have gotten sick several times from eating their food. However they do give you chick fila money at the start of the semester. My advice is try to save it until later in the semester when you grow tired of chick fila
College Sophomore,1,The campus is very strict on having the opposite sex in dorms. This really does affect the social life on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"The community dorms are out dated, and feel crowded.  The school says that they cannot even make major changes to the older buildings because then they would have to spend more money to update things to the fire code.  There are no sprinklers, and no fire walls so students have no access to stoves and ovens.  Strangely even with the lack of fire walls the RDs are still allowed access to cooking appliances.  The bathrooms in the center hallways lack very much privacy.  The two shower stalls face each other with only the shower curtains and a small space with two chairs between them.  My dorm room door has been on a list since early fall to be fixed, but it is February and it still remains broken.  Despite the fact that tuition is expensive, the community college 45 minutes away has better conveniences like vending machines that serve hot beverages and I believe soup.  The vending machine in my dorm building only serves cheap things for expensive prices.  The laundry situation is also horrible.  We only have 6 washers and 6 dryers and today 1 washer and 2 dryers were broken.  We're one of the biggest dorms on campus yet we all have to share these few appliances and I don't think I've ever seen them all working.  Paying $1.25 for drying really sucks when the dryer breaks half way through drying your clothes."
College Freshman,1,Very strict.  It's like high school all over. No freedom at all. The villages has a little more freedom.
College Sophomore,1,"No Trans. There is absolutely no public transportation in Campbellsville. So, students must have a vehicle to take them wherever they need to go. Or they have to walk or ride bicycles."
College Sophomore,1,"Campbellsville, KY is the center of Kentucky. But it doesn't offer much in local attractions, shopping, or activities. The community doesn't welcome foreign exchange students easily. There is Green River Lake here, which is a great place to fish."
College Freshman,1,"Choose Carefully – I would not choose this school again. Many of the students and faculty here are very judgmental, exclusive, and think poorly of you if you do something ""out-of-the-ordinary."" The town offers nothing except a Wal-mart, some fast food restaurants, and a lake. There are very few active clubs/organizations on campus. The student population is very small- only about 3000. I cannot wait to transfer to a different school in a city this fall."

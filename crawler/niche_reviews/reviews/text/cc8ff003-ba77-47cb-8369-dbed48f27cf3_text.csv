Freshman,5,"Everyone is super helpful and friendly online platform is easy to use and follow. Financial aid office does a wonderful job knowing what forms
You need to fill out and what is still missing. Student advisors are well informed with what classes are needed and which ones are not."
Freshman,5,"My professors are providing a great learning environment by the utilization of multiple educational tools. Students have access to textbooks, online visualizations, and other resources the professor informs us to use. I enjoy the online learning experience because I get to learn the way that is most comfortable for me, and also have an instructor that makes sure I am getting the most out of my time learning the given information."
Freshman,5,I have recently transferred to St. Johns River State College and they have made the transition easy. The school is beautiful and clean. They offer a great variety of classes. My favorite part about this college are the student activities! The effort and planning they put in to their functions is awesome. It really makes me feel connected to the school and my peers.
Niche User,5,"The professors usually are very clear and concise, they ensure you understand the material, and the campus experience is easy to navigate."
Niche User,5,The online classes have allowed me to take classes while also finishing high school and working. The professors have been responsive through email and have held office hours for me through zoom.

Graduate Student,5,"The online portion to this college was completely through canvas and was easy to follow along with. Overall, an amazing learning experience!"
Graduate Student,5,"I attended St. Johns River State College immediately after graduating from high school in 2018. i just recently graduated with my AA degree and have transferred to the University of North Florida. Overall, St. Johns River State College gave me an amazing experience. As someone who was not fully understanding of what needed to be done in college the faculty, staff, and advisors guided me the entire way through it. I am very pleased to say that I have attended this college and it has put me on the path to bigger and better things... without breaking the bank too!"
Alum,5,I really enjoyed the online classes at this school. You can do your work whenever you please and are not rushed. The professors do online classes often so they are already familiar with the online platform and most students are too.
Sophomore,5,"I love the teachers, advisors, students and staffing. They are very caring and show you that they are there for you. They make you feel so motivated just by helping you help yourself. If its overwhelming they know how to talk to you and even get you help. Tutoring is very helpful. I would change some teachers in a way cause some seem they are just there for a check but majority of the teachers you can tell love what they do and they care about the students."
Sophomore,5,"It can be veey hard but when you reach out to your teachers they respond and they extend homework dates, offer extra credit or if you are confused they will let you call them or zoom."
Niche User,5,"Thus far I haven't started classes, but I will int he Fall. I graduated from UCF with my BA in Sociology and I am now returning to SJR to complete an EPI program to earn my permanent teaching certification. The program is 1/3 the cost of other similar programs that I researched, and as it is online, it is extremely flexible for adult students who work while attending classes. I have been in touch with the head of the program for a couple months and she is a fantastic wealth of knowledge. She has been extremely helpful with answering questions and helping me to achieve my goal to make a positive impact on the young minds in our community! :)"
Niche User,5,I am planning to take classes online in the Fall and I hear wonderful things about the school's programs!
Freshman,5,"I personally am not much of an online student, but I have taken a couple of online classes. The online classes were very easy to use and the professors work with you if you have trouble. But it is also a great learning experience."
Sophomore,5,"So far my experience at college has been a positive experience. All of my teachers have been very helpful and very understanding if I had a problem on anything. St. Johns River State College is definitely a great place to start your career.
-Ocean Rynn"
Sophomore,5,Great! I have absolutely loved St. Johnâ€™s. I love how small it is but there is still sports so you kind of still get that big school feel. The staff are amazing. It is a very clean place.
Sophomore,5,"Its very small, but i really like it. The campus is somewhat clean, The viking center is awesome! they have pool, ping pong, and a few other games. They also have a cafe called the lunch box and its very good and inexpensive. Some of the professors are very good at teaching, and very understanding. My favorite professor has been professor Savage. Before signing up for classes you should go on rate my professor and look at their reviews. I really enjoyed my two years at st johns. Oh and the library is amazing!"

Freshman,5,"I started a club there, and I've never regretted it since. I've made some of the bestest friends of my life here."

Freshman,5,"Everyone is very helpful especially when trying to figure out how to work around my busy day to day life, they went above and beyond to help me figure out how to make my dream career become a reality.  Plus the school has three locations which makes it easy to take classes close to home and close to work!"
Junior,5,I love this college. The professors are professional and want to see you succeed in the program. This college as a whole really values their students. They provided me with a ton of information to help me afford college.
Sophomore,5,I've been going to Saint Johns the Orange Park campus and I've always had a great experience there. The professors and advisers  are extremely helpful when you go to see them.
Freshman,5,I highly recommend this college to all. Especially if you are local to the school. I do not have to drive 1 hour round trip to get to the next closest school. The employees are nice and patient. Always trying to make sure you are all set up to start classes by deadline.
Sophomore,5,I love the small classes and that there is always security on campus. Small classes make for more teacher to one student time and that is necessary for success. The professors are compassionate about their work and students. There is always some construction going on at the campus and that always made things loud and a mess.
Sophomore,5,I was able to complete two degrees in two years at St Johns River State College & Florida School of the Arts. They supply as much scholarships as possible & the academics was both challenging and easy comprehension.

Freshman,5,St. Johns River State College is an amazing college if you want less stress. The teachers are amazing at helping you understand the subject because the classes are smaller.
Freshman,5,Community College is a great way to go to save money. They are very good about transferring students and have a good set of teacher. They know you have a lift out of school so it's a great flexible school.
Sophomore,5,"Teachers are very helpful and willing to work with you. Very good class sizes so the teacher gets to know each student. Friendly admissions office, and very guiding. Classes are straight forward and everything is clear in the syllabus. I just wish there were more campus events because there is only a couple. Affordable, especially if you qualify for financial aid and a good start to college before transferring.  I recommend getting your Associates Degree here and then either entering one of their programs or transfer to a University. There are three campuses and I currently attend the St. Augustine campus."
Sophomore,5,"St. Johns River State College is a great school! I am a dual enrollment high school student and they are so accommodating and welcoming to new people. All of the clubs are very interesting and the professors are very knowledgeable about their respective subjects. The professors are also very good about answering questions in and outside of the classroom and are willing to help you to understand things. This is an amazing college; if they offered the major I wanted for my Bachelor's, I would definitely stay."
Sophomore,5,St. Johns River State College is awesome. It is a community college and the students and staff are all incredibly accepting. The professors are all incredible and strive to help us achieve our goals in any way they can. Overall I had a fantastic experience in my two years there!
Niche User,5,"I attended St. Johns River State College through my high school's dual enrollment program. I had the ability to take four college level classes including comp 1, comp 2, college algebra, and human nutrition. SJR provides many student resources, including extra office hours for classroom and other types of aid. Their website is very informative with links to contact administration, office hours, locations, and student research portals. The online service provided at SJR is a very organized and easy to follow system."
Sophomore,5,"I was a student at another institution before I switched to this one and I have to say that I truly love this school more. If I could go back and start all over I would much rather have started working on a degree at this school. The faculty and students are extremely friendly and informative, I would highly recommend this school to anyone attending college."
Niche User,5,Saint Johns River State College is a really good school. They have dual enrollment for high school students and they have a huge selection of programs for students to chose from. They are very helpful when you need help with financial aid or anything else school related that you may have any questions about.
Freshman,5,"St. Johns River is by far the best college I have ever been too. The campus sits right on a nature filled lake which makes the atmosphere so relaxing and peaceful. The students and staff are always very friendly and are always willing to help out. I had the choice to start here and switch to a University but I actually chose to stay with SJR just because I love the college so much.  I really recommend anyone who attends or would like to attend college to check SJR out, it is truly an amazing school."
Sophomore,5,Iâ€™ve attend this college since my senior year of high school. The campus staff is willing to help students reach their career goals. Provides all the help and sources we need. Free tutoring for people who struggling and provides computers to people who canâ€™t afford them at home. They make it every way possible to helps students with their problems.
Junior,5,I transferred from another local college to be closer to home for nursing school and I am so glad I did. The schedule options were flexible for prerequisites and the advisors are great for academics and financial aid.
Sophomore,5,"SJR has three different campuses with different campuses. I go to the St. Augustine campus. It's very lively there and the environment feels safe. My education is a fair price at SJR, making it easier to pay for classes. There is also a transferring program that can get you guaranteed into UNF if ever planning to go there."
Niche User,5,"Great college, I feel welcome here. Its my first time on college and I was feeling like a duck out of the pond, the staff help you go thru all the process. They want us the student to be successful."
Sophomore,5,Over the years I have seen St. Johns grow with the town. I remember 8 years ago it was a stepping stone for students. Now they are staying in the local area and earning degrees. Every time I need to call the school or have any questions the staff is always there to help and actually enjoy helping their students.
Sophomore,5,St. John's is a great school. The professors are always  willing to help both during class and their office hours. The tuition isn't that expensive if you qualify for financial aid or have other scholarships.
Freshman,5,St. Johns River State college is very organized and so very helpful in anything that you may need. They offer such an interested staff to walk you through the steps to get you where you want to be.
Freshman,5,St. John's River State College was the first stepping stone in my path of life. St. John's River State College has made transitioning from high school to college a breeze. Faculty works diligently to solve all issues and help students out in every way possible.
Sophomore,5,"Extremely affordable, and I don't think I'm missing out on any information I would have gotten from a 4-year university!
Staff and teachers are helpful and welcoming.  I haven't had one bad experience from a professor or student.
Cafeteria has a good tasting small little restaurant.
There's a plenty of places inside outside to study all over campus.
There's also a free tutor lab, and you get around 200 free pages that you can print for class."
Freshman,5,"I'm currently enrolled and I overall just love everything about St.johns, from the professors to just the campus, the counselors, etc. Amazing school!"
Sophomore,5,"St. John's River State college is an institution that truly cares about the success of its students. Whether attending college for the first time, transferring, or going back to continue education, I would definitely recommend this school to others."
Freshman,5,"So far, Math, English, Business and Tutoring educators have been great!
This college gives students every opportunity to succeed with many tools available both online and within their 4 walls. 
The campus is beautiful.  Covered access from building to building.  Beautifully landscaped to include a boardwalk over a lake with sitting areas to meditate while watching the fish or turtles.
The food in their cafe is reasonably priced and of great quality.  They call their customers by name when greeting them.  The student area has a pool table, pingpong table, gaming room with big screen t.v.'s and is next to the bookstore and security office. The library is substantial and includes sound proof rooms for study groups.  A separate area next to the library has several computers available to students and with enrollment gives 200 free pages of copy.  Love this college!"
Graduate Student,5,I attended St. John's State College starting in 2011 as a dual enrollment student. I graduated in 2015 with my associate in arts degree. I throughly enjoyed my time at SJR State and plan on returning in 2018 for their ASN-RN program.
Junior,5,I really love the small classroom sizes at St. Johns River.  You are able to develop relationships with the professors and you can get more one on one attention.  I wish the college would offer more bachelors degrees.
Freshman,5,"I like that the staff is very focused on helping the students achieve their goals.  I wouldn't change a thing about this school, i was satisfied with my experience"

Junior,5,"I have been going to St. Johns River State College since 2010 and I have really enjoyed myself. As of right now I am currently in my bachelor's program for Organization Management (supervision management). Me being here, I have met some amazing people and made some great friends. The professors here are great. My personal favorite professor here would be Dr. Savage. Dr. Savage was my Humanities professor. He taught the class about life situations and incorporated it with the humanity lesson."
Freshman,5,"I have been enrolled st saint johns for two semesters now and I have had the privilege to study under actual doctors for my anatomy and physiology class, and a published author for ENC1101. What I mainly appreciate about Saint Johns however, is that on the first week of the semester, proctors are placed throughout the campus to answer any questions, or simply point you to your class. Another great opportunity that Saint Johns offers its students allowing the Blood bus to come for donations."
Sophomore,5,"I studied at St. Johns River State College, and I absolutely loved it. The people are great and the professors really cared about my education and seeing that I succeeded."
Freshman,5,Very small and nice teachers. I recommend for anyone who's looking to do two years at a small school then transfer. They directly connect to UNF so that's nice.
Sophomore,5,I am earning my Associate's Degree at SJR State. It has been an amazing experience so far. The teachers are very professional and knowledgeable. 
Recent Alumnus,5,No frustrating instances. So easily to start classes and find out about your credits.
Freshman,4,Due to covid 19 saint Johns river state college is an online platform and may offer a few hybrid classes. Although this is a new form of teaching the professors have done a wonderful job switching to online and has kept the open line of communication with the students they are quick to respond and very helpful.
Niche User,4,"It was a bit more difficult but still fairly easy, the professers tried their best to keep the material easy to understand and they were willing to help in any way they could."
Niche User,4,This college participates in the dual enrollment program with my high school.  I was able to take a few classes at my high school and then felt ready to continue the dual enrollment with online classes into my senior year.
Sophomore,4,I was recently accepted.  Cannot speak yet on the overall experience. I am excited and looking forward to the experience.
Sophomore,4,I am newly enrolled. I have not had any online learning experience. I am looking forward to the experience.
Sophomore,4,The teachers are good about handling lectures online and making sure you have the things you need to succeed in the class. It is very learn at your own pace and there is an opportunity to get ahead and finish early.
Sophomore,4,"So far, the experience has been easy and fair. I have been in touch with many departments and service has been exceptionally quick with all areas. I have no concerns or questions about how to proceed and feel very supported by the institution."
Senior,4,St. Johns has kind professors and solid curriculum.  I was able to complete my AA and feel prepared to transfer to a university.  There are online options and the campus is clean and safe.
Senior,4,"I would love to see a bit more cohesiveness in the science department.  I had some awesome professors and then some that were much less engaging or involved.  Overall,  great state college and area.  Administration is organized and super helpful."
Freshman,4,"A few complications every now and then, but nothing that could not be fixed. I have learned a ton in only a year at this college and I plan on doing the four-year nursing program. Overall this is a great college for anyone trying to get a cheaper college degree while also doing a part-time job."
Sophomore,4,Although it wasnâ€™t like taking classes on campus switching to the online environment wasnâ€™t as bad as I could have expected. The only thing that made me upset is that many of us donâ€™t have Wi-Fi access. This made it very difficult for class.
Sophomore,4,The campus was nice. I attended the orange park campus and found it to be pretty clean and easy to find a spot to study or do homework. My commute wasnt bad but parking could've been better. Would recommend attending.
Freshman,4,"It is a great school overall, I would just prefer to go to a bigger school that offers more opportunities with extracurricular activities."
Junior,4,"I like the small class sizes. I they have accredited programs that are affordable , as a young college student. I cant afford to go to a big university but because of colleges like St. Johnâ€™s River State I am able to better my life and get a degree."
Niche User,4,I had amazing teachers while being there for my dual enrollment classes and helped me with anything I needed.
Sophomore,4,The college is great itself but knowing the details that are required are difficult to come by. Maxed out my financial aid without realizing it because I was taking classes for my backup degree.
Freshman,4,Its been hard for me but itâ€™s a very good and nice school. The professors and staff are extremely nice and easy to talk to.
Niche User,4,My experience at St johns has been pretty good so far the professors are wanting you to success and do everything they can to help you if you ask.
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at St.Johns River State College and I would defiantly recommend this community college to any student. to begin the staff are very kind and remember your name. Most teachers are happy to be there and will go the extra mile to ensure their students are doing well.  The campus is fairly small but cozy. the library provides students with private study rooms as well as free tutoring for anyone who needs it, not only that but upon enroll you automatically get 200 free copies."
Sophomore,4,"SJR State offers students an affordable, accredited, state college.  The class selection is quite satisfactory and the professors, at least the one's I have encountered, are amazing!"
Sophomore,4,"This school is great, especially for underprivileged people. The classes are small and quiet. Every staff member there is there to help you. You get the same level of education here as you would at any other college or university."
Sophomore,4,It's smaller than a university so there is not swarms of people at every turn. If you would like a smaller class room and have opportunities to have a closer relationship with your professor and get outside class help from them this is most definitely the place to go.
Freshman,4,"St.Johns River State College is very welcoming to new people. It provides students the opportunity to succeed. The website is very easy to use, however, I have had some trouble with their databases in the past. All of the professors are knowledgeable about their subject. So far, I've had a good experience while attending this college."
Freshman,4,"Haven't started classes yet but the admissions counselor was not very helpful, all I got from her was what courses I ""couldn't take"" instead of giving me insight into what to take."
Sophomore,4,"Overall great school. It just recently became a state college so they do offer 4 year degrees. In my opinion a school like this is good for getting a two year A.A degree. So for the purpose of getting a two year degree, SJR is a great school for that purpose. You also save loads of money!"
Sophomore,4,"St. Johns River State College is a great school to get your foot in the door for college. If you are looking to transfer to a bigger university, St. Johns is a great place to get your prerequisites."
Sophomore,4,"Great community college. Class sizes are small s professors are more involved in helping students. Tutoring for any class is completely free here. Tuition is very inexpensive. Campuses are expanding quickly. Snack Shack is very overpriced. There are three sports here, baseball, volleyball, and softball. Campus security is very tight comparatively to the population size of the campus."
Sophomore,4,"Great professors! Student Services can be backed up during peak processing times, but everyone is super helpful. The only place to get food is at the SnackShop, which is overall decent, if not a little overpriced. I've had an amazing time so far at the college! I would definitely recommend using ratemyprofessor when selecting professors. So far, my professors have matched the reviews on there, and it's been a wonderful experience."
Niche User,4,"The professors are very helpful and knowledgable. Class sizes are small and personal, and many teachers offer a variety of assignments to make sure that their students have the best opportunity to succeed in the class. The campus is small but nice and quiet!"
Freshman,4,"Through it all, this college provides academic advancement as the years go on. I love seeing the changes of various majors and degree types that weren't there 10 years ago. All and all, it is a great college for the price and it has a bunch of potential."
Freshman,4,"St. Johns is a place where you feel welcome by everyone. The teachers are involved in your educational well-being, whether you are a past or present student of theirs. The events the school has really brings a sense of community and homey-ness."
Sophomore,4,Sjr has helped me a lot with reaching my goal of achieving my AA. They have been helpful with signing up for classes but some of the professors have not been the best. If I had better professors i would have enjoyed more. The office is also not that great at helping students.
Alum,4,My time at St John River State College was overall a pleasant experience. I loved the small class size as it allowed for better class participation and one on one access to the instructor. What I'd like to see change is more student activities for those attending classes in the evening.
Sophomore,4,"Very helpful. Offer online and on campus classes. Teachers are helpful. Could use a little more variety of classes and times. Could also use more programs, or availability of courses."
Junior,4,"St. John's River State College has good professors, helpful staff, small class sizes, and a beautiful campus."
Sophomore,4,"While my time at St Johns has been short, I believe it is a good school.  This school provides the opportunity for students to attend from  several counties, with campuses in Palatka, St Augustine, and Orange Park.  Additionally some four year degrees are available.  Many of the professors are knowledgeable and helpful.  I would love to see the Palatka Campus grow into even more.  The potential is there.  St Johns River State College should grasp onto the doors and open opportunities to expand the degrees available.  Many of the youth in our community leave the area due to seeking degrees that are not available at SJRState.  This college is a great starting place and I hope they continue to expand.  Show the students that you too are willing to conceive, believe, and achieve."
Sophomore,4,Great small town feel.  Low cost way to earn your AA. Lots of online options. Friendly staff who are knowledgeable and helpful.
Alum,4,"It was all around a good experience. Most of the teachers where attentive, and the campus was small but serene."
Freshman,4,Saint Johns is a great institution with professors and staff that aim to help you succeed! It has been a great stepping stone for me before I go to a larger university and I will cherish the memories I have made here forever! Go Vikings!
Junior,4,"Overall it has been a good experience at SJR State. There have been 1 or 2 teachers that really had no business at a community college, but otherwise the instructors are very knowledgeable and relate well to the students."
Sophomore,4,"Saint John's River State College (SJRC) is a fantastic institution. From the one semester I have attended SJRC I can see the huge impact it has had on the community. My courses (although not always racially diverse) offer perspective from parents, wounded vets, high school students, and many full-time students who are also employed full time. The vivacity of youth mixed with the experience of age creates truly unique conversations. Generally speaking, the professors are fantastic. They all care deeply about their subject matter and about the success of their students (I know firsthand). The only downside besides lack of diversity is the student life.  Student social life is fairly limited, there are only about half a dozen clubs. To end it on a high note, the parking is AMAZING: there is ALWAYS a spot relatively close to every building."
Sophomore,4,"â€˜â€˜Tis college is a nice, clean a very educational, this college takes pride in there education and being the best it can be. It is affordable and very helpful. The only reason I gave a 4 star is because you have to talk to several people to resolve a issue may one occur"
Freshman,4,"I am attending SJRState as a Transfer Freshmen and an Active Duty military member. The experience I've had so far has out preformed my expectations. The staff, professors and even other students are amazing and helpful. Although I attend at the Orange Park campus, not main campus, the campus, student life and actives are still above par!"
Freshman,4,It's a college where it is super easy to get connected with others and enjoy the sun. The campus is nice and most of the professors I have encountered have been amazing and easy to talk to.
Niche User,4,I am enrolled for the fall and i have visited the college multiple times. There is no on campus housing though. And the college isnt all that big
College Sophomore,4,Nice small classes with very helpful professors
Recent Alumnus,4,"Saint Johns is a great choice the get your associates out of the way. I would definitely recommend it to an upcoming student. It is conveniently placed and class sizes are smaller, which leads to a more learning based environment. This college has a lot to offer for it's students. The tuition is also about 20% of the price of an average university."
Recent Alumnus,4,I  have only completed my pre-reqs for the Nursing program at my school. But the professors I've had helped me a lot and taught me new things that I will carry on throughout my journey of Nursing School.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have enjoyed my experience at St. Johns River State. The teachers I have selected throughout my 3 years of being here have been great! Also, being apart of the SGA club opened my eyes more about how beautiful our campus and school are."
College Senior,4,Most classes are offered on multiple days and times.
College Senior,4,Teachers provide plenty of time to submit assignments.
College Sophomore,4,the classes are small and the professors are understanding
College Sophomore,4,The faculty is nice and the classes are small enough for students right out of high school or adults taking the step to go back to school to not feel overwhelmed.
College Junior,4,I've had great success with online courses
College Junior,4,They provide career fairs and help with job searching
College Junior,4,All of my professors have been fantastic
College Junior,4,They give you a great education and help you on your way to a career
College Junior,4,I feel as if I'm always growing academically
College Sophomore,4,"Coming to school was a little difficult to me at first, but now I feel like I'm getting the hang of it. The experience at school as altered my view of myself and I'm learning new things about the world, as well as myself."
College Student,4,Well my first semester I took Comp 1 and i really enjoyed it. My class size was about 25 students and my professor was energetic and always ready to teach us grammer or what we read for homework.
Alum,2,Online was a little difficult for me. I'm a type of student that I need to be in a classroom setting. So it wasn't for me
Freshman,2,I am taking online classes and for the first month and a half of class my professor never communicated with anyone in the class and the assignments she put up were unclear
Freshman,2,Orientation was very unorganized and the faculty was not very helpful. I didn't feel as if I will be getting a worthy educational experience. But I will still remain positive and continue on seeing the bright side of this school.
College Senior,2,I think saying that I emailed state legislators and the Jacksonville city Fl mayor on enforcing college teacher conduct sums it up. The teachers make up their own rules and say whatever they feel and we sit there and take it. I'm just trying to get my AA and then run for the hills.
College Senior,2,I'm completely biased towards the south but it has small town community college written all over it. It was the best of two evils though. The Florida State College at Jacksonville Florida was worse. I can not wait to transfer up north away from the south.
College Senior,2,"Scheduling my courses around my work schedule was not an issue. I transferred to St. John's from Jacksonville University and the office did not include several of my credits and had to go back and put through my transfer credits that were missing. I was told last spring I had completed everything in order to receive my AA degree and it was shown on the degree audit that everything was complete; but they made a mistake and I had to take five additional courses to receive my AA degree. Once I applied for graduation, nearly two months early, the office did not put my application through and I had to submit a new one two months later, resulting in receiving my AA degree late."
College Freshman,2,some professors care and some dont
College Freshman,2,the help offered is hard to get to online
College Sophomore,2,"There is no alumni network and no job prospects for my school, non that I know of and the career center is very small."
College Sophomore,2,"As far as I know, there are no job/internship prospects and I do not think there are any alumni networks. I think there may be a career center on campus, but nothing that is noticable."
College Freshman,2,I dont hear any stories or knowledge of how to transfer from alumni.
College Senior,2,I tend to avoid campus resources because I have never found them to be that useful. 
College Senior,2,"I'm honestly not impressed with the time that I've spent at St. Johns River State College. The main reason that I chose to attend this school was because of its convenience. It is within a mile of my home and I'm supposedly saving money by completing my AA degree. I've encountered numerous problems over my year and a half of attendance and I cannot wait until I am finished and can be done with this school forever. The advisers are essentially useless and don't seem to make time for students when they really need, financial aid is possibly the most stressful thing I have ever experienced and I've encountered nothing but problems in that department and I personally do not feel like I'm saving any money as it's costing me roughly five thousand dollars a semester, totally 20 thousand dollars in two years. How does that save me money? I understand that school in general is expensive but I feel that if I were going to accumulate this much debt I would have rather done it at a 4 year institution and saved myself some frustration. "
College Senior,2,I have several new professors. One of which is entirely too young and immature to be teaching at this level. 
College Senior,2,"The computer set up is fairly average. There are a limited number of terminals, so get ready to wait in line, and it's nearly impossible to get signal with a wireless device throughout most of the campus. Best bet, take a laptop to the Mcdonalds down the street or go to a nearby public library. Server system also crashes occasionally, and printing is a nightmare."
College Junior,2,"I dont really like online classes as much as traditional classes. I have taken a few online due to work scheduling and raising my son, but I never feel like I Iearn as much I do in a classroom setting. I lie the more one on one with my professors and sometimes I need a little extra help which online classes do not offer."
College Junior,2,"I will start by saying that the campus itself is a beautiful campus. They keep it clean and beautiful with the pond in the middle and all the trees and plants outside. The school itself is a little outdated. The student canter is very small and the options for food are not so good. It is hard to find an open computer sometimes inthe library and half the timeit is so loud in there that I can not even concentrate. They offer some campus activities, but not that many. There are noathletic canters, but it would be niceif there was."
College Junior,2,My c is from my test I am a very bad test taker and over the years I am getting better .
College Freshman,2,"The orange park campus has no athletic center. The student center is nice, however better seating would help. I love the library and the school functions that we can partake in."
Recent Alumnus,2,Some of the professors are super difficult and others are easy. So I have mixed emotions about online classes.
Recent Alumnus,2,The counselors are very difficult to talk to. They just try to get you in and out as fast as possible.
College Sophomore,2,Never used the career center myself but I know many graduates still struggling to get a job. They say the school want helpful at all.
College Sophomore,2,"High School All Over Again? Currently, I am in my second year of schooling at this campus. To be honest, I am not exactly enjoying my time here. There is no student involvement, the others who attend school here currently are not exactly ""friendly"", and the teachers don't seem to be very informative."
College Sophomore,2,"I go to school to for an education and that is what SJRSC gives me. I would like a little more from my college experience but i'm perfectly fine just getting my degree. Overall, my experience has been boring but useful."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a student center, however, it is small and not fun at all. No athletic center at my campus. Campus activities are few and far between.the classrooms are very stock but the new science building is very nice. Facilities overall are adequate but I always leave campus whenever I can."
College Junior,2,Second Try â€“ I dont really like how financial aid is set up. They dont like to give people another try if they mess up. I had a really bad year one year that made my gpa fall. I have been working hard to bring it up but it is a couple of points away from a 2.0. I wanted them to still help me pay for school but they would not. But they do help a lot of other kids so I cant say they are all bad.
College Senior,2,"Un-Importaint Classes â€“ If we are not using spacific materal in our daily lives for our carrer choices why must we drag out our education to recive the training. I belive we should be trained in what field we wish to go only, and if we cose more then recive it."
College Freshman,2,Not Helpful â€“ The professors don't really put in the time to help you and they act annoyed sometimes when you ask questions. They have office hours but a few times I have went to one of my professors he was on the phone and totally ignored me.
College Student,2,"Glad I Am Older Going Through This â€“ I have been a business professional for over 15 years, and I must say how shocked I am at the lack of support at this school.  NO clear steps for the registration process I have only found 2 people ( at the palatka campus, I am going to the St. Augustine campus) at the school who actually got anything done and cared to assist. I can see how easy it is for the uneducated to get through the admissions process.  I found it sad that there is no clear directions for a person to follow to make sure that all items are done to insure proper enrollment."
College Junior,2,"Do Just Enough to Get by â€“ Mostly, my school consists of people who live with their parents and do not appreciate what they have. They do not try hard in school like I do personally. The people in my school do what they can to get by on their school work. Socially, it is a different story. Everyone spends a lot of time with friends!"
College Junior,2,"I can't say there is anything spectacular about the school. I would like to see some upgrades. The st. augustine campus has nice comfortable chairs, the palatka campus still has hard desks in most of the class rooms. The desks hurt my body and are uncomfortable. I was spoiled being at the st. augustine campus."
College Student,2,"Computers: Passwords & Wifi â€“ I understand that we need passwords so that we won't go over on a printing limit, but the students are consistently upset about how long it takes to fully be logged on because it wastes the time that most students at this school do not have, especially considering there are a fair amount of students that are fully loaded at 18 credits such as the Floarts majors and the nursing majors. The school also recently acquired Wifi. This would be fantastic except that it reloads about every ten minutes so that it is very hard to do things on your laptop without stopping to have to type in a password at least 4 times."
College Senior,2,Wireless Access â€“ It can be very slow and difficult to get on. Sometimes I can't even get access to the internet.
College Freshman,2,"So far it's been alright. I've had to drop a class because one of the teachers insisted I should already know the material when all I was asking for was help and this continued for a few weeks, finally I had to change teachers. The one I have now is great! This was math by the way. If there wasn't a distance problem I would have liked to go to St. Augustine, I've heard from other students that the teachers there are much more willing to help out."
College Junior,2,It's Okay â€“ The financial aid office is very helpful. I came in with questions and have walked out with answers. The tuition I'm paying is also worth the value of education I'm getting. It's cheaper at this college than at a university. It gets frustrating when you receive your left over financial aid after aid is due.
College Senior,2,"THINK BEFORE YOU ATTEND â€“ Counselors are not too helpful. Get with the students to see what teachers to take. Classes are not offered like listed. It's buyer beware. Online homework is substitution for teaching. Tutors are available, but not always competent."
College Student,2,The blackboard program crashed a lot this semester and was confusing to use. Students are better off taking classes with an actual teacher. Online classes are hard.
College Student,2,"Duel Enrollment â€“ This school is not very accommodating when it comes to scheduling. There are no classes available on the weekends and the teachers that have been hired recently are not amazing. Yes, it's nice that it became a state college but I can never see anyone wanting to be here for more than duel enrollment. There are no campus activities and limited amounts of sports."
College Sophomore,2,Nothing Special â€“ I'm sure the online class experience at SJR State is virtually identical to the same experience at any other school.
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like I don't get many options when faced with the financial aid department. The only thing they tell you to do is fill out the FAFSA application and then you are left on your own.  I have done some research on my own and found many opportunities to get money but because I don't know enough I don't know if I'm eligible.  The department doesn't, in my opinion, offer much in the way of options for aid."
College Student,1,whyyyyyyy do i have to keep doing this. is it even worth it now
College Student,1,if i have to type one more i swear im gonna lose it
College Student,1,this is so stupid that i have to keep typing stupid reviews
College Student,1,this is the worst review i have ever had. why do i have to type more than 50 words
College Student,1,i dont really care for the review so thats why i gave it 1 star
College Senior,1,"They have an easy transfer program with a university near by. As far as transferring to schools up north where I want to be, I will soon find out about it. There's no way to transfer my transcript from my own personal computer so I can't imagine this school making anything fast and easy."
College Senior,1,Sticks to the south side poor reputation.
College Senior,1,Nothing at this school has caught my eye. Hopefully the north east or west coast will be better.
College Senior,1,There really is not much going on. It is a basic-as-it-gets community school.
College Senior,1,Just trying to leave and transfer as soon as I can.
College Senior,1,"St.Johns is basically what you would expect out of a community college, a place where people go to class then go home. It is what it is. I am probably the only history major in this entire place."
College Senior,1,"The biggest problem that I've had with St. Johns other than financial aid is scheduling, I have a job and wanted to keep my classes to two days a week to maximize my availability at work. This is quite difficult because class times always seem to conflict, I feel that the school should offer a wider variety of class times to accommodate students schedules. Not everyone wants to or is able to spend 5 days a week in class. "
College Senior,1,"The financial  aid process at my school is extremely frustrating. The staff are not proactive about notify students when they have important information missing from their records and the office that deals with financial aid affairs is quite far from the campus I'm attending, which makes it more difficult to resolve issues when they arise. I've struggled with receiving my financial aid on time for now two years in a row. The staff of the financial aid office do not complete their reviews and verification in any sort of timely manner which puts more stress on the student. I'm hoping that moving on to a different school I will have a better experience with financial aid because as of right now it is a nightmare. "
College Freshman,1,"The student body is pretty small, for the most part students are just here to work."
College Sophomore,1,"At St. Johns River State College, everyone is extremely uninvolved. To be completely honest, it saddens me. I pay money for college so I can get an education. However, I also pay money so I can have a good college experience. I wish the ""student body"" were actually involved with my school so I could at least say that I had an amazing first two years of college."
College Sophomore,1,Unremarkable in Every Way â€“ There is literally nothing that sets this school apart.
Recent Alumnus,1,Not the Best â€“ They charge to print after so many pages which is rediculous. Every class I have attended (which is always 4 a semester) would have always went over if i did not have my own printer. We pay the school so they should not charge students to print. It is always good to have a computer of your own because the computers at the school are not always available. Wireless connection on separate devices is very hard since it logs off every five or so minutes. on some devices it won't even log into.
College Freshman,1,"A lot of my grades were only based on my tests, there weren't any extra homework or projects. Therefore, if you didn't do well on one test you could have ruined your whole grade."
College Senior,1,The financial aid office staff is very rude and hard to work with. The dates they are said to reimburse you are always off and they dont like to tell you anything unless you contiously call and ask questions
College Student,1,"Social Scene â€“ When I went here, I was a kid among adults. The average group of people who went here were 40 year old people and young adults who were negligent on going to college after high school. There is no school spirit. The only club I can think of at school is phi theta kappa that houses 10 members? Again, not a very good representation of college life."

Freshman,5,My online learning experience was very good. They stayed on top of us to keep up with our assignments and they were very helpful if we were struggling. Overall they were very accommodating and they did there best to help us succeed.
Freshman,5,Midway University has given me the best freshman year experience I could’ve asked for. Everyone was so kind and would help you if you needed help. Even the campus security was extremely helpful. All of my classes were small groups so I could get the 1v1 help that I needed to succeed. The teachers were extremely accommodating and would help figure out ways to help you if you were in a sport or if you were struggling. They really care for their students at midway university. All of the equine Professors would would have regular classes and then spilt us up into even smaller groups of around 10 people and would help us understand what they were teaching even more. Most labs were held within the barns getting to practice what we were learning on the horses which made it even easier to understand what we were being taught. Overall midway university feels like home to every students thy goes there and they will do everything in their power to make sure you are getting everything you need.
Sophomore,5,I took two classes online and while I love the face to face learning as it is easier to retain information midway makes learning online super easy and convenient the professors were very easy to communicate with and were able to grade the work in a timely manner. I even decided to go ahead and take an extra online course to get through some classes that offered it faster than I would had if I chose to do all of them face to face.
Freshman,5,The small size makes everyone feel like family. I came on a tennis scholarship and right away the coach takes care of his freshman.  I have been in contact with several team players and they have all been very personable.
Junior,5,"Midway is a great place to be. The staff is honestly amazing and so friendly, they are easy to talk to and they let that be known that we can come to them for anything. They are trustworthy and reliable sources. As of right now the only thing that I would want to see different is the food, just more diverse and health foods"
Sophomore,5,I like the ratio between professors and students as well as the relationships that are able to be created through the small class sizes.
Freshman,5,Everything within my process to Midway has been made incredibly easy and the staff is great to work with.
Senior,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful! It's small enough that walking across campus takes less than 10 minutes. All of my professors have been amazing, especially the nursing staff! Class sizes are usually around 20-30 depending on the room size. I have had no bad experiences here, so I definitely recommend Midway to anyone!"
Niche User,5,I loved midway when I went to visit last year it was a wonderful environment. would love to see more diversity.
Junior,5,I love all the opportunities the school offers. It is important to get involved. It’s nice going to a small size classroom and the teachers know you by name. There is free tutoring and the teachers are willing to help you. Everyone is friendly and there is some good diversity at this school. this school is very safe and cameras are everywhere for protection. Midway is a dry school so there is no parties aloud on campus. There is good views and you can wake up to the horses. The town is nice and small and there’s things that are not that far of a drive. There is a train track that the train comes through a couple times a day. The train doesn’t come at night so it won’t wake you up. There is temporpedict matricess so they are really nice.
Freshman,5,Midway is a small university that is invested in it's students.  Individualized attention is given to incoming freshmen - so you feel like an important student and just not a number attending in the fall.
Freshman,5,Midway is a very small campus and quiet campus. The college is placed in a very small town. This is a great college for anyone who wants a small college or is coming from a small town/school and would like the same feel.
Freshman,5,I like the communication that they have with incoming students. They had step by step on what I needed to do and still have to do. They make sure your ready & prepared and in a timely manner.
Freshman,5,"Midway College has been a perfect fit for myself. Midway is based in the center of an historic town. The setting of  Midway College is peaceful and they could help with relaxation when dealing with stressful studies. Midway is continuing to advance everyday. Midway is now co ed which can improve students way of being social. Yet, the college has a classroom size of 18-20 which allows students to have more interaction with the professor. The graduation rate is 56% and the sports are advancing, What could be better ?"
College Junior,5,Small school with challenging classes you can actually learn something in. I have had a good experience with admissions and getting scheduled for classes. Only downside is no financial help for transfer students.
College Freshman,5,I have never felt threatened on campus.
College Freshman,5,Your professors know you by name and will contact you if you miss class to make sure you are ok.
College Freshman,5,I am an equine major at my school. It is unique because my school is located on a horse farm and there is a barn right on campus. I can see it from my dorm. Being able to walk to the barns gives me and all other equine majors a lot of hands on experience.
College Freshman,5,"I come from a very small school, so being at Midway has not been a hard transition for me at all. Playing a sport made it difficult at times, but still very doable. Midway is a great school for academics and I more than often try to recruit people to come here, even though I have no role in admissions. 

One thing I would change at Midway is definitely the food and workout facilities. Both lack major basic fundamentals that a school should have."
College Sophomore,5,"Being at a women's college is a very special thing. I chose midway because of this, being here you don't really need to have your guard up too high because at the end of the day we're all sisters."
College Freshman,5,The staff is amazing!!. They make you feel like family. I would highly recommend this university.
Recent Alumnus,5,The financial aid dept is amazing. They make it easy and they get you just the amount of aid you need.
Recent Alumnus,5,"If you are a good student, you can get into the program. They have requirements like all programs and it requires work but it's worth it."
Recent Alumnus,5,It's a great school. It's smaller and everyone wants students to succeed.
College Sophomore,5,Never have I seen or heard of a problem of crime on campus. Our campus security is around 24/7 and the local police patrol once or twice a day. Our campus is in a small town community and nothing much ever happens. I've never even heard of someone's iPod being stolen.
College Junior,5,"there is mixed of different  races on campuese. the school have a  a wednesday where they do a different culutre in the lunch room, to get students to try adn learn about other races."
College Junior,5,lots of space to park and parking npass is resaonable  price
College Freshman,5,We have a great library and brand new computer labs. We have a large and nice cafeteria. There are plenty of campus activities and each dorm has a lobby with TV and different games. We also have a weight room and cardio room.
College Freshman,5,We really don't need trasportation anywhere because the town is so small. We only use transportation to student life activities and sports events. There are some students that live out of state and come in on planes that can be transported to and from the airport for a small fee.
College Junior,5,"Midway is a historic campus, as is beautiful. The teachers and staff are always there to help and are always friendly. I love my school."
College Senior,5,"The weather is normally nice.  Even if it rains or snows, the dorms and parking lots are extremely close to classes."
College Freshman,5,I am a nursing major and the academics are great. You don't have to take any classes that do not help you get closer to your goal. The classes may be challenging but it is all worth is because it makes you that much stronger and smarter.
College Freshman,5,Crime is almost non-existent and the town is beautiful. It is an old historic town that is on a scenic route. It is small and full of history.
College Junior,5,"Wonderful professors, great curriculum, easily accessed information"
College Junior,5,I attend the night classes.  There's no two people or two instructors alike.  Very diverse and interesting.
College Junior,5,I am able to get my entire degree online which is great because that way I can still work full time.
College Junior,5,"There are not a lot of restaurants in Midway. However, Lexington is only 20 - 25 minutes away and there is a ton of stuff there."
College Freshman,5,"Love It – Midway is the best place to go and study, it's quite and small. just the right size for me . I would recomend  Midway to any one that wants to be a vet and or a nurse GREAT PLACE!!!!"
College Freshman,5,"Waiting for This Heat Wave to Putter Out. Luckily Midway has a small, compact campus; otherwise, instead of writing this essay I would still be inhabiting a corner of their sidewalk as a puddle with a few papers and a book floating in it. I can't blame the school for the abnormally high temperatures this year, but I can thank them for keeping their quaint size."
College Junior,5,"Quick Response Times – The teachers are great, and they will always get back to you as soon as possible if you have a question.  The classes are usually really interesting and informative.  Registration can be a pain though, as the system doesn't recognize classes while your taking them."
Sophomore,4,"I love the close knit community feeling. Everyone there from the staff, to the students to the community care for each other like no bigger university ever could. the class sizes are very reasonable and you are able to get the experience with your professor that you wouldn't get if you where to go to a bigger university. Living on campus gave you interactions with people you wouldn't get had there been more housing options, the dining hall was filled with joy everyday as many students came in chatting with each other. Overall a smaller university is something I will recommend to anyone who is having a hard time choosing between colleges."
Freshman,4,"Very small campus that allows everyone to get to know each other and get a long. Feels like a home and everyone cares, especially the professors"
Niche User,4,"Midway is a go to college for small campus life while still gaining a strong education. A very homey environment, as well as teachers who care about you, both as a student and as a person. Small size classes equal personal help from teachers allowing you to make the most of your education at the palm of your hand."
Junior,4,"This past semester has been difficult for me in the personal aspect of my life. My grades were slipping but my professors and supportive staff were there to support me and help me be as successful as I could be. I like that at Midway I am known by name to my faculty and staff, and I don't have to wonder if they care about me and my progress. It's also good that everything on campus is within walking distance, especially the equine facility, which is rare. I would like to see Midway expand its art related programs and the scope of the equine studies program."
Freshman,4,"I visited Midway May of 2017 and fell in love with the campus and the atmosphere. I visited to see the volleyball coach since i will be playing ball there. Overall the campus is beautiful, its small which is what i like and everybody is very nice"
Senior,4,"The administration can be condescending to students and can be illogical in their expectations of students, especially under involvement. There are a few faculty and staff members that are priceless to the success of students during the academic study and post-graduation."
College Junior,4,I have loved this school and it's small class size. I am concerned for the future as I believe they have bitten off more than they can chew for this year.
College Junior,4,"One time, a girl OD'd on cocaine in her room.  She got kicked out.  People don't do hard drugs.  A few people smoke Marijuana but they keep it to themselves and don't bother anyone."
College Junior,4,"Campus is tiny and in a tiny town.  It's very safe.  Security isn't too sure about what they're doing most of the time, but they don't really need to be."
College Freshman,4,My advisor is very good at finding jobs and internships for an equine major. We get emails all the time about jobs and internships.
College Freshman,4,"Being on such a small campus, almost everyone is in at least one sport whether it be archery, one of the equestrian teams, or basketball. These aren't all of the sports but they are some of the most popular."
College Junior,4,"Workload becomes harder the more advanced the classes are, but this helps out in the long run when preparing for graduate school. Professors are qualified for their jobs and really care about the students learning and gaining an education."
College Junior,4,I have never felt threatened on campus.
College Junior,4,Teachers do a great job relaying the information.
College Junior,4,Get great letters of recommendation for future job
College Junior,4,Being an all girl's private college allows for the classes to be small. I love this aspect about it because it allows the teachers to help the students learn and understand more by having more one on one teaching.
College Freshman,4,"Midway is an amazing university and I hope to keep enjoying my experiences here. The professors are very helpful and respectful to all the students. Also, the small campus setting makes it easy to know most if not all the students on campus."
College Sophomore,4,The town of Midway is adorable and we're in close proximity to numerous other cities and towns.
College Sophomore,4,"Downtown Midway has a lot of great options for dining.  Midway is also very close to Versailles, Georgetown, Frankfort, and Lexington if you are looking for cheaper or more late night type options."
College Sophomore,4,"Most students recieved financial aid.  They are not great at their jobs, but they get it done."
College Junior,4,The teachers are very helpful and try to know each and every student.
College Junior,4,I am an athlete so I think highly of the athletics.
College Junior,4,I have everything that I need to be able to live like a normal college student.
College Sophomore,4,The town is very small and very quaint and cute. I love the atmosphere everybody is very close and even though there aren't huge chains you pretty much could find anything you need there.
College Sophomore,4,"The experience has been great. I feel as if I have learned a lot of things that I couldn't have learned at a different school. I know that this school was the one for me as I feel more at home there than anywhere else. I wouldn't choose a different school, I do wish that some faculty was changed due to there lack of knowledge but other than that it's been an amazing experience!"
College Senior,4,"All girl school during the day, commuter classes at night.  Very low key campus"
College Senior,4,I have not heard of any drug/alcohol activity on campus
College Senior,4,Accelerated classes with emphasis on success
College Senior,4,"There are very rare issues of anything that security has to be involved in during my experience
"
College Sophomore,4,"I know that some people drink and there was an incident last year, but I have never been asked to drink or do drugs with anyone here. It is a tobacco free campus as well. They are very strict with their drug policy."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is small but gorgeous. All the buildings surround a huge green lawn. There is an ampitheatre that people study on or sometimes teachers take you there for class. There are plenty of clubs and organizations. Advisors and teachers encourage and are very helpful with participation. There is always something going on or scheduled in newsletters and emails. Its impossible to be left out if you want to engage in activities.
College Freshman,4,Financial aid is willing to work with you. They want to help you get as much aid as possible so they do everything they can. I revived a decent amount i n scholarships and several of my friends have their whole tuition paid for through one or more scholarships from the school.
College Freshman,4,"Midway is a big equine college. One thing that helps set us apart is that most colleges who offer equine degrees don't have the equine facilities on campus. As an equine student I can walk out my dorm and walk 5 minutes across campus to get to the barns. Our newest barn is top-notch. We have a large indoor arena, severel offices and even a lab to hold classes in. The stalls are decent size and the staff is very knowledgeable.
Another perk about Midway is that they have an internship program. You are required to do three years worth of interning to graduate. As a result you build connections and when you graduate most girls have jobs lined up and waiting."
College Freshman,4,"We don't have a huge amount of diversity since we are so small, roughly 2,000 students total in online,day and night colleges, but for the size of our school we have alot of different people from different countries. It was really suprising to learn about how many different cultures were represented on such a small campus."
College Freshman,4,"We only have a few sports. We have basketball, soccor, tennis, and softball. Most of the students are athletes. Our school spirit is great but the sad part is that other than the parents, the students are the only audience and support the school teams have."
College Freshman,4,The wireless is sketchy at times but pretty good. Their are plenty of computers on campus at all times and they are newer model computers. We have printer access but it does cost to print per page. Thats the only thing bad and that I don't like when it comes to the technology part of the school.
College Junior,4,"Since Midway is an all girls school, you will find many types of women from all walks of life. Some are athletic, some are married, some are living on campus, some working through school, some supporting a family. You will find women from all walks of life on our campus."
College Junior,4,"Midway is a small historic town with not many places to chose from concerning food. The restaurants downtown are amazing places to eat. There is anything from Grey Goose to Heirloom to The Tavern. Any kind of food you are craving, Midway has it."
College Junior,4,"The facilitiess at Midway are beautiful. They are historic, yet modern. Midway has done an amazing job preserving the history of the campus. Its green spaces and landscapes are always perfect."
College Senior,4,"Midway College is a smaller, more private school that focuses all of its attention on its students."
Niche User,2,"While studying through Midway, I found most professors to be extremely helpful and learned a lot from them.  However, the higher the level of leadership and the longer some professors have been there, the less helpful and caring they are.  It doesn't matter if you follow your advisor's plan and approval for classes, if you aren't knowledgeable about the order of things, you will be a senior for three or more years.  It doesn't even matter if they tell you everything is okay and they will make sure you graduate by a certain time.  Don't take their word for it. You are truly on your own!  Also, the negative ratings of employees on Glassdoor are a true reflection of how things operate at Midway all the way down to the students.  Their leadership needs to learn from the younger professors and staff."
Niche User,2,"When I first started at Midway, I loved it. The professors were always helpful, engaged with the students, and looked out for the students' best interests. As I progressed into my program of study, there was a massive turnover of professors. This lead to lack of communication about what we should be taught in each class, making it hard to succeed in the program. As a result, I will not be graduating from Midway University. Though I wish them all the best, I am very disappointed with the program."
College Junior,2,The school doesn't treat it's students well so the alumni are not willing to do anything for their school. I do not blame them.
College Junior,2,The school shows huge respect for sports like volleyball and basketball. But it frequently cuts other sports teams without warning. The members of the cut teams are rarely formally told that their team has been cut and find out through peers and rumors. The teams that the school doesn't regard as important are treated unfairly and without respect.
College Junior,2,"The only redeeming quality the dorms have is their size.  The rooms are huge compared to the size of other dorms I considered.  The students are treated like they are in high school with monthly room checks and no visitors during finals week.  Occasionally you find a good resident assistant but overall, they are the ""chosen ones"" that have their heads stuck so far up the student affairs staff, the staff members can't see just how nasty and truly mean the RAs actually are.  They can't keep Resident Directors except for a thirty something year old woman who is so full of herself I am genuinely concerned she may blow up like a balloon and fly off.  The internet access is the worst I've ever seen.  Just trying to review my school, I have been kicked off of the internet three times.  Horrible, horrible, horrible experience."
College Junior,2,"The only teams that consistently do well are the Archery and Golf teams.  They have random students playing softball after firing the coach, students drop off of the equestrian teams like flies because the team members are toxic and don't support each other, the other teams have participants but seem to lose quite frequently.  No one comes to support the teams despite efforts by the student affairs staff."
College Junior,2,Kentucky has no idea what good food is. I come from The Eastern Shore and I MISS the food! You can't get a decent hoagie roll here. Kentuckians have no idea what GOOD food is!
College Senior,2,The gas station is your option here.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the departments had a lot of cut backs.  There are few good teachers and the programs are collapsing.
College Sophomore,2,There are limited food options and what they have is typically very poor quality.
College Junior,2,The gym areas  (weight room and cardio room) are very small and don't have a lot of variety.
College Student,2,The weather changes a lot and that affects me a lot.
College Senior,2,"Midway does not provide transportation nor is there public transportation. Once per month, student affairs will transport students to a mall to shop but if you do not have transportation, you're up the creek without a paddle."
College Senior,2,Expensive or Limited Housing – Not sure about off-campus housing because I live in another county and travel to campus. What I have been told by other students is that both on and off campus housing is expensive and the off campus housing is limited unless you live in another county.
College Sophomore,2,"Very Little to Choose from – Its a small town so there are not many choices. They are all close those and moderately priced, so its not terrible. However, you can drive about 20 min to Lexington, Georgetown, or Frankfort for much better options."
College Freshman,2,Rains Alot. Just your typical Kentucky weather. They take all of the possible repercussions to keep us safe. Just the weather deserves a C not the school.
College Junior,2,All Girls School – Midway College is an all girls school. It is nice to not have to worry about impressing guys but lets face it girls have drama. Guys are allowed on campus and in the dorms as long as they are escorted by a resident. The good thing is you have all different kinds of girls at Midway.
College Junior,2,"Community Is Helpful! Midway does not want students to live off campus, so there is no help in finding off-campus housing. But if there are apartments available usually people in the community are helpful and understanding."
Recent Alumnus,2,It is a small town and the choices are very limited.  You have to drive into Georgetown or Frankfort for restaurants that are affordable.
Freshman,1,If you want your kid to come to College to smoke marijuana then this is the place for your kid because I can smell it mainly on the first and second floor of buster. I know some dealers that have offered me some pot but I denied every single offer. There are dealers not just on campus but live in nearby apartments. Its a shame that none of the people running Midway University have not done anything about this. It makes Midway University look bad when tour guides give tours to the future new students and student parents when sometimes the hallways smell like pot and possibly the rooms they show smell like pot too.
College Junior,1,"They accepted far more students this year than they have housing for. This has never been a problem in the past. The staff has no idea how to fix the mess they'be created.

I'm a junior and an athlete and I am scheduled to move in in eleven days. They have not yet assigned me a place to live."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life.
College Junior,1,mainly because there is only one sex on the campus all girls
College Junior,1,its an all girls school so its definently lacking the other side of the coin. a lack of men weighs on the excitement around the community and state. the sports the women do have dont seem to be very competitive either.
College Junior,1,"It is an all girl campus.  Therefore, you mostly see lesbian couples if any at all."
College Freshman,1,"There are very few options to go somewhere that is quick and not too expensive. You have to get out on the interstate if you want to find food when its later at night, especially since the few resturants dont stay open very late."
College Junior,1,"Transportion Can Improve – There is no public transportation around. If you don't know someone on campus that has a car you can't go to Wal Mart or Target that is about a 15-20 minute drive away. There is no public transportation. I think that they should have a train that comes through Midway, KY and runs to Lexington, KY"

Junior,5,"Heritage University offers small class to teachers ratio making it easier to ask questions. A very nice university overall, only change I would seek is a reduce in tuition. As there is no dorms, sports teams and with COVID, the tuition has in fact increased even with online classes rising."
Niche User,5,The Heritage University is a small place and it is awesome. The things that they teach are very good. I have been the university and it's not that bad. It is a good place if you don't like going somewhere big.
Freshman,5,"what I like about this college even though my career is 4 years to achieve a bachelors degree is I get the help and resources I need to stay on top of my work, I have tutors, and my house is literally 7 minutes away. I would like to see more student to attend this college and be able to understand the great benefits to be at this school. Not to forget the teachers way of teaching and interreacting with students to go far."
Sophomore,5,The teachers are super supportive of their students and want to see them succeed. There are lots of resources for students to access help such as tutoring if needed.

Freshman,5,"Heritage University is a small campus with big opportunities! The ability to make strong connections with everyone you meet is exactly what I've been able to do through Heritage. It has been so helpful to see familiar faces everywhere you go it makes creating friendships and reaching out for help a lot easier. The best thing about Heritage are the support groups that welcome students seeking help and information, for example the CAMP program has helped me throughout my freshman year by meeting with me monthly to discuss my progress, providing help in applying to scholarships and financial aid, and in creating friendships with mentors and fellow CAMP students. My experience at Heritage has continued to be excellent and I expect it to always be a great guide in my journey to receiving a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration. To all considering taking the route towards Heritage University you will have an amazing support system and a great experience."
Sophomore,5,"Heritage University understands our needs as students. They offer their help and one-on-one meetings. The small classes are extremely helpful, you get to meet new people that can help you in the class while still being able to ask the professor any question you might have."
Senior,5,Heritage University is a great school to attend. This is my second year and I absolutely love how the professors treat their students. They are there to answer any unfamiliar questions and make sure you graduate on time. I am pleased with how fast the staff in the office and throughout the campus tend to the student's needs. If I have any concerns or questions I know that I can rely on Heritage University to answer any of my questions. I wanted to mention that I feel safe as well while attending classes. I also enjoy that this University is filled with diversity.
Freshman,5,"This university is huge on student support and academic support. I really love this university, with the fact that there is so much help available.  You don't feel on your own and you can openly ask questions. Everyone is really nice and most professors are very helpful. Only thing I would like to change is for the university to add athletic sports and open up more to diversity like in bigger colleges."
Junior,5,"I absolutely lover Heritage University! I am a transfer student from Yakima Valley Community College and after that experience when receiving my AA degree, I would have never thought that I would be going back to school. The Yakima Valley Community College experience was terrible. I am floured with enthusiasm when I think about my experience so far with Heritage University. The education professors are incredibly helpful and amazing teachers. You can tell they go out of their way to really engage with their students. I have never had such a personal teacher-student relationship with any professors from Yakima Valley Community College. The staff is what really makes this college experience memorable and enjoyable."
Freshman,5,"Heritage university is good place for learning, studying, making friends, and for better opportunities. The professors are very good at teaching each student in his/her class one on one, for a better understanding. The food here is amazingly delicious. The events they have on campus are very fun and also helps release stress from all the homework you have. The safety here on campus is really good that i can leave my stuff on the table and use the restroom without having to stress out about my things being taken."
Freshman,5,"The diversity is amazing here. Whether you have personally talked with someone or not, you can always spot familiar faces. People are helpful and best of all, the student to teacher ratio is great. You have the tutoring center and the writing center where you can get one on one help on you homework, essays, and anything school related."
College Junior,5,"I believe that Heritage University is one of the best Universities to go, because professors care about your success and they are also there to support you."

College Sophomore,5,heritage university is a safe to be
College Sophomore,5,heritage  university is one of the best school.
College Sophomore,5,"The school is very open, generally if anything were to happen students would more than likely have witnesses or a person they could go to for help."
College Sophomore,5,"Most students are parents, so the school helps by providing resources/scholarships that help them continue to their degree. Employees are eager to see students accomplishments."
College Sophomore,5,"I've enjoyed the past 2 years at heritage, the professors are helpful and students are encouraged to do better every day."
College Sophomore,5,Heritage University offers a variety of career prospects and value the degree by preparing student's for the real world with the courses provided. Some of the courses require an internship where the student's gain the experience in their field of study. Student's are also assigned to an advisers who makes sure students are learning the education necessary according to their major.
College Sophomore,5,"So far, the courses are within reach of student's ability. Also, professors teaching skills are excellent to understand the material being taught. If student's need extra time to review or study professors usually make time to meet with students outside of class time. Class size are reasonable and fairly assigned to accommodate according to student's needs and education."
College Sophomore,5,"Heritage University provides resources for student's safety by providing emergency telephones around campus in case of an emergency. Also, security services without the day, until the campus closes for the day. Personally, I do feel safe attending Heritage University because of the social atmosphere."
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at Heritage University is unique from my previous school because the support and resources are in reach of student's ability to become successful. Professors take their time to explain the material outside of classes time if student's need the extra time. So far, my favorite experience is participating with the Enactus program by providing community services with public schools in regards of their future education."
College Senior,5,The teachers were amazing and so helpful. Campus life was really diverse. I truly enjoy my time there. I made some life long friends.
College Sophomore,5,"I believe the environment, staff, and materials are great, my experience has been very good so far. I Love HU!!"
College Sophomore,5,The Greek life at heritage is important. Both frat and sorority help one another to grow more and more since barely a year ago students decided to start a fraternity and sorority. They host events on campus for anyone to come to get to know a little bit about them and have students be involved on campus. They also care about the community so they will hold food drives and anything to help anyone in need in our community for example the fraternity decided to do a blanket and coat drive since it's winter and not everyone can afford coats or blankets to stay warm in the cold so they came up with the idea to help those in need.
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at heritage university has been the best. My first year as freshmen was one to remember. I was easily able to go around my school and experience what it's like to be a college student. All the faculty and professors want all students to succeed so they are more than willing to help anyone out with anything a student may need. Also the events they offer is what makes the school unique. They do events for students to be involved and have something to do while they're waiting for a class to start and it's not only just for students, sometimes they make these events public for anyone that is is welcome to come. Also the programs they offer and the in class room experience is the best. Professors know what they are teaching to their class and they are more than willing to help a student of they are struggling in a class."
College Junior,5,It is close to home so I can drive there every day.
College Junior,5,"We security on campus, with cameras. There is also phones in every classroom and poles outside to call 911."

College Student,5,I didn't have to worry about doing all the paper work on my own. The people who dealt with financial-aid helped me step by step on everything and they made sure I wasn't confused on what the paper work was and what it was for. Applying for my financial aid was extremely easy with their help.

College Freshman,5,In my opinion we do nothave a drug problem becasue we are private university.
College Freshman,5,They are concerned about our health and safety. Like th other day we were in biology and one of our labs said that we were goning to be testing our own and others blood to see what blood type that they had and i was very excited to do so. When we went to class our professor told us we will not be testing ours or others blood due to the fact that it is a health risk not knowing if somones blood your testing has HIV. It was a real bummer but i got over it seeing that it was true I did not know who had or didn;t have HIV. I thank my professor and the university for watching out for not onluy my health but others as well.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very accepting and very nice at heritage.
College Junior,5,finish my university requirements wererequire in order to get in the program
Junior,4,"With the sudden change due to COVID-19, my professors tried their best to adapt our class material to online. Frequently asking us how we were doing which I loved the most."
Freshman,4,"I love that I can further my education but also stay home and be close to family. The environment at Heritage University is amazing, the staff, students are very welcoming and helpful."
Sophomore,4,The help not many school take the time to walk with you and help you understand the material along with the eight pass.
Junior,4,I like the small teacher to student ratio. The teachers actually know your name and want you to succed.  I think this school has a different mission but it is working out in their students benefit.
Junior,4,"It's a university that is phenomenal. While it does have its own flaws, it's important to recognize that this university empathizes on putting the students first. This university is very hands-on with every student that arrives on campus to help them succeed to be the best."
Freshman,4,"I have been in Heritage University for a year now. I love how there have flexible schedules, so I get to come home everyday and have a job as well. There  is diversity in campus, so there are always chances of meeting new people everyday. The professors are helpful; you get to experience a 1 on 1 conversation with professors.  Something I would change about Heritage University would be more activities, sports teams, things that resemble to other universities. I would also change the cost of attending, it's pretty expensive but it will be worth it"
Freshman,4,Heritage has been a great experience so far. The professors are very nice and are always willing to help even out of class. Heritage also has a writing center and an ASC which stands for academic student center.    The help that they offer here is amazing! The tutors are students like myself who work with us to get a better understanding and best of all the tutoring we get is free. Something that I would like to see change is the involvement of sports.  I would like to see our University has a soccer team since we have a lot of boys who like to play soccer on their free time.
College Senior,4,"There are security cameras, and have never heard of burglary or other issues regarding poor safety. We barely see police, but we have security guards"
College Senior,4,"As a PA student, I already have job offers. It is pretty easy to get a job after"
College Senior,4,"It has been a great experience being in the country for college. It is quite and the faculty is so close to students, making sure that we get what we need to succeed"
College Sophomore,4,they  are nice and great
College Junior,4,Heritage University is a great value for a small private university.
College Junior,4,"I am returning to Heritage for my Masters in Teaching after graduating with my Bachelor of Science from Heritage nine years ago.  The campus is small but beautiful, classes are tiny and instruction is often personalized.  Professors are extremely passionate, helpful, and caring.  And for a private college, it's very affordable!"
College Sophomore,4,"I've had a great experience at Heritage, professors are always readily available for students and are proactive in helping you reach your goals."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, I have not encountered any alcohol or drug involvement around campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Heritage University doesn't have dorms, but the social atmosphere is great because students and staff make you feel welcomed and at home. Unfortunately, tuition cost is highly expensive for students. Although, Heritage University provides scholarship options, but I believe there is not a variety of scholarships."
College Sophomore,4,"As a new student at Heritage University I have noticed school spirit, student involvement, and staff support. Heritage University acknowledges student's achievements and provides the resources needed to improve student's education. School spirit is strong and recognizable without the campus, but also when participating among the community. Heritage University student's are involved with different projects in the Yakima Valley by the Business program called Enactus."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the fact as soon as I applied I heard from Heritage within 3 days I applied. I was contacted to come tour the campus, was told about the University. Its a smaller university where I get more one on one time with staff, faculty, and other students. Happy I choose Heritage."
College Senior,4,I like the fact that students can go in and use the facilities whenever they have time.
College Sophomore,4,I have only been attending Herzing University for a couple weeks but I enjoy it so far. All of the staff and teachers that work there are welcoming and friendly.
College Freshman,4,The chef creates new menus for everyday. You never know what will be next. He makes the best scones ever.
College Junior,4,"Don't have any yet, but most of my class mates have. They have been very satisfied."
College Junior,4,There is great places to eat the only thing bad is the hours.
College Junior,4,There really isn't that many Greeks in our school or community.
College Junior,4,"The town is very historical, and they take pride in maintaining it that way. There is shopping and locals are great"
College Junior,4,"The Campus has all we need and if we don't know where places are at, we just have to ask."
College Freshman,4,We really don't have parties at school and that is the good thing. This is because it doesn't interferer with the students classes and homework.
College Freshman,4,"Because there are NO dorms, the party scene is NONEXISTENT! But, I like it that way because it gives us more of a focus on academics - which is the whole point of going to college. There are FUN events here (that do not involve 'bad' things or influences) which is a great way to hang out with friends and meet new people."
College Freshman,4,"Heritage is strict about honor and responsibility and does NOT allow alcohol/drugs. But, there are times (such as regarding attendance) when professors will be more lenient and understanding. It is a laid back/calm atmosphere, yet at the same time certain general standards and rules are expected to be followed."
College Freshman,4,"There are no dorms her at Heritage, so we ALL live off-campus!"
College Senior,4,"The registration process is easy you can do it on your own. I like the professors I have had so far they talk to you and explain things to make sure all the students in the class understands the topic. I also like the curriculum because each new topic builds from the last, and it is a reasonable workload."
College Senior,4,There are lots of internships during the summer that is available to students with a science major. The workload is a lot but it is manageable. Also the science facilities are very good with everything that a student would need.
College Senior,4,The student center is great because it is a place you can go and get help with any subject. I like going to the library because that is where you can go if you want to study in a quiet area. They also have a lot of tables outside where students can study our hangout. Also they also offer a lot of different kinds of campus events.
College Senior,4,"The cafeteria has a good variety everyday to choose from, and they have different specials everyday that are good prices. Also they have a lot of room in the dining hall so that you can eat and study at the same time."
College Senior,4,It's very unique with its HU105 program that allows undergraduate and graduate students to experience hands on training and learning to become an elementary/middle school teacher.
College Senior,4,"The faculty and staff have been mainly responsive to my questions and applications. All of my in person interactions have been great! The program has not necessarily been keeping to its exact timeline, but has been very responsive to following up with me. I look forward to the Master in Teaching HU105 program and all it has to offer me."
College Sophomore,4,The campus to me feels secure enough they have two securities patrolling in vehicles and keeping safe the outside grounds and inside I feel safe I have never felt uncomfortable in any way. Everyone I have seen are very respectful and trustworthy. I have no worries of my or my vehicles safety on that campus.
College Junior,4,we have several ethnic groups in class
College Junior,4,I feel very safe at school.
College Junior,4,i love this school because of the flexibility it allow me.
College Sophomore,4,"I really appreciate how many computer labs Heritage University has. They have several that are open for students to use. The printing is reliable to students and I think that it's quite an organized system. The speed and network reliability is good, there is just a couple of places on campus where it seems that the wireless internet doesn't reach to. The need for a personal computer is somewhat needed, but I think students need one if they wanted to do their homework at home."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a Psychology Major and I enjoy this program. The classes are small, so you get more one on one time with the professor. The workload is always reasonable. The curriculum is simple and easy to follow. The only downside to the psychology program is that not every class is offered every semester."
College Junior,4,The classes are small enough to have contact with teachers and get help when needed. The cost of tuition is high and probably the thing that makes me think twice. 
College Junior,4,"There are young, old, kids, no kids, married, single, and all different races around us. It is very diverse and its nice to meet all these different people from all over. "
College Junior,4,I have not personly ever had a problem with parking. I can always find a spot and the distance isn't that far away from my classes. 
College Junior,4,"They have several programs that offer help and support, like Trio. They are not only for needy people either, they take a variety of people interested in their program. I am personly in Trio and it is awesome. I get a lot of support and fun events that I can attend. "
College Junior,4,I would choose to go to Heritage University again and maybe will for Grad. school. I have had a great experience over-all. I am in the HU105 program and it has helped so much in learning how to teach by being a teacher in its self. 
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors were very caring about individual students goals.  The registration process was a bit confusing but advisors were helpful.
Recent Alumnus,4,I was given loans that I needed.
Recent Alumnus,4,I think the expertise and friendliness of professors really made a difference.
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors and students are more accepting of diverse groups of people than other colleges.
Recent Alumnus,4,There is always parking spots available.
Recent Alumnus,4,I love the professors.  They really care about your future.
College Freshman,4,Heritage university offers security on campus. Having security there at night makes me feel safe.
College Freshman,4,I have never seen any drugs or alcohol at my campus. 
College Freshman,4,The weather doesnt get too crazy here.From the time i have been attending Heritage University i could only think of a few times school has been delayed because of the school weather. 
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid process went smoothly for me, the reason why is because when needing help i turned to my schools adviser and she gave me the help i needed."
College Student,4,"The professors are very involved in your learning they care about what you think. If you need help they will work with you one on one and the classes aren't crowded like other colleges. It is a very calm place and everybody is very friendly that is something you don't find in a college with a large amount of students, and I think that, that is what makes this college different from other colleges out there."
College Student,4,Everyone at my school is very out going and when it comes to being friendly there is no doubt that they will be the best. When you're there it is very welcoming and you feel right at home. The boys and the girls are all very kind and you will see that if you go. 
College Sophomore,4,"great, i enjoy it very much because i like it alot."
Junior,2,This collage is local and it has a rich diverse student body from what I have seen so far.  As for my experience dealing with faculty it has not been that great. Instructors seam to be confused on the policy’s and rules of the university and how they apply to new incoming students.
College Senior,2,"The school is currently working to improve athletics, but otherwise at this moment there is barely any athletic spirit, at least that am aware of"
College Sophomore,2,we don't have much for sports. let alone sports teams.
College Sophomore,2,Since heritage is a small university. There is not much sport activities in campus other than a coed soccer team that is kind of small. The school does help fund for the team with certain parts but as of right now we don't really have a nice soccer field.
College Freshman,2,We do not really have any sports we have more clubs.
College Junior,2,not many parties or social events are happening throughout the school year.
College Junior,2,residential area is low income
College Junior,2,Not a lot to choose from!
College Sophomore,2,There is no varsity sports teams. But Heritage does have some organized sports events that are open to students to participate in. But it needs a bit more publicity and organization.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't really a nightlife at Heritage. Just night classes and that's about it from what I know.
College Junior,2,I feel that we need better food we only have a cafeteria but most of the food is not healthy and the portions are small and costly. For students on a budget it is expensive to eat on campus. 
College Freshman,2,Theres hadly any variety of foods to chose from and there isnt any food service after 6pm 
College Student,2,"We don't really have a hangout place, because we are a private school we don't have as much resources to getting a place where we can all go and hang out but with the new building under construction I am sure that we all will have a place where we can socialize. I think it might just be that we are a  very relaxed and calm school that we try and keep out environment as calm as possible. we have hangout place that is more like a lounging place, but it seems that it is more of a relaxation area. "
College Sophomore,2,We only have one sport which is indoor soccer.
College Freshman,2,I am not very happy with the program that I am in.
College Senior,2,"The dining area is comfortable, however the food is so unhealthy and pricey."
College Sophomore,2,there is not much options the drive to those places is not very far but also not too close it maybe takes like 1 mile to 1 mila and a half to get to the nearest place. the cost is average and i havent heard of any student discounts to the places i have gone to.
College Student,2,the professors are alright really. study options are very good they have numerous numbers of tutors in the academic skills center where we can get help if needed sometimes the professors are in the academic skills center and thats awesome too because sometimes there is way too many students in one class that the professor cant go around to everyone and help them if they asked. registeration is very good once you get the hang of it and know what you have to do and when it needs to be turned in all you have to do is see what classes you need to take grab a form write those classes down n turn it in to finical aid have them sign your paper and your advisor if you have one then turn in the paper into student services pretty simple as that only problem really is looking for your recommended classes you have to take because classes fill up fast so you need to turn in your form as soon as possible.
College Junior,2,Drugs are not a big of a deal at Heritage University. There may be family members or friends picking up my peers that may have consumed a type of drug but none that risk peoples lives or that make noticible.
College Student,2,i have not seen any secruity and there is only one emergency button that is far off campus.
College Sophomore,1,Heritage does not provide campus housing but it is being considered in the future as the university continues to grow.
College Freshman,1,At heritage university you will not find any sports. There really isnt any school spirit therefore the lack of sports is low. 
College Junior,1,Not many options. Either car pool or ride a small bus that onyl comes once or twice a day if you call the serice.
College Freshman,1,The new portable where we eat is big but the food is not satisfying
College Freshman,1,"Since the fire at our university this summer the first half of the year was spent eating at local opinions near the school, the options are very little and not in the budget of a college student. This semester we have a place to eat but the food is very unhealthy and expensive."
College Student,1,there is no mascot and not a lot of people talk. its really serious.
College Senior,1,"None Avialable – That I am aware of, there is no housing available on campus.  you are resposible for your own housing."
College Senior,1,"Wish I Had a Little More Help – I actually just received my award letter today and called the school to see what more could be done to help with paying for my education.  Person whoanswered, ""Gina"" did not sound like she wanted to help in any way.  I let her know that my contribution was being determined by my work last year and I was working 2 jobs to support my family and will now with starting school have to completely quit my second job and possibly cut back on hours at my current place of employment.  I really wish she had been more helpful.  So I am now on FasrWeb applying for scholarships like crazy to be able to afford to pursue my dreams of becoming a registered nurse."
College Sophomore,1,"Not much info about sports, just occassionally seeing flyers about the team."
College Senior,1,Not Close to Campus – The housing is not close to campus. I live 45min away from school. The housing that is close is in low income areas that are high in crime.
College Freshman,1,Far Off Campass Houseing – i lived with my parent and then rented a house in sunnyside. however the school camass is in toppenish and i have to travel far to get to school. there is little housing oppertunity in toppenish or cities near toppenish.
College Freshman,1,No Clubs or Parties – ther is no parties bt i think it because of the no dorms it would be good to have some though.
College Student,1,Paying for School – The financial aid process is smooth you do get a good amount but if you plan on going in the summer. You dont get that much aide and therefore your stuck with the bill. And are not able to finish until its paid off. Thats what im going through right now.
College Student,1,On campus there are no dorms. You have to drive to campus
College Sophomore,1,"Almost Non-Existant – I don't think there are any kind of Greek programs, but there might be a few Greek students.."
College Student,1,"Our spot to hang out is RIGHT in front of the University Library! Not in front of the building but right in front of the single glass pan doors. And I must admit we do get loud in which case the librarian closes the entry doors but never has she been mean.  Our hub, it sucks nobody goes there, old couches and a little baby flat screen just ant cutting it."
College Student,1,Get Modern – Our school is located on the Yakama Reservation in a Hispanic community. What I mean by that is there are a lot of local businesses in which all employees speak Spanish as there first and only language.  My solution to the adapting world around me is to get modern. I'm enrolled to take Spanish in the fall.
College Student,1,We do not have on-campus housing! I think the student wood benefit from housing on or near our school. Houses in the surrounding areas are not college student friendly. Those which are affordable on a college student budget are not our top picks Unfortunately they are also in unsafe neighborhoods.

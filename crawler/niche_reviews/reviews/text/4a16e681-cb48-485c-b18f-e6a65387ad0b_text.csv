Junior,5,"Emmaus is a community of amazing faculty members and students who love God and live it out. It is more than just a place to get an education. Emmaus has such a beautiful blend of cultures and backgrounds that have one thing in common: Jesus Christ as their personal savior. It has been the most wonderful and amazing year of my life as I have learned about God, explored his word, been challenged in my personal life, and have gained the most genuine of friendships ."
Senior,5,"I have learned so much about how to excel in my future career as a ministry leader. The teachers do more than just teach, they live out what the teach, and that makes their teaching more effective! We have many people who are from all over the world who come to Emmaus to learn more about the Bible. The community hear is second to none! People who genuinely love one another, and have excellent, close relationships between other students, and students, and staff. We only have 250 students so this allows for more personal teaching, and higher quality of learning! I have learned how to be a more effective servant leader! Daily challenges to live my life in humility, to serve others, and in so doing, serve the Lord! So thankful God brought me to Emmaus, and if I had to do it again, I would still chose Emmaus!"
Junior,5,"Emmaus is a great college because of its size, it has less than 300 students and this makes it so that there is a family-like atmosphere. Everyone knows your name and the teachers care about you and really want you to learn. I highly recommend Emmaus to anyone looking for a good Bible centered college with a family-like feel."
Junior,5,"Firstly, love that it's a Bible College with strong theology. It's also cheap (relative to other options). It's small which I love, but may not be for everyone. Has a helpful 1-year program to give you some leeway but not lose credits."
Junior,5,"I have so enjoyed my time at Emmaus thus far! The professors are great, they really invest in the lives of the students. The campus environment is inviting and welcoming from the start. This is a place of spiritual growth and the accumulation of Bible knowledge. I have learned so much about the Bible and Business (my degree program) and I feel I will be ready to enter the workforce when I graduate next spring. "
College Junior,5,"I attended a tech college prior to coming to Emmaus.  Emmaus has been very accepting to all of my transfer credits, the transition was issue free."
College Junior,5,"The professors and courses are top notch.  I am a Junior at Emmaus and there has not been one class pertaining to my major that I have disliked.  The professors are engaging and knowledgable in their field and they really make time for each student.  I have met with numerous professors outside of class for coffee, to talk about a life issue, etc...They really make time for you and care how you are doing spiritually.  The class sizes for the most part range from 10-25 students and this size allows for the professor to be personable with each student."
College Junior,5,"I am in the Biblical Studies Program at Emmaus and I have been thoroughly satisfied with it thus far.  The workload is challenging but not over burdening.  You have to work but the professors know what line they can and cannot cross.  They challenge you to think and put in effort to make you interact with the material being taught.  The classroom facilities are top notch, they just updated all the projectors this year.  In the Bible Program the professors do a great job with imparting information but they also challenge the student to think of ways on how to apply these truths that are in the Bible into a real world setting.  The Bible really is made real and relevant.  My professor right now is actually on his own time is trying to hook me up with an internship to Zambia."
College Junior,5,"The professors take time to get to know you as a person outside of class.  They'll meet with you at a coffee shop, invite you to their home, and so much more.  You can tell they really care for you and want to pour into your life both academically and spiritually.  The setting of Emmaus make it prime for developing life long relationships and growing closer in your walk with God."
College Sophomore,5,"Overall, Emmaus is the best college that can be fit for anyone, such as those who struggle or don't struggle with finances. They are more than welcome to help and figure out a solution for each student that comes. Their love for Christ is strong and it encourages each of us to not give up on our education but to continue it for the glory of God!! I am excited to continue my Emmaus experience and use that experience to influence others around me. I would recommend this school to any person around the world whether they can afford it or not because Emmaus would still help, care, and provide for each student."
College Freshman,5,"I loved playing volleyball, making lifelong friends and getting to know the professors."
College Freshman,5,The quality of the courses and professors is top quality. The class sizes are small and personal.
College Freshman,5,There seems to be plenty of opportunities for internships once you get to that part of the degree program.
College Freshman,5,"The student body is diverse in where they are from, but we are all Evangelical Christians so we all agree in the religious aspects. They are very accepting, but you cannot get into Emmaus unless you are a believer."
College Freshman,5,"The value is well worth the cost. I have gotten more financial aid than I expected. I wish it was more, but who doesn't?"
College Freshman,5,The professors are great and they offer one on one help for any students that seek it out. The class registration process is simple. Emmaus also offers individual studies if a class isn't offered when a student wants it to be.
College Sophomore,5,"Alumni frequently come and visit, and there is usually a good turn-out for any alumni games scheduled. Also, a good amount of alumni take jobs at the school."
College Sophomore,5,"The business office is so great about helping out, and explaining any questions I might have. They do not try to hide anything, but seem open and honest about financials."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are one of my favorite parts of the college. They are so knowledgeable, and they genuinely desire to help you and see you grow in your spiritual, academic, and social life."
College Student,5,"Since we are a christian college, we discuss topics all the time concerning society around us"
Sophomore,4,"Emmaus is the type of place that I would highly recommend if you are a student looking for a place of community, excellent teaching, and spiritual growth.  As a student, my favorite part of the school is that the professors want to see you succeed and genuninely love you!  Connections with fellow students and professors are ones I won't forget."
Sophomore,4,"Awesome faculty, there's a huge sense of community at Emmaus. Lots of information is pushed into your head and the professors are brilliant."
Freshman,4,"This college has given me countless opportunities to learn and grow here at the school as well as in the community. Classes can be challenging, but in a good wa to grow your knowledge of the Bible and the world around us. Professors and staff are personable and always ready to help. Definitely a school to study at if you want to get deep onto God's Word, learn basic knowledge with a christian perspective, and experience interacting with an incredible community of people both inside and outside the walls of the school."
College Junior,4,I don't really know a whole lot in this area.  But I do know that most of my friends who graduated in the last two years are working at a job they went to school for.
College Junior,4,One of my Bible professors right now is actually working on an internship for me right now.  My degree will prepare me to do mission work effectively over seas by giving me the tools and knowledge about the Bible for impactful ministry.  Emmaus does a great job with the alumni.  The host alumni games and invite the alumni to a lot of student events to keep them involved with student life.
College Freshman,4,I transferred 6 credits from High School Composition class and they transferred well.
College Freshman,4,"I am only a freshman, but the post-grad services seem very good  for the graduating seniors."
College Freshman,4,I just started in the Business program but they seem to have many opportunities after graduation and the workload seems about average for most majors.
College Freshman,4,Their athletic center is getting updated for next year! Their library is great and their study center is helpful for group projects.
College Freshman,4,Teachers being flexible and understanding if conflict arises with assignments
College Freshman,4,We do activities most schools don't because of their large size.
College Freshman,4,Class sizes are very small- perfect!
College Freshman,4,Many career services on and off campus offered
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very open to other people
College Freshman,4,The alumni are very much still involved.
College Freshman,4,There the curriculum is very helpful!
College Freshman,4,The professors are always willing to help!
College Sophomore,4,"Sometimes the internet goes in and out, but for the most part it is pretty reliable and is fairly fast. Oh, and printing is free here!"
College Sophomore,4,"Though not too big or fancy, the library is sufficient, and so is the gym. There are enough places to hang out on campus, and when it is nice outside there are even more places to go and socialize with friends."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is so awesome and social here which makes it fun to hang out anywhere in the school! Laundry is part of room and board and I never have a problem with it, and the gym is decent for the needs of the student body. Also, I have nothing to complain about regarding the classrooms."
College Sophomore,4,"The student body acts as one big family, and I think this helps with not only the diversity, but just with everyday interactions with one another."
College Sophomore,4,"The education program is superb here, and the teachers really are top-notch. Since Secondary Education was just recently added to the college's list of majors, it is hard to say how it will end up, but I have no doubt that it will be just as great as the experience that the students/teachers have in the Elementary Education department."
College Sophomore,4,"Because it is a small school, there are fewer professors which means fewer chances that classes will work around your own personal schedule. I have had very few problems with this, though, so as long as you are not on a super strict schedule, you should be absolutely fine as far as scheduling is concerned.

Credits transferred in just fine though, and the administration was very helpful and willing to work with me as I made the transition.

Not only admin, but professors and other faculty/staff members have been so great, and they are genuinely kind and caring for the social, academic, and spiritual life of each and every one of the students. It is like one big family at college, which is such a great thing to me, and although there are times when it seems too small, I know that it is a really wonderful place and I would not trade my experience here for anything."
College Student,4,"I've taken free online courses because I'm not actually attending Emmaus, but I plan to enroll this fall. The classes I have taken are loaded with great content pertaining to my major that I'm looking at."
College Student,4,I plan to go into a counseling psychology program at Emmaus. The integration in the program of christian worldview and counseling psychology is very emphasized and I like that
College Student,4,"The selection is very limited because it is a very small school. But on the positive flip side to that the few teachers that they have are very intellectual, very personable, and they enjoy their jobs"
College Sophomore,4,The emphasis on the Bible is the most important thing. Emmaus certainly hits that on the head.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are very knowledgeable in the Bible, and they are happy to pour into students lives."
College Sophomore,4,I have never had a problem finding a computer or printer when I needed one.
College Sophomore,4,Emmaus Bible College is a very diverse school. It makes it an even more excellent place to learn.
College Junior,4,"It is a very small school (about 300), but the academics are first rate!  The elementary education program was called a hidden jewel by the state when they came to renew accreditation.  They have the unique Bible focus in all the major and gen. ed. classes not just the Bible ones."
College Junior,4,The jewel of the campus is the library.  It is well stocked with any books you might need to complete your project.  There are two gyms; the main gym has recently received a new wood floor.  The student center is a fun and comfortable place to hang out as well as the lounges on the dorm floors.
College Junior,4,"The network did have some problems, however, they were looked into and fixed.  The computer lab is great.  The entire school is wireless compatible.  A personal computer would be very useful, but is not absolutely necessary."
College Junior,4,"Worth the Cost – For a private college, the cost of attendance is very reasonable, and you receive a quality education.  Be sure to go to their website and look for scholarships that would apply to you."
College Junior,4,The students body is a mix of traditional students and adult students.  A few students come from Mexico and a few other foreign countries.  The student body as whole is very friendly and encouraging.
College Junior,4,"Very high quality program and classes.  The teachers take the time to present information thoroughly.  Classes are intensive and working is not recommended, but you will be well prepared."
College Freshman,4,I have not had very much interaction with the financial aid. However I think this was because they were so helpful explaining everything that I need to do. This way I never had to go back and constantly ask questions
College Freshman,4,Emmaus student body is great! The school is small so everyone knows everybody and they actually care about each other enough to spend time geting to know each and every student. I have grown up around small christian groups but this schools student body really shows christ threw there love of other students
College Freshman,4,"Very Straightforward – I recently switched majors and my academic adviser met with the Dean of Academic Affairs to try and get as many of my old credits to transfer to my new major. They were able to get a few class credits to transfer, but naturally some others did not. They did everything they could to get as many credits possible to transfer."
College Sophomore,4,Helpful Transfers – The only credits that didn't transfer were ones that had nothing to do with my degree. The Emmaus staff were very helpful in guiding me as to which classes I should take my last semester at the community college so I could transfer them the following semester to Emmaus. They went above and beyond the call of duty to help me.
Alum,2,"You are away from home, you meet your RA and people on your floor, oh my, there are so many like minded people here, and we get to grow together. Emmaus felt like a summer camp - so many friends, great experiences and heart ache. But let me tell you something, a lot of people lose focus of the future, and so many people I graduated with ended up with dead end jobs -  This college DOES NOT prepare you for life after college. 

You will end up with a lot of student debt, and unless you want to become a Theologian or preacher, you will have a useless degree in Bible. You are better off going to a community college or  in-state college. State colleges have devoted Christian groups like Navigators/Campus Crusade/InterVarsity. If I could go back in time, I would not go to Emmaus Bible College - I did make lifetime friends there, but so many people ended up with dead end careers."
College Student,2,"They really don't have a whole lot to offer in this area, which really isn't a big deal for me, but they have made a few recent improvements that are nice. The concrete floor gym and the lounge area are very nice"
Niche User,1,"I didn't take online classes
------------------------------------------------------------------------"
Niche User,1,"I wouldn't recommend this college to anyone.  I actively try to convince freshmen there to transfer.  Here's why:

1) Emmaus will limit your career opportunities.
Emmaus is a small college with limited majors, and poor networks.  Many students that I went there with gained little to nothing in a career field.  College is a big investment of time and money.  Many freshman do not know exactly what they want to do/major in when they attend college.  Many colleges with large options with enable them to discover their interests, and put them in a program that will lead them to a career.  The ROI is low at Emmaus.  

2) Emmaus will limit your college experience.
College is a great time to meet lots of people, and experience things.  Emmaus is very small, and limits one's ability to have these out side the classroom learning experience merely by nature of it being so small."

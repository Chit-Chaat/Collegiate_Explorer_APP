Alum,5,There were a couple classes that were set up as hybrid classes. I thoroughly enjoyed these classes cause we did the lectures and learning online and then the professor was available for questions and problem solving in person.
Alum,5,I really enjoyed that faculty at Allen College. They really want their students to succeed. The faculty definitely lets the students know what is expected of them and the faculty works hard to make themselves available if questions come up.
Alum,5,Small class size. Accredited. Professors were vested in student success. Quality education which prepared me for my future career.
Junior,5,Allen College offers online courses that allow people to work while continuing their education. The instructors are helpful and always available to answer questions.
Sophomore,5,"Allen is a small nursing school, but the professors are all dedicated to helping their students succeed."
Junior,5,"I am happy to be a student at Allen, I feel that we learn ""more"" than what other colleges have to offer (just by working with non-bsn RN's)... The first and second semesters were difficult, but Allen does offer excellent support, and your instructors are more than willing to individually help you out, all you gotta do is reach out and ask!! (push push push that communication!!!) I wish we had some more vending machines, but, Allen does cater for free lunches for us often, and the SNA group and faculty are pretty awesome with setting up snack tables and little activities to relieve stress during mid-terms and finals! Being a private college increases the chance for scholarships, Allen also offers clubs to join which provide scholarships as well. Overall, I love it here at Allen,  and I will be proud to add my Allen College BSN-RN degree achievement to my resume soon :)"
College Sophomore,5,Computer access is not necessary but the wireless internet availability is very excellent when using your smart phone in between classes. 
College Junior,5,"Academic Excellence and Grade a Staff – At Allen College the instructors/professors are fabulous!  They have a solid base of knowledge to provide students with superior guidance, mentoring, and leadership.  The administrative staff at Allen College are over-the-top in assistance.  They want all students to have a great opportunity that is worry-free and it shows!"
College Junior,5,"Um, yeah, Allen is a college of nursing so most of the students are girls.  Girls rock!"
College Junior,5,No tickets or fines. Need a car because campus is on the edge of town in Waterloo and most people live in Cedar Falls but you could probably find someone to car pool with. Don't have to walk far to class.
Graduate Student,4,Allen College is a great place to complete your education. Most all of the professors that I have had have been really good about communicating as well as setting up office hours if any questions arise.
College Sophomore,4,A difficult workload and study options are available for certain classes.  Generally the classes that are more difficult on average will offer special study options.
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are difficult and need major effort to get good grades but good study habits will definitely help.  Yes, variety of classes offered and class size varies."
College Sophomore,4,Special security is available if one feels the need for it.
College Sophomore,4,Allen College is somewhere I feel safe and healthy. 
College Sophomore,4,Most students choose to live in Cedar Falls or around the transition area into Waterloo. This provides a safer housing opportunity and the commute between cities isn't a hassle. 
College Sophomore,4,Allen has a partnership with the University of Northern Iowa. This partnership and closeness makes the use of their night life and activities very easy and accessible. 
College Sophomore,4,Options offer variety and cost isn't outrageous. 
College Sophomore,4,Allen College is a great school to further your career in nursing. They truly care about your success and want to do anything they can to aid in your success.
College Sophomore,4,Allen College has a hassle free application that is fairly standard. You apply for all of the general scholarships and then they use your information to narrow it down from there. 
College Junior,4,"Since I do not live on campus, and most students don't, strictness doesn't really impact social lives. However academically is it the normal standards."
College Junior,4,I feel safe at Allen. I haven't ever had a problem.
College Junior,4,At Allen College you will find amazing students!  The students represent a variety of cultures and all seem to blend well!
College Junior,4,"Small Town Charm – The Waterloo/Cedar Falls area is a mid-size town with a small town atmosphere. Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Cedar River, the scenery is sure to please. With so many things to do and see you are sure to find something to suit your interest."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The School Is Average for Strictness – The strictness at the school is descent. It is really important to stay on task at most times, but the professors can be laid back also."
College Junior,4,Safety is excellent. Last year there were no crimes committed on campus. We have security cameras in the buildings. There are only two building very close together and the parking lot is right next to the buildings for safety. Lots of lighting in the parking lot for night time classes.
Senior,2,"Allen College overall has great education and professors. However, the college costs a lot more than what they portray and does not offer enough financial aid to compensate the costs. Another disappointment is that refunds were not provided for clinical experiences that were not able to have been attended due to COVID-19 as the college felt as if online virtual simulations could compensate for hands on skills that would otherwise have been done in the clinical setting. 
Along with this, students are not fully respected by higher up faculty as they are left out of decisions and are not told all of the information about decisions that are made.  Faculty make decisions that are the easiest for them, rather than making decisions in the best interest of the students.  When students voice their concern about decisions they are shot down and told to “stay in their own lane”. 
I am very disappointed in my Allen College experience as I do not feel respected as a student."
Graduate Student,2,"This program will sure help you pass the test, but so will any other college that is not as extremely overpriced. There are many unnecessary,  annoying classes and assignments and teachers have very poor teaching skills. They are nurses, not real teachers. Would not recommend. Save your money, time, and metal health, get your degree  elsewhere."
Alum,2,They continually add extra fees such as Typhon or security systems that they take down eventually because no one knows how to run them. The whole experience seemed like the staff could care less about their students and were insanely unorganized.  Don't call the school between 11:30 and 1:00 pm because no one will answer. There's better and cheaper schools in the Iowa area.
College Sophomore,2,There are no athletics at my school for Allen College. It is a private college for students looking to go into a health field.
Senior,1,"Allen College online learning caused the workload to double. Professors had students listen to lectures prior to class and then attend virtual class periods, which increased the time students spent on lecture material rather than allowing students to work on assignments and studying for exams as they were also expected to do. Students spoke up and addressed this topic with professors; however, professors were too concerned about “getting in trouble” with other faculty rather than providing an experience that would better benefit the students.  Along with this, the college thought that online virtual simulations compensated for hands on clinical experiences and continued to charge students the full amount as if they were having clincial experiences in the hospital."
Graduate Student,1,"1.) Constant ROADBLOCKS to learning.  Stop wasting my time with menial task work--give me a textbook, and leave me alone-- I will pass any test you put in front of me.  Allen College doesn't seem to be able to just GET OUT OF THE WAY and let the student learn. 
2.)Enough with the leg work.  The computer systems are terribly designed and poorly integrate with one another.  I don't need an 8th password.  I don't need new red tape tasks or to readdress the ones I have already completed. And stop using locking people out of their courses on short notice as a method to gain compliance with running your red tape errands. 
3. Try answering the phone.  I'm talking about the MAIN line. Not exaggerating: try calling the school during normal business hours and you will be lucky to get through 1 time in 20.  Not even close to acceptable.  I know what I pay in tuition. You can afford to pay someone minimum wage to just pick up the phone."

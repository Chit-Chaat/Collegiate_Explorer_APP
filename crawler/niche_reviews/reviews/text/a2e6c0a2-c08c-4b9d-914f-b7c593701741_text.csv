Sophomore,5,"This place isn't perfect, but it's the best college I could have chosen for me. I'm a big city person, so moving to a place like this can feel a little stifling at times, but the things I'm getting from this campus far outweigh having to live in Aliso Viejo. For example, next semester, I'm getting a study abroad at no extra cost in Japan. It's just normal tuition I have to pay. On paper, tuition and room and board look expensive, but in actuality, all of us are on scholarships and need-based aid. Traveling is really important to me so this is a huge win. Also, I'm interested in activism courses and international relations, so finding a school like this is neat because a ton of people on campus are interested in politics and political change. Of course, that isn't for everyone, but SUA really isn't a normal college experience... from what I've heard, parties here suck but I'm not a partier nor do I drink/smoke so that's no problem for me."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently in the undergraduate program. Definitely an interesting place to go to school. However, I realize it's not for everyone so I compiled a list of points that are important to address when considering this school.
Pros:
- 100% of students get financial aid. It's definitely affordable, even for students with less income.
- Study abroad built into the tuition. 4-5 months in a foreign country after being trained in a language. (Mandarin, French, Spanish, or Japanese).
- Only 1 roommate freshman year. Private room and 1 suitemate sophomore and junior year. Some seniors have their own private room and bathroom.
- Professors that are really passionate about the things they teach. 
- Safe campus. Lots of security around.
- Beautiful areas to take photos, study, or just spend time. 
Cons:
- Boring city (but very safe)
- No big party scene (this is actually a pro for me because I don't generally like alcohol, parties, or loud spaces, but I know some people are into party culture)."
Junior,5,"One of the things I like about Soka is the small class size. The faculty-student ratio is 1:8. Many classes are discussion-based, and I learned a lot from my classmates. In the beginning, I was not used to speaking up in class, but gradually I started to enjoy discussing with my classmates and became able to develop and express my ideas in class.
I would like to see a change in the improvement in treating students from diverse backgrounds. As the number of international students is about half of the student body, students come from different countries. However, some majority groups, such as white Americans or Japanese people, tend to be represented more than other groups of students. It is essential for the school to change in equally treating and considering students from various backgrounds."
Junior,5,"Soka University has provided so much for me these last three years. I have gained so many lifelong friends from all around the world. Soka currently has less than 450 students, yet there are students from around 40 other counties represented in the small student body. The students are all united in striving to learn the real significance of what it means to be human in this world. I have yet to learn many things but can already see and appreciate the changes that have taken place in my life from applying what I have learned. Soka's small discussion-based classes have played a significant role in this. Through the discussions, I have been able to understand my classmates' perspectives. The various ways we know the same topics and ideas reflect the multicultural environment we cohabit. There are many events sponsored by the school that connect the students to the surrounding communities and activities that unite the student body as a whole."
Freshman,5,"After meeting with a SUA alumnus educator in Japan, I started studying English. Since I was from a poor rural family, I never thought it would be possible to go abroad. However, after studying hard, I was able to get a full-tuition scholarship from SUA and now I'm studying at an extremely beautiful campus in California with great friends from over 45 countries around the world."
Sophomore,5,"If you are looking for a small campus and are passionate about seeking out the world, this is the place for you. SUA gives a lot of financial aid. Personally, I got enough aid that I don't have to take out any loans, which is pretty amazing giving the base price of the school. In terms of sports, we only currently have soccer, track and field/cross country, swimming, and women's golf, but this can grow in the future! We have a private gym, pool, track, field, workout rooms, basketball court, etc. There are a great variety of very nuanced courses that appeal to everyone's interest, no matter what they are. Everyone here is focused on succeeding and also contributing to society, so that makes focusing on academics rather easy here. I am studying Japanese (although there is Mandarin, French, and Spanish!) and in a year, I'll be embarking on my FREE study abroad. It's crazy what SUA offers, and it's definitely something to take advantage of.  I don't regret coming here at all."
Sophomore,5,"Professors are very approachable and knowledgeable. Unique programs like learning clusters, core, modes of inquiry, alternate spring break and Bridges to Business have been the highlight of my experience here. You get free laptop as well as free access to linkedInLearning. The dorms are super big and nice with free unlimited printing and super fast internet access. Everyone around is always nice and you always find people you get along with. You will also develop a lot of humility because if you do something embarrassing the whole college will find out sooner or later but hey thats a very important skill. If you just wanna party and hook up with someone new everyday this is not the place for you but if you are serious about education and want a very unique and wonderful experience, I highly recommend this university. Soka lions have got into Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Duke, London School of Economics as well as many other top colleges around the world."
Junior,5,"I am currently a second-year student, and so far, my experience at SUA has been great! If you are interested in liberal arts and ok with the small campus and student body, I would highly recommend attending SUA. The close contact with professors opens many doors for you, and the diversity of the school together with the guaranteed study abroad semester provides you with an open-minded and progressive education. While the city surrounding SUA is relatively small and quiet, there are many beautiful beaches and a variety of interesting communities in close proximity."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a sophomore at SUA. One thing that makes this university different is that you will get 100% of the professors’ attention for both class work and personal projects. Although it is always hard to start college, SUA has different resources to help each student learn the skills they need to get the most from their education career.
Just like any other university, you will be challenged to step out of your conscious and unconscious comfort zones; these include socially, academically and personally. However, SUA creates an environment that is safe enough for us to ask and understand anything."
Senior,5,"This is my 4th year at Soka, and I would really like to appreciate what Soka have given to me. I was able to study abroad in France and to have a great experience with my host family. Because I'm an International student, coming to Soka and going to France is like studying abroad during my 4-year study abroad. This experience contributed to gaining more confidence in myself. Moreover, a small class size is one of the best characteristic of Soka. If class size were big, I would not be able to speak in class or think class contents as serious issues. So, small class size really made me think who I am and what I can do to improve this society. Scholarship is another great thing about Soka, and if you study hard, it's possible to study and live on campus for free. Because of a small student body, the chance that you get full-scholarship is really high! So, if you want to seek your identity and to go overseas and learn about different culture, Soka might be the best school for you!"
Freshman,5,"When I applied to Soka University of America, I had troubles turning in my fee waiver so they extended my application deadline which allowed me to turn in my full application. The academics focuses on a worldview on becoming a global citizen focused on improving the world. The students are very diverse as most of them are from minority backgrounds and international students. The campus is very pretty and nice to walk around, as it is rather large for such a small student size."
Alum,5,"I graduated from this college.  I am currently a PhD student.  The college provided most of fundamental trainings for living a productive life as a researcher and also as global citizen.  The professors are passionate in teaching than most other prestigious universities.  Students tend to find a bigger dream while studying at Soka, and many alumni actually pursue their dreams.  The accomplishments of alumni are impressive."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing school, be aware that this is a small campus environment with a very tight-knit student body, and adjust expectations accordingly. There's a bit of everything here, and Soka does a very good job of supporting the individual's motivations. Definitely an environment for self-motivated learners as the discussion based nature of the education means that the more you put into your work the more you get out. Students also have great opportunities to build relationships with their professors, which leads to some really exceptional mentoring. Very safe and inclusive environment that really allows students to focus on their studies and interests."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Soka. What I like the most about Soka is the small student body. Classes often involve small discussions, and professors are always willing to answer any questions from students both in and outside of classes. Because I come from a country where rote learning and limited discussions are typical education style, the classes at Soka are eye-opening experiences. In addition to the unique academic opportunities of Soka, I would like to emphasize student activities. Majority of students participate in club activities, and there are multiple school events where they can perform and enjoy a lot of performances by other clubs. I myself joined one of the dance clubs on campus without knowing any basic. But now I get to know the joy of dancing and have a lot of fun in this club! So far, I am satisfied with the campus life here and have no regret to have chosen this school :)"
Senior,5,"I'm currently a 4th-year student at Soka University of America (SUA). Last semester, I studied abroad in Tokyo, Japan as part of SUA's language and culture program. I can say wholeheartedly that coming to SUA has been one of the best decisions of my life. After having studied, made friends, and grown as a person and member of the global community at SUA for over three years, I’m now prepared to take on challenges of the 21st century. Academically, I would say that SUA’s learning environment is not bound by classroom walls but encompasses the entire school. Classes are small, usually 12 students and rarely over 18, which means that students participate in meaningful discussion at every session. As for campus life, SUA makes sure that students are safe and healthy. Almost everyone lives in well-maintained on-campus residence halls. Laundry is free (!) and meals are included in room & board. Overall I’m very grateful to be studying SUA and developing myself alongside my classmates."
Sophomore,5,"Soka allows me to learn about other cultures, naturally, because there are so many international students from all over the world. Studying here allowed me to learn about the differences in cultures and made me realize that people live so differently outside of what I am used to. People here are really amazing and the professors are really passionate about what they teach. They work to make you understand the material if you are lost, and will never leave you stranded."
Sophomore,5,"I’m a sophomore at Soka University of America. It’s definitely a unique environment when it comes to small class sizes, having more contact with professors, and the generous amenities (aka spacious dorms and no communal bathrooms). Some aspects of Soka may not be your cup of tea; but like any college, you receive what you put into the experience. I was worried that I wouldn’t make deep connections when I first came to Soka, but people here are generally really nice and caring. Thanks to Soka, I have so many resources at my disposal to further my education/experience such as networking to alumni who are in my field of study and generous study abroad curriculum in my choice of country. This school isn’t perfect (small student body, only four concentrations of study, quiet surrounding area and student life) but it’s a great deal and I’ve grown so much here. Soka is definitely worth it."
Senior,5,"The small class sizes (average of 12 students per class, but in some cases as few as 3 students per class) makes it really easy to communicate with and learn from professors. I have received a fantastic education at this university. Dorms are so comfortable- I am currently living in a large room which I have to myself. We have concerts for only 5$ by some world renowned artists and we get to enjoy a state of the art performing arts center. It does get pretty quiet- there isn't a big party scene here, no frats and sororities (thankfully), and no night clubs in the immediate vicinity, but for those with cars or those who learn how to use public transport, this isn't a big obstacle."
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a first-year international student from Nepal enrolled at Soka University of America. Soka is a great liberal art college with students from over 40 nations of the world. It has a small student body, which facilitates interaction with professors within and outside the classroom. The interdisciplinary education and diverse community of Soka provide students with an ability to view things from a broader perspective. 
What I particularly like about Soka is its unique program called Learning Cluster that takes place during the month of January. A Learning Cluster is a research seminar where students work in teams with faculty facilitators to investigate a specific question. It helps in bridging theory and practice, and evoke an educated outcome. Apart from its great education, Soka is aesthetically gifted with a beautiful campus and natural beauty of the surrounding canyon. It's a great place to visit and take a walk!"
Senior,5,"I am a senior at Soka University of America, and I truly love this university in all aspects. Professors at Soka are academically accomplished, friendly but demanding, and they also become your mentors and close friends. Classes are rigorous but rewarding, and the curriculum is highly customizable and individually tailored. The student body is very diverse, and the campus community is accommodative to students of all backgrounds. Soka has about 30-35 student clubs. Campus is beautiful and pristine. Dorms are spacious (103 ft. per person), modern and furnished; the rooms also have private bathrooms. Cafeteria food is catered by the Bon Appetit Company and is delicious. Campus and the local area are very safe, but there is a lack of entertainment opportunities in general."
Junior,5,"I love this school! I just finished my second year at SUA, and it has been a great experience so far! I have grown a lot through the small class sizes and diverse population.  Making friends for me became much easier since all students live on campus.  One negative thing about living in Aliso Viejo is that there aren't many shops or restaurants outside campus because the city is so new, so sometimes it gets boring.  However, I would recommend this school to anyone looking for a safe learning environment!"
Freshman,5,"I love Soka University of America because of the helpful staff and teachers that they have there. I have never been to a school where the staff is totally connected to the student. I find it a great benefit that the classes usually have 9-12 students in them which is beneficial for me. I also like how the college is ascetically pleasing due to their fountain in the front. I feel safe when I am walking around the campus because the school is not located near any major city nor any place that would invite crime. I find it enjoyable that the school really puts into practice the mission of fostering global citizens due to the diverse student population here. I would not want to change this school in the least, I just hope it could become more recognized."
Sophomore,5,"Since I came here, I really love Soka!!! As an international student, I had many concerns regarding my communication skills in English, class styles, dorm lives, and so on, but thanks to the support from my friends, professors, RA, and faculties, I am enjoining my university life!! Soka offers liberal arts education and appreciates students' diversity, so here is definitely great place to expand your points of views and to figure out your identity!"
Alum,5,"Soka is a little multicultural gem palace in a sea of monotony and strip malls. It's curriculum and educational model is innovative, inspiring, and is positioned to be a forerunner for academic excellence in the 21st century. I simply cannot praise it enough."
College Junior,5,"The student body is so friendly, and we can connect to alumni easily as we have a website for it. The job opportunities are good and they give you chances for the job"
College Freshman,5,"SUA is a phenomenal school academically speaking. There are some bad professors sure, but you have that at any school. Almost every professor is incredibly intelligent, and they all teach classes themselves. More importantly, they're incredibly accessible, and you develop some really close bonds with certain profs. The class size cap (with a couple of exceptions) is 18, and 12 for language classes, so you really get a lot of interaction. The class diversity isn't the greatest, but that's down to the small size of the school more than anything."
College Freshman,5,"Drink if you want, don't if you don't want to, nobody will pressure you. There's definitely alternatives if you don't want to be around it, and even at parties you won't be judged. As far as drugs, some people smoke weed but that's really about it. A few people play around with psychedelics but hard drugs are basically never used."
College Freshman,5,"This isn't college, it's a resort. Freshies live in really spacious doubles (only two students per room, no forced triples) and the next three years singles are provided for everyone (apart from a few very unlucky people in the really big class of 2019). You never have to use public bathrooms, every room has its own. The dorms themselves are phenomenal and really clean. The only complaint is only the freshman dorms have a kitchenette, and there are no ovens for cooking. However, lots of students get around this by buying their own equipment for their rooms. Overall, we probably have the best living conditions of any college in the US."
College Freshman,5,"SUA is a tiny Liberal arts, and that comes with a lot of ups and downs. However, I absolutely love my university. From the students to the faculty to the campus itself and the opportunities we are provided, this is a truly unique place with no parallels that has opened my eyes in so many ways. We may be a little spoiled, but where else are you required to study a language and study abroad in a country that speaks it, and where else will all of your friends be from different nationalities. I could write a novel."
College Freshman,5,Professors care about each student and are very willing to offer office hours.
College Freshman,5,Dormitories are super nice. Students can enjoy there own space a lot. I am proud of SUA residential life.
College Freshman,5,"People here are from different cultures and countries, but we sincerely respect each other."
College Freshman,5,"great campus, very liberal and accepting. most diverse school i know"
College Freshman,5,I absolutely enjoy being in this school. I chose to come to this school because I knew Soka would teach me about myself where other school won't.
College Sophomore,5,"Before I came to Soka University of America, I was a person who is not very confident of myself. I had a hard time reaching out to my classmates and talking to them. I felt very comfortable being alone because I did not have to think about how to interact with other people and how they would judge me based on my actions. But after coming to this wonderful school, I became a totally different person. I feel the caring and warmth from my classmates and upperclassmen. Whenever anyone on campus has a very tough time in his or her life, people will give him/her support. This school is small, so everyone is so close to each other. Thanks to Soka, I have the opportunity to broaden my view and interact with people from all around the world."
Recent Alumnus,5,No one can match the Financial aid opportunities offered at sua!~
College Sophomore,5,"The dining hall is amazing!!! It is just not open as much as I wish.  And the food is really good.  If you want to go to Soka, I recommend that you try the food.  We are very welcoming to people around the community and so feel free to come by!"
College Sophomore,5,"Okay, let me be perfectly honest. There are times when I scream ""I HATE SOKA UNIVERSITY."" But when the end of the day comes, I'm so happy that I came. Despite every issue and challenge I have faced here, I would choose Soka a thousand times again."
College Junior,5,I really got to bond with my roommate and dormates. The campus housing is the best from all the other universities I have toured in the past. People respect others' privacy.
College Junior,5,"This university is located in the mountains and secluded in area of houses and neighborhoods. It is located in Aliso Viejo, a pretty new city in OC. There are rarely any crimes. The security and the school is really helpful and resourceful. I love the environment and how the school treats the student's safety as one of many top priorities."
College Freshman,5,Academics at Soka are great! Just make sure you talk to other students about which classes and professors are best. Remember that everyone has different opinions and learning styles though! The admissions counselors at SUA are super sweet and will help you through 100% of the process.
College Freshman,5,Registered nurse on campus for students every day of the week. Campus safety is on patrol 24/7. I've never ever felt unsafe on campus.
College Freshman,5,"The dorms are extremely nice - much better than the majority of colleges. Private bathrooms. Sophomore year and up you get a private room and you share a common room and bathroom with 1 roommate. Living rooms, computer rooms, free laundry, pantries with fridges, TVs."
College Freshman,5,Parking is free for students and there are lots all over campus.
College Freshman,5,"Soka was my first choice of colleges. It's definitely not the right school for everyone, though. If you really care about getting a transformative education inside and outside of the classroom, you should look into Soka. Being a student here can be very difficult but completely worth it."
College Freshman,5,"There are many unique aspects to Soka, so I'll only list a few. Every student is required to take a foreign language and then study abroad in a country that speaks that language during their junior year. Almost every single faculty and staff member is so kind and truly cares about the students. Everyone from the shuttle driver to the president of the school cares about you."
College Freshman,5,"Because the school opened to 2001, the entire campus is extremely nice and well kept. I have had friends who go to other older universities that have commented on how nice all the building are. The university works very hard to maintain its image. The buildings and landscaping are always well kept."
College Sophomore,5,"All students have a Liberal Arts Major which is awesome because it's an integrated education. There are 4 concentrations, I am working towards one in Social and Behavior Science. There are so many resources- career counseling, internship, work and travel grants/opportunities. This school is the most supportive school where you work directly with the professors and are never taught by T/A's."
College Freshman,5,most students got a full ride and the rest got really close it... tons of my friends even got refunds from the school to buy books and stuff.. soka was my cheapest option and i know that a lot of kids chose soka because of how much money the school can give... they give their students tons of money because the schools new and they can use that to get really awesome students :)
College Freshman,5,"students from malaysia, china, france, japan, india, canada, venezuela, america (of course).. it's awesome!! i can learn about so many cultures just talking to people at lunch"
College Sophomore,5,"Soka University provides great campus housing! Though you don't necessarily get to choose what kind of housing you get. Freshman are typically in spacious double rooms, sophomores and juniors go into suite styled rooms that have two separate rooms connected by a horizontal hallway, while seniors have the option of suites or single room.

Each room is equipped with air conditioning, a private bathroom, and the usual desk, bed, and closet furniture. There are also at least one larger room for anyone with disabilities on each floor.

The 1st floor is reserved for the dorm office and multipurpose room. The 2nd floor has a multifaith room where people can practice their faith outside of their room. Printing is free in the computer rooms located on the 3rd and 4th floor of each dorm building. There are also a telecom room and living room on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floor. A lot of people spend their time studying or hanging out in the living room. 

Social atmosphere is great, it feels like one big family as the school is small enough to know everyone. There are plenty of socials amount different classes."
College Sophomore,5,"Campus food is awesomeee! We always have 3 main course options for lunch or dinner and our international meals are too good to be college food! We always have vegan and vegetarian options. Every few days there are meals with locally grown produce. We often have a lot of european, asian, hispanic, and indian meals.  However, if you're ever homesick, the chefs would happily take recipes to make you a ""home cooked"" meal! Campus dining is all you can eat and you have unlimited swipes that come with the cost of dorming. Not free, but already ""paid"" for. I'll have to admit that by the end of first semester, you become more selective of the food (since we're so spoiled) and might want to eat out a few times. There are your typical American fast foods around Aliso Viejo and some specialty restaurants like Peruvian and Vietnamese. 
We are also given $50 to spend at what we call Sokafe, where we can get snacks when the cafeteria is closed. This could be coffee, chips, muffins, ramen, etc. My favorite are the spam musubis on Sundays and Wednesdays!"
College Sophomore,5,"You don't really need a car on campus as we have a shuttle system that comes every half hour from morning to early evening. If you're someone who wants to eat out late at night or go outside of a 5 mile radius frequently, then you may want to have a car, or make friends with someone with a car.
Parking permits are free and everyone's respectful enough not to do anything that would lead to a ticket or fine. 
Parking can be great or somewhat annoying depending on which side of campus you live on. One side never lacks parking and is located right outside of two dorms. The other doesn't always have enough parking and is a little farther from the freshman dorm. Often enough you may find yourself parking on the side of the smaller parking lot or parking closer to classes, which is still less than a 5 minute walk. I know most colleges have a more difficult time with parking, and a 5 minute walk really is nothing, so A+!"
College Sophomore,5,"Soka University has an extremely diverse student body. The university has a strong international program so there are students that come from places as diverse as Peru, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Kenya, and lots of other countries. There is a strong LGBT presence on the campus and gays are openly accepted; there are many homosexuals who are open with their sexuality. In fact, Soka was founded on the virtue of having an open mindset and this is achieved by meeting people from all around the world, the US, and from different backgrounds, which can greatly change a person's attitude just from being on campus"
College Senior,5,"Since our school is just entering its 12th year, all of our facilities are extremely new. Furthermore, our facilities staff on campus is working around the clock to ensure that our campus remains functioning properly and beautiful!"
College Senior,5,"SUA has an amazing curriculum. Being a liberal arts university, each student has to take a variety of courses for GE. But because we're extremely multi-disciplinary, things learned in one class can usually be easily applied to other classes and courses. Our classroom discussions are amazing, allowing students and professors alike to learn from each other."
College Senior,5,"Our campus housing is extremely unique and extraordinary. First, that on-campus housing is a requirement for all 4 years. But in return, our rooms are luxurious. All rooms come with a bed, closet and desk, and each has their own private bathroom (no communal bathrooms). Because all the students live together, it creates an enormous sense of community and comfort. We're not just students living together--we become a family."
College Senior,5,"Because of our small faculty-to-student ratio (9:1), all of our professors are able to provide full attention to the students. Our classes are mainly discussion-based so no voice goes unheard or ignored. The professors are genuinely interested in the students' learning and always has their doors open to help. If a student is interested in something that the professor isn't too well-versed in, they will learn alongside the student."
College Sophomore,5,"Compared to most schools, we've got it good here at SUA. There are campus shuttles that work on a 9am-10pm schedule. The shuttle picks up students at the shuttle stop every half hour and drops them off anywhere within a 5 mile radius. 
Special requests can be made to go to Laguna Beach, or to Mission Viejo Mall, or the train station."
College Junior,5,"Upon entry, each student receives their own lap tops. Soka also has a computer lab with great computers equipped with music and photo editing software. Also, every dorm has a printer and rooms with Wi-fi. The wi-fi at soka is very accessible and fast."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the liberal arts experience at my school since I get to choose what I would like to study. However, it'd be great if the admins were more accommodating and more open to listen to the students, since there've been students' movements about it. Other than that, it's a pretty close community, and if you manage your place, you'd be alright!"
Freshman,4,Soka is a beautiful school. It only offers a liberal arts degree. It has about 400 students. It is not in the best location because Aliso Viejo does not offer much to do. It is important to get off campus to find fun things to do.
Freshman,4,"Nice dorms, decent food, terrible parties, nice professors, interesting classes, small class size (average is maybe 13), small enrollment size (around 500 students), very good financial aid, mandatory study abroad, not that many sports, lots of clubs, the campus is kind of dead after classes (literally looks like a ghost town), beautiful campus, amazing people, pretty diverse... I think that sums it up."
Senior,4,"From the small class sizes (Ratio 9:1, student to professor) to multiple opportunities abroad AND incredible financial aid options for both domestic and international students, Soka University of America, proves to be a wonderful education for anyone looking to expand their education far beyond a bachelor's degree. The education you obtain from attending Soka are real life skills, human skills, and global skills that will put any student on the map (literally) after graduating from this institution."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at Soka University, and I love this college! The class size is so small (12 students on average, I guess) and you can build a one-on-one relationship with your professor. In my first year, I worked as a research assistant for a professor and helped him publish his book. I think at other colleges, you can not gain experiences like this from the first year! Even the total number of students is around 400, and third-year students are required to study abroad in their fall or spring semester. So that around 50 students are always off-campus for their study abroad, which makes the number of students on campus around 350. It is a very small community, selected to be global citizens. Of course, there are cons about being in a small community, (like, you have to see your ex, or someone you don't like very often), but knowing everyone on campus gives you a sense of unity and belonging to the college."
Senior,4,"What I really like about Soka is the fact that it's very easy for students to approach professors. Because of the small class size, there's much room for interactions between students and professors through discussions. And professors give you through feedback on your papers, which is very helpful. They are also available outside the classroom. You can go to their offices or eat meals with them at the cafeteria. I've learned so much through close interactions with great professors, which Soka encourages and makes it easy to have."
Junior,4,Soka is a great university with very good professors. The ideals and beliefs of this school are incredible and lead student to become global citizens. The students are somewhat treated like kids though without much freedom. The athletics is also very bad with terrible athletic staff.
Freshman,4,Great university to come to with no need to worry about cost. Learn a lot with the diversity of the school. Student life needs to improve drastically.
Senior,4,"I really appreciate the small class size here, which encourages student engagement in the classroom.  We have discussions or small group activities in class. You can't just sit and listen, but you have to participate, which is sometimes challenging, but rewarding. If you carefully choose the professor, you can get a lot out of each course. I also appreciate Soka's diverse student body. I've been able to talk with people from different backgrounds and become friends, and I've learned so much from those interactions.  There have been times when I struggled with cultural differences, but all struggles helped me grow as a person. The small campus can be a little bit suffocating sometimes, but it depends on the kind of relationships you have with people, and overall I like how we can cultivate deep and intimate relationships."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a first-year student. I plan on concentrating in either environmental studies or humanities, and I am taking Chinese as my foreign language. SUA is wonderful school and I'm honestly not sure where I would be without it. Our student body is small, just 450 students, which allows for a strong sense of community. The student body is really diverse, so as a third-culture kid, I feel at home here. Also, most students are dedicated and interested in many different things. Almost all of us are involved in many things outside of academics (for example, I am part of the school play and am in a social justice and a poetry club; I also work in the student garden). I can pursue my passions and be myself here. The academics are challenging and interesting, and I feel like they are actually meaningful to my life. Also, SUA has really great resources and facilities - for example, free printing, free laundry, and private bathrooms."
Sophomore,4,"Financial Aid is definitely one of the best selling points of Soka, but it's not because we are solely a rich school with a lot of money so spare; it's because Soka believes in equal opportunities for young people to pursue education without being hindered by their financial difficulty. To me, however, the mission statement and community of care stand out to me the most. This is a friendly campus whose students are overall studious, open-minded and very talented! Diversity is another great bonus (and important to me), although you do find many Japanese. However, this makes sense regarding the history of Soka so no big deal. It's not like you get discriminated for being non-Japanese. I have learned so much about human connection in Soka and made wonderful friends!"
College Freshman,4,"The staff has been extremely helpful and engaging as I start my first year. The other students seem interested in learning and want to make a difference. I am glad I chose such a small school, and I am amazed everyone else is so much like me. So far, Soka has been a very positive experience."
College Junior,4,We have our own separate rooms and it is pretty big. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating
College Junior,4,"The campus is pretty safe , even if you put the laptop in the public area, it will not be stolen. And the security will check around the campus very often."
College Junior,4,"They are friendly and have good teamwork, they would try their best to help each other. They have a good support from the students."
College Freshman,4,"Internationally our statistics speak for themselves. Lots of Japanese students, but also very many from other countries. Economically there are people in varying economic situations from around the world, but Soka's financial aid is great enough to where that doesn't really make a difference for attendance and no one really talks about economic background. Religiously speaking, there are many SGI Buddhists (makes complete sense when you look at the origins of the school), but they're never in your face about it, and there's a variety of other religions practiced. I'm personally Christian and have never had an issue with my faith being criticized, but I have heard of some other students who felt like they didn't feel incredibly comfortable being Christian while in some class. From a sexual/gender perspective, Soka is also diverse for it's size. There are a number of students who identify as queer, transgender, pansexual or gender non-binary. Political diversity may be the one area where we don't have much variance. The campus is very left leaning, and any variation of thought really comes down to moderates vs hardcore liberals. It's difficult to express any sort of conservative opinion in class, something which I really think holds the school back. You lose sense of what the real world is like when you're only surrounded by one type of thinking, and it really feeds into some of the over idealism that can pervade Soka. Besides that one issue though, Soka's campus is incredibly diverse."
College Freshman,4,"As far as direct safety is concerned, it really doesn't get better than Soka. Controlled access to campus, lots of security  (who are friendly if you get to know them), and keycard access to most buildings. It's also in the middle of Orange County, meaning that this is realistically one of the safest campuses in the US. We have had some anger towards administration with their treatment of sexual assault cases, but this is hopefully improving."
College Freshman,4,"Like any school, there are phenomenal professors and less than stellar ones. Overall I love how open the professors are (no TA's ever). They're easy to talk to, encourage you to come in outside of class, and I've even had dinner or hung out with a few off campus. Most try to keep classes interesting and engaging. That being said, the high number of prerequisites (Liberal Arts remember?) means that some classes can be a little stale. It's also really tough to disagree with certain teachers about politics without getting shouted down by both them and the class. This is a very liberal and idealistic campus, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it sometimes manifests itself in making more conservative leaning students uncomfortable, which is bad."
College Freshman,4,"It's a Liberal Arts degree, so going straight into career searching with it isn't necessarily the best idea. That being said, this institution is only getting stronger and stronger in terms of prestige. We're rated as top 10 for schools in California, and especially for Grad School quiet a few people know who we are. The internship and career services departments are phenomenal, and will work closely with you to ensure that you get proper opportunities that suit your interests. This is actually a way that many students get jobs. As far as the alumni network, it's still very small because of the age of the school, but it punches far above its weight. It's also very tight knit because of its size."
College Freshman,4,"While the teams my be small, the athletes that participate are very good. The facilities themselves are beyond compare. Professional athletes will frequently come train in our facilities."
College Sophomore,4,The housing is pretty convenient. It can be a little difficult to pick out your room depending on what type of room you want.
College Freshman,4,"We have four concentrations, including Humanities, Social Behavior Studies, International Studies, and Environmental Studies."
College Freshman,4,I seldom see or hear about drug problems. I thnk it is rare.
College Freshman,4,"Soka allows me to freely explore my interests, which I really appreciate."
College Freshman,4,People here at soka are very nice and freindly.
College Freshman,4,"This is my first year here at Soka. I actually came the year after I was accepted because they allowed me to defer my enrollment to take a gap year, which was an amazing opportunity. The atmosphere of the school is very peaceful, you get to know your teachers on a first name basis, the food here is absolutely amazing, and the facilities are in great shape since it's a relatively new school. The downside of such a small school is that it can feel empty at times when you crave a more lively atmosphere, although there are some events during the weekends that are usually fun. 

The city of Aliso Viejo doesn't have much to offer in terms of entertainment or job/internship opportunities, as far as I have experienced. It's unfortunate that there is nothing to do around the campus. I've taken walks off campus and it's all just neighborhoods along a busy street. The only local attractions are the town center and some other shopping centers, which we can easily take the shuttle to access. There's a movie theatre, some grocery stores, and your usual shopping and fast food. 

Internships are pretty slim since it's a very small, suburban city. Lots of teacher's aid internships at local schools, some local NGOs, the country club, the Laguna Hills organization that does conservation and education outreach about the nearby wilderness preserve. It really is what you choose to make of it, though. Many people have had rewarding internship experiences, and it isn't completely limited to what's nearby (if it's during the school year, if you don't have a car, then you are limited to what the shuttle can take you to). However, students have done overseas internships too, which can be a neat experience. 

Highlights: very supportive of students' needs, campus is clean, safe and beautiful, living standard is very comfortable, professors are reviewed by students after every semester, high quality faculty, small class sizes, facilities are very well maintained, students are happy"
College Freshman,4,"I will begin my freshman year of college this fall and have not yet attended classes. However, I have visited my school twice and talked to people that are attending and the whole atmosphere is fantastic. While I cannot give them five stars because I have not yet participated, I really love being there."
Recent Alumnus,4,The food is good and the ingredients are prepared organically
Recent Alumnus,4,Students never have to share a room with more than one person in the entire student career. Students get personal bathrooms and have a lot of freedom in the dorms. The Housing is very luxurious
College Sophomore,4,"There is the Aliso Viejo Town Center down the mountain (3 minute drive) that has a Chile's, Taco Bell, Subway, Jamba Juice, Panera Bread, Ralphs, etc."
College Sophomore,4,We just post on the Soka facebook when we're bored.  We find some people who want to hang out and go! It's very friendly and chill.
College Sophomore,4,"The teams are okay, but it is always a fun community building experience to attend."
College Sophomore,4,You can get away with a lot on campus. They're all big talk when it comes to a lot of things. Keep the parties with drinking out of the freshmen dorms (which are dry no matter the ages) and everyone is happy.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are super nice. There is no ""bad"" dorm. Each one is the same, lol."
College Sophomore,4,"I mean we have some nice places near by, but some are just Del Taco or In-N-Out. I really enjoy the local restaurants, though there are few."
College Junior,4,"I love the weather of SUA. It is not too cold and not too hot, since its located in Southern California."
College Freshman,4,Really wonderful students attend Soka! Dating can be a bit difficult because the student body is so small but people do it.
College Freshman,4,"98% of student receive some sort of financial aid. Financial need-based, athletic, merit and full-ride scholarships are available."
College Freshman,4,"The cafeteria is all-you-can-eat buffet style. It is included in your room & board. Most of the time the food is really good. All fresh ingredients. If you don't like what's being served you can make a salad or sandwich. You can also go to the grill and order stir-fry, hamburgers, hotdogs, and more. Usually at least one gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian option (but not always)."
College Freshman,4,"The weather is almost always sunny and warm. Sometimes it would be nice to get a bit of rain and clouds, but I really can't complain."
College Freshman,4,"Aliso Viejo is a newer town that is pretty high income. There are nice restaurants, grocery stores, and a few places to shop. I wish there was more coffee shop sort of places, but it is a very residential neighborhood in southern OC so it makes sense. Campus is surrounded by a beautiful canyon that has lots of awesome paths. You can also hike through the canyon to Laguna Beach."
College Sophomore,4,"Workload is pretty large, but you will learn so much and be rewarded for it. Professors are all so smart and willing to work with their students on everything."
College Freshman,4,"sometimes i see and smell people smoking but its really easy to avoid those people when they're smoking... compared to other schools, soka kids dont really drink or smoke or do anything like that"
College Freshman,4,"we are taught ONLY by actual professors, no grad students; teachers have VAST experience (a lot come from poverty and rose themselves us) and lots come from big schools like harvard and stanford... of course, theres some boring teachers that focus only on memorization and lecture, but for the most part, theyre good"
College Freshman,4,our teams are good and students support athletics.. but athletics are not as competitive as other schools (we dont have football or cheerleading at all)
College Sophomore,4,"At Soka University, only Liberal Arts degrees are offered under one or two of four concentrations (Social Behavioral Sciences, Environmental Sciences, Humanities, and International Studies). I am still undecided between Social Behavioral Sciences and International Studies as my interests lie in the economies of South East Asia. Our average classroom size is 13 and it makes it very easy to talk to professors. Soka has only been around for a little over a decade, so everything is still pretty new and in great condition. We have great local and abroad internships in just about everything as well as a mandatory study abroad program.  I love just about everything about Soka! The only thing I would want is to have more classes in regards to South East Asia--that would make it an A+"
College Sophomore,4,"Soka is a liberal arts college with currently four concentrations: Humanities, Environmental Studies, International Studies, and Social Behavioral Sciences. There are both classes that fall under these concentrations and required classes that students must take. Most of the classes are enlightening in their philosophical curriculum of classes that range from social issues to art and music. Students take an average of four classes a semester or more, and there are many opportunities on campus for assistance. There are also many on-campus jobs that students can have with the library, IT and performance center, and internships are routinely offered."
College Freshman,4,There is a very tiny percentage of noticeable drug use at this school. I feel grateful to attend a school that I feel comfortable being who I am. There is a very small amount of peer pressure.
College Sophomore,4,"Off-Campus Wonders – In my opinion, Aliso Viejo has a wide variety of restaurants to choose from for such a small and young town. Town Center is filled with restaurants. Since I have just finished my first year at Soka, I can't name many restaurants. I personally didn't go off-campus to eat much. I don;t like to spend money on food when I can just get it for free on-campus. I only ate out on special occasions or if I was peer pressured by my friends."
College Student,4,Lovely Shuttles Are Lovely – The shuttle takes you anywhere within a five mile radius
College Junior,4,"Campus Is Quite Safe – SUA is not very big on drugs. Usually students would prefer to get together to drink rather than take drugs. However, the few that do, would usually just smoke."
College Junior,4,"Highly International – Soka University of America is probably the most international institution I have ever been a part of. At least 50% of its student body comes from foreign countries (including myself). Moreover, many members of the faculty, staff and administration are also not American. The variety of nationalities and ethnic groups makes this university a wonderful educational environment."
College Junior,4,"Varied but Repetitive – The school's cafeteria tries hard to keep its cuisine as varied as possible, so to satisfy the taste of as many international students as possible. Moreover, it purchases most of its products from local farms and prefers fresh organic foods. The only problem is the repetitiveness of meals."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Buffet Style Meals – For lunch and dinner there are usually three dining options at the bistro, and if you don't like them there is the salad bar which also has deli meat. There are always bagels, bread, rice, and cereal available. 
For breakfast there is a buffet of scrambled eggs, sausage, waffles, tofu, tater tots, or something similar. There is always fresh fruit and fresh orange juice/grapefruit juice. You can also order your own style of eggs from the chef. 
The lunch and dinner options tend to be a bit unconventional. There is often Japanese styled fish, rice with curry, Indian food, jambalaya, etc. You can always order a burger or a chicken sandwhich."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's College – alcohol is used by all ages as long as it is kept hidden from RAs. When students are loud, the RAs will take alcohol away from the youths. There are some who use marijuana but they are very careful to avoid visibility."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's College – alcohol is used by all ages as long as it is kept hidden from RAs. When students are loud, the RAs will take alcohol away from the youths. There are some who use marijuana but they are very careful to avoid visibility."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The weather for the most part is amazing. It is hot during the day and breezy at night. There are windy storms from November to February, which are really chilly. But other than that it is wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,"Global Citizens – As it is a small campus, it is easy to form relationships at Soka whether intimate or not. Soka University of America accepts and aids students from all over the world so there is much diversity on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"No Flip Flops in the Shower! Soka University of America, being a ten year school you will find  the dormitories to be clean and fresh. Each room has a private toilet and shower so you don't have to wear flip flops while you shower or brush your teeth. Although the campus in not conveniently located, there are many options when it comes to finding things to do such as club activities and sports."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, the diversity on campus is pretty good. We have students from over 40 countries and many domestic as well. I feel like everyone pretty much accepts everyone else, and in my year there, have not felt any racism or prejudice goes on. Religion and sexual orientation are also very well respected and accepted at school. The students are very supportive of each other."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the faculty are entirely unhelpful, and some of them will personally attack your character. I've had some pretty awful experiences with administration here."
College Sophomore,2,The school does a lot of suppress victims of sexual assault.
College Sophomore,2,"About 60% of the school is from Japan, the other 40% is riddled with people of Japanese descent or members of SGI. While there are a lot of different people, many want everyone to act the same: be quiet during day, go to parties, study a lot. You feel a little judged if you don't follow these things. It's kinda awkward sometimes."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Middle of Nowhere – It's sort of in the middle of nowhere. It is a rich town that has little history. Fortunately there are several attractive towns surrounding, like Mission Viejo and Laguna Beach. It is over a half hour drive to Laguna Beach, and students don't go there often because it has an isolationist vibe. Aliso Viejo itself has little culture so the local attitude towards students is neutral. Irvine Spectrum is a mall about a half hour away, and the shuttle goes there every weekend."
College Junior,2,"The Contstant Pink Elephant – There has been this issue of whether or not the school is run greatly influenced by the SGI Buddhist community within the school. It has gotten to the point where dialogues and huge discussions would be held, which seem more to keep the facade of perfect school, rather than fixing any problems like religious differences"
College Freshman,2,"Non-Asian Students Are Isolated. Nearly everyone here is Asian or Asian-American, and nearly all of them are of Japanese descent.  You'll fit in great if you speak Japanese, but if not then you will frequently feel isolated."
College Freshman,2,"SUA provides full tuition to any student whose family income does not exceeed $60,000 per year. They also provide Merit scholarships (up to $20,000 per year) to all incoming Freshman, renewable annually.  The problem is, if your family income is $61,000 per year, you're out of luck.  Additionally, the merit scholarships barely make a dent in the $40,000/year tuition. Furthermore, though your merit scholarship is renewable annually, the amount never changes.  That means if they offer you $1000 per year, you will only get $1000 per year, even if you get straight As every semester."
College Junior,2,"Study School – At SUA we have a concept called ""Soka Vision"" where people date based on personality, not looks. With a campus of about 450 students, there tends to be more general knowledge when two people are dating, which can sometimes be stressful."
Alum,1,"Everyone who gives 5 star reviews is blatantly exaggerating about the merits of this school. Just like all the Sgi buddhists who are devoted to their leader Ikeda, they have blind devotion to a really underwhelming curriculum that wastes our money on ""CORE"" classes which won't do us any good in the real world. It's embarassing to think I've wasted my money on this. No one wants to admit it, but it's a costly mistake you should avoid if you can. Go to a school with a reputation that has actual majors. Don't go to a school a school based on the positive vibes you get from it, because that's probably the only thing drawing you here, and after 4 years you will realize it's all fake anyway. You think you want to be with ""global-minded"" students? Go to a good school where you can get a job doing global-minded things whatever that may be. Don't go to soka just because the people there claim to care about the world. That's not worth 30k a year!"
College Junior,1,"There is a shuttle system on campus, but it only meets the most basic of students' needs. The current system is designed to run every 30 minutes along a circular route to AV Town Center, Target, and Walmart. In reality, it is a good day when the shuttle is able to stick to this 30 minute schedule. A simple trip to Target can easily become an hour long process with the more reliable shuttle drivers, and an hours (multiple) long process with the less reliable drivers.The shuttle can take you to other locations, but they must be within a 5 mile range of Soka (in Orange County, this not get you very far). The shuttle will not take students to the closest airport (John Wayne/Orange County International), and it can be difficult to arrange a ride even to the nearest train station (Irvine). On top of that, it is difficult for many students financially to get to the airport or train station as there are practically no reliable bus lines in the area, so your only options are a $40+ taxi ride or a similarly priced airport shuttle. All in all, while I understand that it must be difficult to operate any transportation service that is free to students, I do believe there is much room for improvement."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are a few hardworking people who get full scholarships, but for the rest, it is almost insignificant."
Recent Alumnus,1,Some people drive two hours away to LA to go clubbing. The students try their best to be like a normal college. They throw occasional dorm parties.
College Freshman,1,"Bring a Car or Suffer. The campus is beautiful, but it's truly in the middle of nowhere.  The nearest bus stop is a 45-minute walk.  Our campus provides a ""complimentary"" shuttle service to nearby locations such as Target, but it's extremely unreliable.  Students should plan to bring their own car if they want to leave campus at any point."
College Freshman,1,There are no clubs whatsoever in Aliso Viejo and the only things open past 10pm are Del Taco and CVS.  Your best bet is to drive an hour to LA.

Freshman,5,Everything is pretty simple and everyone is helpful. Professors are helpful to and understanding. They made a quick changes with everything that is going on right now.
Freshman,5,WCU has a great campus and there is a lot of locations that you can study at. The community feels like you are a part of a big family. Everyone is open about everything and always there to help. Everyone will find something that they like best.
Junior,5,You can tell the professors really care. Everyone is very nice and wants you to do well. The area is also very nice and is full of local business.
Freshman,5,Awesome college. Love this college so far and I am a freshman. Doing school from online but West Chester is handling its very well.
Freshman,5,Going remote from home at West Chester which is just like taking online classes. Love how they are handling it.
Freshman,5,The classes are good. professors are good for working with what they have. classes are the same length. very engaging.
Freshman,5,everyone is so nice and it's very inclusive. Very diverse you can see any group you identify with. very safe.
Freshman,5,I am really looking for to the opportunities that will be available to me at WCUPA.  Especially with the marching band!! Go Rams!
Freshman,5,They have really made an effort to keep me informed with all of the changes going on at school.  I appreciate all of the weekly notices that have relayed everything that I have needed to know to be able to move forward with my degree in Music Education.
Alum,5,"Learning online was a tough adjustment, but I think West Chester did the correct thing during this time. The professors were understanding, and the university was very fair with refunds."
Junior,5,Online classes were supported by speedy responses from professors and Zoom office hours during COVID-19. This was also bolstered by frequent notifications from D2L and student emails.
Junior,5,"West Chester University provides the best experience a student could ask for. Not only is the tuition affordable, but the education is on par with universities of a higher pricetag. On campus, you'll find excellent SAGA and diversity student clubs and a quality recreational building alongside student living buildings, ensuring a degree of convenience. Additionally, West Chester has the needs of every student in mind with frequent surveys and emails regarding important events and are open to suggestions of how they should improve, with an emphasis on disenfranchised/POC students."
Junior,5,Due to COVID-19. There is a possibility that I will have to take online classes for a whole semester. This shouldn't be a problem because the second half of my semester last semester was turned to online due to COVID-19 and my experience with the transition was seamless.
Sophomore,5,My professors did an excellent job of adjusting our courses from person-to-person to online. They were really prepared for anything and everything.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love it! The campus is really nice plus the town is just a 15 minute walk away with great restaurants.
Sophomore,5,"So happy I came here—I miss being on campus so much though due to the virus sending us home. Online learning just isn’t the same, but my professors have been giving 200% . We really need to be on campus. I had so many internships possibilities for my junior year that I hope still happen. It’s one of the reasons I chose to come here—West Chester and Philadelphia have so much to offer with internships. Please have on campus classes!"
Sophomore,5,4 of my 5 classes were handled extremely well. The professor was really engaging and I feel like I learned just as much as usual. But I had one dud class that I feel could have been better. Hoping next year my junior year we will be back. I want to start my internships.
Senior,5,I have taken a few online classes and overall have had a wonderful experience.  The professors take time to set up the online courses in a way to easily navigate them and that are straight forward.  The professors are easily accessible even in a virtual setting.
Senior,5,"I really enjoy my time at West Chester University.  I am a commuter so I can't speak to campus life, but the campus is well managed and I really like the food trucks that are on Church Street!"
Sophomore,5,I loved my freshman year at West Chester.  The professors and fellow classmates are great! Dorms were good.  Food is average.
Senior,5,"I love how close all the students are. We talk to everyone, not just the students we are majoring with. All students excell and create wonderful friendships! We love each other and are open with each other. We basically live together because we're with everyone all day and have deep conversations. West Chester University is the best college and invites all students who are willing to expand their mind and heart."
Freshman,5,I love west chester university. They handled the covid-19 situation in an amazing way. They have great academics and it’s a fun campus. Diverse campus! And great dorms. So many resources for help!
Freshman,5,"A few things I love about West Chester University is the location, the relatively affordable price and the amazing professors that teach us.
The only thing I would change about WCU if I could would be the food options."
Freshman,5,"I love the area and the many clubs offered here. My dad also went to West Chester University which definitely impacted my decision on choosing West Chester. I grew up a half hour from West Chester and growing up driving through it to eat at Barnaby's every Saturday, I knew it was the right college for me. I do not regret my decision. College is very expensive in general but West Chester makes it affordable for me and offers university loans."
Junior,5,"I didn't even really want to come to West Chester to begin with. It was my third choice school and I decided on it because they gave me the most in terms of financial aid. However, I've loved it more and more with each passing day I've been here. It genuinely feels like home and when I'm actually back at home I'm itching to return to the area. It's definitely a community I could see myself settling down in later in life. It has its troubles but that's what builds character."
Sophomore,5,"West Chester university is a 4 star school. I am so proud to be in my second year, I learned so much through these 2 years and I can’t wait to learn more. Our campus is pretty huge and we may be a bit overpopulated. However we are very diverse and our our athletic teams are top 5 in the country."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community and the amount of effort the university puts into all of their students. As a student who has moved to the United States for college, West Chester was very accepting and made the changes in my life very manageable. Some of the facilities around the school, such as study areas and food options could use some attention as there is not a very large variety."
Niche User,5,"I have only had the privilege of visiting West Chester University a few times, but experiencing their campus is the best thing I have ever been exposed to. The campus has a very historic aspect, while still looking brand new. The school offers amazing programs, and support with any questions during the process. I am privileged to say that I am spending my next four years as a Golden Ram."
Senior,5,I loved my experience at West Chester University. My professors were very approachable.  The food was just OK. I met many interesting people and made lots of friends. The town of West Chester is very cool with easy access to Philadelphia.
Freshman,5,"This University is everything you could ask for. They have an amazing education program, great housing, and the community is so warm and friendly. I am glad to call West Chester my home for the next four years!"
Freshman,5,"As being a freshman on campus all I can say is that I love it. West Chester is my new home I never want to leave. I  got to join many clubs my first semester and the people who run the clubs make you feel very welcomed, it honestly didn't take that long for me to get adjusted to campus. I currently live in the USH dorms, those dorms are very home like. I have a lot of space and the building is very clean I haven't had any problems and I can say it is very worth it for the price that I pay. Now for my classes I can say that I had all friendly professors. The professor are always available for help and as being a Biology major I can say that my first semester wasn't bad at all."
Junior,5,"I am currently a Junior at West Chester University and I love the school, the campus, and the town of West Chester. There are many great restaurants and bars in the town. WCU also has a great Honors College program and Education program."
Senior,5,"I loved West Chester University. The campus is a nice size and they are always improving buildings and other part of campus for their students. The area surrounding campus is very safe and fun to travel to. Everything is in walking distance which is so nice. The food could be better however, once you are off campus you can cook for yourself."
Alum,5,"West Chester is an amazing college--loved every minute of my time there. Current students--get involved! It mades such a huge difference in your happiness. It took me until my Junior year to really become part of clubs & activities....I wish I didn't wait so long because I only had 2 years of being part of the school culture. Do the weekend trips! Professors cared so much about my success. My only criticism is the food wasn't the greatest and parking needed improvement. I had no problems finding work in marketing and had my first job lined up before I even graduated. Oh... the housing costs were getting out of control by the time I left, but I guess that is partially due to the location. It's an expensive area."
Sophomore,5,"I like the campus, it is beautiful and short walks to class. I like the town of West Chester, it is close and fun to walk around. I would like to see change in dining. The food is not terrible, but there should be more options."
Sophomore,5,"West Chester University has been a wonderful home away from home so far this semester. I am a transfer student from Melbourne, Australia, trying to see more of the world in coming to the United States. I am here playing field hockey for the Golden Rams, and have loved every minute so far. It is challenging, but the resources and wonderful people at West Chester have allowed me to become a stronger, more independent, and overall better person for doing this. I am struggling financially a bit and with being homesick, but with the wonderful RAMily I have built for myself, every day is getting easier. The location is also great! I obviously have a love for travel, and with the town being situated so close to New York City, Washington DC, Atlantic city and others, being here has allowed me to get out and see more of the world. The town itself is adorable; the old cobblestone streets fill me with joy, and the wonderful array of stores and restaurants is awesome.  
I love West Chester!"
Freshman,5,I love it here! it's so diverse and really tries to connect to its students in every way possible. I couldn't have asked for a better university
Junior,5,"I love the size of the campus and the education here is great. I've only had one issue with a professor in my three years here! The food is not the best, but they are working on improving it. I am on the gymnastics team at West Chester and I would say our athletics are great!"
Freshman,5,Absolutely amazing campus life! very diverse and inclusive to everyone. The school spirit is really high.
Junior,5,Great school and people! everyone fits in. The school has so much to offer its students. There is something that is always happening on campus whether it is academic or social.
Junior,5,I currently attend West Chester University. It is an excellent institution and has a plethora of helpful professors who are always seeking to bring the best out of their students. The students are very accepting for the most part. The culture is overall comfortable. The downtown area of West Chester is only about a mile away and has a great nightlife. Highly recommend!
Senior,5,I love the atmosphere and I love the little town it is! I’m so happy I chose West Chester and I wouldn’t have changed my choice for anything.
Freshman,5,"I have just started as a freshman at WCU. So far everyone has been extremely helpful, making my transition from high school to college very smooth. I did attend the summer music camp for three years, and have had the opportunity to meet some of the music professors. I have learned so much during the camps and also feel more comfortable as a freshman as a result of the experiences I had during the summer music camps. I am looking forward to developing my skills as a music composer and making new friends"
Junior,5,"it is a peaceful and safe community and people are friendly. The professors are excellent and I enjoy the area a lot. They have great food all around and if you ever need help with anything there is always a person on campus and even online that is willing to help you with your needs. The housing is excellent on campus and the housing makes you feel like you are almost at home. For future students that want to move or even commute to West Chester University, I recommend highly on joining the West Chester community and I even recommend joining the clubs at West Chester because even the clubs are a lot of fun to join. So these are my recommendations on West Chester University."
Freshman,5,"I really love the atmosphere of the campus and all of the older students and incoming students are very nice. I have yet to start classes, as I just graduated from Council Rock High School North in June. I'm very excited to move into the dormitories and make new connections."
Sophomore,5,"My experience with West Chester has been great so far, the campus is very diverse and there’s so much to offer on campus. Life on campus is awesome with a town right around the corner that provides a different variety of stores. Overall I’m glad I made West Chester University my choice."
Alum,5,"I just loved campus life and the city so much. Every one of my teachers made in class learning easier for me as well as the after school hours were very flexible and open for anyone who needed help. I rarely ate the on campus food so I really don't have much to say but on the occasions that I would venture in Sykes to try their food it did no disappoint. I always lived off campus but I did have siblings live on campus and they loved their experience providing that they had the right roommate. West Chester's campus security are local police who police the school, and even have a station on campus, and the surrounding area."
Sophomore,5,"West Chester University is an amazing school with a great staff. The professors all are invested in making sure that each student gets the information they need to succeed, and the advisors are a great help with scheduling classes and guiding each student along. The campus is beautiful, with old buildings and new buildings and two open area quads, academic and residential. The dorm buildings, both affiliated and traditional are in great shape and well kept up with. The university itself is amazing, but the town nearby adds a great deal to the appeal. Just a short five minute walk from campus and you are in the beautiful town of West Chester. It has restaurants, bars and a lot of different things to do during the year such as the Restaurant Festival every year."
Sophomore,5,I like the diversity of  West Chester University. There are many opportunities to meet other individuals through the different organizations.
Sophomore,5,"Great School. Professors are willing to help to succeed. Town is outstanding. Great atmosphere. Safe atmosphere. Can get around the parking issues. Many things to do in the area surrounding. Students are kind, easy to make friends."
Alum,5,The Education Department did an amazing job of making me feel confident in my abilities in being a teacher.
Niche User,5,"After visiting West Chester multiple times, I’ve decided to spend the next four years of my academic career there. The campus is beautiful and the town outside is nice. The students on campus all had nothing but good things to say about their experience so far while attending. I will be majoring in Criminal justice when i attend in the fall of 2019."
Senior,5,It is a great school. There are many activities for students to join as well as campus events. The professors are great and prepare you well. One thing I would like to see change is parking on campus.
Alum,5,I loved the different aspects of the campus.  The community was very friendly and the professors were extremely helpful and wanted you to succeed.
Senior,5,"West Chester University has been so rewarding! There is so much experience within each course and class I attend. I have been able to get hands on in each of my classes for public health. The resources available to the students are excessive. There are many leadership and volunteer programs for each student. I am enjoying meeting new people and I find joy in working aside my colleagues. The dining facilities at WCU are very clean and organized. The food they serve will not disappoint. I enjoy the provided facilities around campus to include the library to study, the gym to workout and the cafes around town. Town is not far from the University and is in walking distance. Very convenient and accessible."
Sophomore,5,West Chester offers its students an excellent education with dedicated professors in a prime location just on the edge of a thriving town.
Freshman,5,"I have loved my experience so far at West Chester! I have absolutely no complaints. They have tons of ways to get involved on campus. They have a cute little town within walking distance. In my opinion there are enough food options where you can find something you like. I live in a traditional dorm (Tyson hall) and I’m really comfortable there. Plus, it’s a pretty small campus so everything is a short walk! Even going to south campus because I’m a health science major only takes about 15 minutes including walking to the shuttle and waiting for it(I usually don’t have to wait for it longer than a minute or two!)."
Niche User,5,"I love West Chester! Anyone from the school has incredible charisma and a positive attitude that makes anyone want to be a part of this community! The classes are amazing and the perfect size, filled with incredibly helpful teachers."
Niche User,5,"WCU has an incredible campus with great people! The college town is also so much fun and there is always something to do. They also have incredible facilities and many majors to choose from! It is also really nice that the campus is so close to so many places! Only 45 minutes from Philly, 3 hours from NYC, and 4 hours from DC!"
Junior,5,"Love this second home. You will love this school and have a fun and rewarding experience. Classes are good, student life is good, and the overall town and campus is amazing."
Junior,4,"The online transition was a unexpected, but the school has given resources to help those struggling with the transition."
Freshman,4,"I am in my first semester at WCU as a transfer student and I am enjoying it so far! Given everything with the COVID-19 pandemic, WCU has done a great job organizing the Fall 2020 semester. The professors I've interacted with have been very understanding and accessible! The only thing I would change right now about WCU is the limited housing options for transfer students on North Campus."
Freshman,4,WCU has done a really good job organizing the structure of online learning for the Fall 2020 semester. These are difficult times and WCU continues to support its students' educational journeys despite all of the challenges this year has brought on.
Senior,4,It's a good school overall. Have had good professors and enjoy my department. There seems to be under-funding of the department though (COM).
Senior,4,"Took many online classes, overall pretty easy if you can stay on top of work. It's great if you live off campus."
Junior,4,I am currently a Junior at West Chester University of Pennsylvania studying elementary education. So far my experience with the University has been nothing but enjoyable. The staff is very friendly and seems to be very helpful in preparing the students for their future professions!
Freshman,4,it's a pretty good college but you end up doing the same things every week seeing the same people with no real excitement.
Alum,4,"West Chester had amazing professors who genuinely care about your overall outcome. However, the university was not very diverse and the traditional dorms were very outdated."
Sophomore,4,"The college campus and surrounding town have wonderful experiences waiting for incoming students. The professors at West Chester genuinely feel motivated to teach, and there is a lot of help in every department of the college. There is not a lot of jobs available on campus readily available for any schedule, but they will always try to work around any inconveniences for you. Overall, being at West Chester University is a very positive experience that would suck to miss out on!"
Sophomore,4,This is the only university I have attended in which I enjoyed my online experience. I have taken other online course at other colleges and felt as if I had no resources. My professors at West Chester stay in contact and are involved so you always feel up to date and prepared.
Sophomore,4,Our academic professors at this university have always done the best they can to provide assistance to anyone struggling. I believe my university sets the students up to succeed for the future. The board also is sure to update students regarding current news and concerns through the community.
Junior,4,"West Chester is the perfect size. Not a tiny college hidden in the suburbs, but also not a huge college in a noisy, hectic city. Just right in the middle. It is very affordable, both academic and housing wise. Their sports teams aren't great though."
Sophomore,4,"My online classes were good, teachers were professional and willing to help, the labs were difficult online."
Senior,4,"West Chester university has definitely become my home away from home. Like school in general, there are always ups and downs. Some professors are really there for you some are not (which is expected). Being in the school of music, it can be hard at times to stay a float. Other than that my experience has been okay. Some semesters are harder than other but again that is expected."
Senior,4,At the end of the semester all students had to take online classes. I think my experience was nice and it helped with making it fun. I liked how all of us got to see each other's homes and know how well the students worked from home. I felt like it helped me get all of my work done earlier than before. I liked how fast it all felt and I hope the other students had a good experience too!
Sophomore,4,"This is a great university for students who are looking for a medium sized campus. I love the campus itself, there is a lot of life to it, everyone is very friendly and the professors are amazing. However I will say that scholarships are very hard to come by and financial aid is not very good."
Freshman,4,West Chester University is a great campus for people who don't want to be at a very big school but still want a big name attached to their education.
Sophomore,4,West Chester is a great school with a diverse student body and a wide range of activities for students to get involved in!
Graduate Student,4,"I am an Alum and recently got into a Grad program there. The negatives I can think of was parking was a hassle as a commuter during undergrad and the main town area was a bit of a walk.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience there. There were some great concerts and events. The restaurants and bar scene was pretty much enjoyable. There are areas that I would stay away from, but that's about normal in any school area I've seen. A lot of students end up living in the area post graduation and I even still work not too far."
Freshman,4,A great school for it's price. It has provided a solid education so far while still being a pretty entertaining place to be.
Sophomore,4,"I think that the community at West Chester is very tightly-knit, and I think that there is something at West Chester for everyone both academically and with extracurricular activities."
Graduate Student,4,I like how West Chester University has many options as to where students can eat and relax. West Chester University is known for its marching band. I think West Chester University could perhaps promote more evening activities for graduate students as well as it does for its undergraduate students.
Freshman,4,I like the layout of the campus and how everything is easy to walk to. I do not like the food options at all.
Junior,4,"West Chester University is a great school academically, and is located in a great area with plenty to do. However, with 70% of its students being commuters, the university could benefit from more programs to help bring those students in more involvement-wise, and get them involved with student life."
Niche User,4,"I really loved the scenery and how the campus is laid out. It makes it very easy to get to a certain class. They have a great psychology program which is something I want to divulge into and would love to experience. Outside of the campus, there are a lot of restaurants to go to at night it is just a fun environment to be around. The athletics are very good here as well. I would personally want to join the soccer team to get involved in extracurriculars, something that  West Chester has a lot of to offer."
Freshman,4,Pretty good school. Beautiful campus and surrounding town. Best college marching band around. Good choice for local schooling.
Sophomore,4,"West Chester University is an affordable, well rounded college. The  campus is lively and doesn't put too much emphasis on partying every weekend, rather students are given multiple options for how they can spend their weekends. Classes are diverse, with many degrees being offered at a high level of instruction. A beautiful campus one can't go wrong coming to WCU."
Freshman,4,"I love west Chester. I’ve met my best friends and I’m only a month in. The food places are alright, I’ll make homemade food next year."
Senior,4,"West Chester is a great school and is growing each day. West Chester though only a state school, competes academically with schools like Temple and PSU"
Freshman,4,"My experience at West Chester so far has been really good. I have experienced nothing but great things. They have a safe environment, the people are very respectful, and even though the school is predominantly white, they are very diverse."
Junior,4,"West Chester is really about what you make of it. Parking is bad, but most of the professors ive had are great. It is a fairly large school and athletics team often go on to playoffs."
Freshman,4,"WCU is the perfect college for me. It's diverse enough, filled with friendly staff and people, and a close-knitted community. The tuition fee is very affordable. Every day, students are academically-engaged and challenged. It's reassuring to be in an institution where you get a proper education and not drown in so much student debt later on."
Freshman,4,West Chester  is located perfectly from my permanent address. The school faculty makes it easy to understand the college process with information and answers to questions. West Chester also with assist in every way to ease any concerns.  The dorms needs a little make over but still compatible with other colleges.
Freshman,4,"- fast and easy communication
- beautiful campus
- safe and interactive area
- passion for education and success"
Senior,4,"West chester is a diverse university that offers all different areas of studies. With welcoming professors, advisors, and, students, west chester university is one that excels to provide an excellent place of study."
Sophomore,4,"West Chester is a very good school at the state school price I pay. However, the quality of teaching and professors has been found lacking. The school has been greatly infiltrated by a ridiculously political mindset that pulls away form the actual information being gained and passed along. Also, not enough resources are offered to commuter students like myself. Overall, the campus and surrounding area are beautiful, but what you gain education-wise is  average at best."
Senior,4,What I like most about West Chester is it's community. All students and staff are welcoming to people of all different races and ethnicities.
Freshman,4,I will be attending WCU this fall and am very exciting. The campus is beautiful and administration are nice.
Junior,4,"I will be a junior at West Chester University this fall, and I am so proud to be a golden ram! The campus is beautiful, and has so much to offer for students. With a variety of majors, housing options, and on-campus activities, there is something fit for every student. The campus is  also conveniently located within walking distance of West Chester Borough, so there is always something fun to do either on the campus or in town. If you want a school with a small town atmosphere, which is also full of fun things to do, and has great academic programs, West Chester University is for you!"
Senior,4,"West Chester University embodies the hope of pristine higher education that all parents wish for their children and the true college experience that all freshman yearn for. It's central location combines the thrill of city trips to Philadelphia and the bustling growth of the town of West Chester. As a college town, the university boasts the fantastic educational capacity of it's professors and resources while also it's partnership with a town full of great food, shopping, and bars."
Senior,4,"Attending WCU is truly a fulfilling university experience. They have hundreds of groups/organizations for all interests, academic programs made to fit the students needs, and great facilities to keep you busy all semester long!"
Senior,4,"West Chester University is overall a good school as far as location, academics, and price. While it might not be as big as some other schools or have all the nice flashy extra things. If you are serious about getting an education at an accredited college this may be a great choice."
Sophomore,4,Currently enrolled in the pre-med program. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved on campus and many resources for connecting to a medical profession. Mostly an education school however.
Junior,4,This is a great experience because there are a lot of options here and fun tings to do. I play on a sports team so I'm busy but it is amazing here!
Niche User,4,My experience at West Chester University was overall amazing. The Campus is very beautiful and up to date. What really stood out was the area surrounding it. The school is within walking distance from the town of West Chester. The town is what really makes it. The party scene is bonkers which is really great. Overall the school is great.
Alum,4,Being apart of greek life really makes the experience here a total 180! There is so much involvement on campus and you really are able to find a group of people who are just like you and you feel part of something while you are on campus. It is also amazing to be walking around and see someone wearing your letters and you just automatically feel happy seeing someone who represents the same group you are so passionate about. AOT
Freshman,4,West Chester is a beautiful campus located right near the Borough of West Chester. The staff and faculty are very accepting and willing to help students when they need it. There are a lot of benefits on campus as well.
Junior,4,"The school is in a great area with lots of activities even if you're not into partying. The academics are good, but like most schools you will find some poor teachers. Besides the teachers, a huge issue would be advising. I have had to switch my advisor because they had no idea how to help me and no good information on the major they represented. The food is average because there are a good amount of options, but the main dining hall is really hit or miss. Sykes is always good for chik-fil-a, but not always good for healthy options other than salads. Dorms are getting older and the new dorms by USH are not always worth the money. Parking is a huge issue for commuters, on-campus students, and employees. However, WCU has a lot to offer in opportunities, organisations, and entertainment. There is so much potential here, it's just a matter of you making the best of it."
Niche User,4,West Chester brings home a natural aesthetic of a  comfy yet challenging environment. It calls people to bring the best out in them when you might think you don't have the strength to.
Alum,4,"West Chester is a nice mid-size school. The area of West Chester is very nice and the housing is better than most college campuses. However, if you are not involved in greek life there is little to do as sports aren't significant here."
Freshman,4,"Awesome courses and awesome teachers. Food is great and work is available on campus. Everything is within walking distance, and college is focused around your personal schedule."
Sophomore,4,"West Chester is a nice medium sized school, not too big where you feel lost but not small enough to know everyone. There isn't much to do other than join a sorority or frat, wish there was more activities."
Freshman,4,West Chester is a beautiful school with a lively town. The staff is welcoming and inviting and many students are respectful. It feels like home.
Freshman,4,"I’m currently a freshman at West Chester University and I truly enjoy the atmosphere of this school. Also, I love the campus life and the ability to grow at this university."
Sophomore,4,The food could definitely use a major overhaul. Parking is also pretty bad. I do like the location and transport services provided by the school. Also everyone is very friendly and it feels like its own community.
Senior,4,Professors are willing to work with you and want for you to succeed. How lot of programs available and tuition is not high.
Freshman,4,"TONS of organizations and clubs to join, which is very nice. I haven't had any problems with professors, scheduling, etc. My only complaint would be that parking is scarce and as a first year commuter, I am only allowed to park by the football field, which actually adds to my commute time significantly (have to take a bus from there to north campus)."
Junior,4,The West Chester Campus is beautiful. It’s just the right size and you have places to go! The town has plenty of shops and food for when you’re bored and want to explore. I was happy with most of my professors and excelled in my academics. The college also runs their own events for students to enjoy! It’s a very lively college and a great pick.
Senior,4,West Chester University was a great place to get my business degree. The business school was outstanding with the options they had for students.
Sophomore,4,"I love my college.  The experience has been wonderful.  My academic adviser has helped me with arranging my classes and directed me the best way I should go.  She even reached out to me during the summer months that we were not in session.  Living off campus helped me save some money.  The campus housing was great the first year, but the charges are more than the tuition paid and they charge you again for registration when you plan to stay the following school year.   It doesn't seem right.  This is the only reason I would rate it a 4.  It would be a 5 if  they had a better system without picking the pockets of the students."
Graduate Student,2,Extremely poor communication with professors for online courses.  Several administrators contradict themselves and others regarding program requirements.
Sophomore,2,"West Chester needs to relax with the amount of police on campus. They really squeeze the money out of their students with countless parking ticket/noise violations. They are using this to pay for the ungodly loud construction that woke up all of Goshen and Tyson Hall every morning at 6 all semester. The classes here are really easy (depending on your professor). I have had some great professors at West Chester that really care about the course material and their students. However, when I did have a professor who missed a third of their scheduled classes and never knew what he was doing the department head completely blew me off when I tried to schedule a meeting. I have really mixed feeling about WCU because in some ways it is a great school with great students that truly care about it. But overall I felt the need to transfer out because I was not learning anything in class, and I was annoyed by all of ticketing and penny-pinching."
Junior,2,"The school itself is great. However the borrow only cares about making money and doesn’t care how they do it. Parking is non-existent and police will be at your door for the slightest amount of music. They would rather worry about these things versus actual crime, such as robberies which are increasingly more common.  Really made me resent my time here."
Junior,2,"The University itself is fantastic. Wonderful professors and an excellent level of education. Something to consider though is that the law is geared against students here. Parking tickets, noise violations, and other (often made up) charges are used as a source of income for the borough. I have not yet gotten a fine (out of extreme caution), but there are some real horror stories of how students get treated here. I came on this site to warn anyone that you are not protected here as a student and treated like a second-class citizen by those who should be securing your safety."
Freshman,2,There's not much you can do unless you have a car or money to spend. There's not a lot of organized activities to indulge in. But there's different people you can meet and simply hang out with when all else fails.
Freshman,2,"Food selection is poor, dorms are not great, downtown is targeted towards upper middle class individuals rather than college students, hard to find work without a car, expensive for what you are getting."
Sophomore,2,I hated attending this school.  It's extremely small campus and enrollment make it hard to go anywhere without running into someone you recognize.  The housing is outrageous and it's difficult to get involved in school activities.  The only positives were its academics and location being close to Philadelphia.
Junior,2,I would like to see more diversity. WCU is predominantly white institution. Our science department is not good either. Some of the teachers seem to not care and it's a high fail rate for their classes.
College Sophomore,2,Living on campus as a transfer student is the worst thing to ever do! You will never meet people.
College Senior,2,Public safety needs to follow through and be more aware of sexual crimes in particular.
College Senior,2,"I did not like it at West Chester at all.  I had terrible roommates every single year, the only time it was bearable was when I moved my senior year.  By senior year, I felt incredibly unsafe on campus.  I was stalked by three different people during my time at West Chester (one in freshman year, two in senior year).  The first two were caught and taken care of, and public safety helped me get a restraining order against the first.  But the last one was different and I ended up being a timely warning.  I don't want to go into details about what happened, but he's the only person out of my stalkers who actually touched me.  I went to public safety and thought they would be as helpful as they were in the past but I was wrong.  They never caught the guy and he continued to follow me around.  I refused to walk on campus at night because I was scared, and took a cab everywhere I went because I didn't have a car.  To my knowledge, this guy could still be at large.  I would not consider campus to be very safe because of my experiences."
College Sophomore,2,"Drugs and alcohol are a driving force here at WCU. Almost pushed on students by university,'have a good time'"
College Sophomore,2,"For a school of 17,000+ very poor athletic department"
College Freshman,2,"I lived in the smallest traditional dorm and hated it. Dorm living isn't supposed to be great, but I felt like I was living in a prison."
College Freshman,2,No one goes to football games or has school spirit in this sense.  This is another reason I am considering transferring as I would like to go to a larger school that is more school spirited.
College Junior,2,"There is minimal student involvement in athletic events. Our football games, which for many college campuses are the highlight of fall, are rarely attended. We have little school spirit, but we do have successful teams that bring home gold."
College Senior,2,"I wouldn't say that NO ONE cares, but I mean no one cares about our sports teams. School spirit is a joke. We like our school, we just don't get all excited about things."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life isa pretty big deal at WCU, and if you're not in it, people are wondering exactly what you're doing with your life. Every year, hundreds of girls go out for recruitment in the hopes that someone will like them enough and give them a bid into the sorority. If you're apart of Greek life, you're college experience will be filled with free-related events like Greek Week and Homecoming. If you're not apart of Greek life, there are many other clubs and organizations to get involved in during the school year."
College Freshman,2,Lots of sexual assaults happen here.
College Freshman,2,West Chester is very strict with underage drinking. DO NOT come back to the dorms with alcohol in your system- they will stop you. They are more focused on underage drinking than anything else.
College Freshman,2,It is very hard to get financial aid. I would suggest looking at outside sources or WCU related scholarships. The university is not known for giving academic or athletic scholarships.
College Freshman,2,"I have many allergies, and although they claim to accomodate to these needs, I always struggled to find food that was not only good, but good for me. When I finally would find something, it was either low grade meat or bland, with the exceptions of course of Einstein's Bagels and Starbucks."
College Sophomore,2,"For some of my courses here I lost interest in because of the professor's lack of knowledge of the subject. And professor's treating you bad in front of the class, and telling you to skip your class to come to their office hours, also to change your major."
College Sophomore,2,"For the dining when you ask for a salad with no dressings or meat, they ignore the order and put them on it. I like their milkshakes and breakfast more than their for. The dining hall is the worse to get something to eat that I'm not allergic to, last semester I got sick because my food was mix with things that I'm allergic to. Their dessert is not that bad, everyone loves there ice creams, and when they do specials. I use my flex in Sykes and the reck center to get drinks, you can use meals too in the reck center after working out. The Chinese food is all flexes in Sykes, their food is good, and I can eat without getting sick. If you are a meat lover well the dining hall is for you, and if you don't eat meats there have three places in their for you that doesn't have much chose from. If you like chick-fil-A well their is one in Sykes but the lines are always long, same for Starbucks and Java city."
College Freshman,2,"Feel like I get a timely warning in the middle of the night Thursday-Saturday. Not very safe, most are sexual assaults."
College Freshman,2,Tried to find an apartment or small house for my Sophomore year around the end of October. Everything was filled already and the prices were through the roof. Now I'm stuck in the traditional dorms again because I can't afford affiliated and will probably be miserable again for the next year.
College Freshman,2,"I can honestly say that I have never been caught drinking in the dorms. But, if you go out the cops are borderline harassing you if you seem even the slightest intoxicated. A friend of mine tripped over the sidewalk that was messed up and the cops followed him back to the dorm and arrested hum for public intoxication and underage drinking. Really dude? He wasn't bothering anyone leave him alone. Also when they do bag checks they aren't allowed to touch your bags, but some of the security guards disregard this rule and will feel up the bottom of your bag and move stuff around. too bad most students don't know their rights. Also I was written up for watching TV at a moderate level with my door open at 10:30 at night. So annoying. Nothing better to do. This school apparently used to be fun I don't know what happened."
College Junior,2,I think its pathetic how hard it is to find an off campus house. The prices are so high for very small spaces and there are few options available since so many people renew.
College Freshman,2,I heard from many students the food there is not that great
College Freshman,2,"Not early enough options, Lawrence is usually bad and everything closes around 8."
College Freshman,2,Dominated by frats and sororities. High ratio necessary to get into parties and they usually suck. Cops almost always bust
College Freshman,2,"The Lawrence dining hall isn't the best but has a lot of options. The only other real options are fast food places (including a Chic-Fil-A) in the Sykes center, and the Diner. The Diner is always crowded but is open late which is nice. The food is sub-par and is often things you can get yourself at the Lawrence hall. The dining hall closes at 8 which is a terrible time to close, and the fast food options at Sykes close at 10."
College Freshman,2,"Only went to a couple parties.  Didnt drink,  it was loud and dumb"
College Senior,2,Lawrence dining hall is horrible despite being the best option economically. Sykes food court is expensive and you usually spend 2+ meal swipes for one meal. There are a lot of really good food trucks on Church St. and Starbucks and Einstein's are good.
College Senior,2,"It's extremely difficult to get through to anyone in the financial aid office, and the only way I was able to get a hold of anyone to help me cover my tuition was to go into the office personally and wait an hour for someone to see me. They rarely cover all of the tuition and are hard to get a hold of, and the application process is a headache. They keep requesting different forms after you send them in. They help you out if you pretty much get in their faces about it."
College Sophomore,2,Defiantly the school got the screw  by the boro when they helped pay for the garages.
College Sophomore,2,"Its a state school, they have to report to the state...."
College Junior,2,Many students are open about their substance usage.
College Sophomore,2,"School isn't big enough for a car to be a necessity

Campus permits are not that bad cost wise, but parking garages are kind of ridiculous"
College Sophomore,2,Too many people want to go out to get drunk and do not seek pure fun
College Sophomore,2,"a few weeks ago, multiple dorms smelled of weed in the hall and the police could not pinpoint specific rooms"
College Freshman,2,"I have only been in a potentially peer pressure type situation, but everyone in the room knew I don't drink so I wasn't offered any and I wasn't pressured to have any. Other than that one time I stay away from those things."
College Freshman,2,"Since it is a state school, not much aid is offered.  After multiple attempts, I was told I should have received merit-based aid but didn't get it."
College Sophomore,2,I am not big for greek life.  A lot of people view Greek life as people who party and study on the side.  I know a few people who are in a fraternity or sorority and it does seem to hold true.
College Sophomore,2,I'm not 21 yet so I can't go to the bars and I don't party so I usually just stay in the dorm.
College Sophomore,2,It is a shame because not many attend the sporting events and it is not huge on our campus.  I wish sports' events were a bigger part of school here.
College Sophomore,2,"Although I don't have a car on campus, many of my friends do and have to park at South Campus, which is a short bus ride away from North Campus. It is annoying to get the bus every time they need their cars, especially in the cold, but it is doable. "
College Freshman,2,Men are very out numbered by women at WCU.
College Freshman,2,"You pretty much need to know somebody who owns a house in town, dorm parties are the worst idea ever because you will get a noise violation/underage, the cops will bust the party you do manage to find, and even if they don't, the people who own the house will tell you the cops are coming anyway to get you out of their house after they've taken your $5 entry fee."
Recent Alumnus,2,Off campus housing is run down and pretty bad
College Freshman,2,they only interact with other greeks
College Freshman,2,not enough off campus stuff
College Sophomore,2,I am transferring out of West Chester because I do not like it and I do not feel enough pride for my school
College Junior,2,"Their library hours include gossiping, not homework."
Recent Alumnus,2,"hard to find space in a computer lab. there are usually lines of people waiting for a computer. the network is slow, and wireless printers also slow"
Recent Alumnus,2,"So crowded, and the buildings are old"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Parking is a nightmare at West Chester, not enough parking and it's far from the classes "
College Junior,2,There should definitely be more strictness on campus.
College Junior,2,"Although a lot of the food is good, there isn't a lot of healthy meals to choose from except for the salads, and some people are allergic to lettuce, so the variety should definitely increase. It's not bad though, and the menu for other foods does change up on a daily basis."
College Sophomore,2,"Rent is extremely overpriced and not worth the small apartmts and still a far walk from anywhere you rent. Some of the apartments are cute, but they'll always be small and you're going to have to share with a ton of people to make it affordable."
Niche User,1,Horrible experience if you’re from out of state. Stayed for a single semester. People weren’t welcoming and very closed off if you weren’t from the areas near the school or Pennsylvania itself. Teachers weren’t very helpful. Overall if you aren’t from Pennsylvania or close to it do not go there
Alum,1,"Became an alcoholic while attending. Large drinking culture, mindset and town bar scene. Be careful if you come here to party. If you are worried about partying too much or have a family history of alcoholic look elsewhere. Computer science program was pretty terrible, definitely look elsewhere if you want a good comp sci program . 4th highest arrest rate in the nation for universities. https://brobible.com/culture/article/top-25-colleges-on-campus-arrests/"
Freshman,1,"PLEASE do not go to this school. They purposely try to get you in trouble and then try to squeeze every last dollar out of you. The ONLY thing to do on the weekends is go to a frat house, so if you are easily bored by sweaty ass douchebags trying to grab your ass without you letting them then this place isn't for you. Public safety are all assholles beyond  belief, and don't even let me get scared on the food. DONT GO HERE"
College Sophomore,1,No real houses maintained by nationals
College Freshman,1,"I've heard that affiliated housing isn't bad, but just wait till you get in the traditional housing. Tell me these aren't the dumpiest dorms you've ever seen and I'll call you a liar. I lived in Killinger Hall and had the worst nine or so months of my life. Want a bathroom with yellow pee stains all over the seat? Killinger's got it! Want an air conditioner that breaks when it actually gets warm out and you need it? Killingers got it! Want to feel like you live in a petri dish of germs all year round? What do you know, Killingers got it! This was the worst possible dorm I could of ever been placed in and I heard that the other traditional dorms aren't much better. If you get put in Killinger, don't bother coming here, it'll ruin your entire college experience."
College Sophomore,1,"Not being a partier, I notice so many kids talking about partying and it gets frustrating. A lot are here just because of partying and I know of a handful who aren't into it.  I hear a lot about using drugs and weed, especially drinking alcohol. A lot of RA's know who the partiers are on the floor, but can't do much about it."
College Freshman,1,It was hard figuring things out on my own and I did not get much info on scholarships.
Recent Alumnus,1,They do absolutely nothing. Bad experiences here. 
College Sophomore,1,The wifi at WCU is horrible. I cannot connect in my dorm barely ever.
College Sophomore,1,The dining hall is not very good. There are not a lot of option since we only have one dining hall and a food court in the student union.
College Senior,1,Parking is at a premium at WCU. It is easy for anyone to get a parking permit if they have completed their first year. However the parking for on campus students is far from dorms. If you are a commuter parking is easy to find in the morning but after 9 you should plan on walking a bit to get to class.
College Sophomore,1,The cost of parking is reasonable but the availability is nearly nothing most of the time.
College Freshman,1,"No one really pays much attention to Greek life on campus. Greek life is not taken very seriously on campus. It's really not a big deal if you don't want to join one. I've heard hazing is pretty bad and I've seen girls running around in maid costumes on campus looking absolutely ridiculous. Overall, sorority life is very superficial and materialistic. Fraternities do throw good parties however with Greek life I almost never see them volunteering around campus."
College Freshman,1,Parking is horrible. You can barely find a parking space open and there are not may options to park at for certain parking passes. I think that if you are communting you have to be on campus atleast an hour before your class to find a good parking space.
College Freshman,1,"Personally, the people at West Chester University dress and act the same. Coming from living in the city and now living in West Chester, there isn't a lot of diversity and is mostly white. The people here are nice, most of the time, but it's hard to pick out certain people because they all look the same! Every guy and girl dresses the same, ugg boots, knee high boots, and north face hoodies."
Recent Alumnus,1,The zoning in the borough has been ever evolving; responding mostly to the non-school resident's patience wearing thin on the party atmosphere that students create. What I have found is that there are increasingly less off-campus housing options because some landlords are not allowed to rent to students in new such zones and the housing that is available is often of poorer quality and / or further from campus.
College Senior,1,"I scheduled a 1pm class because that's when I'm able to be at school. Unfortunately, it looks like I need to be there at 12pm if I want to get a parking spot. I paid for a permit and there have been two days so far in this short semester that I drove around for over 40 minutes looking for a spot. Totally ridiculous. If enrollment is up, then accommodations need to be made for students--especially those who commute. With multiple drivers seeking minimal spots, the parking lots are treacherous as people are cutting one another off and racing toward possible spots. It's unsafe and unacceptable."
College Junior,1,"West Chester Is Not a Friendly School – i think West chester has a horrible college environment, i also think that most of the students that go there are very cocky and stuck up."
College Sophomore,1,"It is so hard to find parking on campus, it sucks."
College Junior,1,"Help! Can You Even Here Me? Since I have been at WCU (recently transferred), there has been 3 in not 4 assults on campus and all of them happened near my building. Being a female, hearing all these safety alerts makes me uncomfortable to walk alone at night. I don't like the fact that I have to park at the back end of the parking lot because I live on campus and the parking lots aren't lit very well. This makes working until late at night impossible, because I am afraid of being assulted. What's the point of campus police if they aren't protecting us. I get that we as adults need to make wise choices, but they could atleast have more lights around or constantly be patrolling the parking lots and the entire campus."

Sophomore,5,"Within the online experience of learning, Cabrini University has been communicating with their students about events upcoming virtually, informing us about internship opportunities in the future, and remind us that talking to all types of eclectic people can lead us down a great marketing path. Having the info of an entrepreneur or an engineer can lead you to a job and hopefully a career in the field."
Freshman,5,My professors were very sweet and they always did what ever they could to help their students. They were present when help was needed and tried their best to make each student enjoy their time in class by giving everyone equal opportunity to participate.
Junior,5,"I'm excited to begin my senior year at cabrini with in-person classes. I can't wait to be back on the beautiful campus and be back in the community. Everyone is friendly and familiar, from the professors to the students. Classes are small and usually interesting too."
Junior,5,Professors moved classes online quickly last semester but they did a good job keeping it engaging for the rest of the semester.
Freshman,5,"Online was nice and a breeze for the most part, not a problem for me at all to be honest, hope I won’t have to do it again."
Freshman,5,"My first year attending Cabrini University was great to be honest, met lots of wonderful professors! And lots of great people, even started working out h there. Can’t wait for my sophomore year!"
Sophomore,5,"the campus and classes are great. close kit, easy to find friends and get involved. teachers here are very helpful, no one is left behind in any classes. there are plenty of opportunities to get involved and find what you like. the sports are good as well. dorms are nice and clean, freshmen years halls are smaller than others but still nice. they have many different living opportunities that you can pick from. they have LC which are groups that you can enter in that help you meet people and people that you can live with and go to the same classes as them. LC's are the best thing for in coming students.  lC's are something that can change your whole experience. they have learning communities and living/ learning communities as well. they have many different majors to pick from and the classes are good. Cabrini is an amazing college and there isn't a lot of people in your class size so its easy to get the help you need in any of your classes. classes last around an hour and 15 minutes."
Senior,5,"I enjoyed Cabrini University because of the small community. I loved the one-on-one time with the professors because they knew me by my name and always felt the need to reach out to me. I could always approach them with questions regarding my academics or future career. The school was small which made it easier for me to adjust to meeting new people and joining clubs and activities. The clubs and activities I was a part of was the Dance Team and Dance Company, President of my Exercise Science club, an Orientation leader, on the Cheerleading Team, a member of multiple honor societies, and achieved President's List and Dean's List several times. I am proud to be considered a Cabrini alumnus when I graduate in August."
Sophomore,5,"Cabrini is a pretty good school and I enjoy my time there. Although there is no Greek life, there still is parties held by athletic teams which get crowded. I love the small classes sizes. The professors are very nice and caring. The food is a hit or miss, sometimes the caf is good but others it will be really bad. I do wish there was more food options on campus, but there is a lot of nearby food off campus like chipotle, Wawa, Panera, etc. The new residence hall South is very nice and a good addition to the school, I recommend living there if you live on campus."
Senior,5,"Cabrini was not my first choice for my college but it was the right choice. The other schools I was at were larger and further away from where I live. Cabrini had a beautiful campus, small class sizes, welcoming people, but it was a small campus. When I thought of going away to school I always thought I was going to go to a big school with multiple campus's. Just because I wanted those things does not mean that is what I needed. Cabrini has offered me everything I needed in a University. The professors are great, the classes are intimate, there is always something to get involved in. I made the right choice coming to Cabrini University and I hope that if it is not someones first choice they give it a chance like I did because they might just find their home here."
Freshman,5,"At first I was not sure if I was going to like it considering how small it was. However, once I started I knew this was right for me. You have closer relationships with your teachers. Also freshman have to be involved in a Living Learning Community or a Learning Community which is a great way to make friends and since the campus is small you always see your friends walking around."
Works Here,5,"Beautiful and safe campus not far from Philadelphia.  If you are looking for a small college in a nice area, it is hard to beat Cabrini.  Nurturing community, extremely competitive athletics department, and a philosophy of giving all make this a unique place."
Freshman,5,"I have only been at Cabrini University for a month and through out my freshman journey my experience has just been amazing. Cabrini truly cares about their students, faculty and staff and even parents. Being at Cabrini feels like one little family. When i was choosing my college I made sure it was going to be one beneficial for me and I am glad to say I made the best decision."
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed every aspect. Despite being a smaller school, Cabrini certainly has a lot to offer for both its community and its location."
Sophomore,5,I love how diverse and connected the school is. It’s small enough that most faces are a familiar face. Cabrini also puts so much effort into teaching us how to make a change to the world and that’s reallt incredible.
Sophomore,5,I love Cabrini. I have made long-lasting friendships. I feel safe on campus always. The classes are interesting and I really do feel that I am getting what I paid for.
Junior,5,Cabrini is a smaller university where the professors care and know each of their students. They are very flexible and willing to work with you to help meet your needs. Students support one and another as well as the sports team and cheer each other on.
Freshman,5,"I recently finished my first year at Cabrini, and I could not be happier with my experience. There is always something to do on campus in addition to the abundance of teams, clubs, and job opportunities on campus. This school adequately prepares students for their future. The class sizes are small, which ensures academic growth. Overall, Cabrini offers great education, is a fun place to be, and is rapidly expanding."
Freshman,5,"I like that Cabrini is small, the professors can get to know the students because its only 15 students in each class. Cabrini has a Math and Writing resource room where they help you with homework for different classes. Cabrini also has an ""LLC"" which is a Learning and Living Community. This is one of my favorite aspects of Cabrini because my roommates are also my classmates. We help each other out with homework and at the end of the year, we have a class trip with our professors. My LLC has gotten me closer to my roommates as well as my three professors that taught me over my freshmen year. I will be looking forward to seeing them in the fall."
Alum,5,"I loved that I felt at home the entire time I was there. So many of the people on campus were willing to help you and look out for you, and the community is really able to come together."
Alum,5,"Cabrini was absolutely the right fit for me. It really was my home away from home. The campus is small and easy to navigate and has a community-like feel. You get one on one time with your professors and they really care about your success in and outside of the classroom. As a communication major, I had leadership opportunities at Cabrini that I would have never had at a larger school. I finished college with a full portfolio of work to show future employers and landed a job right out of school. My four years at Cabrini were so memorable and definitely prepared me well for my career."
Alum,5,I ultimately decided to attend Cabrini because of the resources available to Com majors. I participated in internships and student organizations that provided hands-on experience to boost my resume and helped me land a job right after graduation. I still keep in touch with my professors - and appreciate the supportive community that they helped create to ensure I was confident to take on new opportunities and experiences.
Freshman,5,I love the thought of small classes.  The ideal of being away but not far.  The size of the campus.  The feeling that you can get to know the students.  The Diversity of the campus.  They are easy to talk too and you feel like you are heard and you are not just a number.  I like the fact that you are amongst other students that are in the same field of study and you get to know them as well.  I like the fact that if you are having in personal problems and they notice the change in you they will help you deal with it.
Niche User,5,"I have visited Cabrini several times before including overnight visits, sitting in on classes, open houses, and tours.  The campus is small and it seems as if everyone knows each other.  When I visited these times, I had this ""family feeling"" as I was walking the campus and everyone saying ""hi"" to each other."
Alum,5,"Cabrini University is a great institution where students are granted the opportunity to succeed and like the school's motto states, ""live with purpose."" As a graduate, I am pleased to say that the university has grown and has continued to succeed. Anyone would be fortunate to attend Cabrini."
Sophomore,5,"Great college with a family environment, in which professors work closely with you and give you maximum attention. A university full of catholic and human values."
Junior,5,"I transferred  to Cabrini in the fall of 2016. I fell in love with the campus, community, and professors. If you need the one-on-one attention with your professors, this University is for you. I also received a job in the admissions department only being on campus for one semester. I was never an A student, but coming to Cabrini I am now an A+ student."
Freshman,5,"Cabrini is building a diverse student body, and it is very welcoming as a hispanic student. Everything here is amazing, and I appreciate all that is offered."
Freshman,5,"I am in my freshman year and I love it!  I couldn't picture myself being any place else.  It is small and mostly quiet, but that is what I like best about it."
Sophomore,5,"I love it at Cabrini! The professors are really great as well as the support staff. Its size is also a bonus. You don't feel overwhelmed or like your just ""that student"". They really know each student as the individual they are."
College Freshman,5,I believe that this school is the perfect fit for someone that wants to attend a small school. This school gives off the friendly vibe that ensures you that you'll make a friend.
College Freshman,5,Every professor has times that they are available to meet with students. The people in your classes end up becoming some of you good friends. They're usually 13 to 1 student teacher ratio which is nice!
College Freshman,5,Public Safety is always around if anyone needs help. I think I must see a PO officer 2 times every hour.
College Freshman,5,"The girls I met on the volleyball team are people who I'll be friends with for the rest of my life. They are some of the first people I met at Cabrini. Also, the school spirit for CSAC is unbelievable as every team comes together to support each other."
College Freshman,5,"I've met some of the best people at Cabrini. I honestly couldn't see myself going anywhere else because everyone is so nice and gets along with each other. Also, the professors are extremely helpful and go above and beyond in trying to help everyone as much as they possibly can!"
College Freshman,5,"It's time to get extra work some of you need to get it done , it's time to think and be around other people to forget about the bad things that happend so that you can get some good things into you"
College Freshman,5,It's a way to get to know each other and get invlove with different activities and people and be around other people
College Freshman,5,Everyone has a spot where they can study and talk and meet with people and still get things done
College Freshman,5,It is a good way to meet new people all different colors backroad ages and more so that we all can come together as one to make everyone know you can hang out other people no matter how they act or what they are
College Freshman,5,"Everything is great I love it , and I tell people all the time about it so that they can tell people and more people can come to the college"
College Freshman,5,Living on campus is the best because everything is on campus meaning if you wake up late you can run to class with what you have on you don't have to wait for a bus and be extra late . You can stay up as long as you want to get projects done be able to meet more people then you would meet if you was on the bus
College Freshman,5,"They are the school they get everyone to get out of their beds and come watch the game , they make the games fun and fun to watch no matter what type of days it is they try to make games on days so that everyone can watch them"
College Freshman,5,Everyone are meant to meet each to see how we can get along because we may need someone oneday
College Freshman,5,"We have the best public safety all year time all day night around no matter what they are always there to help , if you lost your keys they will help if you posted anything they will help to if you need help getting into your dorm etc.."
College Freshman,5,It's the best because it is very helpful mist students need to know why and how it works they need to take time out of their day to check it out no matter how the day is
College Freshman,5,Their very strict . But very easy to get away with using drugs if you're smart about it.
College Freshman,5,Everything is really simple at the school. The process is easy and if not they will try their best to make the process go as smooth as possible.
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy the school I picked very much. I have grown so much as an individual with the help of the people I met at school. I look forward to staying at this school for the rest of my undergrad. The teachers want to see you succeed and everyone wants you to get involved around campus. If I had to do it all over again I would still pick Cabrini.
College Freshman,5,I was very nervous starting out but found my spot before the end of the first semester. I'm looking forward to the spring semester & my classes.
College Freshman,5,This was my first and only choice of schools. I love the small campus size & the professors take time to get to know each student. Very happy with my choice.
College Freshman,5,Everyone treated everyone the way they wanted to be treated no one had attitudes they all had a big smile at all times answers everyone questions and got to know each other and we got to know them . they showed us around the school and what we may be doing or living and where most of are classes will be if we where taking a certain major it was the best if I could go back to that Day I would .
College Freshman,5,"I love my school because I feel so welcomed and at home. From the moment I stepped foot on campus during orientation, I could feel the friendliness and respect from everyone. The teachers are always free for questions or one-on-ones to ensure that you're comfortable with the lesson and with yourself. I feel a part of a family."
College Freshman,5,The best part about living on campus is the friends that you make.
College Freshman,5,"Wayne offers the best off-campus dining ever! The only problem is that it comes out of pocket. We can't use out flex or meal exchange, so if someone orders something or goes out to dinner, it's out of pocket costs."
College Senior,5,I love the night life here! There are a number of great bars in the area and down town philly is just a train ride away. Many students go out for $2 tuesdays and $4 well drinks on thursdays and then hit the city on the weekend.
College Junior,5,I am in the education program. We have one of the best in the Philadelphia area. I really want to work with special needs kids on a more one-on-one basis.
College Sophomore,5,Hard work but worth it
College Sophomore,5,Cabrini has everything you need
College Freshman,5,"Campus shuttle takes us pretty much anywhere we want to go, and the staff is great!!"
College Freshman,5,The athletes at my school are great. They are 100% determined to do what they need to do so that they can have a great season. I was able to attend all of the girl basketball games and most of the boys games and they were great. Ive heard about the lacrosse and field hockey team and they were doing great too.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Cabrini University is still going on, but it is going well for me. I am being informed about upcoming assignments, and my teachers cooperating with me when I need an extension on certain assignments. Ever since everyone went to virtual learning, they explained to me how to use particular services like Blackboard properly, instead of expecting me to figure it out, which is nice."
Junior,4,"During COVID it was tricky to get in touch with professors since there were no office hours and they had overwhelming emails, but otherwise online classes aren't difficult if you do the work when it is assigned to get ahead of it before you are assigned more."
Junior,4,"Great if you want to go to a small college. Catholicism isn't pushed, but there are several service opportunities (even if you aren't Catholic). Great academics and one on one opportunities with professors and staff. Everyone is welcoming and awesome! Wayne is a cute little town with shops and cafes/restaurants. King of Prussia mall is a short 15 minute drive away!"
Sophomore,4,During my first year I really enjoyed the resources that were made available to all students along with the teaching program. I was excited to learn in this environment growing up in a Catholic school while growing up. There are activities throughout the school year that students and staff prepare and do a excellent job.
Sophomore,4,"Campus,Educational opportunities are good.Location is good.Diversification is excellent.Professors are decent.Accessibility to staff is good."
Freshman,4,"Cabrini University is the perfect place for someone who knows what they want, but is open to trying new things. There's a little bit for everybody here with its diverse population, career opportunities, extracurricular activities, etc. Teachers are very friendly and dedicated to students' success. There are numerous services offered to students to help them excel (i.e. homework help/tutoring, counseling/advising, and more). There's a place here for anyone, no matter who you are and where you come from."
Niche User,4,"What I really loved about Cabrini was the environment and the people that filled the campus. The energy was very positive and the entire soccer team was such a tight-knit group of girls that really bonded with each other. Also, the exercise science department really sparked my interest and the classrooms looked very inspiring."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Cabrini is that it is a small campus. The campus is very beautiful and nice to relax on. The class sizes are small, which in my opinion is better; because students can get individual attention from the teachers. My first-year experience at Cabrini was fun. I met some new people that I now consider friends, and I learned a lot about myself in just a little bit of time. Something that I would like to see change at Cabrini is the food. Also, I would like for Cabrini to have more of a campus life. There are not many activities to do on campus. I do wish that there was more of a variety when it comes to the food selection. But overall, I like Cabrini."
Alum,4,"I transferred to Cabrini after being at another college for about a year. Unfortunately none of my credit from my previous college transferred so i began the college process all over again with Cabrini. Fortunately - Cabrini was amazing in this experience! I finished my undergrad in a whooping 3 years, making Dean's List every semester. My professors continue to be some of my biggest support systems. Even 6 years after graduation - I still love telling people about my experience with Cabrini."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Cabrini University has been good so far. I am currently a junior on the women's soccer team and women's crew team. During my time at Cabrini I have met a bunch of different people who are all so nice. Cabrini is not a big campus, but once you find a good group of people to hangout with it will change your experience at Cabrini. One of the biggest things that I think Cabrini needs to change is the size of the campus. Yes I understand that it is easier said than done. But if Cabrini added more residence halls or a bigger parking lot for students, many of the current students would be happier and wouldn't have a lot of problems"
Niche User,4,"People are very welcoming. The campus is very beautiful and clean. Classrooms are very neat. Loved how they have many events and groups for everyone to be a part of. Dorm rooms are pretty small but other than that, it’s a beautiful college."
Freshman,4,I am a freshman and I am having a wonderful college experience.I am meeting new people and trying different things and I am achieving a lot.
Sophomore,4,Cabrini University is a small quite campus. I felt like i learned a lot but I didn't really receive the best social experience because its so small. Overall I like Cabrini and it offered me a great college experience.
Niche User,4,This is a very close college. student that go here have a lot to look out for. carbine is also very historic. campus is very relaxed.
Freshman,4,"Cabrini University is a wonderful Liberal Arts college in Radnor, PA just outside the Philadelphia. It is a pretty diverse campus, but it isn't hard to make friends. Academics are challenging depending on your major, and its pretty well known for its education program. If you're looking for a good time on the weekends, befriend athletes. You will no doubt have a great time creating memories, receiving a decent education, and enjoying what college is all about."
College Freshman,4,I've had great professors and classes at Cabrini
College Freshman,4,I'm satisfied with Cabrini so far
College Freshman,4,I loved being able to choose who my roommate was for the first year. If anyone had any questions they were willing to ask and very much on top of things.
College Sophomore,4,It was easy and I got good help
College Freshman,4,I feel sexual assaults are taken very serious on my campus because sokn as something happens you instintly hear about it. They also give seminars on this topic on ways to keep safe and so on.
College Freshman,4,I havd toget myself involved in more internships but overall I think its good
College Freshman,4,"The class size is great, very intimate. I come in close contact with my professor"
College Freshman,4,There is one Greek program but I am not involved in it.
College Freshman,4,"The School spirit really isn't big because the campus beig so small. But my school have a lot of beneficial aspects about it. The education factor is the biggest part to me, the classroom size is small and I am close contact with my teacher. I enjoy the basketball games because overrall I love basketball."
College Freshman,4,No rapes are sexual assaults take place on campus.
College Freshman,4,Students are usually almost always employed outside of high school
College Sophomore,4,"Public safety is always walking around, and I have yet to truly feel unsafe. We don't hear about too many safety-related events here on campus, and when there is an event, it is fully investigated."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the class sizes, and I have liked most of my professors so far. Most of the courses seem alright, and there seems to be a decent variety."
College Sophomore,4,I love East Residence Hall and wish that I could live there again next year!
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy my school. It's small and local, just like I wanted it to be. Having small classes means that the professors can get to know you, and and the campus is great too."
College Junior,4,I like being at a small diverse college.  The professors are approachable and want me to succeed.   I've only had one semester but I really like it and would choose Cabrini again!
College Freshman,4,The housing is fine. There are days were the management of the temperature in the rooms or hallways should be monitored better but other than that housing is great.
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of school spirit and pride at the school.
College Freshman,4,"I love the school spirit at my school. There is a lot of pride at the school. I also love the opportunities that come up with everything that you find interest in. There are a lot of ways that you can get involved at the school. In addition, the professors and staff at the school are very helpful and supportive of the school no matter what year that you are. Finally over all the school has a good vibe and show that they take pride in being a family and community."
College Sophomore,4,They are always around campus checking in to see how students are doing. Very concerned about our safety. I feel very safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,The professors really care about their students. The curriculum is challenging in a good way. Some times you do not get the classes you want but advisers and other professors will work with you so you can still get the credits you need to graduate on time.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy the dorm rooms I have lived in so far. There is enough space for me an my roommate(s). I am a little worried about the upperclassmen housing though.
College Freshman,4,The Public Safety department does a great job
College Freshman,4,I'm not an athlete but what is available for all the students is impressive.
College Freshman,4,I am really happy with my experience so far. All the people I have met so far are really nice. There are so many resources I can utilize if I need help in a class. This school is most likely the best fit for me.
College Freshman,4,Im looking forward to starting in the fall
College Freshman,4,The School has had a number of events before school started that allowed me to interact with students and make some friends before the first day of college
College Freshman,4,Have to look for the good spots!
College Freshman,4,"The staff  and faculty are overall, very friendly and nice."
College Freshman,4,The school gave me some cool grants that I didn't expect and has many opportunities to receive more help.
College Freshman,4,"i think it's a very nice campus, nicer than I expected to live in"
College Freshman,4,I wish they had more chicken options in the Cav.
College Freshman,4,I think the campuses public safety do a great job at handling whatever is the dispute on the campus. I feel safe here also since the campus is in a relatively nice area.
College Freshman,4,I found living on campus to be an interesting choice since I have experienced college life in its full zeal. It is nice walking over to a neighbor or studying with your roommate at your own leisure.
College Freshman,4,I received a great scholarship from Cabrini for my grades. It helped make this school affordable for me.
College Senior,4,There are lots of characters at Cabrini. Sometimes its fun just to stare at the wildlife haha
College Senior,4,"The Main Line of philly is home to the east coasts largest mall, all philly pro sports are a train ride away, Valley Forge national park is just down the road, but it is expensive to live here. But hey, you get what you pay for."
College Senior,4,"I live off campus in an apartment complex and it's great. Rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in the area around campus may seem hight but that is because of the area we live in. From my searches the average rent for a 1 bedroom was around $1,100 a month."
College Senior,4,"Cabrini College is located on the Main Line of philadelphia and home to some of the greatest bars, restaurants and diners. If you have a car your options are endless. There is a shuttle that takes students from campus into town."
College Junior,4,"Five places to use computers: Psych Lab, Mac Lab, Communication Wing, Iadrola, Library. Always one available"
College Junior,4,There are a lot of different people on campus. Everyone is open and friendly. A lot of diversity.
College Junior,4,"The teams are good, we need a football team though."
College Sophomore,4,I have never attended a game but I am aware that the basketball team is one of the best in the country and is nationally ranked.
College Sophomore,4,"My program directors and advisors were very helpful. They understood the direction that I was heading towards and they led to the right direction. My biggest advice is; as long as, you aware of your goal and what you are attempting to achieve then the process is easier. If you are unsure then your progress is probably more difficult."
College Sophomore,4,If you stay involved you'll have fun.
Senior,2,"It is not a bad school, however, it is difficult to get the classes you need. Some faculty are nice but some are very rude.  If you are studying for a computer science major good luck. The classes expect you to know the lesson before entering class. There is no hands on learning which is a struggle to do the homework."
Freshman,2,"Cabrini has a beautiful campus. Classes are on the smaller size, so its a more intimate experience. They have a very diverse student body and embrace everyone's differences. It's a small school but it has a little bit of everything. The biggest thing I would like to see change is price. It is an expensive school. Even though they give scholarships and help, that just lowers the price to what it should be in the first place. So you think your getting this generous gift, when in reality your paying full price because the scholarship just lowers your tuition to a normal price."
College Freshman,2,Their to stirct on drug and alcohol. I dont think you should turn a blind eye but just be more lenient when someone gets caught or if you see someone doing a drug let it slide just give them a warning.
College Freshman,2,Their aren't that may parties on campus. Just a few kids drinking in the dorms. Houses get busted frequently enough. Night life scene or off campus is where you want to go to party.
College Freshman,2,I have a few good friends but if I could do it over I wouldn't choose Cabrini .
College Freshman,2,"The food is terrible, greasy, lacks variety, and makes you go to the bathroom frequently. The inner workings and systems in place that are supposed to keep the college running need serious fixing. The power goes out when it rains. It's hard to trust people because the campus is so small that everyone knows everything about everyone. There are constant plumbing problems. The planned events are less than exciting. However, the staff and professors take the time to get to know you and what works but for you and the campus is beautiful."
College Freshman,2,Don't eat much but when I do I don't think its worth it.
College Freshman,2,"Not a party school. good for those who are all books, but bad for those who want to have fun and meet new people."
College Freshman,2,I went through hurricane Sandy on top of the fact I am from New York and I got little to no financial aid. I also am a 4.0 student and have received nothing in scholarship or grant money.
College Freshman,2,"The food on campus has improved, but overall it is pretty bad. There have been times I have seen rats and flies in the lunch room. It makes it really gross to eat in there and most of the time I'm force feeding myself to just survive."
College Freshman,2,The food choices are not healthy and do not have a lot of variety. My school serves fish over and over again. I would like more flex on my meal plan because I find myself wasting the regular meals. I wish you could trade the meals in for flex. Dining halls on campus are very limited and so are the menus. The best place on campus is Jasmin's.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms feel very small and limited to what you can have. I have not had the best experience with the social atmosphere. It can be hard to make friends the first year, so it can get lonely. I've also found a lack of activities on the campus I'm at now."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is not good.  There's no variety in options; especially whe  it comes to healthy options.  You end up eating the same food every day.  You can go to the dining hall, Jazzman's and Sandella's, or the RAC.  All of them serve unhealthy food, and if they have healthy foods they are way more expensive."
College Sophomore,2,There are not enough parking spaces or parking lots at this school.  The parking pass for the year was 100$
College Sophomore,2,"We are surrounded by so many trees that any little storm will cause trees to fall over, flooding the streets, power outages, and school delays or closings.  This past winter we have missed more days of school than I can count due to weather."
College Sophomore,2,The caampus has a shuttle running but the times are not the most convenient.
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife stinks.  You can go to people's dorm rooms and drink, but you'll probably get busted by an RA. So if you want to have a lot of fun go off campus, and be good friends with all types of sports teams."
College Freshman,2,it depends on the situation.
College Sophomore,2,The drug scene at Cabrini college is not very big; not many people are involved in serious drugs. I see lot of smoking and drinking.
College Sophomore,2,Not much to do. Unless you're already 21 and you can take the shuttle to a bar on Thursday nights. There are parties at the apartments and like the houses.
Freshman,1,"Deplorable Freshman housing. It looks great until Mom & Dad leave, then it sucks. RA's have no interest in helping you. Security is a JOKE and NEVER around. Very un easy feeling at night. Weekends it turns into a ghost town. Student and counseling services barely give you the time of day. I left ag=fter my first year. HORRIBLE SCHOOL"
Freshman,1,"it is very terrible. when I am there I want to claw my eyeballs out. everyone is so weird, unattractive and just plain annoying. my teachers are very weird and talk too much. they never like to hear about the students opinions. i also had a very bad encounter with my roommate. she snored 24/7 like a mad man, and she also liked to type on her keyboard so hard at odd hours of the night and i thought the computer was going to explode. sometimes when i woke up in the middle of the night I would see her walking around and talking to no one. maybe mother cabrini. i hate everything. the only thing I like is the milkshakes at the rac. I can not wait until my 4 years are over."
College Freshman,1,"We do not have a Greek Life at Cabrini,  maybe we can start this program up for students like myself for people to get involved"
College Freshman,1,Well everyone is private when it comes to drugs use so that they won't get into trouble
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely no social life besides partying at my school. You have to find friends that you like and go out drinking. That's what a lot of people on my campus do. Although it is very quiet and I do not hear many parties going on. But the social scene is poor at my school.
College Sophomore,1,Cabrini got it's first soroity and faternity last year.  There are no options.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life
College Freshman,1,Um for one thing they are way too strict about what you can and cannot have and checking up on that and they don't allow male visitors after midnight.
College Freshman,1,No one pays attention to them.
College Freshman,1,They make you feel weird when you go to them for help.
College Freshman,1,gross. almost no night options.
College Freshman,1,"Honestly it's nothing special. My advice don't come here, I can't wait to go."
College Freshman,1,I'm hoping to transfer because I don't like it at all. The people are just so boring and res life is so annoying and i'm just sick of the whole thing. College is supposed to be somewhat fun. This is not fun.
College Freshman,1,"I don't find most of the people on campus good looking. I've found people to be mostly boring, lazy, and uninteresting. The social scene is an embarrassment."
College Freshman,1,One word does the trick:boring. Nothing to do. No social scene.
College Freshman,1,I haven't had an internship but I have concern due to the schools lack of organization.
College Freshman,1,"It's ridiculous, you can't join an actual sorority they just have tiny volunteer group that they refer to as a sorority. It basically doesn't do anything."
College Freshman,1,"It's very boring. I'm very social and wanted a fun and social college experience and it's been horrible. It's boring to begin with. The people aren't very friendly, they're nice but not super social. The people running Res life are way too involved/strict. Not to mention they show no consideration. I was living in a double room with vacancy and they told me I was getting a roommate 10 minutes before they gave me one. They're incredibly disorganized. If you live in Woodcrest it is awfull. I lived there for almost two months and was completely grossed out. East and Xavier are alright but most Freshman get stuck at Woodcrest."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is not popular at Cabrini, considering there is only two. The frat and sorority are not focused on parties but instead community service (more of a sorority thing). They help with fundraisers and other charity events."
College Freshman,1,The academic programs at Cabrini are different than most schools with a lot centered around the justice matters curriculum and core values. Most of it is pointless though and is not beneficial.

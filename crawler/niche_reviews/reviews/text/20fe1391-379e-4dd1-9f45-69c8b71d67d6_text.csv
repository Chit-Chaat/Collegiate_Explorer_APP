Junior,5,"I'm having a great overall experience. My advisor reached out to me as soon as I had been accepted. He assisted me with class registration, already aware of what classes I needed to take. The staff as a whole has been great helping me to get back in the swing of things because it's been 6 years since I last attended. They are very accessible and committed to making sure I'm successful."
Junior,5,"I hadn't been in school in six years. Clayton State has a tutorial on how to be a successful online student. The tutorial showed me how to submit my assignments, include attachments such as videos and my documents, how to communicate with the professor and my classmates, and other features and tools that I'll be using. I think this is going to the best online learning experience."
Junior,5,"Clayton State University might not be a very prestigious school, but the quality of education definitely shows that it is a quality school. All of the professors know and have experience in their field. Plus, there are many amazing programs such as the Dual Degree program they have with Georgia Institute of Technology! There are many opportunities to network and increase in professionalism. Not only that, Clayton State University has over 37 countries within the student body. For instance, I have met soccer players from Finland, Spain, Venezuela, Nigeria, and Australia (just to name a few)! Every personnel you meet is friendly and enjoy sharing their experiences with students. I do not regret my decision of becoming a  Clayton State Laker. You can be one too! GO LAKERS!!"

Niche User,5,"I love this school! Its campus is very beautiful and peaceful. Classes are medium sized, depending on the course. Some courses may have ten students, while others may have around 30 students. I have been in both. Smaller classes are brilliant because it gives the student the opportunity to speak to the teacher one-on-one. Also, teachers' office hours are very flexible, so you can speak to them on your own time. Clayton State University has multiple buildings that are very decent. They have an Arts & Sciences building; a laboratory building; a College of Business; and another building, James Baker University. It's easy to speak with your advisor on your courses needed for graduation as well. The courses are also not very expensive compared to other universities. There is a diverse student body with numerous student activities to choose from."
Freshman,5,"So far, Clayton State has been a great experience. Being in this environment on my own to meet people and form new bonds is really exciting. On top of that, I am also taking classes at my school that allow me to work on my craft as a creative individual. The other students on campus are equally, if not, even more creative, which allows me to thrive as well."
Sophomore,5,Clayton state university feels like home. The environment is calm and chill. Clayton State University is a safe place to come learn and get your education the right way. Most schools focus on the school while Clayton State focus on taking care of the students that attend here. They are very helpful and kind people all the staff and faculty. The changes I would like to see at Clayton State University is promoting the school and having more live events on campus.
Senior,5,"Clayton State University is a great school when you want to make a smooth transition from a smaller high school or home school to college life. Although the campus is growing, it is not too large and easily navigated. Professors are always there to help and so is the Center for Academic Success. As long as you’re invested in your education and graduating, Clayton State will be your guide to your goals."
Graduate Student,5,"I came to CSU as a transfer student and I absolutely love it. They offer a lot of opportunities as far as internship, academic advise and leadership growth."

It is so beautiful and peaceful, how could you not love it here?"

Freshman,5,"I like how this school is secluded but once u go down the road a bit, you've basically got everything you need. You've got grocery stores such as Walmart and Kroger, restaurants including, Wendy's, and Cookout, and the South lake mall is in the are also. There aren't too many distractions and that's a good thing for me. I enjoy the fact that the school is small, which means you will see people more than once which allows you to make more friends."
Junior,5,Campus is easy to navigate and the advisors are extremely helpful and patient with any questions I have!
Sophomore,5,Very beautiful campus! I would like to see more student parties and imvolvent. The curriculum is pretty bareable. The classroom sizes are pretty descent.
Junior,5,My first college experience being over 40 was better than I imagine it would be.  Definitely recommended for older adults going back to school.  The student support that you get is very good.
Niche User,5,"Clayton State is a great college. As a dual enrollment student, I am able to see what college is like while still in high school. Clayton State has an array of wonderful teachers willing to help students further than most would think."
Sophomore,5,"I genuinely adore this school. Most of the teachers really care about you and want to try and help you succeed as much as possible. As long as you put in a little effort, it can take you pretty far. The campus is also very beautiful. It has 4 lakes and everything is close together, so if class was a bit hard one day just take a walk it might help."
Niche User,5,My mother and I toured the College in the Fall of 2019.  We were really impressed with the tour.  It was very informative and we were able to talk to the different professors.
Niche User,5,"I like how the school is aiming to be better through renovations and such. Overall, the school is great and every teacher I have had will always take the extra time to help a student."
Niche User,5,I’ve done years of dual enrollment at this school and I have no complaints. The campus is very nice and is kept clean. The professors are good and they care about their students.
Sophomore,5,"When I started Clayton State University I was welcomed with warm arms. I started with summer bridge program. I earned 6 credit for the summer. I received the grade of a A+ and B+. The program helped me meet new people and experience campus life. The thing I like the most was the CAS, were they help you with you work and help you study. It made me become a better student and person. I appreciate going to clayton state university."
Sophomore,5,"I was quite unsure about going to Clayton State. I was not sure what to expect at all. My freshman year I stayed on campus and it was the best experience ever. You are so in-tune with what goes on on campus and you will love it, you do not miss a thing. When it came to classes, all of the professors were understanding and willing to help with whatever you needed. You usually do not find professors that actually care, it was good to know they did."
Junior,5,This is a good school that is very affordable. I got my bachelors here and came back to get another degree.
Works Here,5,Awesome. Clayton State University or the university with the lakes as some call it is a wonderful university. Its small and family orientated. you can get exactly what you came there for with the help that you need.
Sophomore,5,I love Clayton State. The professors are really nice And actually want you to pass and the campus is beautiful.

The academic advisors help you build your class schedule to cater to your major and help you graduate on time."
Sophomore,5,"Clayton State University is an affordable and diverse college just south of Atlanta. The class sizes are small, the professors are highly involved with students, and every one of them is an expert in their field. I'm studying communication, with a minor in music, and I could not have chosen a better school. The community is excellent, very welcoming. If you are planning on majoring in music, go to Clayton! We have Spivey Hall, a huge season of world-class musicians, and there are lots of opportunities for student teachers and student performers in the surrounding area."
Sophomore,5,"Clayton State's online offerings are awesome. I attended another school before transferring to CLSU. At the other school, it felt as though online students were second-class citizens. CLSU has made me feel just as important as anyone else. To top it all off, I was offered a scholarship opportunity during my first semester! I love CLSU!!!"
Freshman,5,I love love love love it here. The teachers are really nice and they genuinely care about you and your well being. Their food is really good and the dorms are so amazing.
Freshman,5,"Clayton State University has not only become my second home, but the foundation to my new and memorable journey. Inarguably, the most substantial part of this environment are the genuine people. Whether you are getting to know your peers or having a heart-to-heart with your professors- it is inevitable that everyone will leave a positive impact on your life. Aside from the emotional and social support system, CSU offers a wide range of propitious majors which are fittingly held by the most dedicated and scholarly professors. In addition, there are also academic help centers and a personal counseling department located on campus. The one thing about CSU that I would change is the freshman curriculum. There are various courses first-year students are required to take, yet gym is not one of them that is enforced. Valuing our body and making it a priority to take care of it throughout college is extremely vital for our overall well-being."
Senior,5,My experiences at Clayton State University overall has been extremely rewarding from the dedicated professors and staff in providing a thriving academic environment to the safety provided by the Campus police!
Niche User,5,Clayton State is a beautiful university with professors and staff who always make sure you are doing your best!

I like cksyyon state because it's in a good location and it's accessible to everything . The student are from all over the country , which makes Clayton State a very versatile school."
Niche User,5,It is a  beautiful campus filled with staff that makes move on when ready/ dual enrollment students comfortable form day one.
Freshman,5,I enjoy the open experience with nature and wildlife. The campus is accessible and locally convenient.
Senior,4,"The completely-online experience isn’t for me. I prefer hybrid classes, at least. I will say, however, some of the professors are very well-versed and organized with the online format they’ve prepared for us."
Alum,4,I didn’t have online classes but it wants me to rate anyways and have at least 100 characters in this ‘review’
Alum,4,Clayton State is very affordable compared to other universities in the state of Georgia. Some of their departments are great and some are lacking like science (a lot of profs aren’t that good) and math (there’s only 1 prof teaching calculus 2 for the fall semester). I hear their nursing program is really good though. I dual-enrolled and went there after I graduated high school and I enjoyed being there.
Junior,4,"Online learning has been very good. Teachers have been very supporting and helpful, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone was very approachable and reachable via online platforms like email. If I had to take online courses again, I definitely would."
Junior,4,"There is always room for improvement. Overall it all depends on your professor how they choose to run their online learning. Your professor could be the type to post all you assignments at once and it up to you to complete them by the deadline or have schedule meetings twice a week on zoom or Microsoft teams and you have to follow along with their lecture through the meeting, hoping its recorded.  There is not sure way to explain my experience because I've experience both examples. It really up to you to decided do you have the patience and have  enough responsibility  to manage your own schedule. Considering  with online classes it based off your time management skills and the effort you put towards study during your free time. Compared to going to an in-person class your schedule to be there during that time slot, therefore it already planned."
Sophomore,4,"The only reason I took online classes is because of the COVID-19 virus, when switching to online all my teachers were pretty good with the transition and communication was regularly held."
Alum,4,I like the size of the campus and the accessibility of the professors. I would have liked there to be more involvement with more community organizations as far as Career readiness.
Senior,4,Clayton state has great staff and administration. Its just limited in exra curricular activities. Sports are limited as well.
Niche User,4,"The teachers always care about our learning. There are some good professors, and there are some professors who weren't as involved. Food supply on the campus is abundant but usually overpriced. School spirit is not as present, but the campus is overall very chill and quiet. There has been a few instances of crime on the campus, but it does not happen often. Since it is situated in the Clayton county area, there are many things to do outside of the campus. There's AMC (movie theater), Walmart nearby and more."
Niche User,4,"Very under-appreciated. This University is actually very idea, but there was a bad reputation before I applied."
Senior,4,"I love that they cater to individuals who are not able to attend class on campus by providing online classes. I dislike the restrictions of classes only being available during certain semesters, which makes it difficult to stay on a graduation path plan. I also do not agree with the mandatory internship class that is required for graduation. As someone who works full time and cannot afford to cut back my work hours to pick up an unpaid internship, it is an inconvenience and has also delayed me from obtaining my degree."
Senior,4,"Clayton State University is a really affordable school compared to other colleges such as Georgia State. They have one of the top nursing programs in Georgia and other good programs ike dental hygiene. It has a lot of good, caring professors that you can see during office hours when you need help. There are a lot of resources on campus to help you be successful such as tutoring, career services, writing studio, and etc. The dorms are pretty spacious and decent, even though dorm life wasn't personally for me. If you can stay in off-campus housing, I would recommend it for cost saving purposes."
Junior,4,"Clayton State is a wonderful university to attend. It is the perfect size for new incoming freshman to get adjusted to the college scene and it's also a nice size school for returning students. The class sizes are much smaller compared to other universities which can have its pros and cons. The only bad thing about it being a small school is that the amount of professors teaching each course is limited, which can then lead to problems with scheduling."
Sophomore,4,"I love the close-knit environment of CSU. Since it's a smaller school, everyone knows everyone and there isn't much of a competitive nature.  For example, in the music program, since there aren't so many of us, everyone encourages us to do well and we all essentially work as a team."
Sophomore,4,Clayton state has a diverse university. Their campus is really nice including a lake and a peaceful surrounding.
Freshman,4,Overall enjoyed my freshman year experience I will be a sophomore in the spring of 2019. Clayton State is a good college however some things on campus could change such as Safety and Housing rules.
Senior,4,"I love that Clayton State University is a diverse school. There are plenty of opportunities to excel here at this school. There are a few campus crimes during the year, but the new gates around the community has made it safer. I also love that this university is very affordable with an amazing education to match."
Sophomore,4,"What I liked about Clayton State were the campus and the people. The campus is very open and the student body diverse, which I love. The professors are nice and understanding. They don't pile on too much homework. I also like that there are a lot of organizations and clubs to get involved in on campus."
Junior,4,Clayton State is a small but connected University. Their film program is very good considering they only have of few of them. I would like for them to create a film building but overall this is an amazing school and I am glad I attend here.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Clayton State University has been amazing so far. I just completed my first year there, and I love it. I have been able to keep my 4.0 GPA, work on campus, and join some organizations. I am in a dual-degree program that will allow me to transfer and finish with 2 degree in 4 years. The price of the school is very affordable, and the professors really care and help you learn the material. The campus is nice, and there are lots of places to go and enjoy while you're there. It is also one of the most diverse universities in the state of Georgia, so you'll be able to meet people from all walks of life."
Niche User,4,The campus is very nice. It's big but in a good way. The teachers are nice and understanding. The counselor try their best to help with anything. There are free tutors there for math and such.
Graduate Student,4,This college was a good college and very affordable. The school had many major options and it also offered online courses as well. The campus is beautiful and peaceful.
Junior,4,I felt very secure and safe in the campus environment.. I appreciate the diversity as well. The professor are great..
Junior,4,"Honestly, I started out at the University of West Georgia and I was wide eyed and bushy tailed. The campus is beautiful, but the lecture halls are too big for my liking. I decided to go back home and enroll at Clayton State University. That was one of the best choices I ever made. Once I got to the campus I knew that I wanted to get involved, and that's just what I did I am know in 5 student organizations and I am on the e-board for one of those organizations. For almost every class it is an intimate setting. If you go to your teachers office hours they will most definitely help you and most of them have a passion for teaching."
Freshman,4,The best part of Clayton State University is the helpfulness of all the professors as well as they integrate technology for learning.
Sophomore,4,"Clayton State has a nice campus with outdoor seating and a nice lake view. However student life is not ideal. The crime is more frequent than one would find comfortable within a college campus. The surrounding area is not nice, there are not many thing to do and crime rate is very high. I wish safety was paid more attention to and student life was more vibrant. There are not many clubs and there are rarely student events. As a four year institution I expect better."
Freshman,4,"The reason i like and chose Clayton State to further my education for 4 years is because, it’s a laid back vibe and everyone is real cool with each other. The campus is nice, the professors are really understanding and there are plenty of ways to be involved and active in the community"
Sophomore,4,"Clayton State is more like fun, diverse, and quiet college. The programs that I've experienced are great, the students are funny, and so kind to everyone. The professors want nothing but the best and I appreciate every second of lectures."
Junior,4,"I really like how  the teachers really care about your success. Theg want you to do well and their nain goal is for you to graduate. And if you need extra help there is an all day tutoring session from Mondays-Thursdays, and Fridays just end earlier. I would like for clayton state to add early childhood to their program. A lot of the students who are in the education major ask about it but its not really happwning so far."
Junior,4,"I love being a student at Clayton State. The professors that I have had were not only extremely knowledgeable in their subjects, but genuinely cared for the students well being & that they left better than when they came. Clayton State combines a higher standard of academics and access to new technology typical of a larger school, with smaller class sizes, more access to professors, & a sense of community typical of a smaller university. My only big complaints about Clayton State as a whole is that finding parking can be very difficult on most days, and the surrounding area is not very safe. I receive a notification at least once every two weeks regarding an armed robbery, police chase, or other criminal activity in the surrounding area."
Freshman,4,The instructors are helpful and have knowledge about their subjects. The campus is full of study areas and rest areas for food and drinks. There buildings tha are easily-accessible to students and disabled-students. Would recommend to anyone.
Niche User,4,CSU has an amazing campus view and the people are friendly and so are the professors. It would be nice if the campus was safer at night though.
Sophomore,4,"I am a big fan of Clayton State University.  They maintain a high level of academic excellence and provide numerous opportunities for the success and well-being of their students. Perhaps some improvements would be a more smooth, efficient admissions process and expanded minors within the business program."
Niche User,4,"My experience at Clayton State University was very exciting. I met new people, went to very culturally diverse events and I was able to be independent. One thing I would like to see change is the student involvement because the school has many great organizations and extra curricular activities but many if the students are not aware if them."
Freshman,4,Clayton State's environment overall is one of the best environments. The teacher make sure that you are able to understand the material given. Most of the time they are very hands on and that is one of the greatest things as well.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Clayton State University has been very good. I am currently a sophomore pursuing an associate's degree in Information Technology and the program is very interesting. The faculty is very kind and helpful. The professors I have had so far have been very resourceful and they do their best in helping their students understand the curriculum in order to do well in the course work.
Sophomore,4,"I was hesitant about attending Clayton State initially. It is a very small school that is known by many outside of the area it is located in. From the outside looking in it would seem that there isn't much going on; and not a place i would desire to spend my college years. Although after spending a few semester at that institution I have completely changed my tune. I have realized that while it may not be the biggest institution with the most resources/opportunities, it is still sufficient for a young adult seeking higher education. In fact for the cost, it is more than sufficient, this University excels at providing students everything they need to be successful during and after their time attending Clayton State University."
Junior,4,I like this school because the faculty and all the employees are very friendly and helpful. You feel safe on campus because you see the police patrol everywhere you go. I will recommend this school.
Freshman,4,"I have had the best experience with this school. I am recently returning to college to elevate my career and this institution has been great at getting me on track. The professors are open and easy to talk to, the counseling staff is expedient with information and offers great advice. I would recommend this school to anyone looking for to further their education."
Freshman,4,"Clayton State University is an excellent school for learning. The Professors and staff at the university are helpful. There are several resources for students wanting help on academics.  The campus is filled with trees and lakes, to provide a peaceful atmosphere. The housing at the university is amazing, because it allows the students to have privacy but also freedom. If i could change one thing at clayton state it would be to have more events to bring the students together."
Freshman,4,I am  duel enrollment student so I found that CSU helped me with learning how to write and it helped to prepare me to go into actual college.
Freshman,4,"Professors at CSU really care about teaching their students. I have been here for a while and I do feel comfortable with the academics. There are also many tutoring and writing services there for students. The only problems are finding parking during peak hours & the service provided by the admissions, public safety, etc. offices. It feels like they are too busy to adequately help their students."
Junior,4,Clayton State University main campus is in a very bad area. I am always getting notifications of robberies and crimes happening on campus. Luckily I take most classes online and at the peachtree city campus.
Freshman,4,Good College with a beautiful campus. Many people are caring and want to see you succeed. It is currently my first semester there but I really like it. They make planning for you future really easy they encourage you to get things done. The sooner you start things the sooner you finish.
Niche User,4,I spent the weekend at Clayton state and i enjoyed it a lot there were plenty of things to do like go to the student activity center or go to the library.
Junior,4,Professors are very kind and helpful. Classes are very easy if you try. Students are very friendly. Stores have a lot of options to choose from and are cheap.
Junior,4,"It’s a nice university with classes that are challenging, yet manageable. I’ve not had a bad professor yet. The parking situation isn’t great and the school itself isn’t beautiful, but everyone is helpful and wants you to do well and learn."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Clayton State University was unforgettable.  My freshman year was the most challenging year that I have ever experienced, and that is why I give it a 4 star rating.  The professors make sure you work hard and earn the grade you deserve.  The classes are reasonably sized, with 40-50 students being my largest class so far.  In that way, I didn't feel like a number.  Instead, my professors knew who I was and I was easier to build  relationships with them."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Clayton State has been good overall. The campus is nice and the professors are helpful. The tutoring services are excellent as well. However, there is literally duck excrement on the sidewalks daily, because the ducks roam around randomly. Also, I don't really know about the area outside of campus, but there has been a few incidents that occurred."
Junior,4,"I began my education at Clayton State University Fall 2014 as a Dual- Enrollment Student. Clayton State University was always an extremely friendly environment. The professors here really want their students to succeed. Overall, Clayton State is a great place for getting your education and the community will encourage you to strive for your dreams."
Sophomore,4,I've had a wonderful experience at CSU! I am transfer student who has attended one other university before CSU. My admissions experience was great. I had no problems with admissions and advisement. The mandatory advisement each semester is great help and I know that this is a measure taken to make sure I take the required courses for graduation. My major is in Marketing  which has proven to be the best choice for me. I am almost junior now and looking forward to graduate from CSU. I love being a CSU Laker! Go Lakers!
Senior,4,"While the campus is small, it is intimate. Student Life is very active and veteran resources are available."
Sophomore,4,I like the atmosphere and the academic at Clayton State. People are easy going and campus is nice and calm.
College Junior,4,The value of receiving a degree from this school is valuable.  The quality of theis school can get you to a successful future and career.  The internships are highly recommended at this school.
College Junior,4,The team spirit at Clayton Stae University is highly enforced.  The basketball team is excellent and they does  great job in their competition.
College Senior,4,"I really enjoy how passionate my teachers are with me and my classmates.  They want to see us be successful, they want to see us do and be our best, and they are willing to give their all in order for us to achieve our goals."

College Freshman,4,The student center and other facilities enable higher rate of success.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe although I cannot speak for others
College Junior,4,"I have used the career services any time I have had an interview. They have helped me create my CV, resume, and interview preparations and appropriate attire."
Freshman,2,"School is meh... lacked student involvement and since the school is so small.. nothing but drama! The school does not care for its students AT ALL but curriculum and professors were pretty good. Great school for your pockets, AWFUL if you want to have an amazing and memorable experience."
Graduate Student,2,Teachers could be very hard to reach for both individual questions as well as feedback on (group)projects. Grading could sometimes take a very long time too.
Graduate Student,2,"I'm not a fan of their online program at all! Unless you're close to the school, the teachers allow online students to sit in on class. The classes are setup in a way that you probably won't make it out in the year as advertised. You may want to bring your own financial aid to save at least one headache."
Freshman,2,"pretty decent school overall, could use a lot of work, from the food to the campus appearance. The food is the same thing everyday, and doesn't really taste good unless its breakfast. The campus is full of geese that poop everywhere."
College Sophomore,2,I have no experience with any of the fraternities at my school and non do I know anyone who has experience or is a part of one.
College Sophomore,2,"I wouldn't choose this school ever, the only reason I go here is because it is close to my parent's house. lt smells awful when it is warm outside, professors can be very racist, and there is a new criminal investigation every week. I would not recommend this school to anyone you won't even get far enough in your basic requirements to learn anything related to your major because barely any resources (helpful resources) are available to learn."
College Freshman,2,"I'm personally not into sports. I give a two point rating based off of the fact that I personally never hear about our sports team. Not from the students or the staff. Our school proclaimed athletes are rarely a factor on our campus as far as I've noticed. However our athletic facility is amazing. They host a weight area, work out area, cardio area, two basketball courts, and three dance/yoga/etc. rooms."
College Freshman,2,I do not enjoy Clayton State University at all.
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't choose the school again because of the disorganization. Also the Gugino is to expensive to not offer much for the students.
College Senior,2,"It is what you make of it. There are some good people here and some bad apples as well, Just socialize with the smart kids who do the right thing and have a good moral compass. As for dating, the majority of students here are overweight/obese. The more attractive students who are in shape will probably be the athletes, which usually are taken. If you are looking for a mate, you might find one, but don't count on it. There is a much higher ratio of females to males."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have parties on campus. They are more like kick backs, but usually they are shut down by cops."
College Student,2,Since the area is very spread out the off campus dining is mostly fast food. Not much you would want to eat
College Sophomore,2,"The Financial Aid office here at Clayton State os absolutely HORRIBLE! They dont do what they're supposed to do half of the time, they send loans through late! I dont know why they feel the need that its based off of their time! No we're the ones in school and have to pay for these classes so when we send in our loans they need to be submitted IMMEDIATELY for processing! Another thing is that over the summer I completely understand that the Financial Aid office is busy, but there has been times when I've been on hold close to 2hrs waiting for the phone to go through and it finally goes through and the phone just rings no one answers!!! I dont know if we need better reps here or what it is, but something has got to change!"
College Senior,2,"We have a Walmart and a Kroger's that stay open all night to cater to the students but that's it. In order to go for some entertainment we have to play in Walmart or catch a cab to Atlanta. There are not alot of things to do in Morrow, and I could really kick myself for not having reliable transportation."
College Senior,2,"Clayton Laker Dining has dramatically in the quality of their foods. The menu consists of pizza, salad bar, grill, main menu, and vegetarian entree. The food used to be great but recently the quality has went down. They open from nine am to eight pm. Sandella's (which is another shop) closes at 11 pm. College students are awake until at least 2 am."
College Senior,2,"I have to travel a good distance, so I'm taking online classes until necessary to attend class on campus"
College Senior,2,Design of the school actually makes parking more difficult.
College Junior,2,A new building is taking up parking spots.
College Freshman,2,Horrible smelling and looking dorms and to high of cost. Only option too
College Freshman,2,People just wear (or not wear) whatever they want
College Freshman,2,You can tell that most students come in high or something
College Freshman,2,The kinda trap you into a web so you can get out and make you pay for things that are not a most
College Freshman,2,There have their own anal way of doing things that are not at other university.
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty bad, I feel like I could get mugged at any sec. Really bad neborhod"
College Sophomore,2,"The only thing that is close to my campus are fast food restaurants. None offer student discounts, which could really help out."
College Sophomore,2,The nightlife in Clayton is alright but to get a real thrill Atlanta is the place to be
College Junior,2,"It's a little on the expensive side and freshman are required to live in the dorms. Also, the roommate selection process is horrible. You may have preferred a roommate that isn't up all night but you get stuck with one that is. Safety is also an issue but mainly with guests. On a couple occasions, female residents have been sexually assaulted by guys that don't even live in the dorms."
College Junior,2,There is no on campus transportation.
College Sophomore,2,Campus dwoesnt have alot of options but it'll do. 
College Sophomore,2,I am a dual enrollment student here at CSU and I have yet to encounter something that is notably unique about it.
College Freshman,2,"McDonlads, Burger King, Wendy's. The same ole, same ole. Blah, blah, blah. Wal-Mart & Kroger are close, so grocery shopping is possible for all would be chiefs."
College Senior,2,"Well Clayton State doesn't have a plethora of attractive guys on campus. There are some very attractive guys, but they are hiding. As for the girls they are about as average as the guys are in terms of looks."
College Sophomore,2,"The Greek life doesn't seem to be a very big deal. It's only a big deal to those involved in Greek life. They throw some parties on campus, which usually aren't worth attending, and there isn't any Greek housing. Non-Greeks don't seem to view them as very important."
College Sophomore,2,"The dining hall isn't the best. Most students complain about the food, which usually isn't very tasty, healthy, or varied. There is a Pizza Hut, Subconnection, and Jazzman's available in the University Center. Pizza Hut and Subconnection serve decent food, but are the only other alternatives to the dining hall. Jazzman's only sells coffee, pastries, and has a couple vending machines. Sandella's is also an option on campus, but it's located in the freshmen dorms, Laker Hall, so it's not the most convenient place for people who don't live in that building. Most commuters don't even know of its existence or location."
College Sophomore,2,"Laker Hall was secured despite the one issue that ended up on the news. Walking the campus after ten is even okay. But living in Clayton Station is horrible with safety. For it to always be a cop guarding, so many crimes occur--robbing, car theft are the most prevalent."
College Sophomore,2,Not a HUGE variety at all! If anything it is quite limited. The one great thing I can say that certain majors such as Healthcare Mngmt. and Health and Fitness management are offered here rather than at most colleges.
College Sophomore,2,"Because of the location of CSU--Clayton County, I wouldn't recommend living off campus unless you find a nice apartment in a safe gated community."
Recent Alumnus,2,there really aren't that many to choose from. mostly chain restaurants.
College Senior,2,There isn't much to do around the school. Have to drive at least 30 mins for anything
College Freshman,2,"The girls here are just embarrassing and hard to look at, most not all. The guys are cute, especially the foreign ones. They are really nice and kind. As for the females they are just depressing, too hype for the wrong things and just look ridiculous. The guys are pretty cool but are not direct with their intentions. Do not expect to find the one the first year of college, and be careful who you involve yourself with, not everyone is trustworthy."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of nurse majors and really good soccer players. Not a hugely diverse campus, very few rednecks though. The average age on campus is like 27, we have a ton of non-traditional students, which mean this is a college where adults go back to get their degrees."
College Freshman,2,There really isn't much unless one of the clubs do something.
College Freshman,2,I wish there were more.  It doesn't have as many as GSU or UGA.
College Freshman,2,"I would recommend this school for those majoring in nursing, dental or pre-dental hygiene. This school is excellent for that! However, if you are seeking to complete your premed courses and so forth I would not recommend this."
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid takes you through a headache, there are rarely any scholarships there, its important that you stay on top of your financial aid as soon as you start school, you can add that to your class schedule as well so by the end of the semester you can be situated for the next semester."
College Sophomore,2,"The restaurants provided, which are only two and not really restaurants but they are pretty good. I really do not like the dining hall food choices and it does not really taste that good."
College Sophomore,2,I would give it a C due to the hear say that crosses my path. However i do not attend any campus events so i cant give specific feedback...
College Junior,2,"Drinking and having weapons on campus are a big no no. Campus security is not heavy, but if they find out something serious, there is plenty law enforcement nearby that will get involved very quickly."
College Senior,2,"Same Old Stuff!!!! Pretty well kept up and ready to serve quickly. Only problem is that the options get old after a while. Not many people support new businesses in the area and it is a drag to go to Wendy's, Taco-Bell, and American Deli every day. So I take my lunch instead."
College Senior,2,"I Wish I Had Went to Georgia State – I went here because it was close and cheap. I got exactly what I paid for. It is not a fun school to be at. Academically it is great, but I truely wish that I had not let my fear of dept keep me from going to Georgia State or University of Georgia (which I had been accepted to as well). It is my own fault for going however, I hope that people who read my reviews realize what their experience at Clayton State will be like. It will be very boring. It used to be for just old people and commuters and it still has not changed. I am getting ready to go to law school now and I hope that I shall have a better and more memorable time at my law school than I had at Clayton State. Good riddance CSU!"
College Sophomore,2,"Majors at CSU are practical but not innovative. Of course there are the General Majors of Biology, History, English, Psychology,and others the school still lacks innovative programs for students that wish to take on more of a double major. From experience I have witnessed that CSU does not want   there students to partake in a double major. They would rather you single major than anything else in the world. Even though this is college, there are still restrictions that can hinder you from exploring your true potential. If you really want a new innovating major(s) don;t come to CSU. Try another institution."
College Senior,2,"It's Hot – The weather varies so much in Georgia but weather is never a good excuse to miss a lecture unless the weather affects the lecture itself. Classes rarely get cancelled. They have never been cancelled because of intense weather conditions. But besides class, weather plays a major role in extra curricular, campus-wide activities. Good weather conditions obviously determine the attendance at sporting events and even events held indoors because we have to walk everywhere."
College Senior,2,Very Cold – The air is one in every class even in the winter time. I can barley learn because im concentrating on the tempeture of the class rooms.
College Junior,2,"I believe the school has good majors, but my bad experience with them is that they can't seem to tell you exactly which classes and how many classes you have left to take to obtain the degree.  My experience has been extremely frustrating."
College Freshman,2,"The greek life on campus is sometimes a cool thing because they have certain events that they do to get the students on campus more involved. Sometimes they may have parties on campus you have to pay for, and they know that a lot of students aren't going to pay."
College Freshman,2,"Were Are All the Parties? I only have been at my school since the Spring semester of 2012. We have only had 7 parties this whole semester. Those parties were not even all that. The best party was the last one which was a fraternity party, off campus. Hopefully Fall Semester will be better.."
College Junior,2,If you don't have a car then that might be a problem. It's a closed campus so there aren't any shuttles besides the inconsistent golf cart rides. There is no public transportation in the county so you can't really go too far.
College Junior,2,"There is hardly any Greek life here on campus. I mean that can be good but its one of the perks of having them on campus is to see and hear them. Due to their absence, you can't see what they are doing for the school or the community. Are they involved? Maybe but I can't tell."
College Sophomore,2,If you do not own a car you must live on campus. It is difficult to find a good parking space. We do not have buses on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"For the most part, the best nightlife is found by leaving campus and traveling towards downtown Atlanta."
Niche User,1,"CSU should be embarrassed to call itself a university. Professors are unprepared and unorganized and it sets students up for failure. My professor didn't show up on the first day. Unacceptable. 

I'm a post bacc student, and three semesters in, I can't register myself for classes like a normal student. I have to email the department heads separately and have them register me. 

There are cops on the campus weekly for some type of violent or unsafe incident. 

It's just a sham of an education and no one in education respects them and it shows why."
Niche User,1,"It's bad. Teachers don't send you the links for meetings, they don't accurately post deadlines or assignments either."
Junior,1,Horrible school! Financial Aid office outright lies to the students ya just to get the money! They screwed up everyone’s financial aid for summer 2020 and told none of us! Not one email notification or mail correspondence! First day of classes none of my classes have been paid for and no money for books. They won’t return phone calls or emails. They only want the money do not care about the students! Withdrew and will be enrolling in Georgia State in the fall! Nothing but a bunch of incompetent people working there. Never again and I will be reporting them to the department of education.
Junior,1,Yes I did and they were horrible! The applications were hard to use and confusing. Instructors were lazy and didn’t explain anything... I didn’t learn one single thing while attending this school.
Sophomore,1,"I was hoping to see other reviews about this but the Financial Aid and Bursar's Office is terrible. I have spent the past three months dealing with them losing my paperwork and fluctuating my student loan amount for no reason at all (I transferred here and I never had this problem at my first school). I've been stressed out and unsure of whether I'll even be able to stay in my classes or get my books because they're constantly delaying my refund. Now they've fully reversed it because they decided to entirely change the loan amount that I'm getting without telling me. It is a month into classes now.

On top of that, their degree programs are extremely strict, though they don't have many resources available for you to gain experience in your field. They only offer two languages and in the Criminal Justice program, you can't even choose which of the two to take; it has to be Spanish."
Sophomore,1,"This school is a waste of money and it is so dry and boring. It is based in the hood, the teachers here don't really care if you pass or fail. Its hard to get a job getting out of this school."
Alum,1,The Information Technology department at Clayton State University is very negative towards their students. A former CSU IT instructor informed me that most students don’t complete their IT bachelor’s degree at this college because the department likes to hold their students back. Professor Ken Nguyen is an IT instructor at this college who likes to discriminate and belittle minority students. He lectures only to his white students and ignores his minority students like they don’t exist. I find it very disappointing that a large amount of students have to withdraw from his classes every semester because he doesn't want to teach them. He only wants to bolster his ego by showing how little the students know and how much he knows instead of trying to make sure the students learn the material. He doesn't give the student's any hope of success in his classes. He is part of the reason why this department is not doing well at the moment.
College Freshman,1,There's no positive impact at all most of the party people had to drop classes or college by the 2nd month of classes
College Senior,1,"Honestly, this is not an area that I would live in. I used to and the houses lost over 75% of their value. I would not recommend Clayton County to anyone who has children and wants them to attend a good public school. Let's just say that some high schools don't even carry soap or toilet paper in their bathrooms."
College Senior,1,"To be completely honest, the majority of the places near the campus are fast food joints and cater to the unhealthy type of person. The healthiest place near by is Hong Kong City and VN Pho. Almost everything else is fried chicken, burgers, pizza, hot dogs, fries and those sort of things."
College Senior,1,"The school does not have a party scene. After all, the median age of students here are 25 or older. Many of them are parents and go to school during the evening. This is not a UGA/GA TECH Campus."
College Freshman,1,The only method I had of financial aid is LOANS!!!
College Student,1,Their are no parties on campus. If you want parties you have to travel up to Atlanta. IF the party is advertised on campus they tend to be shady at best.
College Freshman,1,Due to the fact that there isn't any.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking here is AWFUL. When I came here fall of 2012, parking already was a major issue. At that time you had to be on campus at least 15-20 mins before you class started because it would take 10-15 mins to find a parking place near your class. BUT NOW THAT THEY HAVE REMOVED PARKING LOTS TO BUILD A NEW SCIENCE BUILDING, YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE AN OPTION TO PARK NEAR MOST OF THE MAIN BUILDINGS UNLESS YOU ARRIVE BEFORE 9 AM MON-THURS. I have witnessed several physical altercations over parking spaces. I personally have started arriving hours before my classes simply to ensure I have a reasonable parking space."
College Junior,1,Students uses Adderall to help them focus.
College Sophomore,1,The parking is bad because of construction and the growth of the students
College Junior,1,It is rare that you can find a good spot on campus. You would have to get to school well before 11am to get a great spot
College Junior,1,"Ever since Clayton County took away the bus system a few years back, many people have complained. I commute by car about 35 minutes each way and it's not that bad."
College Sophomore,1,"There are no transportation options at Clayton State. Most students get around by walking, driving their own car, or knowing other students that are willing to take them wherever they need to go."
College Senior,1,There is no public transportation at Clayton State which sucks. It would be really coo if there were buses to take people without cars to the grocery store at least. Is that too much to ask?
College Senior,1,"The Housing staff at Clayton Station are incredibly rude, I went in yesterday trying to handle some business and one of the front desk agents named Danni had a nasty attitude. She kept rolling her eyes and couldn't believe that I couldn't remember a managers name from a year ago."
College Sophomore,1,"Thankfully this school is only 15 minutes away from Atlanta, but then again Atlanta becomes boring as well. If you love to party and club or attend self-proclaimed kickbacks then you'll fit right in I suppose."
College Senior,1,"There really isnt any, unless you plan on walking a couple of miles"
Recent Alumnus,1,Makes me late to class. Never a good spot. Makes me want to park in teachers area because I am late for class driving in circles sometimes.
College Senior,1,Not enough room for everyone. They need more parking
College Freshman,1,"There are no options provided. You must have your own car or you must walk. Fortunately, the campus is very small and very accessible from either the dorms or apartments."
College Freshman,1,"You need to have your own laptop. Not a desktop. Many professors require that you have access to your laptop for assignments and work. Math classes are hybrids, so keep that in mind as well."
College Sophomore,1,"Clayton State does not have a transportation for students. If the student has a car then it's more than likely that they will drive over to closer parking lots at the college, Everything is fairly close and mostly walking distance. Some students also carpool if they are living in Clayton Station."
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have a car or know somebody with one you will be bored out of your mind. Shopping wise, Walmart and Kroger are walking distance."
College Freshman,1,"No public transportation. This is a boring town, with no college atmosphere whatsoever. It's full of adults/non-traditional students, so of course nightlife is lacking. Twenty or thirty minutes north is Atlanta though, and that's full of options."
College Freshman,1,The freshmen dorms on campus are pretty boring. Rarely some kickbacks. Um it's pretty boring for the most part if you are not involved.
College Junior,1,"The allow the faculty and staff to have majority of the spaces, even though the student out weigh the staff in population. It is complicated to find a good space, It is wise to go early. You have to constantly search for a spot, even in the back"
College Sophomore,1,Its a must that you have your own laptop to attend this college..!
College Senior,1,Bus? Car? Train? There are absolutely no transportation opportunities at my college. This is not good because everyone drives and causes a traffic jam. Public transit was removed so many people walk across the road too. This makes it very hard to get where I need to go when I am in a rush. I would probably ride alternately if it was available but it is not. This also takes away chances of underprivileged youth to get the chance to go to college at all.
College Senior,1,"You only qualify for most scholarships if you are a business, teacher ed, or nursing major; it is nearly impossible to qualify for scholarships otherwise. The office of financial aid is poorly managed and always cuts it close when it is time to disperse financial aid."
College Senior,1,This Campus Is Too Strict – The campus is trying so hard not to offend anyone that they are unable please anyone.
College Senior,1,"Student Organizations Are Too Resticted – All of the activities that are put on by student organizations are heavily monitored and censored by the department of campus life. The university tries to make up for this by building new buildings and gyms and increasing funding to the student organizations that the department of campus life deligates most directly (DEEP, Student Government Association, and Campus Events Council). As a result of the funding favoritism and the department of campus life's desire to cesnor all of the organizations this campus is simply devoid of fun. I honestly wish that I could have afforded to go to Georgia State University."
College Sophomore,1,Not Enough Spaces – Parking at CSU is a nightmare that you will never wake up from. Anytime before 9 am is the best time to find a parking space. However between the hours of 9-5 pm on tues/thursday is hell trying to find a parking space. Best advice if you are a commuter student than try and get to school early.
College Junior,1,"No Clubs – this is not a normal college campus. Most students have jobs and family life that they tend to after school, so very limited social life on campus.  No college bars in area."

Graduate Student,5,My learning experience was excellent. I had access to all of my professors and they worked and diligently to ensure that I was successful.
Graduate Student,5,I attended Thomas as a graduate student. The professors are very knowledgeable and supportive. The Teacher Leadership Cohort is a great program and I look forward to seeing Thomas adding the Doctoral program in this area. The tuition is affordable and it was another reason why I chose Thomas University.
Graduate Student,5,I am currently enrolled and scheduled to start program in August 2020. The admissions process was explained satisfactorily by representatives The Mental Health Counseling Program is CACREP accredited . It meets the needs of becoming a licensed counselor in the state of Georgia.
Sophomore,5,The one thing I love about Thomas University is the international diversity. I enjoy being able to study with different cultures who have different views. We all learn from each other. If I could change one thing about the University it would be for more classes to be offered on campus verses to the extensive high volume of classes online.
Freshman,5,"I went to Thomas University on a visit for their baseball program.The city looks really nice , it’s a small town but it doesn’t look like there’s a lot of violence. The first place I went was the baseball field, there were houses around it and that makes it look like good , the coaches there were super nice and I also meet some athletes from the team and they were really nice too.After we finished the baseball workout we went to the main campus,It’s just a couple miles away from the baseball field.The campus looks nice and clean, it’s not too big so I don’t think I would have trouble to find my classes, coaches showed me the building where athletes live and how is their like as a student athlete. After that visit at Thomas University I knew that was the school where I wanted to continue my education and baseball career and today I’m committed to play baseball there in my freshman year."
Freshman,5,It's a good school to go to because it has small class. The staff is committed to see you succeed and if you don't then it is your own fault. You get a lot of people who are from different countries so it has a lot of diversity. It is a little expensive to go here but it has quality education. I have had a really good experience going here.
Sophomore,5,It was easy for me to apply and get my acceptance letter. Overall my experience has been a great one.
Sophomore,5,It’s has great family type of environment. You can also talk to your professor face to face. Thomas unversity has a great place to study and get help with different subjects.
Sophomore,5,"Thomas University has a beautiful campus with faculty and classmates that feel like family. It provides a wonderful atmosphere where everyone feels comfortable and safe, while all fun is being held around."
Freshman,5,The campus is gorgeous and very easily navigated. It's a campus that isn't very crowded with buildings pushed against one another. It's also in a very secluded place for a more quiet environment. The staff is very helpful and genuinely very sweet. I would recomennd this college to anyone that was searching!
College Sophomore,5,"My school is small but we're like a family. The majority is athletes and we take in and recruit student athletes from around the world. Each team takes care of each other and as a majority we feel unstoppable. On top of that, the academic program is impeccable. The classes are challenging but the professors are understanding of our athletic schedules. We have a small campus and don't have class on Fridays to prevent athletes from missing class due to games. We get free tutoring and our coaches make us go because we are students before athletes. We are also very involved in the community and athletes are required to clean up the town, do community service, and be a part of church events and services. We function well as an athletic program, an academic program, and as a whole."
College Junior,5,It's rare to find a town where everyone try's to make you welcomed
College Junior,5,Our program is completely online and rated among the best online program in the nation.
College Senior,5,The program I'm in is Medical Lab Science and I love it. I started out in Biology but soon changed it. The professors are always willing to help you and make it fun and easy to learn the material. They respond quickly to your emails if you have any questions.
College Senior,5,"There are plenty of apartments you can look at in Thomasville. I think it is cheaper than living in student housing, if you turn off the lights and don't run the water all the time. It can get expensive if you aren't good about turning off the lights as you are on your own with the utility bill and water bill. They are safe and parking is good. If you don't have a car I would highly recommend living at the dorms or with a roommate that has a car and won't mind driving you everywhere. the closest apartment complex to the school is about 5 miles."
College Junior,5,It's a very small school so ther is not much to get into to
College Sophomore,5,There's two computer labs in the library and a small lab in the tutoring room.  The computers all work well and are always available for use by the students.  The labs are great for the students.
College Freshman,5,The WIFI is great! There are a lot of computers/computer labs available at campus. It is also free to print from the computer which is nice.
College Freshman,5,Offer a variety of sports teams for both men and women. They also offer varsity and JV so more students are able to compete. They work the teams and they are definitely competitive. TU also offers a pretty intensive study program to make sure we succeed in school as well as sports.
College Sophomore,5,There are two computer labs in the Library full of computers. There is almost always a computer open and printing is free and extremely easy to do. Every now and then the internet is down but it is very rare. They usually send out an email letting you know when it will be down. The wifi at the dorms can be hard to access if a lot of people are using it.
Freshman,4,We’re a family! Everybody supports everybody. Strongly recommend getting into a club or sport. Small town and small classes. Easy to get one-on-one work with your professor.
Freshman,4,"Located just 30 miles north of Florida's capital, Thomas University is a gem that sits on 75 acres at the home of the Honorable W. Cameron Forbes, Ambassador and grandson of Ralph Waldo Emerson. The moment that I visited on campus, to meet Mr. Ferguson, Vice President of Enrollment was life-changing. Thomas University is a place where different races, ethnicities and nationalities come together to learn about current issues, culture, society, and ourselves in small classes. Although Thomas University as a private college tuition and fees are quite expensive for the area. On the other hand, having the opportunity to be offered a chance to learn has solidified my objective to graduate with a master's degree in Social Work (MSW). Ideally, Thomas University campus offers quality programs and professors like Dr. Gresham and Ford who will prepare you for life!"
Junior,4,"Thomas University is a small simple school. It is full of professors who are very willing to help their students succeed when they see the effort put forth. With it being a small university, it is also quite easy to create relationships with classmates."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the flexibility of pursing my degree online, however the tuition is expensive with little scholarship opportunity for students who are not Georgia residents."
Freshman,4,It is actually a very good website. It shows us what scholarships are available and when they deadline is for each scholarship also
College Junior,4,My experience at Thomas University has been great. I enjoy my classes and the professors. Everyone is very helpful wether you are online or in person.
College Junior,4,The teams that Thomas University have been great. They have great players and students.

College Senior,4,The school is very good. Great diversity in students and majors. The professors are great and classes can be scheduled around my busy home life
College Sophomore,4,Nice downtown but everything close early

College Junior,4,"People attend from all different background, religion, and, diversity."
College Junior,4,"Great, great way to meet people"
College Junior,4,Did not have any problems
College Junior,4,The city is small but has a great community with great people.
College Junior,4,The network and speed at our campus is good but one program Blackboard is sometime a little tempermental at times
College Junior,4,faculty interaction with the students
College Junior,4,we do have a large percentage of our students who are distance learning students therefore we do not see them. Out of our traditional students they are comprised of athletic students from many different countries.
College Junior,4,We have students from many diverse backgrounds
College Junior,4,We don't have much peer pressure or alcohol or drug visibility on our campus. The policy for this is strictly enforced.
College Junior,4,We offer a lot of help in finding off campus housing and even have discount rates at some apartment complexes.
College Junior,4,Our campus parking is great. Parking is free and no matter what time of the day you can find a parking space. We also offer free shuttle service from one campus to another.
College Junior,4,I plan to participate in an internship very soon for the program I am enrolled in.
College Junior,4,"I am not familiar with the campus security since I am an online student at this time. However, a honors code of integrity is enforced regarding academics."
College Junior,4,"Thomas University offers opportunities to study academics that are either hybrid, on-campus, or totally on-line."
College Junior,4,The instructors at Thomas University show a lot of enthusiasm in making sure that the student really does take something of importance from the classes.
College Senior,4,"TU is a small school and everyone gets along and is very close with each other. If you ever need anything you can ask anyone, even the community. We have this program called Adopt A Student and families within Thomasville will ""adopt"" you and you can do laundry there they will cook you food. They are your family away from your family."
College Senior,4,The professors at TU are always willing to help you as long as you are putting effort in. They will bend over backwards for you to try and better you.
College Senior,4,The computers on campus are wonderful. The only thing that I would say bad about them is you only get 30 pages to print each day. You may think that is a lot but once you print PowerPoints for your classes those 30 pages goes quick.
College Senior,4,Nightlife at TU is getting better. There are more and more students getting interested in it. About once a week there will be game night at the dorms or in the library and you can win all kind of fun things.
College Senior,4,"Living in the dorms is a great way to meet new people, I recommend living there if you are a freshman or sophomore. They can get loud at night and messy at times but some of my favorite memories was from living two years in the dorms. The apartments at TU are nice, even though they are spread out. The living can get cramped, as for a two bedroom one bath they will put four people in there."
College Senior,4,"At TU the campus can be strict, the staff are always looking out for your best interest even if you don't agree with them. They know when to be strict and when to relax and have a good time. They have a zero tolerance for drug use and the campus is a tobacco free. With attending classes the professors expect you to go to class every day, but they also understand if you miss. You just need to email them and they will get with you if you have to make the class up or the assignments that you missed."
College Junior,4,"So far so good.If I had to do it over again I would have majored in this the first time instead of wasting 4 years getting another degree I didn't need. My career plans after I graduate are to take my NAACLS exam and become a Medical Laboratory Scientist working at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital then later in the Veterans Clinic they are buliding in Tallahassee in the next 3 years. No there will be no trouble finding a job in my field, healthcare professionals are always in high demand."
College Sophomore,4,"There's a variety of places to eat near my school.  A short drive leads you right into town where there's all kinds of restaurants such as Italian, Chinese, southern home cooking, and then most of the fast food chains."
College Sophomore,4,There isn't an exhorbitant number of students so there is plenty of parking
College Freshman,4,Many international students attend Thomas University.
College Freshman,4,"Every person are allowed to be themselves at TU. There are all different kinds of races and religions on campus. Especially since there are so many international students. I would call the environment a ""family"" environment at TU."
College Freshman,4,"There is no buses or taxi's around Thomasville which is not good if you do not have a car. However, the school have a shuttle bus with a good schedule that drives by all the student housings! In addition, every Friday, the shuttle will go to Wal Mart if students need to shop. The only bad thing I have to say about the shuttle is that it sometimes do not follow its schedule."
College Freshman,4,Good food and very nice personnel. The place is small so things are pretty much made for you when you order it.
Senior,2,"Thomas University is extremely underfunded, there's frequent turn over in staff, beautiful location with no service so bring your mail-pigeon."
College Sophomore,2,Some teachers are great then others go by the color of skin
College Junior,2,School needs much work but its a small private school so I really don't expect much...
College Sophomore,2,Very Little – there are very few Greek affliations on campus and I know very little about them

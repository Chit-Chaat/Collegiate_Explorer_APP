Niche User,5,I love that I am able to take classes while in high school. It saves me a lot of time and money that I will not have to spend later on.
Senior,5,"Ferris is a great school regarding academics, support and making new friends. The staff will bend over backward to help a student out in any way."
Junior,5,"I have taken a few classes online at Ferris. The layout makes it very easy to understand what needs to be done for the week, and how it needs to be done. My professors have been very good at making sure their students know everything they need to know in order to complete the online courses successfully. They are very patient when it comes to internet connection issues, offering make-ups and working around whatever personal issues you may have going on. The professors are willing to do pretty much anything to make sure you are successful in your course, as long as you show you are willing to put in the work and the extra time."
Sophomore,5,Great staff great location . Loved the parking lots and the football games. The energy in the crowds were amazing.
Junior,5,"I enjoyed having a smaller campus to live on, as well as all the fun opportunities I was given with my education and future, as well as all the fun and social opportunities. Not only did I feel more satisfied with my education, I felt happier making new friends to spend time with while also being able to have my own space at times. I want to continue going to Ferris to further my education and I intend to graduate from Ferris in either 2022 or 2023 depending on how things go between the current pandemic and the requirements I need to satisfy in order to obtain my degree."
Sophomore,5,Campus is really beautiful. The staff are really nice. The food is great. You have an opportunity to try new things
Senior,5,I would like to see more online classes made available for students. The college is a fun atmosphere and a fun place to be for students.
Senior,5,Online learning experience was easily accessible and fun learning. The online Canvas is easy to maneuver and helps aid with learning.
Junior,5,I am glad to be attending Ferris State University for three years now. They had taught me what a real college experience is. They are not perfect and always can progress.
Niche User,5,"I love Ferris so much. The first time that it toured Ferris I fell in love with the campus. That is how you should feel about the a college if you are going to go to it for the next four years. The dorms on campus are nice, they have all types of style and building you can choose from across campus. The campus  has to restaurant the student could choose and eat at, the Rock and the Quad, both places are really good in my opinion. The campus it's self isn't a really big campus but then at the same time it isn't a small campus either. For all the athletic students or anybody that wants to work out, Ferris has a Rec center that is free to all students everyday of the week, as well as club sports that do travel. Ferris also has over 200 student organizations that students can get involved in and meet new people that have similar hobbies as them.  I am so excited to start college this upcoming fall and start the next chapter of my life."
Senior,5,So far I have enjoyed my time at Ferris. It kind of sucked for a little bit without an adviser as I really liked the one that I had and she was very helpful. The new one is alright. I wish more of the classes were offered online but I understand the importance of having on campus classes and doing presentations and getting actual feedback on your work from your classmates in person. I also like that I go to the downtown campus and have had opportunities to take classes at GRCC to save myself hundreds of dollars on classes.
Freshman,5,"Coming from a high school that was absolutely terrible, Ferris State has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. Everyone there is so accepting and always looking to make friends. Class sizes are great, campus size is perfect, the professors really do care about you succeeding and are very easy to talk to/work with, there are an abundance of resources to help you succeed academically, and there are so many ways to get involved. Ferris offers organizations, teams, clubs, or just fun opportunities to get you involved for even just one night. We are also known for having amazing food!"
Sophomore,5,"Great academics, great experience. Not all professors will be in your favor, but you'll definitely learn something new everyday and it will stick with you throughout your entire career."
Senior,5,I love the small community at ferris. I do not have much bad time say other than the parking here sucks.
Freshman,5,"It has the best pharmacy and optometry programs in the state of Michigan.  In addition, the campus and staff are great!  I would definitely recommend this school to anyone who is interested in pursuing either a pharmacy or optometry degree."
Freshman,5,"I love Ferris State University, especially because they care about their students. Recently they started accepting students based on their GPA rather than their test scores because they believe that everyone deserves a chance."
Junior,5,I love Ferris State University as a whole and think it has so much to offer. Like any school there are rough areas of leadership but with the right help you can conquer all.
Graduate Student,5,I liked the small town feeling of Big Rapids. You were able to recognize people from different classes or from casually meeting them in different areas. It brought a sense of closeness especially since you can walk to anywhere on campus since it was close to your classes and where you eat.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Ferris. Pefect medium sized school, kind of secluded but still prominent in the community. Very good, technical programs, most professors really care about you."
Junior,5,"I love the flexibility that Ferris offers to its students. I started out going to Ferris in my hometown, but decided to leave for a bigger city that Ferris also had a location at. Even if I went to a city without a Ferris location I could have continued by education through their online programs. These online programs are still offered to general students, and I have used these to give myself even more flexibility in the hours that I focus on school."
Junior,5,"I love the size of campus, not too big or too small. The professors here either career do not care, most of them care for you as a student. They want to help you succeed. The options here are great, I love all the RSOs"
Sophomore,5,"Easy to navigate campus, great professors, very helpful advisory. Ferris offers free tutoring which is such a helpful tool to help you better academically."
Works Here,5,Ferris State is a place where the students truly come first. I have worked at other  4-year and 2-year universities and colleges and potential for relationship building is outstanding.
Niche User,5,I know people that are attending Ferris and I visited campus last year. Definitely my top choice of college.
Senior,5,"I love Ferris. Other family members of mine go here, as well and I highly recommend it.
The cost of college is expensive but, it is all about the education and experience you get from it!"
Freshman,5,Ferris State University where I met my best friend she was my suitemate they compared our two personality's and roomed us together. One thing I would change about Ferris is that they need more African American programs.
Freshman,5,I love the environment every time I have visited the campus I have felt so welcomed. The food is also very good I like the fact that I get a big selection to choose from.
Freshman,5,"Although I have only been at Ferris State University for one year, it has been the great year. Since I was a  Freshman, I stayed in the dorms. The dorm I stayed in was an older building but it was still  nicely kept. The students on campus are very helpful and respecting. The campus itself is a decent size. It is small enough that you can see the same people on a day to day basis, yet big enough that you will still see new people everyday. All the facilities that students are allowed to use are great too."
Freshman,5,"This college is a small school but with full college atmosphere.  The students are very friendly and welcoming.  The school centers on offering an education that prepares you for the working world after college, not just on an education."
Sophomore,5,Ferris is a great school for kids who come from smaller towns and arenâ€™t ready to dive right into a big city.
Sophomore,5,"Ferris State University has been the perfect home away from home. Here, I have found my support system of sorority sisters who treat me just as well as everyone should treat anyone. Additionally, I have found that many of the professors do care if you pass their class or not and are willing to help guide you towards success every step of the way. Another factor that helps everyone succeed here is that we have free tutoring services that are students helping other students. All of these facilities, whether it be the register student organizations or the learning programs of this university, Ferris is a home where you are here to grow into the best version of yourself."
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere at this campus. the people here are just so welcoming and they honestly care about your well-being and you succeeding.
Junior,5,Great professors and amazing administration. They really put the time and effort into meeting your needs when it comes to your academics and getting to know people on campus!
Graduate Student,5,"Great education, caring and professional professors, active student life and RSO's, great value and great staff to work with when there are issues with financial aid, admissions, classes, etc.  Small town with enough things to do on campus and around the town to stay busy and have that feeling of being home. Beautiful and safe campus with lots of lights, public safety, blue boxes and programs set in place."
Alum,5,This University was a very user friendly personal and helpful college.  My dad was given plenty of help from Professors and easily completed my Bachelors degree.  This provided advanced education and financial stability.  The college helped pave a positive future in nursing.
Senior,5,"I do not attend classes on campus, but I have visited the campus before and it is beautiful.  I have been working on my Bachelor's online through Ferris, and so far all of my professors have been kind, helpful, fair, and knowledgable.  I also love my academic advisor, and the Financial Aid office is amazing!"
Freshman,5,They are easy to get in contact with! They offer many unique programs that  fit your style and they work with you to keep you on track all semester long! A good size campus... not too big or not too small.
Senior,5,"Overall, I have had a great experience at Ferris State. I will have received two degrees come this May, and will begin graduate school in the Fall at the College of Pharmacy. The professors have helped greatly, and they genuinely seem to care about each student and helping them understand the material. I have also had professors help with non-school related things, such as assistance with a resume, curriculum vitae, and letter of intent. These instructors are very understanding for the most part."
Graduate Student,5,"Ferris State University offers a variety of programs. Since starting school, I have been able to excell in my profession and make amazing friends along the way."
Freshman,5,"It's a really good university. Great nursing program, students and teacher are very friendly and nice."
Freshman,5,"Really wonderful. The teachers actually care about their students. I chose this school because I got a good scholarship to go here, and plastics engineering students have access to a well-equipped lab to practice their skills in."
Niche User,5,I love the feel of the campus and how it is in a small town just like where I live.  The food is amazing!
Freshman,5,"I like that Ferris State for the most part has small class sizes, so professors can help each and every one of you. Also, all of the staff here at Ferris State University is very helpful, and want to see you grow and succeed."
Junior,5,"Still a Ferris State University student, I earn Ferris credits at Mott Community College in Flint, Michigan. This option that Ferris offers gives me the opportunity to save money while graduating from my dream school. My program is incredible and affordable.  I'm able to travel to campus for athletics and events which is awesome!"
Freshman,5,I love the campus and I love how friendly everyone is. It is the perfect size and they have great food. They are a big business and science college and have great professors here. Ferris has diverse programs and majors and are willing to work with you on your path.
Alum,5,"FSU is an excellent university offering over 190 academic programs in Arts & Sciences, Business, Engineering, Technology, Health Specialties...and more, plus has the highest rated College of Pharmacy in the USA.   In addition, FSU won the 2017-18 NCAA Division II National Basketball Championship."
Freshman,5,Food could be a little better.  Other than that Ferris is career oriented with a job in mind at graduation.  It is one of the few colleges that offers my major of game design and animation.  It is an excellent university.
Niche User,5,"If you are used to a smaller town you will love Ferris. It's not the biggest campus but it's a good size for what and where it is. If good food on campus is a deal breaker, Ferris has great food available on campus."
Graduate Student,5,"Over all, Ferris State University is a great school. Most of the instructors have have field experience, and many still work in their field of practice aside from teaching,which brings a dynamic of real life education to supplement the instruction criteria. I have yet to encounter an instructor that in unapproachable or willing to help students succeed. 
As well there are many activities for students every week end including athletics, games, community volunteer opportunities, and social events."
Senior,5,Great articulation agreement with Mott Community College!  I was able to take 3 years at MCC and 1 year at Ferris to obtain my degree in business administration.  It was more economical to do it this way.  I could take classes at the community college instead of commuting daily or weekly.  On line classes were great as well.
Junior,5,Coming to Ferris is probably one of the best decisions that I have ever made in my life. Everyone is nice and you fit in very quickly. Iâ€™m in my 3rd year and I still find new things to do everyday. Nothing ever gets old and the food rocks!
Niche User,5,Everything is great! I love this university. I am right now getting my masters degree in criminology and Ferris has been the best school for me. The campus is kind of on the smaller size which turns out I love. The smaller campus feel is for the best part. Also the workers make you feel like you are home.
Junior,5,"I like Ferris state. Some athletics are good, the teachers are willing to work with the students and they have different organizations to keep the students busy versus getting in trouble"
Senior,5,"I like Ferris because it is a smaller school but you hardly see the same people walking to and from classes. We also have a lot of student origination to be apart of and they put on a lot of different events during the school year. One thing I would change is the amount of things to do off campus. In the summer not a lot of people are here because it is a college town so nights can get kind of boring. I think we have a very diverse population, including race, ethnicity, age of students attending Ferris, among others. One of the biggest things that needs to be worked on and that I would change would be the advisers, sometimes they do not know all the correct information and then you are taking classes you don't necessarily need for your program. They should send you to talk to someone who knows more about the topic so you aren't sent in the wrong direction."
Junior,5,"I love the atmosphere here. The professors I've had are amazing, the campus is beautiful, and the people are amazing. I transferred to this school hoping to get a better opportunity than what my previous institution was providing me and I am not disappointed one bit. I feel at home at this college."
Senior,5,I attended the Grand Rapids campus and it has allowed me to stay home and get the 4 year degree I wanted. They also had this awesome program that allowed me to take a majority of my classes at Grand Rapids Community College so that I could save money and be sure that all my credits would transfer. FSU has truly been the best choice for me and I would choose this route all over again if given the chance!
Graduate Student,5,"Ferris State University is a great college located in the heart of Michigan. It is extremely underappreciated as far as Michigan schools go. The class sizes are small, there are tons of campus events to keep students engaged, there are many student organizations both professional and extracurricular, and of course there is a river running through town that is great for tubing in the summer."
Sophomore,5,Ferris state is an amazing school with amazing programs. The campus is beautiful and Big Rapids is a great little town.
Junior,5,"I transferred to Ferris and it was the best decision ever! I feel at home at Ferris. Greek life isn't important, but it seems like everyone is either part of Greek life or an athlete. The athletic games are always full of many students cheering on the team. The basketball team even won the National Championship!"
Freshman,5,I love the campus and how it's set up. I don't like how they constantly have the same food over and over. The classes are a good size and the professors so far are all reasonable.
Junior,4,"The majority of professors are good, but thereâ€™s a handful that I have had within the past three years that have been difficult to learn from. Most of them provide minimum information which sets failure up for exams, they donâ€™t explain things well, and online classes are very confusing especially in the time of covid. I do like the location as there is a variety of things to do, places to eat, and options to live at. I do wish their waitlists were shorter considering sonography is a three year wait to get into the program, but thereâ€™s not much that can be done about that. The recreation center is a wonderful place and have a variety of equipment for every type of workout"
Junior,4,"I really enjoy Ferris State. I feel the professors go above and beyond to make sure their students are successful. They are more than willing, and even encourage meeting outside of class to give the extra help and guidance a student may need. The faculty and staff that I have come across have been more than amazing. With all of the extra help the professors offer, I was able to excel in classes I thought I would struggle with, which in turn gave me confidence, which only motivated me to continue to strive for my goals, knowing I will be able to reach them. I also enjoy the food courts at Ferris, they offer great options. The library was also a great get away place for me. I enjoy the way it is laid out, each floor offering different options and study rooms for privacy. I am a transfer student from a community college, and transferring to Ferris was the best decision I ever made for myself."
Alum,4,I only took a few online classes during my time at Ferris State University.  The communication took place through Blackboard. Communication was great and Blackboard was easy to use.
Alum,4,"Ferris State University is located in Big Rapids, Michigan with a campus in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Both campuses are beautiful, but Big Rapids is much easier to navigate."
Senior,4,Nice to take online classes for the easier electives (like English). You still get all the necessary learning but its easier to work around hard in-person classes and allows for good time management.
Senior,4,Great school with good small class size. Small town feel with great parks and shops. Good environment - everyone is nice and the professors do their absolute best to help.
Sophomore,4,"Everyone is super nice on campus, a lot of fun, and a lot of great people. Super diverse campus and LGBTQ+ friendly!"
Junior,4,"I took 4 classes online last semester, and all but one of them were easily translated to online. I think certain classes are better off being physical classes to attend, but overall the 8 weeks of being online were not as hard as I imagined they would be. My teachers were helpful and communicated and showed support and concern for me and my classmates the entire time, wanting to make sure everyone was safe, healthy, and had what they needed to succeed. I cannot speak for everyone but I felt my classes being online last semester went successful for the most part."
Junior,4,"The minute I stepped on the campus, I knew it was the place for me. Ferris State is the perfect size - not too big and not too small. The students are friendly and the Bulldog pride is contagious. Our professors genuinely care about our thoughts and struggles. Even during the struggle of this virus, the professors go out of their way to make our lives easier.

Iâ€™m very thankful for Ferris State and the opportunities presented to me. Ferris State University is home. Go Bulldogs!"
Freshman,4,"Professors at Ferris State University are highly incline to truly teach their students. Every professor I have had is passionate in teaching. They will take the time to help each individual at all costs whether that be adjusting office hours and/or having Q&A sessions days before an exam. I would like to see some change to the dorms. While Ferris is slowly updating the dorms, there could be improvements made so that the enrollment number is higher."
Freshman,4,"I  very much enjoy being a student at Ferris State University. They have a lot of opportunities throughout the year to meet new people. They have a lot of professors I love and they accept TIP, and is the only 4 year university in Michigan that accepts it. Their dorms are kind of ugly, unless you can afford the most expensive ones. They have a Starbucks on campus and you can use meal exchange for when you get sick of the cafeteria.  A lot of places to eat in the town and Grand Rapids is only a 40 minutes drive away. I'd recommend if you like small campuses."
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed the community involvement that was integrated into my studies, the teachers actually care and are strict but also willing to work with you, the teachers care more about you understanding and applying material than just passing the tests."
Freshman,4,Ferris is a great university for individuals looking to further their education in a variety of fields; not only out of the book but hands on lab work as well to make sure every student understands each concept for each class
Junior,4,"Parking was not horrible but could be better, just like any other campus. Dorms on campus that arenâ€™t being used can be torn down and build something else in its place. I would like to see a shift in focusing on making the academics higher than sports. More programs flourishing."
Junior,4,"Ferris State is what makes up the town of Big Rapids. The university is the population in and of itself. This makes Ferris feel like home. Even though there's around 14,000 students, I can't walk across campus without seeing someone I know. The only thing that isn't fantastic is the occasional clashing between administration and professors."
Alum,4,Ferris State University was a great place to finish my Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree! I now work as a telemetry nurse on a cardiac unit and could not have gotten here without the awesome professors that helped me through school. They were always easily available and made sure to answer all my questions.
Freshman,4,Ferris State University is very career oriented and focuses on professionalism. I love this university because I feel that it really prepares your for the professional business world. Another key contribution to this university success is that most programs/ majors require you to complete a semester long internship which will give you experience for after you graduate.
Graduate Student,4,"I am a graduate student at Ferris State University.  In the small town of Big Rapids, Ferris State has a very embracing, warming, and hometown feel to it.  There is a lot to do on campus including numerous student organizations, clubs, intramural activities and much more.  The University Center and FLITE library allow for long periods of student access for studying and doing homework! The school also provides very timely notifications about weather and other related notices."
Freshman,4,"I like how ferris has a large variety of classes and almost all professors truly care. Campus feels safe and there are often fun events to attend regularly. Sports are awesome, and the parties are frequent. It is however quite expensive and Iâ€™d like to see more meal plan options. The food is usually okay but some more variety would really help too. Overall a good school."
Sophomore,4,I am going to be starting my second semester at Ferris as a transfer student. My advisor is very helpful in scheduling classes and making sure I understand my college plan. The dorms are clean and other options are offered and easy to obtain. Campus is clean and easy to walk around.
Freshman,4,"Currently, I am a freshman enrolled at Ferris State University studying Criminal Justice. So farm my experience at Ferris has ranged anywhere from fantastic to poor. Dorm living at Ferris, and probably like most colleges is far from ideal. With that being said it is not an awful experience, just the life of living in a prison cell. Personally, my professors have been nothing but amazing. All of my professors are open to any discussion, questions, comments, and concerns without any judgement from them and fellow classmates. Big Rapids, Michigan is not necessarily the most ""fun town"", but with it being a college town it adds a little fun. Overall my first semester at Ferris would definitely receive a thumbs up and I will for sure be attending the next 4 years here."
Sophomore,4,"Ferris State is overall a good experience. It has a decent side campus; not to big not to small. Can get pretty much anywhere by walking. Itâ€™s a pretty quiet environment, small town but on the weekends that changes. The food is pretty decent with two different cafe areas and various other small shops for food"
Freshman,4,I loved the Ferris state campus and how nice everyone is. The only thing i could maybe want to see change is the way we choose our dorms. I really Cant wait to go to Ferris and enjoy the environment that seems to be very open and engaging
Niche User,4,"The major program I am participating in (Digital Animation and Game Design) is full of faculty that are more than willing to help students become the best artist they can be. The amenities available on campus, such as the various restaurants and the bookstore, are always clean and open, with a very nice environment. The on-campus dorms are of a good quality, offering a decent amount of space to store all of my clothes and electronics."
Niche User,4,"Ferris State University has been very professional and accommodating towards me. The librarians are very helpful and eager to assist. The professors that I have taken have been very good at teaching and have really tried to help me get a good grade. Of course, the campus is incredible.  I am pleased with the University Center and the Library. The UC staff are polite and eager to please. he campus ground are always very well kept and all the classrooms I have been in have been clean and neat.  I am very thankful for the variety of study rooms and locations.  There is a quite bench in the green house, couches in UC, tables and chairs in the Library, and personal study rooms in most buildings."
Graduate Student,4,"The pharmacy program is fantastic, however the university itself is average. The facilities are a bit outdated and they do not have the greatest amount of resources for students."
Sophomore,4,I love the size of Ferris and I love being here. I really feel at home. The only thing is that I'm in the process of changing my major and it was hard for me to find who to talk to help me find out what I wanna go into. But I finally found someone to help me figure out what I want to do. I've only had one meeting so far but the lady I had the meeting with was very nice and helpful so far.
Junior,4,Ferris State is a great value of a school. A few of our programs are amazing and the food on campus is good. Big Rapids is a pretty boring town and it's much more fun to leave town and go have fun elsewhere.
Junior,4,"A fine school with excellent professors and facility! Couldn't think of a better opportunity to experience such craftsmanship from such fine students. Plus, the school is rather an artsy University in its own right!"
Freshman,4,the main part of the school that i like is the student services because they help so much when comes down to helping in classes and funding for yourself.
Sophomore,4,"Campus is amazing, good teacher interaction, and great student tutoring. One thing to look for is finding a good teacher will help you in the long run"
Niche User,4,I really liked the facilities.  Really clean looking and updated dorms but there isnt much to do around campus like going out to eat or activities.
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful and they are very dedicated to making sure their students are safe and successful
Junior,4,"The environment is great. The people here are amazing. The instructors (for the most part) care about the students' success and are willing to work with students if the student asks for help. The students on campus are typically really friendly and there's definitely a decent party scene. With that being said, you can also easily avoid it if you're not looking for it. The campus itself could use an upgrade. For example, the residence halls could use some renovations. The dining hall food is okay. There's a variety of options to choose from but it soon gets repetitive and boring."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the size of the classes. The majority of the classes are only 20-30 students, so you get to know the professors and build a relationship with them. This also allows for more one on one time with them if you need it. Professors I had years ago still recognize me and know my name when they see me on campus!"
Sophomore,4,Had some great classes and instructors. As a park of the honors program I was given many opportunities to do something great with my time and am ready to get back and do it again.
Niche User,4,"I like how there is a 70% internship rate among all of the students and how the merit scholarships donâ€™t require as high of a GPA or SAT/ACT score, making it more affordable. I also love the different buildings for dorms and how many people can live in each."
Freshman,4,"I like how open the campus Is, how nice the people are, and how diverse the students are. So far i haven't seen anything that needs to change."
Sophomore,4,Great experience ! Many activities that take place on and around campus. Great way to experience and meet new people.
Sophomore,4,"After completing my first year at the university, I can honestly say that I am very happy and content with my choice to pursue my degree through Ferris State University. The professors  are extremely qualified for their positions and take it upon themselves to reach out to students and offer extra help to students who may need it. Ferris State University offers excellent resources available to the students such as the campus writing center, and course specific tutoring at the Tutoring Center."
Freshman,4,"I like the small community that Ferris creates, making it feel like home very fast. The food is great and the honors dorms are nice. Something that could change is better wifi on campus."
Freshman,4,I like how diverse and welcoming the community was when I visited. Everyone was very warm and seemed very involved. The atmosphere was just a place where any student would want to be.
Freshman,4,"It's a really good school! Even though campus is pretty big, it doesn't take long to get places and everything is within walking distance. I think the only problem I have had is some professors don't engage like you want them too and you sometimes have to teach yourself. But you're going to get that anywhere."
Freshman,4,Ferris State University is a great place to start your post-secondary academic or athletic career. FSU offers a variety of majors within a great community. There are many graduate programs as well as many other opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"Here at Ferris State University the teachers that are major specific really care about their students. In general education courses teachers are significantly worse, aside from a few. Ferris State University provides a great background in your desired major."
Freshman,4,"In all honesty, Ferris doesn't challenge its students. If you know the material it won't get any harder from there. Ferris State follows a strict ""lesson plan-like"" structure. Everything else is great though."
Sophomore,4,I love that it only takes 10 minutes to get to the other side of campus. All the class sizes are reasonable unless its a lecture but still a very reasonable size. The teachers there will actually learn your name and actually connect with you.
Niche User,4,From my time at Ferris I have always liked the food and the small classes. The sports and extra activities are really awesome too. I havenâ€™t liked the buildings however I think they need to upgrade them.
Junior,4,I love the smaller university feel that Ferris provides. It allows for great relationships with professors as well as other students. The faculty really advocates for the students and wants them to succeed.
Niche User,4,This university is well known for their careers that they offer. But the thing that interest me the most about this university is that they have a great automotive program
Graduate Student,4,Ferris has a great MSW program. The professors seem to truly care about what they do and their students.  Overall it has been a great experience and I am enjoying student life from a non traditional standpoint.
Junior,4,Love Ferris very much. Love the size and the professors. My classes for the most part are great. They are not to long and not to short. I would recommend people to come to Ferris no matter what degree your going for. Ferris is very welcoming just wish there was more diversity.
Niche User,4,"I have only experienced two classes from Ferris. Both of them were offered to me in high school, so I do not have a full comprehension of some aspects. From what I have experienced so far, the teachers seem to be very good and accommodating. I have had no problems reaching out to them via email or other discussion boards."
Niche User,4,Our family did a campus tour for my brother who would like to attend. I was wonderful and full of information. There is a lot to do and see just walking around campus.
Senior,4,"I really enjoy Ferris State. The campus is small which makes finding friends pretty easy. Plus, there are a TON of clubs to join!"
Sophomore,4,"I really liked the friendships I made there and how many different opportunities there were to get involved in the campus. The huge downside of Ferris is its location in Big Rapids. Itâ€™s pretty small, especially for me since I originally live in Grand Rapids."
Senior,4,"I love the small campus size, it makes everything a lot more manageable. The food there is great, and the Legal Studies program is tough but fantastic, with teachers I will remember and appreciate for the rest of my life. I truly felt like this school was a good fit for me, especially since I came from a small town. There are a lot of things to do on campus, and the students there are generally friendly."
Senior,4,Ferris state university is a good school because of all the hands on programs and labs. It also has a good enviornment for people to get to know one another.
Sophomore,4,Great atmosphere and the people that I have met were wonderful. Everyone is very helpful here. I haven't been to many sporting events but I hear a lot and we seem to do very well.
Freshman,4,"Ferris is a great school with lots of well known programs across the nation. Each program is very competitive and obtains challenging characteristics. The food is good, and there are a lot of out door activities seeing the location of Big Rapids. I do recommend bringing a car. The only negatives about Ferris is the advisor communication and the financial aid department. As a science major, I would prefer to be more in touch with my advisor regarding the best ways to get into my program faster. The advisors don't help you with picking the classes you need to take or are late in response to any questions you may have. The financial aid department seems to have poor training and lack of knowledge. Each employee will tell you different than the other."
Senior,2,"Online learning is a huge aspect of present day communication. In light of current events, online learning should be embraced fully, to minimize the risk of exposure to this virus. Instead of removing much needed breaks from the school year, the school should instead be working to aid professors in moving their courses fully online. Since the middle of the summer, I have advocated for fully online lectures, and in class labs, as hands on experience cannot be replaced, which would maximize what the school can do to prevent the spread of the virus, but my voice has gone unheard. Instead, they have chosen designated areas for people to sit, which every single student uses every single day, and we are all touching the same chairs and desks that never get sanitized. Ferris is focusing on the wrong issue."
Sophomore,2,Online is hard and it was tough trying to figure out where everything was or when it was due. My degree is not made to learn online
Niche User,2,"I was at Ferris for a year but then decided to transfer because I didn't like it so much. I felt that the people on campus were not very kind or welcoming, there was nothing to do, and the academics were just average. The food was not worth what you pay at all and there were many instances in which I felt I did not belong there at all. One of the biggest things I felt is that you had to drink or party to have much of a social life. I did not enjoy my experience there."
Alum,2,Professors donâ€™t care about your academic career - basically youâ€™re on your own. Advisors are unhelpful and mess up your schedule so you have to stay in school longer. Classes are a joke and no one takes this school seriously. Donâ€™t waste your time or money
Junior,2,"Ferris is incredibly impersonal. With the rising technological advances, Ferris is becoming less and less personal. They don't have enough staff in some places. Some classes are terrible and boring, others are interesting enough. Don't expect anything from your advisor. I had one meeting with my advisor and he told me to talk to someone else. I guess it's not the guy's fault, moreâ€‹ the whole management system. Because your advisor is just some professor in your field. But that's like giving a gym teacher a job as a history teacher. Like you don't have enough people so you make unqualified people do the jobs you can't fill. Plus you don't have to pay another person. All in all, it's a college so it's a gigantic scam and everything is more difficult than it needs to be. So you can't be too optimistic."
College Sophomore,2,Its not worth the hassle. I would encourage living in an apartment. The walk to classes in the winter are impossible because they don't ice or remove the snow as often as they should. And when they do its in the middle of the night right underneath your window.
College Senior,2,"I was charged $200.00 for not vacuuming 30 sq. feet of carpet---in a apartment slated for demolition!!!

The manager in charge is a real bitch."
College Freshman,2,The rec center has three tredmills. two are borken. the machines break all the time and take forever to be fixed.
College Freshman,2,"There are only Frat houses, no Sorority houses. It is a good way to meet people, but it is nothing like the movies."
College Junior,2,"There may be times when a teacher will scold you for walking into class just a few minutes late, and every police officer is strict about parking and will give you another ticket even if you have already gotten one in that 24 hour period"
College Sophomore,2,"Big Rapids is small, there are few options"
College Sophomore,2,I have to talk to financial aid multiple times a semester to get anywhere
College Sophomore,2,It's the same thing over and over again.
College Senior,2,Greek life at ferris is only good for parties
College Senior,2,"Campus housing is very expensive and really small. Most of the time you are sharing your place with 3 other students and you would have to share a common space. The housing is not very close to campus either, some housing you could walk but, its fairly far. The social atmosphere is good because you are with a lot of other people all of the time so if you like to talk to people at all times then the crowded places might not be all that bad."
College Junior,2,I hear about them all the time but don't participate.
College Junior,2,It cost way too much unless you live with like 5 other people. Then you have to make your own food. You also get the worst parking on campus.
College Junior,2,It isn't the safest school to attend. It also cost extra money out side of personal medical coverage even if your insurance pays for it there is a 45 dollar fee just for using the Ferris health facility.
College Junior,2,I haven't heard anything about Greek Life at Ferris State.
College Junior,2,I am guessing from formerly living there; not many options.
College Junior,2,"Although I do not live there; I know options besides grocery store or convenient stores, are not many."
College Senior,2,I don't party but I know there isn't a lot of night life here. There are maybe 5 bars that people tend to go to but they aren't anything special. There aren't any clubs. Frats might have some parties. I don't think it's a positive impact at all. Partying seems to lead people to do really stupid things.
College Senior,2,Our hockey team is really good but that's about it. People get really into that but the other sports aren't really a big deal.
College Senior,2,Big Rapids is a small city and there really isn't all that much to do. It's also pretty isolated so the nearest 'big' cities are at least 45 minutes away. The main attraction is tubing on the Muskegon river in the summer.
College Junior,2,Not impressed with the two options!
College Freshman,2,"The health and safety programs are not directed to the correct people or crimes. When at a college campus one should get a sense of freedom. Within ones dorm room it should be a safe and not hostile environment, which it is. It is said that one cannot be themselves without being harassed."
College Freshman,2,There should be many more opportunities given to the lower class students. I have seen numbers that show the amount given to students from government in the past 10 years has decreased about twenty percent. If it is important for more education that make it easier.
College Freshman,2,The teachers expect a load of work out of you and give too much time in between assignments which means you are continually given new assignments.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Optometry is very demanding on your time and energy. Should be worth it though! We do however, have a beautiful new building."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I don't really participate but from my understanding, there are very few options."
College Junior,2,"Greek life gets very little recognition for all the good it does, and most non-Greeks students and faculty have a negative bias in mind about Greeks no matter what. As for housing, all the near campus houses that are large enough for Greek housing are all owned and rented out by the same company. That company does a terrible job of up-keeping the houses and is very unhelpful with any issues tenants have with the houses."
College Student,2,"A good 70-80% of the year is bitterly cold and snowy. It is really windy here also, which makes it even worse."
College Student,2,"There really is not a whole lot to do around here. There have been weekends where there is absolutely nothing going on anywhere. Also, a lot of places do not stay open late enough to do anything."
College Student,2,"There are not a lot of places to eat up here. It is a really small town, so we have your basic fast food places and larger chain restaurants, like Applebee's and Buffalo Wild Wings."
College Student,2,"We only have one bus for our campus. It makes three stops in total, and they are at places that are not convenient for everyone."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you can find a parking spot, you'll still have a ways to walk, and watch out for tickets!"
Recent Alumnus,2,Big Rapids is absolutely freezing and snow-covered most of the year...
College Student,2,"Its always super windy, the weather wouldn't be so bad if the wind wasn't as crazy"
College Student,2,"Its horrible. Commuters have such a hard time because people who live on campus who have a 10-15 minute walk to class like to drive their cars to class, taking up most of the parking"
College Student,2,I have seen many students with alcohol containers in my residence hall and have also smelled marijuana throughout the halls.
College Freshman,2,I would not recommend living on campus so many students are unpleasant and make living harder than it needs to be but the school policy says you have to stay for at least two semesters on campus.
College Freshman,2,I hate it here the townspeople are nice but there is nothing around the college at all.
College Senior,2,"It's fine, I don't notice peer pressure or usage."
College Sophomore,2,Too young when I lived on campus to do anything.
College Junior,2,Ferris is known as a party school. I do not party and people look at me like I'm an alien because I don't party.
College Sophomore,2,"I have been of the age to drink since I enrolled so i am not quite sure of the alcohol concept. Though i can say more than half of the student population partakes in drinking, Its College. I am unsure of the vibe towards ""drugs"" I hardly notice it, and if people do partake in these activities it is not known. I gave a 2 star rating because Ferris is a Drinking University pretty much everyone socially does so."
College Freshman,2,"The weather was alright in the fall, but walking around in under ten degree weather really sucks"
College Freshman,2,"It was a hassle working with most staff members, and many other students complain as well"
College Freshman,2,This is Northern Michigan.  I don't expect good weather!
College Freshman,2,Big Rapids is a small town in NW Michigan.  There just isn't the demand for many good restaurants. What there is doesn't cost much.  Blue Cow is the only good restaurant in town. Not a lot of variety.
College Freshman,2,"There is not a lot of things to do in the town because it is a small town. A lot of the local people come to eat at the cafeteria on campus because it has some of the best food in town. It is also not a traditional cafeteria, because there are different stations to choose from with many different choices of food. The locals don't have too much disdain for the students. The town is pretty safe. "
College Freshman,2,"Small town. Nearest city is around an hour away, but people don't go much there"
College Junior,2,"Summers are hot, but not completely unbearable. In the winter, it is bitter cold and never stops snowing. And the roads get super bad. Be prepared to trudge through some shitty weather on your way to class. Oh, and they put way to much salt on the sidewalks - it'll wreck your shoes."
College Sophomore,2,"the dorms are way to small to have two people living in them, i get sick very easily, and i need my personal space sometimes "
College Freshman,2,I got help with the aid but not nearly enough.
College Junior,2,I used to eat on campus now I cook myself
College Junior,2,I have some but not enough. I work a lot to attend
College Junior,2,There is not a lot to do in this town. 
College Junior,2,Not a lot of parking and tickets are given to much
College Junior,2,I don't like snow or walking to class in it
Junior,1,"Most of my classes last semester along with all of them this semester are online. I have been struggling with them, but it could be because off five of them are online now and itâ€™s a new system, canvas instead of blackboard. Itâ€™s harder to learn and I feel like professors donâ€™t provide enough information or material for me to learn adequately"
Senior,1,"Ferris State University needs some change in both leadership and the way they handle issues, including money. Most recently, I have observed hundreds of students every single day not wearing masks, and professors and faculty doing nothing about it. It makes for an unsafe, uncomfortable environment. What's more, is the Provost has decided to remove spring break (Spring Recess) from the school year, instead of enforcing the mask wearing policies more. Removing a much needed break from a relentless school semester is a huge mistake, and will not fix the ongoing problems concerning a lack of discipline for the policies set in place by the state governor. So many things this year disgust me, and this most recent attempt to ""slow the spread"", in which they completely misread the situation and missed the mark on, has been the last straw. I can't wait to graduate, and get out of this insane asylum."
Senior,1,"Senior at Ferris and a lot of professors are unhelpful when you ask for guidance. They come off as if your concern isnâ€™t their problem, so they blow you off. Would not recommend anybody to waste their money at this school."
Sophomore,1,"Ive been at Ferris for two years now, and I hate it. The social interaction between students is terrible. Everyone here has clicks, and its like you HAVE to go to parties to make friends. The food here at the rock, is the same food served everyday, Burger, fried food, rotisserie, fries, pasta, and pizza. There is little to know healthy options here, and being a vegetarian is sooo hard. I like the hands on education experience, the professors here seem to all be very calm and relaxed. Most of the classes here you have to be on  a waiting line, and if you didn't get in them you have leave for a semester or until you get them. Isn't that great?"
Recent Alumnus,1,There are very few places everything is unhealthy and fried
College Junior,1,"Being a student athlete at Ferris, I would say that the facilities are terrible. There is not enough space for all the sports teams. In addition being on the Women's Soccer team it is difficult to say that the facilities are nice because our locker room is shared with the Softball team, and there is not enough space for our equipment. Our field is not regulation size; therefore, we can not hold tournament play at our ""home"" field, we have to play at the local high school. Also, there is no bathroom facility at our field, nor are their locker rooms. The bleacher are brought over from the football field to supply our visitors with benches, along with our parents/spectators. On the other hand, Hockey is the only D1 sport Ferris offers so there is a lot of participation on the weekend when they are home. Also, our football team won the GLIAC conference this year and one of the players on the Harlon Hill Award. This is increasing our school spirit since our teams are improving their performance."
College Junior,1,It takes a long time to get into the program and you can only apply for the program once a year. The also take a person with the most Ferris credits before they take anyone else do if you transferred after a two year college you're screwed like me.
College Junior,1,"I had all my finances paid for by August 3rd, but on August 13th they added more onto my bill. All bills are required to be paid on the 14th. I am out of work and have no way to come up with more money for school. I based all my finances for the entire year on the original total they gave me. They make in near to impossible  for people with low paying jobs. My mother called the finance office and they said the charges were because I am an upper class-men and not a lower class-men. They charge more the closer you are to graduation which makes no sense because you have more debt from the first couple years of school. I had my transcript sent in May and it should have been looked at before August 13 to show I was an upper class-men they should not be able to change the cost of school more than a month before. I now have to try to see if i can win any last minute scholarships to pay the charges that were added on after I paid my original bill."
College Junior,1,"Ok. I work at TacoBell and on Friday and Saturday's we are open until 3am and 3:30am in Drivethru. Wow. Ferris kids really like to party, which is one reason I am glad I waited to go to college until 26, and I have quit drinking now for over 2 years. Students some to my work wasted and they are usually happy but sometimes you occasionally get the rude individuals. The worst part of working when they are wasted is they steal everything and anything in our lobby. I have had paintings, chairs, wet-floors signs, window decals, hot sauce containers, you name it if it is out in their view/reach they will attempt to steal it. They have broke doors and wrote on tables, brought open booze in my restaurant. Man, wish I could of partied like that ten years ago, and get away with it!!!! Other than that I love my ferris students as customers cuz they make you mad, happy, sad and glad when the night is over and I can go home to my kids at 5am!"
College Senior,1,Internet is rough at Ferris. Wifi is shotty at best.
College Freshman,1,I cant play the sports I want because of the weather
College Senior,1,"The dorms are too small, the buildings are outdated."
College Freshman,1,extremely cold. specially for someone coming from the south.
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is no public transportation system except taxis, and those are expensive and usually disgusting from the locals riding in them all the time."
College Junior,1,"The town is run down, full of old buildings. Landlords try to make top dollar off students by providing basic, poor quality housing. Very limited off campus housing that looks nice and is decent all around."
College Sophomore,1,I am an athlete at Ferris State and I have never been so disgusted in my whole life. Sports teams do not get the funding they need or the attention. Athletes are constantly overlooked and the athletic director is not a nice person.
College Junior,1,"It snows and classes never get canceled unless that individual professor cancels their class. The sidewalks are always icy in the morning which makes for a challenge walking to class. The spring and summer are beautiful here in Michigan though, once you get through the freezing winter."
College Junior,1,"It costs $100 dollars a year to park on campus and there are so many students you will be lucky to even find a parking space. There are really no parking spaces available off campus either unless u leave an hour in advance for your class. And if you are late for class because of parking, the professors do not accept that as an excuse."
College Junior,1,"One minute it's sunny and seventy, the next it's pouring rain and sleeting."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is horrible. It is hard to find a good spot to park, and driving to class there is not many places to park. DPS is way to efficent and giving out tickets. as a freshman i had to park my car in Cramer parking lot when i live in Travis."
College Freshman,1,"Living in Big Rapids is most defiantly something. Most of the locals seem annoyed with the students that live in Big Rapids. Going to the stoor is something that as a female i would never do alone due to the amount of old men that seem to linger in Walmart and Meijer. Besides uptown going downtown is pretty dingy also. The bar is the main attraction, the food is overpriced and there is no place that college students can really go to socialize during the day. Overall the experience i have had in Big Rapids has been pretty negative, but I feel that this is just an experience that I will learn from."
College Sophomore,1,The weather is unpredictable. One day it might me nice and sunny and the next three days its rainy and foggy. After that it snows for a week and then its very windy.
College Junior,1,"Parking at Kendall can be a nightmare. On street parking is metered all day and heavily patrolled until 6. There is a ramp, but it will cost you about 12 dollars if you're there all day. There is also a lot a block away, but it's like 4/hr. The best way is probably to park in one of the bus lots and then ride the bus up to campus or walk. Unless you're parking after 6, then the ramp is 3 dollars and on street is free. But beware if there is an event going on.. When ArtPrize happens, good luck finding a spot and/or getting anywhere fast."
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing to do here in Big Rapids unless you like to party. It is an hour away from Grand Rapids though, so if you have a car, there is a lot to do there!"
College Junior,1,"The only option is a taxi, which would be pointless. Most people walk or ride their bikes."
Recent Alumnus,1,I see a lot of students drinking and many pop or snot pills
College Freshman,1,"They are very strict with parking. And, fines can be a bit pricey for a college student."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't much to do at Ferris State. You need to go out to house parties or the bars if you want to have a good time. They have a few local restaurants downtown that have really good food, but other than that nothing. The dorms are old and need to be renovated so dorm life doesn't make you want to stay. It will be what you make it. The center where you are supposed to ""hang out"" is old and run down. Ferris needs some serious renovations. Where is all my tuition dollars going? Seriously..."
College Sophomore,1,"There  isn't much to do at Ferris State. I find myself going home almost every weekend. I can't now because of all the studying, which good luck getting a study room at the library. The only things to do here is to drink and party, which I don't do or have the time for. Good luck having fun. The golf course is really nice and cheap if you like that."
College Junior,1,"Rules and Regulations â€“ Ferris State's rules and campus laws are very clear on what you can and cannot do. Their guidelines for breaking or even bending these laws are very severe, which makes sense for Ferris and Big Rapids are fairly conservative ideals. Their probations are strict and non forgiving so DO NOT get in trouble on or off campus. They do communicate with the city and county police, so they will know when you get in trouble off campus."
College Senior,1,Not Very Diverse at All â€“ The campus is domaniately white. There is a small population of blacks and foreign exchange. I dont understand why they are not recuiting a more diverse population. I tend to be one of maybe 2 people in an entire calses who is diverse!
College Freshman,1,"Horrible school! Ferris is a horrible school! Students are all hicks and from small rural areas. They are not open to anything, very close minded and not accepting! Faculty are very bias and are also from rural areas. They are not cultured or well informed about the current events outside of Big Rapids. There are good educational programs, however, admin and faculty are hard to work with! Everyone wears camouflage and the only activity they partake in is hunting or fishing. People here are extremes. The town itself has nothing much. There is one bar, WalMart and Applebees. Before choosing to go to Ferris, rethink what you want from your school. If you like camouflage and hunting, this is your school! If not, rethink your options. "
College Freshman,1,"Ferris State University is in a small town so there are a lot of commuters which means there needs to be plenty of parking. Unfortunately, FSU does not have very good parking close to classes or housing. The cost for parking per year is outrageous. If your meter runs out or you park in the wrong lot, the strict FSU criminal justice students will ticket you every two hours your vehicle is there."
College Freshman,1,"Alcohol and Drug Scene â€“ FSU has a huge party persona and because of this, there are plenty of places where underage students can obtain alcohol. The drugs are also very prevalent and most students here are very into marijuana. FSU doesn't have a strong policy on drugs or alcohol, they just don't want you to drink and drive."
College Freshman,1,"Main Threat â€“ The main problem you could encounter is the Ferris DPS. If you have a car, and accidentally park in the wrong spot, you could get slammed with a parking ticket which here is a students pet peeve."
College Freshman,1,I don't really think that much of a nightlife exists at Ferris. There is one club called Shooters which people go to but that seems like it. I am not really a partier so I enjoy that it isn't huge here.
College Freshman,1,The people you work with are rude and expect you to know everything. Ferris doesn't give out hardly any scholarships. Its just very crappy.
College Junior,1,"Nothing Much to Do â€“ there is only three choses bar, party , and stay alone"
Recent Alumnus,1,"no need to join. parties suck, and you're better off just joining a club sports team or finding people with similar interests."
College Student,1,The athletic facilities need to be up-dated. The hours for the work out facilities need to be fixed. I would like to work out on Saturday but currently cannot because it is not open. All of the work out facilities are out dated. It is sad to see that there is no demand for a decent gym in this town.
College Sophomore,1,Ferris parking is terrible they ticket everybody all day they is no parking spaces any where and they dont have that many meters
College Sophomore,1,"A Lot of Snow! In the winter it snows a lot. However, the worst part is the wind. Campus is pretty open and the wind carries through so easily. Also, they are really bad about canceling school. This past year there was a 50 car pile up on the main highway right next to our school and they still never canceled school."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is almost impossible as a commuter student. I live in an off campus apartment, and they charge $100 dollars for a commuter parking pass. There arent very many commuter lots, and all of them are not near the buildings I frequent for classes and work. Sometimes the lots are full and no matter how early you leave to get there and get a spot, there arent enough spots to go around and you end up having to either park in a meter, or park in a lot you arent supposed to. When I lived on campus, the price for a pass was the same and you could only park in your designated lot (which was always at least a 15 minute walk) and totally not worth in the dead of winter in northern michigan."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Terrible Went Back to Finish Degree NOT ACCEPTABLE â€“ Went back and called the Flint office to finish my degree.  After two days the gentlemen called me back (I have five adopted children and two boys in college) and said to finish English Comp II and if I received an A or B I would receive my Associates Degree.  When completed, I did not only not receive my degree, I was told by the Dean of Business in Big Rapids that he could decide who graduates and who doesn't.  I did not have time as a parent and mother to do this other than I wanted completion for my children mainly to see.  I do work in several positions that require a Bachelor of Science Degree from my experience as a buyer for department stores.  I also worked in several companies one as a Secretary to the Vice President of a major insurance company in Flint, Michigan.  I can just say this.  Interview the college you choose to attend and do not settle for this.  They do not care about the student, it is totally about bringing in more money.  Good luck and I still was not given a degree from this school and I am currently substitute teaching.  Figure that one out....Maybe experience is the better choice in many positions in life.  30,000.00 could buy your children one major business and money to invest in their families future.  College is highly over rated and no one should assume it will be the reason for ones success.  Oh, I did receive a 4.0 in the English Comp II class.  Thanks Tracy"
College Freshman,1,"It Sucks!! Since I don't drive I personally don't have to deal with it, but I know people have been late to class or missed because they could not find a parking spot. Also each year the parking passes price goes up. They just need to put in a parking ramp and that would help with the parking issues."
College Freshman,1,There is very little parking on campus.Between 9am and 3pm u do better walking. And assign parking is even worst. I do not think its fair that freshman get the last spots. And a parking pass is now $100 which is crazy.
College Senior,1,"Ferris does not have a transportation system. You have taxis and dial-a-ride that are cheap, but only take/pick within a 10 mile radius."
College Junior,1,Greek life sucks. I'd never do it. Ever. FAIL Greek life. FAIL
College Freshman,1,Extremely cold and snowy â€“ Ferris is extremely cold and snowy but we never cancel class.
College Freshman,1,Nothing to Do but Drink â€“ At Ferris there is not much to do but drink. The university does not offer many events that are interesting to students. On the weekends there is NOTHING to do but party.
College Sophomore,1,"I only got aid from the Michigan promise scholarship. After that I got nothing. Ferris needs to understand that just because you might live with your parents and they still claim you on their taxes, doesn't mean that their money goes towards your tuition. I am paying everything myself. No help from mom and dad."
College Junior,1,"It Snows a Lot and Buildings Are So Far Apart. If you are a walker, which you pretty much have to be because there are never any parking spots, then it is absolutely terrible!! We live in Michigan and it snows A LOT and reaches very cold temperatures! Plus sometimes you have to walk 3/4 of mile to get to your next class!"
College Junior,1,There is no enough parking on campus. The put in stupid green space instead of parking. DPS sucks ticket fairys are always out.
College Junior,1,Dorms Suck â€“ Dorms suck! RA's are no fun. The only good thing I have to say about dorms and living on campus is The Rock Cafe.
College Senior,1,"What Public Trasnportation??? Ferris State has really dropped the ball here.  At one point, there was a bus route on campus, but no one knew about it and it went away.  Parking is crazy, not enough spaces to park.  I have missed classes because of lack of parking."
College Junior,1,"If you want to go anywhere somewhat interesting, it involves driving, no public transportation whatsoever and only a few different taxi companies"
College Junior,1,"Economic Background â€“ The majority of the students are from the lower middle class, as a result those above them are looked down upon as elitists and outcasts."
College Senior,1,"Never Enough Spots â€“ During peak times of classes, people will end up skipping class because there is nowhere to park.  And if they find a spot, it will be so far away that you'll miss half the class walking to it."
College Student,1,"DPS sucks at handing out tickets. At the beginning of the year, I acquired 4 parking tickets when there was a sign covering the parking lot I was supposed to be in. I was one spot away from where I was supposed to be, and the lot was a mile away from my room. Since I only had insurance for the days I was driving my car, I didn't check up on it. I paid $15 for the parking pass... and $80 dollars for all the tickets."
College Senior,1,"Not Very Diverse â€“ The campus is not very culturally diverse, and there seems to be a lot of separation between groups."

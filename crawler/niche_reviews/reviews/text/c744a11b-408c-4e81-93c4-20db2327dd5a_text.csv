Sophomore,5,"Due to covid-19, classes were all put online at the last 3 months of school. It was a quick adjustment to everyone but it went very smoothly. Professors were very considerate of different situations and overall I couldn't have asked for a better experience."
Sophomore,5,"North Dakota State University was one of my best decisions. Not only is everyone very helpful in navigating campus, everyone is willing to help."
Freshman,5,"Very welcoming and comforting feel of a smaller campus although it is a larger college, they focus on the student and don’t only care about money."
Alum,5,NDSU provided an amazing experience.  I was in the Business College and had professional and intelligent professors who pushed me to perform at my greatest potential.
Alum,5,"Online courses were offered, however I didn't take them.  I enjoyed an in person experience with highly talented professors."
Sophomore,5,I loves my online classes at NDSU. they were very well put together and I enjoyed them greatly. I got very good grades taking them online as well .
Freshman,5,I loved how it wasn't too big or too small. They make everyone feel like they belong there. It is so easy to get involved on campus and the professors are there to help you no matter what. It feels like home.
Alum,5,NDSU provided an excellent education in a great community!  The football games were awesome and a lot of fun.  Professors were experts in their fields and made learning very fun.
Graduate Student,5,"The medium size of the school is what I was initially really attracted to! That being said, I love how home-towny it feels. I am from Minneapolis, so I definitely wanted to be somewhere smaller and that was more tight-knit. NDSU is definitely that; I see someone I know on campus everyday, and I still see new people everyday! I think my favorite thing about the school is how welcoming the students are, I was so surprised how kind strangers can actually be. For example, my freshmen year I was walking on the sidewalk and sneezed, someone nearby said bless you (which almost never would have happened in Minneapolis-- unless you knew the person). This is a school where people do truly treat others how they wish to be treated. At the moment, I have no bad words to say!"
Freshman,5,"Amazing college, everyone is friendly and kind. I felt right at home when I got there and I knew this was the college for me. Plus with my major I graduate with two degrees in one which is amazing"
Junior,5,I love it here! It really feels like a tight knit community of people who all share the same passions.
Freshman,5,Love the atmosphere of the campus and city. There are loads of cool and trendy coffee shops and great places to study all over downtown. The library on campus is amazing and offers many different study areas.
Sophomore,5,I love North Dakota State University! This is a great college with a wide range of majors and minors. I chose NDSU for their exceptional nursing program and facilities!
Freshman,5,I just transferred to NDSU and I felt welcomed as soon as I stepped on campus. I am glad I chose to go to this college.
Freshman,5,"I love it here! It's the perfect mix of city and small town. The weather can be a little crazy at times, but if you get a good coat it's perfect. The classes are great for the most part and the community is super welcoming. I truly feel like I belong here. The professors care about me and it's easy to get access to any resources I need."
Sophomore,5,"North Dakota State University has been my home away from home. I have nothing but positive things to say about the people, professors, campus, and community in Fargo. I feel very safe on and off campus and Fargo is a great college town with many things to do. NDSU has hundreds of clubs and on campus activities that you can be sure to find something to get involved in that you will enjoy! NDSU has made the transition from high school to college feel very smooth and easy as they provide you with many resources to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"I love NDSU! During my high school career, I knew immediately that I wanted so very badly to attend NDSU. Now that I am a current student of North Dakota State University, I have not regretted my choice one bit. Other than the fact that it is super cold... but that is besides the point. The professors have always wanted the best for their students, and make sure that they are successful. Whether its setting up appointments with them or going to open office hours with the professors, they are always understanding for the student. Students also have a great deal of resources including many computer labs, tutoring, and great advisors to help if needed."
Niche User,5,"I toured the campus just a few days ago unsure of where I wanted to go. Once I was there, I was so sad to leave. The campus is absolutely beautiful and full of opportunities."
Niche User,5,North Dakota state University campus is large and inclusive. There is always something to do and people are always inclusive.
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the experience! If you want a more affordable higher education this is the place to go! You also get the full college experience here!
Freshman,5,I love the campus! Everyone here is so nice and welcoming. I love the facilities on campus as well as the classes offered. The dining centers have great food.
Sophomore,5,"I like that they have several organizations to be involved in and they have high academic standards.  The reason I chose to attend NDSU is due to the warm feeling of being at home.  The students and faculty were warm and friendly and the school has a lot to offer.  The only thing I would change is that students should be given a laptop or pc as other schools offer students.  There are plenty of places to get on a pc to do work, would prefer to have it as an option compared to other schools."
Freshman,5,NDSU is a great place if you’re looking to find yourself or stay in your comfort zone. The many activities and athletics keep students involved with this school. When you come here the people are kind and want to get to know you. It’s almost like being a part of a great big family. GO BISON!
Junior,5,The campus is beautiful and a perfect size. The student to professor ratio once you are in your program is very nice as well as the administrative officials.  The overall content that the professors teach is very good as well as many of the teachers are former employees of the field they are teaching about.
Sophomore,5,I love attending NDSU! I'm so excited to return for my second year. NDSU has provided me with the perfect environment to continue my education with amazing professors and student life. There is always something to do on campus when you aren't studying and that helps keep stress levels down. NDSU treats it's students well and I'm happy to be a bison. Roll Herd!
Senior,5,"North Dakota State University has provided me with many valuable resources to help me succeed as a student, but also within my future career. In the nursing program, NDSU students are held to high regard within the community, which opens us up to many opportunities to learn and grow as future nurses. Staff, both within the program and out, are always willing to help, and encourage students to strive for greatness and welcome challenges. Overall, NDSU has set me on the right path so that I can achieve my goals and dreams as a future nurse."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community, including all of the things you can get involved with at school, the sporting events, and the sorority/fraternity parties. The one downfall to this campus is that there are not underground tunnels throughout the whole campus. The winters can be brutal and walking 5-15 minutes to classes when it is negative degrees and snowing is awfully cold."
Niche User,5,I will be attending NDSU in the fall 2019 so the reviews I have submitted are based on my orientation experience. I look forward to attending
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year at NDSU, and it has probably been the best year of school so far. NDSU is so much fun, it isn’t too big nor too small. It is easy to make friends and being forced to live in the dorms for the first year was probably the best decision. You make so many friends and meet new people within the dorms and make great connections with your roommates!"
Niche User,5,"This University is quite incredible. The professors are amazing, and especially if you want to pursue a career in health professions, this university is the one for you. The advisors and deans in the college of health professions are truly incredible. There are so many resources, including the massive add on that nearly tripled the space for health professions and will open this fall. Yes, winter is really unpleasant, but the community is amazing. I don't know if you could find kinder people elsewhere. There are so many ways to get involved, and I met some incredible people with whom I am still friends despite me withdrawing within 2 months due to chronic health issues that weren't conducive to me beginning college this year."
Junior,5,I have absolutely loved attending this college and I truly cannot imagine myself elsewhere. The campus events are so much fun and the professors really have helped me to learn. The campus isn't too big but also isn't too small either. It's been perfect for me.
Freshman,5,"I love NDSU! It is absolutely amazing. The professors truly care about you and your grades. They are all super easy to contact and do a fantastic job of teaching. There are so many opportunities to take in including work studies, research opportunities and volunteer work. There are tons of clubs to join and there are events all the time. The only thing I would change is the size of the dining centers, they can be pretty small at times. However, they are expanding one and renovating it right now so that will help a lot!"
Freshman,5,"NDSU is a great university. The facilities are fantastic, the buildings are clean, the professors are great, and the prices are very low compared to other colleges.  I couldn't ask for anything more from NDSU."
Senior,5,Plenty of things to do from attending sporting events to joining a variety of clubs. Many caring professors that truly do care for their students. I'm very happy I chose this university as the school I went to for my higher education.
Niche User,5,North Dakota State University is in my opinion the best University in the world. People from all over the world and country are coming just for this amazing school. the academics are great too. NDSU is a student focused research University. The athletics are also great. I love to watch the different NDSU sports teams.
Freshman,5,"North Dakota State University and its students give you a home, there is not much I would change, It is an excellent school. The staff are all very friendly, and it is easy to find a job on or off campus. even though there is an enrollment of 15,000 students, I do not feel like just another number. I feel like I am always learning something in each of my classes. It was also extremely easy to switch majors, and the advisors made the process very easy. There is always something to do on campus, whether its put on by student government, or just going bowling at the alleys under the Union."
Niche User,5,I have visited the NDSU campus and I have competed there and I really like the school. The athletics are amazing and the campus is very nice and friendly. I love Fargo and visit there quite often. I am planning on attending college there in a year.
Junior,5,"I'm a Junior at NDSU, and I am a social work major. I have enjoyed my experience here a lot. I love going to the football games, walking around downtown, and trying all of the little restaurants around town. The professors and advisors that I have had so far have been extremely helpful and caring. I'm very happy with my decision to come to NDSU."
Junior,5,"North Dakota State University is an amazing school with lots of opportunities, many of which I don't even know about. I liked when I was living in the dorms as a freshman, and the other students would try to get us involved in all of the things the school has to offer. Unfortunately, I never went to any of those, but that's more about me than the school."
Senior,5,"After a break from my academics, I returned and the changes in classes, instructors and facilities only added to the great environment that was established"
Niche User,5,"NDSU has a good layout and facilities are up to date. Employees are always friendly and helpful, and strive to assist you however possible. Overall, the college has a welcoming, comfortable atmosphere."
Niche User,5,The campus is huge and diverse. The staff is also very helpful.  I can not wait to attend next fall!
Senior,5,"Small enough but big enough. Individualized attention. Friendly and competent instructors. Broad spectrum of majors/minors available. Reputable educational programs. Assistance with job search and placement during school and post-graduation. Resources for tutoring, financial assistance, study abroad, resume and cover letters, etc."
Graduate Student,5,"I had a great experience with a wonderful professor who was only looking to see me grow and to reach my fullest potential. She took an interest in my life, and she really wanted me to succeed."
Junior,5,North Dakota State University is very affordable and welcoming community. It is a very diverse campus with many opportunities for all different kinds of interests. The professors are here to help you and will answer any questions you may have. If they can not give you an answer they'll point you in the direction of someone who can. Ndsu has over 100+ clubs so you are bound to find one that interests you. Ndsu is filled with friendly and supporting people and I'm glad I have had the opportunity to be here.
Freshman,5,Love my school. Such friendly professors and great programs. Awesome sports program as well. Roll herd!
Niche User,5,"NDSU had a great atmosphere when I had visited for a tour. They make sure you feel at home and welcome. They also keep in touch with you, and show that they really want you there."
Niche User,5,I visited the campus and the program I am interested in. I loved their program and I found it so interesting. I loved all the equipment and on the tour the guys even showed me some of the cool things I get to use. Super friendly people who I would love to see everyday. They even have campus emergency buttons incase you ever feel in danger on the campus and a campus cop will come get you within 3 minutes of you pushing it. There's one you can always see because that's how it was set up.
Junior,5,For the first couple of weeks I was at this college I began to feel out of place because of the lack of diversity. Although after that I found many inviting and fun organizations such as Chi Alpha and the Bison Robotics team. There was also a hip hop team i joined which has been awesome as well. The education is definitely there and i feel like many teachers and staff are actually there for you when you need it. Can't wait to start my third year there this fall!
Sophomore,5,"At NDSU you're not just another number, and there are so many opportunities for students in many different career fields. The atmosphere on campus is also great, and you're a bit separate from the city."
Freshman,5,I am not currently attending NDSU but I plan to come next fall. It seem like a really good place that could help improve my education.
Freshman,5,"I love it ! I will be a sophomore next year! The campus is easily taken on, and is not confusing at all. Everyone is really nice, and very social"
Sophomore,5,"I love the size of NDSU, its big enough that you probably will never know everybody but small enough to make close friends, feel safe, and has a great community feel. I love pretty much everything about NDSU, size, location, majors and organizations offered, professors, and opportunities. The only thing about NDSU that I would like to change is that organizations votes are from the members and they go off friend base not who really wants a position or who would do the best at it."
Niche User,5,"From the moment that I stepped on campus, I knew that I was going to have a great time here. I knew that I was going to be home."
Freshman,5,"The campus is perfect sized for me, not too big, but not too small.  North Dakota State University focus on the needs of the students and do whatever they can to satisfy their needs.  You walk onto campus and immediately feel welcomed and comfortable, it really feels like home and I couldn't picture myself going anywhere else.  The professors make class interesting and are really good at keeping the students engaged.  North Dakota State University also provides such a wide variety of majors and academic programs, you can find exactly what you're looking for! Not to mention, the hundreds of clubs and organizations on campus that you are able and encouraged to get involved in."
Alum,5,"I loved the environment! Every, teachers, staff and students, were all so welcoming and friendly. There are amazing opportunities to get involved both within your degree and outside of it. I very much so enjoyed my years at NDSU."
Sophomore,5,This campus is very welcoming and has so much to offer. There are so many clubs and activities to be involved in. The professors are very willing to help any student when they need it. This is a very safe and great place to go to college!
Niche User,5,"I have toured NDSU twice and have decided to get my four year degree here. I absolutely love it! The programs are great and the people are so nice! The Fargo Moorhead area is big enough to find things to do but also small enough to have a nice feel to it. So far, all of the students I have met are amazing and all very nice. I have a great feeling about this school."
Niche User,5,Beautiful campus and great academic opportunities. Staff is always available to help you in any way they possibly can.
Freshman,5,"NDSU isa great college. It has a lot to offer in terms of academics, agriculture, and life outside of class. There is plenty to get involved in and lots of people to help you do just that."
Sophomore,4,I have taken some online classes. It depends on the course and instructor. I had very helpful instructors who communicated very well. They want you to reach out with any problems you have and want you to feel connected with them. There was times the course got tough due to electronic reasons but once they were fixed everything went smoothly.
Freshman,4,I took online classes even before this pandemic and I was satisfied with them. I took online english and psychology.
Freshman,4,I like the variety of classes I can take. It is a large enough university to be able to get classes at different times that fit your schedule.
Sophomore,4,I am a sophomore at North Dakota state university this year and I love it. They have a beautiful campus with many resources for students. I enjoy the beautiful campus as well. they are located out side of the busy town of Fargo so it is convenient.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere at North Dakota State University. The people and professors are all super nice and helpful. I have never felt scared on campus or in Fargo. The campus is a good size, not too big and not too small. They make you feel very welcome and make sure you succeed while at NDSU. They have good tutors if you need help with anything in classes as well."
Junior,4,NDSU is a great school if you are looking for a big athletic environment but smaller school feel. The academics are great there is a lot of help if you are looking for it. The class sizes aren’t to big so you are able to connect with your teachers.
Alum,4,Excellent value. Good variety of programs.  Good balance of opportunities. Respected graduate programs.  Great athletics programs. Tons of school pride.
Niche User,4,"When I toured North Dakota State University, there were numerous opportunities that students were given. They had very nice facilities which were open to all students. They only downside to such a large campus were the class sizes. I was very nervous for being able to learn in such a large class number coming from a smaller high school."
Freshman,4,"I am a music and communications major. I would highly recommend the music program. The professor are extremely involved with students, and they are committed to each students' success.

The one thing that could be better is the enrollment process. I did not receive good instruction on what classes to take."
Niche User,4,I loved the feel of the university. I felt very at home when studying. The community is very supportive of the university and it's students.
Freshman,4,"North Dakota State University is an excellent 4-year school, there are many opportunities, and tons of clubs to join in on."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the classes they offer. As well as the opportunities they give available to the students. I really enjoy that the professors can communicate easily to the students.
Freshman,4,"North Dakota State Unversity is a really nice school to go to. The people here are nice and very helpful when it comes to academics. The teachers are usually pretty good for the engineering side of the field. There are many clubs to be a part of which is really cool. Overall, I really enjoy my time here."
Niche User,4,They gave a very good tour and answered all questions that I had formed during it. The people were kind and the environment for it was very nice.
Senior,4,"I like the small-town feel of Fargo, ND. It's a beautiful campus during the Fall and Spring months. Professors genuinely care about your well being, and want you to succeed. The only down side of living in Eastern North Dakota is the harsh winter weather, which at times, prevents students from getting the most out of their education. The Bison football team is another highlight of attending NDSU, and it's fun to cheer them on each Saturday. They have won the National Championship for many straight years in a row, an incredible feat to accomplish."
Sophomore,4,I do live off-campus and work most of the time so no parting or socializing for me. The weather gets horrible in the winter witch is 9 months of the year. But the teachers are really nice and willing to help. There are also activities all the time but I'm paying for college so I don't have time for them.
Freshman,4,"I love college at NDSU! Everyone is so kind and welcoming and I feel I have learned so much by going to school here. The campus is beautiful, even with the frigid temps."
Junior,4,"I really like that family atmosphere on campus felt during all times but especially during the football season.  It has a “Midwest friendly” with other students; most people are easy to talk to and work with. I am in the architecture program which is wonderful, but at times I wish our classes were on campus, closer to the other academic buildings"
Alum,4,Good school for the right price. Engineering department is highly qualified and ABET certified. Campus is relatively concentrated and easy to navigate. Bus system helps on cold days commuting from nearby area for free.
Sophomore,4,NDSU is a great school. All the teachers care about you and how well you do in their class. It also is a beautiful campus!
Senior,4,"North Dakota State University is a great place to attend college. It has a very welcoming, homey feel to it. The faculty are fairly accommodating and friendly. NDSU provides students with abundant resources and opportunities."
Senior,4,THE PEOPLE. Hands down that is the strength of the University. Every department has professors that just want to support you to succeed!
Senior,4,"North Dakota State is a great school if you are looking for a flexible college experience. They have let me custom my path helping me find my major and change majors effectively, so I am not adding years to my education. I have transferred, started a semester late, changed majors twice, and I will be completing my degree in just 3 years despite all that. It took some work on my part, but if you are willing to put in the effort, the school will help you graduate quickly. It exceeded my expectations."
Freshman,4,"NDSU makes it easy for incoming freshman to get comfortable on campus with their welcome week. It's really easy to make new friends and the overall mood of the campus is friendly, happy, and energetic"
Freshman,4,"NDSU offers many resources to help all of their students succeed. Professors are always there to help, and there are plenty of clubs to keep you busy and make new friends!"
Niche User,4,"I have been here for things including, FFA, plays, and music competitions. Overall this university treats you with the up most respect and can provide essentials."
Freshman,4,"Personally, I really enjoy all the friendly smiles on campus. you may not know everyone, but there will always be a smile waiting for you if you are willing to smile back! Along with that, the professors are amazing (most of the time), and they do genuinely care if you are willing to go to their office hours. I would like to see more snow plow control and tunnels, but if you decide to go to school in the north, be prepared for snow!"
Freshman,4,Fit my lifestyle very well. Has the small town feel with everything a large city can offer. Never a full moment.
Sophomore,4,"I love NDSU. They offer free ace tutoring, which is basically tutoring for any subject you may need. I also love the atmosphere of the campus and the people and professors on it. Safety is also great because there are emergency buttons all over, and a police station on cakpus. Overall, there are some professors that are super strict about grades, but that can be expected at every campus. The one thing I wish NDSU would change most is the dorms. Many are old and outdated and need to be redone to make campus truly feel like home."
Senior,4,"If you came from a small town or a small school you will fit right in at NDSU. Professors know your name and the campus (main) is roughly a square mile so its easy to get around in a pinch. there are tons of clubs and activities on campus and the cold is not as bad as it sounds, but the wind is..."
Junior,4,I really enjoying studying at NDSU. There are lot of teachers that are very understanding and work with you when you're dealing with personal issues. My adviser is wonderful and is straight forward on class subjects that I benefit from. The only issue I have is one teacher that was trying to force me have facebook even though facebook gives me anxiety and for my mental benefit I would not get it. He told me what I needed to do ( Lot of hoops to jump through) and it was just better for me to drop the class. Even though it was all over just commenting on a status that I couldn't answer any other way without getting approved by the special needs. beside that most of the teachers have been wonderful. Before NDSU I went to tech schools and the teachers were awful NDSU teachers care! They go above and beyond for their students and it has made going to school fun and not stressing out over your teacher being in a bad mood.NDSU is beautiful and I am very proud to be a Bison!
Junior,4,North Dakota State University has a large unviersity feel but with small class sizes. The campus is easy to navigate and everything is within walking distance. There are a lot of helpful resources right on campus that are easy to get to with people who can help you with anything from tuition costs to homework.
Freshman,4,"Love the campus, not to large and not too small! Everyone is very friendly and always willing to assist you in anything you need!"
Sophomore,4,NDSU is a nice school to go to. The tuition is fairly priced and the professors are friendly and there to help you. You can feel a little lost in the crowd at times though.
Senior,4,"NDSU is Bison proud.  It is very focused not only on football, but also academics.  NDSU offers personable professors and a very nice campus.  There are a variety of student activities to get involved in and the overall atmosphere is homey."
Freshman,4,My first year is almost over. I have found there is good food. My dorm situation is good and access to social events is great. My instructors are knowledgeable and available for help. Technology support is also good. There is a wonderful wellness center to exercise and release some stress. The only downside is the advising isn’t as good as I hoped.
Freshman,4,"I love the environment and the people here, everyone is friendly and nice. Weather is not the greatest but creates an unforgettable experience."
Freshman,4,So far so good! Friendly and helpful staff! Just a big campus and takes some getting used to!! I don’t live on campus but the food is good from when I’ve had it! There’s also other food places close to campus so that’s awesome too! Not only that but online services are easy to use and help you stay on top of your school game!
Sophomore,4,Everything is going well. I liked the compus in all aspect. Life at NDSU and education at NDSU is very good.
Freshman,4,"North Dakota is a great community of people that are encouraging are ready to learn. There are are many great organizations to get involved in and give you a sense of community. One downside to the campus would have to be the weather. In the winter months it becomes very frigid and almost unbearable. Besides the climate, North Dakota State is a great college that offers an exceptional education and a low, affordable tuition."
Freshman,4,I hate the winters of North Dakota but the Interior Design program is fantastic. Its a small program that is student minded! The professors are amazing and the atmosphere just feels like home!
Freshman,4,I like North Dakota State University because all professors are very willing to help and it has a friendly environment throughout the campus. Fargo is also a college town and everyone supports the Bison.
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere of the college is very enjoyable, and their is a wide selection of campus opportunities. Three dining centers are located on the campus, making it easily accessible for students to find somewhere to eat between classes. Dorms are comfortable and suitable for living."
Freshman,4,I like Ndsu academic wise. The dorms are decent and it provides a great environment to learn. I think the meal plan food could improve with more options and more dining centers open on the weekends. I stayed in Dinan and I think its by far the best dorm choice. The bathrooms are nice and updated but the floors and washer and dryers need updating.
Sophomore,4,"I love the feel of the campus.  It's big enough to always meet new people, but the right size so you also see a lot of familiar faces.  NDSU has a welcoming community that makes you feel like family.  The classes are"
Freshman,4,"Love the campus! I have had a hard time connecting with students but the staff here is great! The food is not so great, but it is better then high school. Id recommend joining any clubs that fancy your interest! Overall the people here are friendly but cliches form and its hard to make friends if you are an introvert."
Freshman,4,"The dorms can be updated but the people are nice the food is great. Great experience so far. Study for the mid term. I work well with other people so the way i get ready for mid terms. I find a few people in the same class as me and we work together so we all can do well on the test. If you are study by yourself sometimes it can be boring, long and makes you not want to study when you have to be. So when your in a group you get to laugh, hang out, and study. But when you are doing this you get to study but you also get to make life long friendship that you get to take through the rest of your life."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful in the fall and spring years and although winter can be tough in Fargo, it is totally worth it!"
Freshman,4,"I love living on campus. It's quiet, convenient, and more than anything friendly. All the students, faculty, and staff are inviting which makes NDSU a positive place to live and learn. The professors are knowledgeable and will make time for students who take the time to see them. Research opportunities are widely available, even for freshmen, as long as students put in the effort to make connections with the professors. Specifically, the new STEM building is beautiful and cleverly designed. Definitely a good school for the STEM subjects."
Sophomore,4,NDSU has provided wonderful opportunities for me to branch out into the community and build friendships that are positive and always supportive. NDSU is a beautiful campus and the professors are all investing in my success. The only thing I would change is having more tunnels to avoid going outside in December.
Freshman,4,It is indeed an amazing school with a warm feeling. Different surrounding but definitely not far from home.
Freshman,4,This is a great university althoug kinda a party school the acedmics are still some of the best. I would recommend this college to anyone interested in engineering due to the stellar program there
Senior,4,"NDSU is a fairly small 4 year university. It has a small town feel in a bigger town, which is great! Sports are also big at NDSU (especially football). There are several options of classes to take every semester and professors care about their students here."
Freshman,4,"There are plenty of opportunities available for all students. The academics are good, especially STEM fields. The new STEM building is really nice, but some of the other buildings, like dorm rooms, are outdated. There isn't a huge variety of collegiate level athletics offered, but the football games are always something to look forward to."
Sophomore,4,"North Dakota state is a wonderful school to attend. Well your probably thinking,  ""what is there to do here?"" That's a good question, from clubs, events, classes, NDSU has a great amount of opportunity to offer to their students."
Junior,4,"I liked the college right away, the university was very welcoming. The town is defiantly a college town, the Bison is what we pride ourselves on. I am loving my experience here and I would recomened NDSU to anybody."
Junior,4,"NDSU has been a great experience because of the people I have met. For the price, you get a really good education. It is tough to be a full time student but when isn't it?"
Works Here,4,"Great school and Fargo is a great city, but if you're the artsy type I'd recommend MSUM in the area, as that type of scene isn't as nurtured at this particular school, it's more about athletics."
Niche User,4,"A university is a place where your dreams become true, where you could reach the limits, go farther and faster that anyone can, reach the stars of your dreams, explore yourself in an amazing way, exploit your hidden energies and let it out so others could take advance of it. You could be a remarkable scholar or a famous scientist. Time could be invested in colleges not wasted, new inventions, explores and developments could be made every day, it's where big minds meet and get to know and communicate with each other. It's Where the sun, the moon, the Stares, oceans fool, lost knowledge, and all kind of limitations meet you and greet you to the new world where you're about to explore and North Dakota State Universit (NDSU) it's the university where you could find what I just been describing, a place to dream big."
Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman, but I'be already seen enough to give a rating. It's lower than a 5 because of my awful roommate situation but higher than a 3 because there is so much help in education. There's helpful, nearly 24 hour, tutoring and the professors respond quickly and with good information. Something to change would be getting better areas for giving roommates."
Sophomore,2,"I liked how small the campus was. The teachers were pretty nice too, but other than those two factors I did not like it there at all."
Sophomore,2,Due to the size of the university and the emphasis on sports I sometimes find the school to lack the initiative to work with the normal students as much. Although the classes are good the interactions I have had with administration have been lack luster.
Sophomore,2,"If you are looking for a lively campus in a lively town, avoid this college.  I do not look forward to going back this fall.  Honestly the only thing keeping me from transferring is its Engineering Program reputation.  If this level of academic reputation was in a college near the Twin Cities for the same price I would give it five stars, but being that it is in Fargo, I cannot recommend it.  Freezing cold winters and boring student life is how I describe this college."
College Freshman,2,It's pretty stupid here. A lot of them just party. Some are known for low grades.
College Freshman,2,Churchill Dorm has cockroaches and is disgusting.  The building is old and students should not be paying the huge fee to live in this dorm.  Other dorms are super nice.
College Freshman,2,"Living in the dorms is quite and adjustment. The cleanliness of the actually facility when we arrive is rather disturbing. The cost is rather outrageous, $358 a month for the conditions we are expected to live in are over the top. Rules are sometimes enforced but most of the time students break them. On the positive side, the location is rather convenient."
College Student,2,I generally stay away only because of the parties
College Freshman,2,"They are somewhat low key, I am not going to be in one, so I feel indifferent about them."
College Freshman,2,I hear about parties every weekend
College Freshman,2,"Very strict as far as drugs, but the alcohol aspect I feel is too lenient in some dorms. Noise violations are too strict, if you make a peep, it seems that you can receive a noise violation."
College Freshman,2,"They are nice, but they are very expensive for college students.."
College Junior,2,Campus and parking police are very strict. You learn quick how to deal with them if you are a partier like myself.
College Sophomore,2,Not receiving as much as I need/want.
College Senior,2,Scholarships are given to students based on academics. This makes it difficult for students with less than a 3.75 GPA to receive any scholarships.
College Senior,2,NDSU has a couple of snow days each year. Winters are harsh and make walking to class unbearable sometimes. Wind chills are dangerously low as well.
College Freshman,2,I didn't apply for financial aid because I applied last year and didn't receive any money.
College Sophomore,2,"The wind and the cold is really horrible. Of course, we do have some good winters, but that's to us North Dakotans."
College Freshman,2,"They have almost no options for aid for out of state, or out of the neighboring states students"
College Freshman,2,There are hardly any places off campus that are within a 5 mile radius.....
College Freshman,2,"About half of the people that apply actually get in the program...the competition is really stiff, but the companionship is nice."
College Freshman,2,"The wind is terrible, and their is no room for coats in the classrooms. But don't get me wrong, there are days where is really the worst."
College Freshman,2,I dont have a car here and the bus system is really hard to use so its difficult getting around without asking for rides.
College Freshman,2,"The rules on campus, mainly in dorms seem very unnecessary."
College Freshman,2,"The parking situation is not ideal. Unless you purchase a parking pass there is no available parking except for the pay lots, which have a four hour maximum. It's outrageous they do not offer a place for guests to park free of charge on campus, even something with a far walk would be better than having nothing at all. "
College Senior,2,"I've never stayed in a dorm at NDSU, so I'm not sure how far parking is in relation to those buildings. Permits cost 150 or so for the semester (less for the Dome permits if you're okay with riding a shuttle), and are good for usually one or two lots. Pick your lot wisely in relation to your classes. You don't want a permit good for the R lots when all of your classes are in CJPP. People double-park frequently, especially in the winter. Tickets seem to be handed out more frequently for a forgotten permit than for double-parking. "
College Freshman,2,I have my own transportation and my hometown is not far from Fargo. However people are always posting ads for car pooling to different areas.
College Freshman,2,Off Campus housing in the surrounding areas of campus are very expensive and are very rare to come by. 
College Student,2,It is so bipolar one min its raining the next the sun is out next there is a foot of snow
College Student,2,I heard that it is hard to find spots that don't get tickets
College Freshman,2,"If you don't drink or party, you are not asked to go out and do things. You are left behind."
College Freshman,2,The buse stops are not close to wear i live and so it is hard to use them
College Freshman,2,I wish they had scholarships year round and not just in the spring
College Sophomore,2,The freshman dorms are pretty small and some of the RA's can be strict. The bathroooms were better than I expected but overall I didn't care for living on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"A majority of the students on campus are caucasian and of christian affiliation. There are a few other ethnicities and religions, but the majority is pretty dominant and coming to college I was hoping for more diversity and cultural difference."
College Sophomore,2,"NDSU 12'-13'
The on campus housing is very diverse. Some of the dorms are very old and run down, where some are very nice and even have air conditioning. They way residence life works is convenient for some students but not as much for others. I had a poor experience in the dorms and ended up getting out of my contract before the year was done. Overall the residence life does an average job, but could use some renovations for the amount of money you spend to live in these facilities."
College Senior,2,We often have floods in the spring and blizzards in the winter causing school to close. Missing classes takes away from the time we need to have the lectures to understand the material better and causes more cramming of information.
College Senior,2,"NDSU is not the most diverse school you'll find, by far. That doesn't make it barren of culture, mind. It is somewhat unfortunate that a fair number of cultural stereotypes hold true here but, so far as I can tell, the general population is fairly accepting of diversity."
College Junior,2,They are strict on certain policies like drinking in the dorms and drug use. but that is going to be like everywhere.
College Senior,2,"I recieved no finacial aid, even though i was in desperate need of it"
College Student,2,I would rate the computer at NDSU a C. The WiFi isn't the best it is really hard to get an internet connection it is very slow!
College Sophomore,2,The housing prices are all over the place and most house landlords don't keep on top of things. My house has been broken into twice this year already and once was because the landlord had chosen to wait to replace our broken door. There are some good places if you are looking to live closer to 15 minutes away from campus. Be careful where you live and who you are living with and make sure that you talk to the current renters before agreeing to take their place in the following year; ask them about the landlord and his policies and his response time.
College Freshman,2,It is so cold and windy in North Dakota. This is the only reason it negatively affects my campus experience
College Student,2,"It is really, really cold during the winter and often there is a lot of snow. They do not salt the sidewalks and are very bad about plowing parking lots. Besides winter, the weather is fine, just dress accordingly."
College Freshman,2,"I got decient financial aid, but it took forever to do my varification stuff.  They also gave me very few options for what I had to do for the rest of the money and were very vauge."
College Freshman,2,"I received financial aid too late so had I not had money saved up I would have had late fees for school because my benefits had not gotten to me yet. However, I have received a pretty good amount of financial aid."
College Senior,2,I came to NDSU because of the academics being excellent said no student ever!
College Freshman,2,"Drinking and Partying – Most people do enjoy drinking at NDSU and alcohol is definitely the drug of choice.  No one will treat you any different if you choose not to drink, but you may have to work a little harder to find people to hang out with on Friday and Saturday nights.  Rules against drinking on-campus and in the dorms are pretty strictly enforced, so most people figure out pretty quickly that it's just smarter to go off campus."
College Student,2,"Dry? Campus – NDSU is a dry campus, despite what students like to think. For this reason, alcohol possession warranties a pretty big punishment if you get caught. With that being said, however, if students can control themselves and are not seen by the campus police or RAs in the dorms, they usually get away with it."
College Freshman,2,"The majority of students on NDSU campus are white. However, there are many international students. The most international students I typically see are Asian. These students tend to form ""cliques"" and only talk to other Asians in their language. I would say there are only two ethnic people that I talk to and they are Asian Americans. Not beacuse I do not want to, but because they will talk english and hang out with white people."
College Junior,2,Very Cold – The winters in North Dakota are known for being very cold. The temperatures can get down into the -30's Fahrenheit. This can make it difficult to get to class especially if walking is your main mode of transportation.
College Junior,2,Chicago Suburbs – Basically everyone was from the Chicago Suburbs.  Upper to middle class caucasians.
College Freshman,2,"Park on the Street- but Get a Ticket – The parking situation on campus is a nightmare. There are visitor parking lots, but they are obnoxious and out of the way of most class buildings and they cost so much for parking passes or meters. The dorm buildings have parking lots, but again, they are out of the way of most buildings. Outside of parking lots, parking on the streets is a nightmare. There is thirty minute parking in a few places, but the parking police are very strict on going over the thirty minutes and parking tickets are always given."
College Sophomore,2,"White and Asian – White people galore. There is a strong international exchange program for Indian and Chinese students. It caters to them very well, but they feel disconnected from the American students. Black people are very rare. Most of them play football."
College Sophomore,2,"Could Be Better – The parking here at NDSU could be a lot better than it is. The parking spaces are quite close together and that makes me scared to want to have my car here because I don't want it to get all dented. Also, the lot I park in gets very full when the minor league baseball team plays and sometimes you don't even have a place to park. Overall, it would be nice if there were more places to park and a little bit better space size for the cars. The permit cost is alright but the ticketing is sometimes scattered. It needs some inprovement."
College Sophomore,2,The temperatures are well below freezing at times and it is very uncomfortable to walk to class.
College Junior,2,"Its alright – Most of the good things are good at all colleges around.  This is an ok school, use it as a safety I would say.  On the whole, not worth it."
College Junior,2,"Most girls are local or from Minnesota.  Alot are your typical girls from back home.  Plenty of dumb sluts around though.  They get around, so do the STD's also."
College Junior,2,"Some are awesome, others suck.....bad – Hall Directors are all lazy.  Some dorms are awesome with attached dining centers and close to classes.  Others have shitty heat, no AC, and are far away from food and classes.  Stay away from Stockbridge and Churchhill. Aim for Reed, Johnson, Siem, Severinson, Thompson if your a guy"
College Junior,2,"Eat it as a freshman, then pass – Dining centers close a dumb hours and not all dorms are attached to one.  Food is mediocre at best.  Its all you can eat but a pain cause they have no trays.  Also all of the meal plans are a rip off."
College Junior,2,Fargo Area is kinda lame – Town has a huge bar scene so if that's not you then don't bother.  Campus is hella lame for activities but most people around town are really nice. 
College Freshman,1,I would never be involved with the greek life here. Not fun at all
College Sophomore,1,It's so cold and windy it sucks walking to class. 
College Senior,1,"I despise the cold. My joints don't appreciate it at all. Snow or ice on the ground means longer driving time to campus. The snow on the ground reduces parking in the student lots by up to 40% because no one can see the lines. Walking from one end of campus to the other (10 minutes on an uncrowded, sunny day) can turn into 20 minutes or more when there's a -40 degree windchill, and you get icicles on your lashes and in your nose.

Wear layers! Including gloves, hat, and a scarf or neck warmer. Goggles or sunglasses are helpful on windy days. Don't complain about the cold if you didn't at least try to dress appropriately unless you want to be pushed into a snowbank."
College Sophomore,1,"NDSU '12-13'
Parking at NDSU is awful. We have bitter cold winters where, if you're lucky, only have to walk 4 blocks from your car. If it blizzards, you have a good chance of your car being blocked in the parking lots by snow, and the plows only push more snow against your car. There aren't enough locations for parking lots and that is not priority even near the top of the list. The parking ticketers are always leaving tickets, and there is nearly no leeway with them."
College Sophomore,1,"I do not appreciate that you need a separate pass for each lot. It literally is a nightmare. The parking lots are small, and the parking ticket people are like Nazis. Also, the fact that there is hardly anywhere to park when you don't have a parking pass for that specific parking lot when you need to run in to a building for some business for even just a few minutes; still, without the right parking pass you risk a $15 dollar parking ticket. Good luck."
College Junior,1,parking is far and off campus. On campus parking is for 30 minutes or 90 minutes. Students have to leave classes to go move their car. The parking permit is expensive but you still must pay when u get to campus if u dont want 2 be leaving classes every 30 minutes.
College Freshman,1,"Make sure that you turn in all your forms within the first week! I received a very good amount of Aid; however, the office wasn't very knowledgeable with what forms I still needed. It took me almost 3 months to get things straightened out. The process was very stressful and costly. Make sure you stay on top of things so that your Aid is applied right away and not lost."
College Freshman,1,"In the beginning and at the end of the year the weather is at its best. There are light breezes and the temperature is warm. But during the winter it is just horrible. The temperature itself is not cold, but the wind adds extra strength to coldness. You will constantly contemplate skipping classes because it is to cold"
College Sophomore,1,"it's an ok school but with regards to my major, I am just not impressed. The program began to go under the first year after I had been accepted into it and the teachers were inconsistent, didn't collaborate, there was no connections between classes, I could go on and on. Overall I have had a disappointing experience and even higher up faculty like the dean have been unhelpful and unwilling to take much action. After spending my entire freshman year working so hard and being so happy with my progress I was let down because we were taken off the accreditation list; we were put on probation. No one had told the incoming class or those students who had just been accepted; we were blindsided and it felt like the program, faculty, and staff had simply been hiding the fact that there were and still are major issues within our department alone."
College Freshman,1,I feel like poeple here are drinking every single day of the week. It's pretty rediculous actually.
College Senior,1,The campus is just as boring as the city. There is nothing to do. Nothing to see. Boring as hell.
College Sophomore,1,"I don't have a car here, but the parking staff is super strict. There aren't always enough parking spots. They ticket you if you've been there 5 minutes if you don't have a parking permit. It is easy to get a parking permit, so I've heard."
College Junior,1,"Price for Meal Plan – Although the meals are unlimited, unless you eat more than 5 times a day, it's way to expensive compared to if you had just a basic meal plan"
College Junior,1,"Not Worth the Price – They over-rate how 'fantastic' the teachers are.  Basically you pay $40,000 to teach yourself.  I really don't see class-lead discussions teaching in anyway because the instructor doesn't have to prepare for them.  Tests were extremely challenging and it almost seemed like the professors either didn't know what they were talking about or were so stuck up they enjoyed screwing with you.  The campus is pretty and well taken care of but it is VERY LIBERAL.  The food is disgusting, not to mention expensive and there is NO WAY OUT of the meal plan.  They also force you to live on campus for three years... again expensive.  It was easy to find a fun job on campus though.  Frats and sororities haze... but there is nothing else to do so you join anyways."
College Freshman,1,"Wind, Snow, Sleat, Hail – It is very cold here and snows a lot, when it's not snowing (or when it is still snowing) it is very windy out, which makes it feel so much colder out than it really is.  Classes have only been canceled 2 days, so we have to freeze while walking to classes."
College Junior,1,GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOU! If you are unfamiliar with mid-west winters BE PREPARED.  Winter is colder then hell and last up to 6 months.  Ice everywhere and snow drifts.  CLASSES ARE NEVER CALLED OFF FOR WEATHER!  Your car has to be started everyday or every other day or it will die and need to be jumped.  Many students skip classes cause its so damn cold. You were warned.
College Junior,1,Complete Joke – Lots fill up FAST.  Most are insanely far away from class buildings.  Instead of a parking ramp that would solve this they built a yard for the presidents house.  Insanely expensive to park also.  Parking enforcement on campus are DICKS and will ticket you EVERY TIME! Just off campus local police hire out a private parking authority that is just a ruthless.  Parking laws around campus are made to get you a ticket no matter when or how you park. 
College Junior,1,"What a joke – Most houses are decrepit and falling apart. Both physically and literally. Most have shitty GPA's and shitty people in them.  The school doesn't want any greek houses to be around so they offer no help.  Recruiting is in the toilet and the houses are all low quality people in them.  Don't waste time or effort.  Girls on campus consider them ""Rape Dens"""
College Junior,1,"We have a football team?....since when?  All of the teams are terrible and nobody goes to the games.  Tickets aren't even sold in the union, you have to go practically off campus to BUY them, yes BUY tickets at full price as a student....WTF??!?!!?!?!? Fargo-dome sees more use from concerts then a football team."
College Sophomore,1,"Counselling for the Counselors – I found it very frustrating when registering for classes that the counselors were unable to answer most of my questions. I ended up signing up for most irrelevant classes because I was so confused as to what was best for me. The counselors offered a general outline for students to follow, but it wasn't specified to interests or degree."

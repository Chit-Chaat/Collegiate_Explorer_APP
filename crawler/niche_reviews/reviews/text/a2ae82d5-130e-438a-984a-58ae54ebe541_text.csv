Freshman,5,The classes are great online and the Professors email you quickly if you have any concerns. Also the topics and the the classmates are great when we do weekly coursework.
Freshman,5,Itâ€™s an amazing school. I wish it was able to expand in its Fort Myers campus. It doesnâ€™t have any area for dining. Overall itâ€™s a great campus and the staff is wonderful. The Professors are hands on and itâ€™s a wonderful place.
Senior,5,"I am not a great online learner. I am more of a visual, hands on learner. Hodges has made online learning to support my learning abilities with videos of what to do and power points with educational information. Hodges University is a truly exceptional one of a kind school."
Senior,5,I am a returning student to Hodges and a veteran. Hodges has taken care of all my request and needs to succeed and continue my education towards my bachelors degree. They have small class sizes and allow service dogs in their faciliteis. I recommend Hodges University to all students looking begin or continue their education.
Niche User,5,Hodges University is ranked as one of the top private universities in the South for a reason. The Johnson School of Business has been named a top business school in Florida.
Alum,5,"The campus is great, and the faculty are truly dedicated to their students. It was a very difficult accomplishment, but I'm glad I chose Hodges."

Alum,5,"The professors are great, but they expect a lot out of their students. You will not succeed by just showing up for class. If you are not willing to work hard, I would recommend attending a public university. The classes within the business realm are much easier."
Niche User,5,"This school is academically challenging, but it has a great reputation in Southwest Florida. The earning potential after obtaining an applicable degree is limitless. Hodges Grads are highly regarded by both large corporations, professional firms, and small businesses as well."
Niche User,5,"Hodges University is an excellent place to grow both personally and professionally. Its experienced professors are also working professionals that help you enhance your education and expand your knowledge base every step of the way. The coursework involved with the Johnson School of Business is very challenging, which is why most students fail to meet their high demands. In fact, many students choose to transfer after reaching the upper-level courses due to their challenging nature. The standards are truly high at this school. However, if you are a dedicated student who wants to work hard to succeed both academically and professionally, Hodges University is a great fit for you."
Junior,5,"I made the best decision  to go back to school to pursue my bachelors at Hodges University back in 2016. If it wasnâ€™t for Erlis Abazi helping and assisting me throughout  the whole process; I would not be attending here. Erlis has been the most helpful, attentive, knowledgable employee at Hodges. He always goes above and beyond for all his students.  I go to him for every issue or little thing to ensure it gets promptly on time. I highly recommend attending Hodges University- specifically ask for Erlis!"
Junior,5,"This school is outstanding for those of us who have jobs and families, and look for a quick and effective way to earn a degree. The coursework can be heavy at times due to the classes being 4-week long, but it makes the terms go by quicker, and getting closer to that degree. The professors have been outstanding and both campuses (Fort Myers and Naples) are beautiful and clean. Highly recommend."
Graduate Student,5,My experience with Hodges University has been a wonderful. All of the administration team and professors have been supportive throughout my transformation to Hodges.

Unlike other universities where the student is on their own and have to figure things out for themselves.
Graduate Student,5,"My experience at Hodges has been great. The professors are awesome and I feel well prepared for my future, as I near the end of my educational journey."
Freshman,5,"I like Hodges University as they offer classes in the evening and that was my main factor when looking for a university as I do not like doing the classes online, I wanted a class room with a professor and that is what Hodges offers, they also offer the online classes but I like the class room ones."
Senior,5,"Hodge University has been an amazing school to attend.  I have taken classes from full time to part time, switching back and forth over the past 5 year, while I work a full time career.  

While looking for classes to attend and confused of which classes were best suited for my degree, I came across a dedicated Hodges employee who has made the process easy and painless.  Mrs. Jeanette Colon has been a God sent. She always makes time to help me, answer questions and makes sure things get done in a timely manner.   The dedication to her job is incredible and her enthusiastic ways  help me continue to push through.  I have even considered completing my Master's Degree because she is so encouraging.  

Thank you for having Mrs. Colon as a staff member.  I greatly appreciate her and her hard work."

I had been employed as a high school educator for twenty seven years prior to embarking on my educational journey with HU.  Earning my Masters Degree allowed me to secure a position as a school guidance counsellor. Prior to becoming a student at HU such a career change was something I could only dream about.

This was an added learning bonus and kept me interested in the lectures.  They were very approachable when questioned or asked for extra help.  The professors were just as responsive with the on-line courses.  

Secondly, Hodges University was a diverse campus because it attracted students from all over the  world.  Activities on the campus and in the community promoted acceptance and understanding of these cultures as we celebrated our differences.

College Senior,5,All religion is accepted.  There is help available for the ones that can not speak English.  There is no tolerance for disrespect of others.

College Senior,5,"There are printing rules but are very minimal. The entire campus is wireless and speed is incredible. The newer building has issues with cellular signal but its a green building. The have programs which allow individuals borrow laptops if needed, but theres a waiting list."
College Senior,5,All the professors either currently work in their fields or have in the past. They are also required to pursue a Doctorate in the course they instruct. I love this aspect. It allows for students to have the opportunities to ask educators what its like in the real world.
College Senior,5,"The internship was unpaid, yet it was a course during the semester. I had to pay tuition; however, it was a great opportunity to be in my field. There were reflective essays required at the end of the term. Would have loved to have continued working with the facility, but it was a non-profit and didnt have the additional funding for other employees. Networking was a great aspect as well."

Junior,4,I have had very good professors and the fact that they offer classes at nights is great. The classes are small and I can get one on one with professors. The only problem would be the price. The location of the university is great for me because it is in town and I don't have to leave to another city to go to school for nursing.  It's very expensive to attend but I make an effort to keep going.
Senior,4,Hodges has a very attentive staff when I have things that need attention.  They are always caring and helpful. I was a returning student this year after being away for two years and they got everything I needed done with no interruption in my schedule. The professors are always willing to help and lead you in the right direction.
Freshman,4,"Nice campus, quick response. I don't like that the teachers don't enforce deadlines for assignments, I understand this is adult education but because we are busy adults we need to have that timeline.
Over the response staff response is good, the online platform is easy to manage and the library is fairly good.

A cafeteria for students an staff is urgently needed, the campus is promoted as a healthy campus but people keep getting food from the vending machine or often running to McDonald's for lunch. Some type of health initiative is needed for staff."
Alum,4,The flexibility and support of proffesors and workers. I would recommend to go back to the 16 weeks courses for a better understanding of the content of every class.
Alum,4,Great school but the cost per credit hour is ridiculous. Get a new board and make the school affordable.
Alum,4,I loved that I had the opportunity to intern twice to gain hands on experience and be able to apply what I learned.
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my experience at Hodges University. Most of the Professor were very approachable to answering your questions and giving you help on things you do not understand.

Or on a quarterly basis hold a event for the students to becomes involved  with each other and the university. The University offers a wide arrange of majors to its students."
Freshman,4,"I like the class size and instructors are very informative and answer questions promptly.
I wish the computer classes we more hands on than online assignments."

The parking lot is set in a way where there's no blind spots or dark shadows."

College Junior,4,My degree program is great with a lot of support from the staff and clubs pertaining to each major.
College Junior,4,My college is reflective of the melting pot of a population that we have in Southwest Florida.
College Senior,4,"This university is writing intensive. You are required, in most fields, to write at least one essay per course. APA is a standard practice and gives workshops to help enhance writing skills. Their tutoring lab is awesome; however, it is NOT peer based tutoring. Adjunct professors are the norm now. Not to my liking but available. Student services offers many options to chose from to achieve your goals. These services include: free tutoring, counseling if needed, job placement/resume building, and workshops to help adult learners achieve their highest potentials."
College Senior,4,Friendly staff and consistent email updating you with upcoming notifications
College Senior,4,The campuses held cultural diversity events to educate the community as well as a meet and greet which brought many individuals together as a whole.
College Freshman,4,"Hodges has simple, easy to follow rules and policies for their students.  Attendance is more strict, but it is because most classes only meet once a week and missing class is the equivalent to missing approximately 3 classes.  I like that they enforce the attendance."
College Freshman,4,Many students on campus are coming from work and are dressed in a very professional manner.  Everyone at the school is very focused on their education and is wanting to learn and do their best.  There are very few students in the classes I have had that aren't focused on getting their degrees.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus with the security measures that have been put into place.  There is always a security guard close by if there was ever an emergency.  The professors have all reminded students that their are counselors to speak with for any sort of stress or hardship.  This is great for the mental health of students to know that there is someone to speak with if needed.
College Junior,4,It's great... It goes according to the seasons.
College Junior,4,Lots of places to eat
College Junior,4,"The student body is very diverse in nationality, ethnicity and age."

College Senior,4,Public transportation is great and it runs until late at night so no one is stranded at school.
College Senior,4,It is sunny 95% of the time so there really is not a problem with the weather. It does get very hot in the summer so I recommend some sun tan lotion and a hat.
College Sophomore,4,"It is, mediocre. The professors though either are or have worked in their field so it definitely helps to learn from a person who is already in the field."
College Sophomore,4,"Inside Scoop â€“ The best part of Hodges is it is an excellerated class, one night a week, small classes, and the off campus employees are excellent. I do not know what happens on campous it is 200 miles away."
Graduate Student,2,I liked that the school was small but it was too small.  2 years later I'm tired of seeing the same professors and having the same students in every class.

Junior,1,"This is an advice for future students considering Hodges University as their place to learn and receive an education, please choose another school or transfer if you already started, every student have a dream to be successful on their career path and get to that Graduation Day but what happen when your institution goals is not the quality of your learning experience but to drawn you in debt..The mini terms were already a failure in which too much information was throw at the students in less than six weeks,now they create the four weeks terms that make things even worse.I know you want to learn and take your University years to enjoy of discovering new things about the world and earning that knowledge with the effort and honor that take people far in life towards their passion that is why I will advice you to do more research and choice wisely to realize what matters the most and have a school working to support you and guide you which is the oppose to Hodges University."

Freshman,5,"I love working online since COVID hit and the campus for my first semester is closed. Working online has improved my workability since I am more organized from home. As of right now, I have 3 asynchronous classes and 2 synchronous. The 2 synchronous classes are my math and Latin and having zoom calls is the closet I'll get to student-teacher interaction. Working from home is not bad at all and most of my classes due dates are at the end of the week so I can plan out what assignments I do throughout the whole week. Working online from home and not on campus is not horrible at all and I would not mind learning online from home for the rest of my freshmen year."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus so far. I am only a freshman but I have visited the campus before and the campus is very open and the scenery is pleasing. The campus has a lot of food restaurants and a gym. Outside the campus, there are more food restaurants options. The walking from class to class I have not experienced yet since COVID but I feel like the walking should not be that bad."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Hawaii at Manoa has such a beautiful campus because of its diverse nature. The courses here are very diverse and range from easy to very challenging, but all of them help to form a student's identity and really prepares a student for the future. Most of the people that I have interacted with here are so kind! The library is also a great place to study."
Sophomore,5,"I love the environment here, very friendly and welcoming. Here at Manoa you get to experience a good education while having an island life of the beach being a 20 minute drive, the biggest shopping mall on the island and also having Waikiki near by!"
Graduate Student,5,I had the best experience attending the University of hawaii at manoa. Everyone is kind and it is a very diverse atmosphere.
Graduate Student,5,"I did take a few online classes but majority of my studies were in person. I have to admit being at UH Moana, it's a really good campus"
Sophomore,5,The University of Hawaii at Manoa has one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen. The greenery is gorgeous and the student life is buzzing. A lot of the professors I have met are motivated in their job and want to help students learn happily. The course rigor is manageable with a lot of perseverance. All the activities available keep me up-to-date and feeling a part of the Manoa family.
Junior,5,The university has a beautiful campus. Some teachers are better than others. The community is friendly and welcoming.
Junior,5,The online system is easily accessible and easy to navigate. I enjoy the distance learning and appreciate the recorded lectures with slides for most of my classes are being very understanding due to the circumstances
Senior,5,"Online learning experience at the University of Hawaii at Manoa are very positive. I enjoyed all of my online learning courses. The professors are very understand and great. They strive to do their best in giving us an excellent education. The university also works with other universities here on the Island such as community colleges. With a huge school collaboration, online courses have wide options in courses. Very educational, very convenient."
Freshman,5,"Since the school year hasn't officially started, I haven't taken any classes yet. However, the online orientations have been incredibly helpful and useful especially with how confusing everything has been since the beginning of quarantine. Plus, the Honors College has set up their meetings as if we were in class and it was nice to see a glimpse of how classes might be starting in the next couple of weeks."
Freshman,5,What I specifically enjoy about my university is how easy it's been to contact and resourceful the advisors and other faculty have been during these troubling times. I also like how the older students are using the colleges social media platforms to answer any questions that the incoming freshman have about the campus and island. The family environment created there is incredible and everyone makes you feel welcomed no matter what year you are.
Junior,5,"I hated the idea of taking online courses at first. I enjoy going to classes and making new friends. Also, it is so much easier to focus and be in the moment in a traditional classroom environment. However, having attended classes online for the 4 months, I find that I prefer not having to commute to school and being able to complete assignments at my own pace,"
Freshman,5,"The classes online are great! Depending on your professor, the class can be at a scheduled time over on Zoom or asynchronous. Either way, things can be done at your pace. I definitely suggest renting out textbooks online instead of ordering them if you need it for a class!"
Freshman,5,"The University of Hawaii at Manoa is a really great school with a bunch of opportunities and majors available for everyone! The classrooms are nice, and they transitioned to online classes very well amongst the COVID-19 pandemic. They provide as much support as they possibly can financially and other ways such as health insurance, counseling, and for those who are disabled."
Freshman,5,I took online schooling in the summer where I was able to learn and have a good time through online services.
Freshman,5,I enjoy Manoa because I enjoy the campus and it is a safe place for me. I am able to be myself surrounded by good teachers and friends.
Senior,5,I love my school. I get to meet different people from various walks of life. The professors are chill as well.
Niche User,5,"I went to UHM on exchange for a semester, and I LOVED IT! Everyone was so nice and cheery. The campus is gorgeous and highly walkable. Staff is so so supportive and kind. There are opportunities abound in student volunteer/organization opportunities. Professors really care about students and seem to genuinely love their job and location. I cannot praise this school enough. My exchange program went through quite a rocky time (on account of my home university's remarkable lack of communication), and the exchange coordinator on campus was incredible. Super patient and worked with me through my issue to the end. I have never felt so supported by staff. The coursework was challenging and encouraged creative thought. Students were genuinely interested in studying. Going to this uni for a semester was the single greatest decision I have made in my education so far, and I wish I could've stayed longer!"
Niche User,5,"I didn't take any classes online, but my professors utilized the online environment to enhance student learning. All of my professors were remarkably tech-savvy."
Junior,5,I haven't been yet but I hear great things about Manoa. Cant wait to start my semester come fall of 2020
Junior,5,I didn't have to take an online classes yet. so I cant answer this question. But once I do ill make an update so that way everyone who reads this will know how they are
Junior,5,"University of Hawaii at Manoa is a great campus for those who love the outdoors and meeting new individuals from all over the world! They offer many programs from arts to communications. I am currently completing my degree with the Travel Industry Management program UHM offers. With this program I have had the chance to meet many people with the same interests as me. This has helped because though I am still seeking what I would be interested in for my career later in the future, I am able to work with and brainstorm ideas and opportunities with others! UHM has the best staff and always does their best to support and guide you to whatever you need in the most efficient manner. They are all very urgent to responding when being reached out to and will give you as many resources to also guide you to the answer if is not directly answered. Also during COVID-19, UHM has been very patient and understanding with the transition to online courses. They are always available and there to help!"
Junior,5,"University of Hawaii at Manoa has been very helpful and understanding during the transition from on campus to online courses for the 2019-2020 school year. As well as many courses for the 2020 summer courses. All the professors were able to help and make the rest of the 2020 semester run as smooth as possible. My professors continued their classes using multiple online resources as possible. Some including, Zoom, Skype,  Google Hangouts, Web-Assign, Laulima and more. Learning online was a big adjustment, but once everything was explained and I had multiple meetings with teachers as a class things became very clear with what was expected. Overall, I have adjusted to online learning and prefer it over in person-on campus courses. For the future I will be using this as a learning stepping stone to better my education and being adaptability for my future self."
Alum,5,I love it. This college is the perfect island life. I was from Texas and the only island I ever went to before that was Galveston.
Alum,5,"I love it. This college is amazing. I feel safe, at home, and really enjoy that it never gets cold. So I go to the beach every Saturday."
Alum,5,"Growing up on the Big Island, I was worried that Manoa was still too close to home for me to have a true college experience.  That couldn't be further from the truth!  I definitely think that it would be nice if Manoa/the surrounding area was a little more college friendly (better access to things closer to campus) but the mall and the beach were just a bus ride a way (which was included in school fees)"
Freshman,5,"This is the best college. Beautiful, well kept with much aloha. I will be a  student this fall and I have done my research. This college has everything I need for upward mobility!"
Niche User,5,Staff and students seem polite. I've never had a bad experience. UH Manoa is my dream school and I can't wait to attend in the fall.
Sophomore,5,"The best parts about University of Hawaii at Manoa are the teachers and the flexibility the school offers. Every teacher I've had I have been able to connect with and was able to enjoy my classes more as a result. As for flexibility, I am completely online this semester because I must be off island for a few months. Taking all of my classes online are helping tremendously with graduating on time and are not impeding my ability to learn."
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed the teachers, staff, and students that I was able to meet during my college visit. I also liked the overall feeling I got from being on campus and would like to go again as soon as possible."
Senior,5,I like the array of classes offered and the teachers' willingness to work with me to improve my academic skills.
Niche User,5,Beautiful Campus. Many educational opportunities for students. Very diverse campus.  Many of the students and staff here are very nice
Niche User,5,I am a senior in high school and have visited The University of Hawaii at Manoa. The campus is quite beautiful and there is a diverse range of students that attend. Manoa offers many different areas of study. I hope to get accpeted!
Freshman,5,"Based on my first semester at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, the pure atmosphere of the campus has been terrific.  Overall the school is a great fit for a well-dedicated student like myself and challenges me on a daily basis."
Sophomore,5,"Lovely weather, lovely people. Most professors are helpful and want to see you succeed. If the stress is too much, take a day off at the beach!"
Freshman,5,"Throughout the time that I have attended the university of Hawaii at Manoa, I have heavily enjoyed the atmosphere the school exudes. While the experience was more difficult than I’d like to admit due to the rather immense and abrupt move away from home, the teachers allowed me to feel comfortable and not only prepare me for success but encourage me to do nothing more. As said before, the sudden change in not just location but culture and people has had an ample impact on how I live my everyday life and has opened my lifestyle up to new opportunities. The friends I have made here have nursed my homesickness and overall have made this experience gratifying."
Niche User,5,"The University of Hawaii at Manoa's campus is very pretty and in a mostly busy area which is nice if you are moving from the mainland. I have only met a few of the professors but they have all been super nice and are able to teach very well. There's lots of food, even  for my vegan friend, and have a famers market type of thing too."
Freshman,5,"University of Hawaii at Manoa’s focus is without a doubt the students. Here, I have been challenged academically but also been given all the resources and tools to not only succeed in the classroom but also make an impact on the world and do all of the things I want to do once I graduate."
Junior,5,Great environment with positive and encouraging professors. Easy to get help when you look for it. Multiple libraries making it easy to find somewhere quite to study or do your homework. Many food options on campus and spots to go in between classes.
Freshman,5,"I love my classes and all my professors; however, the living situations could be improved. For example, the housing could get air conditioning and cleaner furniture. Also, the social life could be a little more livelier."
Freshman,5,They offer the only Dental Hygiene 4 year degree in all of the Hawaiian Islands! Such a beautiful and lush campus.
Freshman,5,"Great school with a beautiful campus!

What separates UH Manoa from other universities nationwide is that it truly embraces an ""Ohana"" lifestyle. It's your family away from family."
Freshman,5,I liked how easy it was to obtain information. It can be very daunting to go to a new place and I felt so much more comfortable just from speaking to people on the phone. The people are kind and quick to assist you and answer every and any question.
Junior,5,"Here at UH Manoa is fun. Activities are constantly organized, anyone can join anytime. The campus is also very green and clean."
Niche User,5,"University of Hawaii was amazing, I would highly recommend this school to others! It has some really good programs to choose from, whether you already know or your still indecisive, it's helpful n matter."
Niche User,5,"The University of Hawaii at Manoa, is home to a famous cheer team, that it known across the state. They have won so many achievements, and is the only collegiate cheer team that competes at the national level. I really hope to make their cheer team when it is time for me to go to college."
Freshman,5,Very good athletics and a good array of professors. The volleyball team there is really good and I highly recommend you going there if you want to play volleyball. Also the diversity is very diverse.
Sophomore,5,University of Hawaii at Manoa is a really great school. The diversity is refreshing. The outgoing and friendly students and faculty are a great quality that really defines the school's atmosphere.
Sophomore,5,"I've lived in Hawai'i for my entire life, and there is not one thing I would change about it. 

At UH Manoa, I get to have the whole college experience AND live in Hawai'i, my home. Beach with friends one day, then hiking the next I don't see the downside besides having no snow. There's so much diversity here, it would be hard to find it anywhere else in the world. If you want to find a variety of people, Hawai'i is the place to be."
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity in the student body that the University of Hawaii has. There are people from over a hundred countries that attend the school which allows me to be exposed to people from places I've never thought of. I also fell in love with the beautiful campus and the energy that people extrude through the school. I am incredibly lucky to go to this school.
Niche User,5,it's a great experience overall. there's a lot of  diversity and you can meet people from all over the world. so i think if your looking in to going to uh manoa you should do it. you wont regret it.
Freshman,5,"I love UH Manoa, and not a single day has gone by where I wish I had chosen a different school. I love the campus and the people, and truly feel at home wherever I go."
Niche User,5,"When I went to view the campus it was everything I looked forward to from a university perspective. I am so content with what I saw that I want this to be my last place I go to further my career in the Dentistry field. I am so excited to get the opportunity from UH Manoa because I am a local and I want to prosper from my own University. I hope I am given the scholarship so I can make this possible, as a single mother just trying to make it to pay my daily bills is hard there is no way I can manage to pay my bills and pay for school so I hope I can get any sort of assistant just so I can finally further my career."
Freshman,5,"UH Manoa provides diversity through many areas, such as clubs, culture, and students. The campus is very lively, and has events going on nearly every single day."
Freshman,5,Super duper lit I really enjoyed my time here so much fun you guys I love the party aloha lifestyle so good you guys
Junior,5,"Manoa is a beautiful campus! I have had a positive experience here so far. I am a Communicology major, and find it to be very interesting. The professors are all very knowledgeable and helpful. I have also found my classmates to be a friendly crowd."
Junior,5,"Its Hawaii. how can I complain. The only thing is the parking situation and we need more of a night life and campus life, but other than that all is well."
Niche User,5,The environmment and staff and students were all so friendly and kind and really tried their best to make students comfortable.
Freshman,5,"The University of Hawaii at Manoa is a place of diversity, positive energy, and happiness. Everyone who attends UH is so welcoming and warm, it becomes easy to adjust. It's never hard to make friends or find your place. The campus is easy to find your way around, with one of the most beautiful campuses in the U.S. Classes become easy to attend because of the beautiful environment. Campus life is busy and fun with events occurring every day for every type of student.  The food isn't the tastiest, but they offer options for every diet, whether its vegetarian, vegan, or a strict meal plan diet."
Niche User,4,I haven't attended any online classes from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. But I hope to next year during the fall.
Niche User,4,I have not attended University of Hawaii at Manoa yet. I have only applied but so far they are really good at keeping me up to date with the status of my application.
Sophomore,4,There are many different classes to take and a lot of them are held asynchronously which means you can do the work on your own time. This type of schedule is good for someone who has to work or would rather be spending time with family.
Sophomore,4,"UHM is a beautiful school when it comes to diversity, nature, and the environment. The campus is pretty close to the dorms so the walk isn't bad at all. Though the dorms are very outdated and need some renovations. You either get a really good or really bad professor so please use ratemyprofessor.com. There are a bunch of events and opportunities to get free stuff at this school so keep a lookout at the campus center. The bus is used heavily here because you can ride the bus free with your student ID. The school is located in the heart of Honolulu so as much as there's beaches, the mall, and nice restaurants, be careful around homeless areas. There is a grand amount of homeless people and towns in Hawaii and some can be more arrogant than others. For the most part, Hawaiians are very accepting people unless you are white and disrespect the Hawaiian culture. UHM is a nice school to go to overall, I enjoyed my experience and the friends I met here were so wonderful. It is very pricey."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience here can be difficult depending of the course you take. With 20 credits this semester, I believe it is a struggle but I am keeping up perfectly fine! Online work is all about organization and time prioritization."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is in a great location with close proximity to essentials like food and stores and is close to the city and beach as well. The classes offered are very informative and well taught by teachers that help students succeed. Housing is the only thing I would change since some aspects of it are unreliable and less friendly/ helpful towards the students. The community here at UH Manoa is a very close and connected community, with everyone being very friendly, passionate, and easy going. I am very glad I have chosen to attend this school for my college experience."
Sophomore,4,"This year, all of my classes at the University of Hawaii at Manoa are online. This system is fairly new to many of my professors, so they are struggling to adapt. However, the transition was smooth sailing for the most part, and now the hardest part is keeping track of everything that is due because of the lack of the physical reminder that is going to class. UHM is doing its best to accommodate its staff and students."
Junior,4,It’s a really great school with a lot of great professors who are willing to help you learn the material.
Junior,4,So far the online experience has been pretty good. Everyone is getting adjusted to the online world for class lectures and so far the professors are very resourceful and accommodating as we all get used to the online environment.
Senior,4,"The University of Hawaii at Manoa is a very safe university. The campus are filled with great and friendly students. My dream career is to become a Dental Hygienist. Luckily, my school has a dental hygiene program that allows me to make my dream come true. The university of Hawaii at Manoa accepts diversity and allow students from all over the world with different ethnicity and culture to come together as one providing different clubs, sororities, and events. It is a safe and smoke-free campus. I have made so many positive memories and new friends by attending this school. It had made a huge impact on my life."
Graduate Student,4,"The university of hawaii at manoa is a good school filled with lots of diversity and culture.  That said there are quite a few things this school can improve on such as student life, consistently good professors etc."
Junior,4,"I like it, but I have no real frame of reference as I this is the first university I am attending. There seems to be a slight disconnect between the various departments, and issues are not solved a the quickest pace; but the people are friendly, and the professors are incredibly patient."
Freshman,4,Their was plenty of campus life and several things to do. The campus offers several ways for you to meet other people and get ahead in your major.
Sophomore,4,"Professors were very understanding and always willing to help. The courses I took online were fairly simple and I didn't struggle too much. Zoom and Google were used for the majority of everything, very simple and easy to use."
Senior,4,Yes during Covid. My professors were very accomodating and helpful. I am plannning to do online classes again once the fall semster starts up.
Junior,4,"Usually online classes are pretty simple with the school's system, but online classes were slightly complicated when the Pandemic happened which was expected considering those classes weren't set up to be online."
Junior,4,"I think a really big factor of UH is that it's solely what you make it. For example there's the students who commute and spend very little time on campus because of it and they usually don't feel too connected to campus, but then there' s the students who lived in the dorms or joined clubs/greek life that all feel much more connected to the school. The freshman dorms also aren't as bad as people think and they're super social."
Freshman,4,My experience at UHM has been great so far. It is a beautiful campus and friendly environment to live in and go to school.
Sophomore,4,"The students are friendly, the campus is clean, and the vast majority of the staff is well versed in their areas of study and willing to go above and beyond for their students ! The chemistry department needs more development/ more adequate staff because they have overly qualified researchers teaching entry level chemistry which results in this disdain and lack of care for whether or not their students grasp the info or even pass the class. All in all, this is a great school!"
Sophomore,4,"Many professors did a great job with the transition to online classes after the pandemic started, maintaining involvement with their students through Zoom classes that I actually looked forward to. Grading scales were adjusted due to how hard it is to learn at home, and it was very clear many professors cared more about their students general wellbeing than how they were doing in class."
Junior,4,"As someone who has lived in Hawaii her whole life, I am happy that I chose to stay home for my undergraduate studies. There are so many things to do in Hawaii, and it really helped me stay on track while participating in other activities (work, research, etc.)."
Senior,4,I love the campus. It’s beautiful and quiet. There are plenty of delicious food options on and around campus. I do wish they would update the dorms.
Niche User,4,"AWESOME location + student body as a whole. Lots of diverse walks of life converged onto a single campus; albeit there was a humanic plethora of multiple backgrounds, there was a seemingly constant and surrounding energy of genuine and down-to-earth personalities amongst every single person I seemed to cross paths with. Which goes for the entire social spectrum--- at one end: a passing glance and smile from an absolute stranger inbetween classes; while a neighboring classmate willing to share her textbook on the first day of class marks an acquainted median point; and at the most extreme opposing end: befriending (or rather BESTfriending) two of the most amazing female homo sapiens on campus--- which came with the ultimate bonus of also being their ""dormmates"", living on the floor level above one and below another!"
Sophomore,4,UH of Manoa is a very diverse university with many opportunities to build a career. Each student is special in their own way and they learn to meet each other among the common interests or their personality.
Freshman,4,only going to UH Manoa for one year has been an awesome experience. I've made a good amount of friends and all the professors have been super helpful with everything.
Senior,4,"As the largest public school system in Hawaii, the University of Hawaii at Manoa has provided me with four years of an excellent education. For the most part, professors do care about you and you will receive based on the effort you put in. Through the clubs and school events, student life has always been one of the best around the island."
Senior,4,"Of the colleges I have been offered to attend, UHM was the most reasonable because of the resident tuition rate and close proximity to home. In my senior year, speaking as an Engineering major student, the course work is challenging enough. Cant say much about the campus life, as I am here for the connections and degree, but this campus has its events."
Freshman,4,The student body is very diverse and friendly. There are many clubs that you can join in order to get involved and meet new people.
Sophomore,4,"I already have a personal opinion about traditional schooling. It needs a drastic change! No matter where I go, I think it will be very similar. And for that, I wish every school could rethink their way of educating the next generations. They should think less about money and numbers and more on the real education. 
Other than that, UH Manoa has a beautiful campus, a great diversity of students, and lay back professors. Lay back, not in a sense that it is going to be easy, but in a way of being approachable. The diversity of students give different perspectives of what is going on in other corners of the planet. Giving everyone a more rounded understanding on what to expect world wise. And the campus is just gorgeous! All the islands are- the level of feeling in contact with nature is just outstanding. If you need traditional education and want to have an amazing lifestyle, this the school to go."
Alum,4,"I liked the wide range of classes like judo, swimming, ballroom dancing, drawing and painting as well as the new fitness center. I did not like the limited amount of courses that were offered. For example, Phyl 301 is only offered in the fall and 302 is only offered in the spring."
Sophomore,4,"There's a lot of good resources to take advantage of, especially for lgbtq+ and out of state students. It can be hard to make friends at times, but there's something for everyone."
Niche User,4,University of Hawaii at Manoa is a beautiful campus with both a diverse student and teacher network. Here at Manoa there is a great set of student leaders that help to forward the Hawaiian community by spearheading different student led programs and activities within the school. Something that I would like to see more of is having the Board of Regents at Manoa being more politically active and understanding toward the different types of issues that are directly impacting this Hawaiian institution. I would also like to see more diversity and openness of the board in conducting more Hawaiian focused activities as this university is located in Hawaii. All in all I think this is a great university to consider if you have a desire to be more versed in a diverse network learning about environmental and indigenous studies.
Alum,4,"My overall experience at University of Hawaii at Manoa was good. Most professors are very knowledgable and passionate about their subject mater and offer help when needed. This university also offers a lot of volunteer opportunities to help the community and practice Hawaiian traditions such as maintaining/building Lo'i patches (there are several on campus). In summary, I liked how involved the school is in student services and their credible faculty. Some areas of improvement could be in providing additional resources such as more private study rooms in the Hamilton Library, healthy food options, and improving lower campus by building a library or an area to study as there is no kind of building/facility for students except for athletes."
Senior,4,"The Marching band brings life to the football and other athletic games. Their music is really fun and upbeat. There is a fair bit of construction. The Libraries are really nice to sit in, however the upper floors of Hamilton could use better internet connection."
Freshman,4,"being at the university at manoa, Itʻs an amazing experience. you have to be willing to take a chance and just got the distance to be at the university. You get connected with all of your professors because each of them believe in an excellent learning environment. Lastly you will love to feel just one season which is sun. instead of many different seasons."
Junior,4,I have been there for one semester. I can honestly say it was different from a community college. Teachers are kind and helpful. The people are nice and it is like a melting pot. There are many different people who have different backgrounds attend there.
Freshman,4,The diversity on campus is great! People are very friendly and helpful. 11/10 would recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Freshman,4,"Attending the University of Hawaii at Manoa is a great experience from what I'm normally used to. The people are nice and the campus is beautiful. Though, the dorms and cafeteria food here may be average and sometimes questionable the pro's of this University definitely beat out its cons. It's already a blessing to be in Hawaii."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, my experience was very smooth and I was lucky enough to have support everywhere around campus. It's very easy to make friends and the academic support is accessible."
Alum,4,"I definitely enjoyed the atmoshpere of all the programs and groups UH Mano had to offer.  I especially enjoyed the sports, such as volleyball and basketball as they were very successful.  The professors created classrooms that were welcoming and easy for me to come in and get help with assignments and papers.  I would however like to expand or lighten the dorms, because they are quite small and dark."
Niche User,4,There is great scenery and the people and their culture is different than what you would find on the mainland it´s an amazing thing to experience a once in a lifetime experience.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time here at UH Manoa. The academics and classes and facilities are okay, but the beautiful campus, surrounding area, and local culture makes up for it. My favorite thing about the school was how it was only a 10-15 min drive or bus ride from the bustling downtown areas of Honolulu and Waikiki. I'm glad to have gone here!"
Sophomore,4,safety is very important to me and the campus layout allows for an abundance of resources to get emergency help. I also love how easy it is to get help from resources in advising or even medical services!
Senior,4,"University of Hawaii at Manoa, is really good, great classrooms, professors are quite nice and from all over the world and they know what they are teaching."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. There are numerous resources for students to do well in class as well as keep mental health in check, which is an important feature to take care of, that most schools do not necessarily take into account."
Sophomore,4,"From the first moment I stepped on to the UH campus, I knew it was going to become my home away from home. Almost immediately, you can feel the positive vibes and buzz of happy students around the campus. UH works hard to put on events for their students and to help them become more acclimated to college life. You can definitely feel the aloha on the campus. The food choices are really diverse as there are many places in campus center, and even around or down the street. Some of the buildings are run down, but UH is always looking to improve their campuses. The dorms could use some renovation, but other than that, I have enjoyed my time at UH very much!"
Sophomore,4,I would like to have more variety of times for courses also a more easily accessible way to get information about important dates.
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity of the student body and of the local residents of Honolulu. I think that there are many opportunities for students to succeed and develop into passionate and hardworking members of society. As a language major it is a great place to develop those language skills and experience how language is used in different cultures and situations.
Junior,4,"Although there are a few hard classes, like any other school, the professors at this school really show a care for their students. They constantly remind the class of their office hours and when you do go in for help they offer different approaches to a certain problem that they could not go over in class. However hard the class is/was I have always been able to see my professor and get the help that I so desperately needed. For instance, in my coding class we were assigned a program to code. I was racking my head on how to get it to work, but inevitably I failed to get it working properly. The next day, I stopped by my professor's office hours and was able to finish the assignment and learn valuable techniques that helped me better understand C+."
Senior,4,"The University of Hawaii at Manoa is a pretty good school. The location is nearly unbeatable, especially if you like the beach and outdoors."
Freshman,4,"I was born and raised on the island of Oahu. It was nice being surrounded by the people I am comfortable with. The university has great diversity, a melting pot. I enjoyed meeting people from all over the world. I got to dorm my first semester and my roommate was great. In all my classes all my professors were very helpful and there were many resources outside of class that we could go to if needed help. There are many different food options on campus that were great, the meal plans were very useful and great to have."
Sophomore,4,"My initial experience with the University of Hawaii was great! They offer so many clubs, activities, and events throughout the semesters. At UHM, they also offer counseling to help you figure out your classes and opportunities for your major. Because I was a freshman last year they require that first-year student's dorm together which wasn't the best living conditions, but I still made a lot of friends in my tower and bonded well with my randomly assigned roommate. Like everything there could always be room to improve on different areas of the school such as classroom resources, yet I do think they are heading in that direction."
Graduate Student,4,"I loved that Manoa was diverse and I felt at home right away! One thing I would change, would be more guidance throughout my first two years at Manoa.  I would have liked to be more intentional during my meeting with an advisor to help me realistically plan out the expectations for my next 4 years."
Junior,4,"Manoa is a very good school, the counselors here really help you and the campus is very nice and safe."
Freshman,4,Education here is up to standards. I am a first year student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and I am liking it. The professors here are very knowledgeable and nice. I often go in for office hours and they are very nice about it. There are also a variety of food choices here.
Freshman,4,"As a first year student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, my experience here was quite decent. What I love about the campus the most is the diversity and inclusiveness, as well as the campus that blends in well with its natural environment."
Freshman,4,Manoa is a great school. They do well with keeping students informed and involved with what is happening on campus. Great food and shuttles to take you around the large campus was a pleasant surprise. Very beautiful with a lot of trees and plants. One small critique: professors are inconsistent in quality. Every semester you are bound to have one professor that is bad at teaching. But most are very good and have energy and passion for what they teach.
Sophomore,4,Overall I have felt challenged but not overwhelmed by the academics at UH Manoa. And it also has plenty of great opportunities for undergraduates.
Sophomore,4,"The community is very welcoming and filled with kind people of Hawaii, no matter where you are on the island you can always find something new to discover."
Freshman,4,"The University of Hawaii at Manoa is an amazing school that offers many Degrees that fit students future plans. Professors here are caring and give students time where they are able to help or answer questions they might have before and after classes. Students here are divers and come from all around the world. UHM has a large student exchange program, where students here can go to a different country to study for a semester for the same price as going to school here; Because of this we also allow students from out of the country to attend school here bring along their own cultural background. Another Great thing about the University of Hawaii at Manoa is they offer assistants to any student who need it, ranging from not knowing what career path the want to take to helping them with their mental health at the counseling center. I would recommend the University of Hawaii at Manoa to any person looking to meeting new people from different backgrounds and looking for a great education."
Alum,2,"Like all schools, there are teachers that were great and have taught me a lot and then there are the few that ruined my college experience and made me regret having chose UH Manoa. It's an unsafe paradise that I paid for and with how lax most of the employees, staff and faculty  of the school are my in person and online classes were not as vigorous and predators are allowed to continue teach and prey on vulnerable students going through a tough time. 

I heard one of the buildings was allowing a homeless veteran to live by a non combustable bin for free for years. His outbursts caused a close friend of mine to fear going to class and students caught him masturbating in a classroom. PTSD and human needs are understandble but in a place with the proper care and therapy.

You may be better off in a more intolerable school, it may push you harder but hopefully you wouldnt be exposed to this type of immoral business that doesn't look out for the safety of students or alumni."
Alum,2,"Online learning experience is not very good. Professors tried their best to accommodate students but the lack of instruction from admin lead to issues between departments and students. Many students struggled with online learning, leading them to leave the university for the next school year."
Sophomore,2,"I was very excited to transfer here after two years at a community college in my hometown in California. I was told by the school before I got here that all my credits would transfer and I could start my junior year in my program, sadly that was not the case. When I got here only my English 3 credits were accepted which meant I had to retake all of my math, biology, and chemistry classes again and English 1 and 2. It was my third year in college and I was starting off as a freshman. Apparently this happens to a lot of transfer students and had I known I wouldn't have come here. The office hasn't been helpful to me at all and every time I go and see my counselor another class is added to my list of classes I need to take and I'm pushed back farther to graduating."
Freshman,2,"Prepare yourself to get to UH Manoa... and then have absolutely no academic guidance whatsoever. The advising center is a piece of work and mental health services are almost nonexistent. Many friends were put on suicide watch this year or had a mental breakdown, and the counselors did almost nothing. The advising center did not help me choose my degree or provide me with options. The website sucks and is impossible to find information on. Campus is fun, unless you're ready to see it become a ghost town on the weekends and after class. Events were poorly advertised. The students are fun, but there is a constant need to one up on social media about who had a better weekend tripping on the beach or going to a crazy party downtown. If you stayed inside studying, sorry, you're a loser. Would've never chose to attend one of the unhappiest schools in the country if I'd just read reviews beforehand."
Freshman,2,"I liked the diversity of this university. What I didn't appreciate was the lack of encouragement by the nursing major advisors. The program only takes 10-15 students per application period out of hundreds of prospective nursing majors. Something needs to be done about the ways in which these said advisors treat young, aspiring nurses."
Junior,2,"I enjoyed studying abroad with their program, it was a year long and the school in Japan had a very good program."
Sophomore,2,UH Manoa is a good experience for those who enjoy living in Hawaii. Some departments are good but others are lacking in good teachers and funding. School life is also a bit lacking and housing is not the best. The best part of UH is that it is in Hawaii.
Junior,2,"Crap school. Students are pretty lame. They are losers, they act like H.S. kids that couldnt get into good colleges.

Nothing on campus is open in the weekends. 

No flexibility with course schedule, so professors make them them all 730 to 830 classes starting and we have no choice etc. why the 4 year graduating rate is 53 percent, college students don't wake up that early. 

90percent of the on campus housing dont have aircon and its over 100 degrees most of the year. Go figure.


 Bad students, mostly on Facebook in the classes. Bad professors, early classes, bad vibes on campus, no air conditioning, no parties, ciliqy like high school. Just losers!! Go to school in the south for real down to earth people. Forget these judgmental liar flakes. Smh. (Better football and frats too)"
Sophomore,2,"This school is not good for those who want to get a real college experience, be social, and meet new people.  The campus offers mediocre social events and no real fraternities or sororities.  This school makes it very difficult for those who need to drive to and from school with expensive parking and lack of spots.  While some teachers are good, others clearly do not care and only show up for a paycheck."
College Sophomore,2,Frear housing is ridiculously expensive. It may be due to the recent reconstruction of the building and the use of air conditioners (other halls do not have air conditioning). It was brought to the media's attention last spring of a certain infestation of rats and prevalence of mold in certain halls.
College Junior,2,"I had two friends have different crime/assaults towards them with not enough action towards the person who hurt them. One friend of mine had a roommate try to poison here and do other things to physically hurt her. The campus security agreed, but the cops let it go and let the evidence go (which is apparently illegal). The other friend was raped, and her raper was allowed on campus for months and they finally kicked him out, but teachers and other staff were rude to her."
College Junior,2,We have barely any options for greek life. Most students ignore the greek like unless they have bonfires or parties.
College Senior,2,"It is common knowledge that the dorms are dirty, old, and not maintenance. The RAs are overworked and underpaid, and students are not respected as tenants. The price for housing is way to expensive, especially for what is provided for such a high price. I loved living on campus for two years because of the community and convenience but students deserve better and a lot needs to be changed."
College Freshman,2,The attendance and enthusiasm for most of the sports are low but numbers are high if the team is doing well.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the upperclassmen housing dormitories are outdated and rundown.
College Sophomore,2,"The Greek life on campus isn't as big as other universities.  Since none of them have their own houses, no on really know much about them unless they do something for the school or community.  Also, there are some great people I have met that are involved in the Greek Life."
College Junior,2,"The university recently implemented a smoke-free policy, yet no one enforces this as there are places known on campus for smoking cigarettes."
College Sophomore,2,I know that Greek life exists on campus but it is almost unheard of that most students like myself don't really know anything about it.
College Junior,2,Students don't want to participate because we suck
College Sophomore,2,"Long story short it feels like a community college functioning only as a research campus. The administration and faculty of the students don't really care about any students. Advising is awful at this university, most of the professors are pretty bad unless they are from Shidler, and the campus is run down all together. This school tends to hide the amount of money you'll be giving it in the next four years (probably six due to general education requirements)."
College Sophomore,2,"I had countless problems with getting any help with financial aid. The people in the offices answered some questions but I still had issues my first day on island. When I went to ask for more assistance, I was left empty handed and with more questions than answers, and in the end had to pay out of pocket for textbooks which should have been covered in my loan but I never saw the additional money I requested in my loan."
College Freshman,2,"I'm having a hard time getting any financial aid from the school, being from a low-middle income family of minority, I would have thought I would be able to get more scholarships or aid from UHM or their affiliates. However, this was not the case and I am currently struggling to pay off my first two semesters at the university and am unsure if I will be able to attend school next semester. If not, I will be working part-time and/or full-time to raise money to be able to attend school. Hopefully this is not the case and I am seeking out any financial help possible to pay off my next semester."
College Freshman,2,It's hard to find available off campus housing here.
College Freshman,2,The scholarships that the school offers are very limited.
College Freshman,2,"The expense of living off-campus is not worth it at all. Living in Hawaii is way too expensive, so the dorms are the really only efficient way to go in terms of living."
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive any scholarships. I did receive loans through financial aid. It was a long, dreadful process. The financial aid office really needs better communication and efficiency skills."
College Freshman,2,"Kinda gross, old, no AC"
College Sophomore,2,I'm not too sure because I'm several ears away from graduating. I'm guessing it must be bad if I know nothing about it.
College Sophomore,2,They target students within the first two weeks.
College Sophomore,2,"It was a hassle, the student service center is also impossible to work with. When trying to call for help from the mainland there was a small window where i could call, and often times no one would answer the phone and there wasn't a voicemail."
College Sophomore,2,I do not have feelings for greek or sorority houses.
College Freshman,2,The party scene is pretty non existent at UH manoa. Sometimes frats hold parties off campus but for UH's campus the apartments are the only place and even then they're pretty small.
College Sophomore,2,I don't think a lot of people are involved and hyped up about our sports teams. I went to one mens volleyball game this year and our team is good but I didn't see much students supporting them
College Junior,2,Getting loans isn't a huge problem but finding and applying for scholarships is a huge pain.  There is no advertising to the scholarships that the school offers and the website is hard to find. Many scholarships are hard to get unless the student is native Hawaiian.
College Sophomore,2,"More scholarships? Less federal aid. 

Oh, and not even my advisors explained to me that taking an online class at sister community college required a CC enrollment form to maintain my financial aid full time status. I lost 3000 dollars of aid because of some form I didn't know even existed. Here's the fun part: When I asked how I could go from a part time to a full time student, they told me I was already a full time student and that it counted all credits. Why is financial aid different that they had to count me as part time and needed a form?"
College Sophomore,2,Housing NEAR the school is incredibly expensive.  Anything that isn't expensive is a pretty much terrible place to live.
College Junior,2,Not too many classes. Spend too much money on sports instead of the education.
College Freshman,2,"oh dear. theres two national frats, and one national sorority. Its not worth it and people look at you differently once you say you're in one. People don't pay attention to them and they have almost no presence on campus"
College Freshman,2,"The RAs, campus security, and cops usually always come and shut them down fast."
College Freshman,2,"It costs a lot of money for an education that isn't the best, especially for students paying out-of-state. Don't come here just for the allure of it being Hawaii and ""paradise."""
College Sophomore,2,Never gotten financial aid. Still trying to though.
College Junior,2,"I never want to look, never will"
College Senior,2,"The financial aid office staff were friendly and understanding. The process, however, can be a bit of a hassle. I'm not sure how others experienced the financial aid process here, but mines was a constant tag along of messages, documents, and follow-ups. I submitted my application on a February, and I didn't get approved until October. I was irritated."
College Junior,2,Housing is fairly ridiculous. The meal plan is unnecessarily mandatory and expensive. Most RAs don't care to be involved. The programs hosted are very juvenile. It also doesn't help that Campus Housing is located in the far corner of school.
College Sophomore,2,They're not well liked. A lot of them are really cocky and do things that aren't right.
College Student,2,Hawaii is the most expensive place in the United States to live.
College Junior,2,"I tried to get financial aid but even though it calculated I needed a lot to pay for school, it gave it the bare minimum for each semester. I was surprised..."
College Sophomore,2,"Every single sports team except the women's volleyball is just plain terrible. Unfortuantely, since Hawaii has no state sports team, UH's sports take place of that. The school tries to make it a big part, but our teams (save womens volleyball) are so bad that its just laughable how they pour so much money into the programs."
College Sophomore,2,"It's the worst because people don't shut up on the weekends. Most partiers are (again) Californian mainlanders who are wasting their parents money by getting drunk/high all the time in the worst possible way. No chill partiers, just a bunch of losers who take swag seriously. Might be worse for me since I live in the freshmen dorms, as I've heard others are quieter and more relaxed."
College Junior,2,"BAD. Same old thing every weekend. Same old cliques of cool kids. Some idiot gets drunk and either smacks his chick, a window, or his friend. Or if no one is around he'll creep in your room and touch you. Check the sex assault ratings for this school. One of the worst in the country."
College Junior,2,It's pretty bad . WAY overpriced. Filthy with roaches everywhere along with plenty of people who don't attend UH. I put above average for variety only because you never know what kind of depraved individual your new neighbors will be.
College Junior,2,"The food on this island is disgusting unless you want gout. Seriously. Gout is a problem here. How the hell do people end up with gout? EVERYTHING is either fried and covered in soy sauce or korean bbq sauce. The food ""diversity"" ends if it isn't Asian."
College Freshman,2,"Living in the Aloha Towers I feel as though I am looking forward to going home. Not having air conditioning is rough but also looking like chewbaca threw up in the bathroom everyday doesn't help. The rooms are oddly shaped and the roommate selection seems quite random. Also, the amount of cockroaches that roam the floors are pretty gross."
College Junior,2,The dorms are expensive. the freshmen dorms are very tiny and old and hot.
College Freshman,2,"You have to present yourself well, and make sure you can get transportation"
College Junior,2,theres next to no parties on campus unless you cramp into a dorm or want to deal with the RA's. off campus is good if youre not surrounded by the usual old people. beaches are the best bet.
College Senior,2,"There is not a lot of nightlife, especially for a large city. The night life around Manoa gets old quickly, and students often turn to dorm or house parties instead. There are a few bars, but are often frequented by tourists as opposed to students."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much of a greek life but it seems to be an overrated part of college anyways! We don't focus on greek life activities. Many students in Hawaii are focused on other ways of having fun. With endless hikes and ocean, students do not resort to Greek life activities for fun. There is already always something to do!"
College Junior,2,Not a gated campus therefore outsiders who do not attend UHM can just try and make their way around. There have been quite a few reports from campus that made the news.
College Junior,2,Not many people are actually involved
Sophomore,1,Very miserable. I was depressed all throughout because of the apathy of the whole system. Transferring was the best decision I ever made.
Freshman,1,"Honestly I am so disappointed. Some teachers were hard to understand due to accents and some were just plain rude. Phone zombies are everywhere.
The food can be a hit or miss.
The desk in my dorm piles up with sand all the time because the building is falling apart. Public safety is a joke and some emergency boxes are broken. There are only two computer labs in the whole campus and the 24 hour library is the Entire diagonal across campus from the dorms. The school is dark at night.
UHM is so disorganized at times. I came a few minutes late to my student orientation and everyone pretended I didn't exist so I left early. I laugh at this school's ""smoke free campus"" status because I can't go a day at school without passing someone who's smoking. UHM is a mess and I wish I could get a refund."
Junior,1,"This college is so backwards when it comes to their thechnolical advancement, they are very behind with the times. Also, the teachers are not interested in helping you succeed, nor are they good at teaching. On top of all of this, academic assistance outside of class is criminally lacking."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Other than Frear, the buildings are outdated. If i were to pick between the two apartments I would recommend Wainani"
Recent Alumnus,1,We only have one major sorority and one fraternity. Not worth it
College Sophomore,1,campus housing is disgusting and needs major improvements.
Recent Alumnus,1,"From what I hear from other students that dorm at the university, the housing needs a lot of work. Elevators do not work, it has been in dire need of repairs over the past 5+ years."
College Sophomore,1,The Greek life is just clubs. No one really joins them.
College Freshman,1,"The Greek life is very poor I would say at UH Manoa. First of all, none of the fraternities or sororities have houses, so I have been told. Second, I get a very snobby, cocky, arrogant, nasty, etc. impression from those that participate in the Greek life. When I see the fraternities and sororities hosting barbecues and events, I hardly see any diversity and feel that they are not respecting of other cultures."
College Junior,1,I don't know why people even bother....
College Freshman,1,"The party scene at UH is virtually dead compared to other colleges. But since it is in such a beautiful location, it's really not so bad that the parties aren't as readily available."
College Freshman,1,Rent in Hawaii is going through the roof. The rail traffic mayhem will also lead to increased demand for town rentals and in doing so will also increase the rent lease prices for town units.
College Freshman,1,The worst is that my family doesn't meet the ceiling for need based financial aid. We still struggle with three tuitions but we don't qualify on paper.
College Freshman,1,"I'm a vegetarian, so I don't have much choice on what to eat on campus. What I can eat is overly expensive. The cafeterias only have one vegetarian option a night so if you don't like the food guess you're wasting a meal on two slices of disgusting old cheese pizza. I'm sorry for those of you with other dietary requirements"
College Freshman,1,"Even with any sort of financial aid, it is quite difficult to cover the costs and deal with the financial aid office."
College Junior,1,No Greek Row or any affiliation to school. Boooo
College Junior,1,"Apply early and follow-up! The financial aid office here works at a slow pace and don't really care about the students. If you are applying for financial aid, complete your fafsa as early as possible and apply for scholarships (the ones you at least can) asap. There's a strong preference for local students when it comes to aid and scholarships."
College Junior,1,"The culture in Hawaii isn't very party oriented, so the Greek life on campus is pretty non-existent. You'll see pledges walking around with sticks or random dudes with Greek letters on their shirts but that's about it."
College Junior,1,Stay in the dorms if you want to be assaulted. Check the sexual assault reports for this campus. The federal government had to audit this school it was so bad. One of the worst in the country.
College Junior,1,"Unless you're degree is in Hawaiian Studies no one will take you seriously. The way visitors are treated by the extremely unprofessional staff sticks with them. I have spoken to more than a few B level executives who ignore UH Manoa graduate resume's. When someone travels from the mainland to give a seminar on a subject and an email is sent out hours before, or sometimes not at all, things are really bad. The govt. in Hawaii is the same as the UH staff. They thrive on outdated processes requiring ridiculous forms and paperwork in order to keep their bloated staff employed. It's rate to see anyone but a student employee doing ANY work here.

If you've ever had a real job the way things are done here will shock you year after year."
College Junior,1,One of the worst football teams to ever take the field. If Norm Chow's last name was Smith he would have been fired last year. Racism is alive and thriving in this school. And I'm Asian.
College Junior,1,This isn't some exaggeration. The University of Hawaii has one of the worst safety ratings in the country. Specifically terrible when it comes to sexual assault. Meanwhile it is in one of the safest states and safest cities in the country. How does that happen? It's deplorable and it is a direct result of the incredibly ineffective staff of the school.
College Junior,1,"theres probably 2 frats but theyre so small everyone thinks theyre one. you never hear about the sorority, im not sure if it even still exists. its more fun to find friends than to force yourself into a group."
College Senior,1,What Greek life? I think we have one frat... and all they do is throw parties that drunk freshman go to to get free alcohol.
College Junior,1,They dont offfer much if anything
College Junior,1,"There's a bar on campus right next to the library, what does that say?"
College Junior,1,Applying for financial aid though fafsa wasn't hard at all but it isn't relevant.  I am still under my parents and their EFC is taken into account when fafsa decides if I get any money but my parents don't help me at all so the EFC doesn't really mean anything.
College Freshman,1,"So expensive, so inconvenient, and there are hardly ever spots open."
College Freshman,1,Sororities and fraternities are a joke here. Don't join one. It's not worth it.
College Sophomore,1,"The ""Greek Life"" here literally is a tiny group that has no house, no structured system, nada. Greek Life doesn't really exist and because it shouldn't. It doesn't fit in Hawaii."
College Junior,1,very few houses. Limited notoriety
College Freshman,1,I never seen a fraternity or sorority house ever. So I don't honestly don't know if there is any Greek Life in this campus.
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is very expensive so most students try finding spots off campus which fills up quickly 
College Freshman,1,Transportation is the biggest pain in the ass of my collage life today. i have the option of getting a car or taking the bus it takes a full hour and a half with no traffic if i lucky to get over the mountain from Kaneohe to Manoa and that is just one way it takes another hour and a half top get back so on average i wast three hours getting from home to Manoa and back again and if i were to get a car it would cost be on average of only driving back and fourth with a fuel efficient car 240 dollars a month so driving is almost not an option. i struggle with finishing my work on time because i have to deal with the difficult and limited time schedules of of the bus and for an architecture student who spends on average 30-70 hours on any given project it has been a real struggle. My hopes are that i can raise enough money for a down payment on a motorcycle but that is a whole other story
College Freshman,1,It's quite impossible to get parking anywhere on the campus as the demand for more parking space is high.  Everything else though is fine.
College Junior,1,"There are never any spots and you pay to park far if you can't find a spot early. Also, guests cannot buy parking passes until after 4 so if you park before that you get a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,No greek life and no parties
College Freshman,1,"The Greek life at my school is very limited and not really important or known; it is possible to join a type of fraternity or sorority by simple signing up and showing up and participating. There is no off-campus housing specific to the Greek-life groups. Although I have heard of some simple past forms of hazing, it isn't common or a big deal here. "
College Freshman,1,"I absolutely hate commuting because i have to travel all the way to school in traffic to find me a spot to park near campus.  Either the parking structure is closed, is too expensive, no off-campus parking, or is too far."
College Junior,1,"Parking is awful! If you don't get to campus early in the morning, you won't find parking."
College Sophomore,1,So many kids come to class high and teachers don't care.
College Junior,1,"Definitely well over half the people I know do drugs here. I'm not even speaking on a recreational basis. These people never stop smoking pot! It's an all day every day thing for them. And they will try to pressure you into it, don't believe they won't. You could be stuck in a dorm that's a constant smoke house and the school does nothing about it."
College Sophomore,1,There is no free parking anywhere and you need a pass to park in each specific lot. You need a pass to park as a moped or motorcycle as well. They patrol the parking lots and will absolutely give you multiple tickets if you don't have the proper pass. There is pretty much no parking off campus either so commuting is awful from what I've heard. The parking passes are uber expensive as well.
College Sophomore,1,I don't think it exists here. I'm not sure I've ever seen/heard of a fraternity or sorority here...
College Junior,1,Parking is extremely rare and is never convienient and is expensive
College Sophomore,1,"The nursing program at UHM is probably the most difficult program to get into. Most majors admit the student once all the requirements have been met. There are many requirements such as taking several classes ensuring you receive the grade necessary to get in, but there is also an exam (NLN) needed to be taken. I'm not in the program yet since I'm a freshman still trying to meet the requirements, but the students I've encountered applied at least three times before being accepted. It is very competitive and just because you meet the requirements, doesn't necessarily mean you'll get in. Often, you may want to consider retaking a class as well just to get a better grade. The best tip I can give is to not be discouraged, the counselors are really friendly and understanding when you need any help."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is quite difficult. UHM has two structures but the favorite one often gets filled quite fast so be sure to make time just in case it is full. The other is about a 15 minute walk to get to campus so again, be sure to make time for that. Freshmen always get the worse parking because permits are on a first come, first serve bases but the older classes get priority. If the structure isn't full but you don't have a parking permit, there is a fee of five dollars. Carpool passes are easy to obtain so if you have a friend you should definitely try having similar schedules and split the cost of the carpool pass. There is parking in the neighborhood but that gets filled really fast, even before the structure gets filled up."
College Junior,1,"Did not enjoy being on campus most of the time. Everything is very run down and there isn't much to do unless you know someone with a car so you can get off campus. Most people I lived with on campus were very shallow, and materialistic, so if you came to find an open-minded and accepting community, you might want to look elsewhere. If you came for a fun and engaging college experience, sadly, you will be very disappointed. There are no parties or social events on campus, but there is plenty to do on the rest of the island... You may like it more than I did, but I lived on campus for two years, I am usually a very outgoing and fun person, and I still hated it 80% of the time. I have transferred to another school now though and I am much happier :). It may not be the same for you, but just take it into consideration."
College Junior,1,"I don't have a car, but from what I heard from friends especially ones who don't live on campus how difficult it is to find parking around campus."
College Sophomore,1,Very hard finding a good off-campus housing since I have to do find and do everything myself. I'm not at all aware if UH offers help on this.
Recent Alumnus,1,Don't do it. Use your bus pass ($30 fee is mandatorily included in your tuition) or get a bike/moped. Heck! Why not walk?
College Freshman,1,The dining halls get old after about 2 weeks.  On campus dining options besides the cafs aren't bad but close by 4ish or so.  The cafs never stay open past 8pm and the market closes by 12am. If you plan on working nights def plan ahead eating wise.  The caf labels all their food with full nutrition facts I SUGGEST READING THE CALORIE COUNT the freshman 15 is very easy at this school.
College Student,1,Well as I can tell greek life is minimal and I would not be interested in joining one here.
College Freshman,1,"Parking can be a burden! For one, no one likes having to pay so much for a parking pass and some may say spending hours just to find a decent parking spot isn't worth it."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is ridiculous and very expensive at UH. And the parking staff are equally ridiculous, it now cost $6 to DRIVE onto campus after 5pm, even just to pickup."
College Sophomore,1,"I transferred to UH Manoa from the University of Washington and the greek system here is a total joke.  There are two sororities and two or three fraternities each with 10-15 members.  None of them live in houses, parties are rare, and they mostly do community service.  It serves as a way for people to meet other people.  Most people I know in the greek system aren't very social people, so it ""makes"" them make friends."
College Freshman,1,"There really isn't a ""Greek Life"" strong here."
College Freshman,1,"There is never a good place to park, and the permit prices are outrageous"
College Freshman,1,"Sodexo has UHM by the balls. They control everything, and the food, personally is awful. Except for sprimp and corn paninis during lunch time which only come around maybe twice a month."
College Junior,1,"The parking is horrible at UH Manoa. The on-campus parking is very expensive, it is $2 every half-hour. The parking rates are just as bad as parking in downtown. In addition, they like to give out a lot of tickets to students which is crazy. For example, we cannot park overnight in the structure even if we are studying late for finals during finals week."

Alum,5,"Took one online class for an introductory in-major course. Was taught well and communication was clear, as the professor taught a different class during the same semester where all students were enrolled in both."
Alum,5,"Overall, I've really enjoyed my time at Behrend. The professors really seem to care about your wellbeing and are easily reachable. The engineering programs are challenging but rewarding, and the campus is absolutely beautiful. Most students opt to stay on campus (instead of transferring to University Park), which is the opposite of most of PSU's other campuses."

Sophomore,5,Behrend is an accepting college with top tier academics and all the resources you could ever think of to help you succeed.
Junior,5,"Penn State Behrend’s faculty and staff is incredible. As a transfer student, they made my transition to Behrend as easy and painless as possible. There is truly nothing I don’t like about my professors or this school."
Freshman,5,I love the people I have met and all the activities they have to do it really allowed me to open up and fo thing I never thought I would.
Sophomore,5,"Penn State Behrend offers exceptional degrees most notably in engineering, nursing, and business.  The dorm and classroom building are modern and well kept."
Niche User,5,"Very safe campus, quiet yet very interactive campus.  The campus is also very beautiful and the professors are very welcoming.  In my experiences at Behrend, I have always enjoyed myself and have always felt welcomed."
Freshman,5,Behrend has provided me many new opportunities. I have been able to broaden my social skills and improve on social skills. Here there are many opportunities to gain or improve on skills.
Senior,5,"What I like about Penn State Behrend is that the class size is smaller than larger schools like University Park, so you get more one on one time with the professors, while still being part of Penn State’s large academic community. They offer a wide range of majors and have majors that University Park does not have. The campus has evolved to become a huge engineering and business school, so I think there needs to be more focus on the other branches of academics, like the sciences and the humanities. Overall, it is a great place to further your education. We have a very good athletics program for being a District 3 school and have over 20 sports teams. The scenery on campus is beautiful. There are lots of clubs and activities students can join and be a part of and the campus is near lots of restaurants and it is not far to get to Downtown Erie. There is never a dull moment at Penn State Behrend."
Senior,5,Penn State Erie is a great college to attend. The professors here are more hands on than other bigger universities because the classrooms are smaller and they are all invested in helping  students succeed in their degree programs. The faculty and staff seem to care a lot about the students and encourage us to learn as much as we can.
Freshman,5,"I've had little experience at Penn State Erie, as I am a freshman, but the college has already proven to do whatever is best for the students. The professors not only care about every student's understanding of their subject, but rather their understanding and knowledge of life as a whole. Also, the college is diverse with people that are kind and accepting of everyone's differences. Penn State Erie includes various opportunities to ensure every student leads a successful life."
Freshman,5,Penn State Behrend is a small community college feel with the big Penn State name. The whole campus acts like one big family. They welcome all sorts of people with different backgrounds and I think That's truly special.
Sophomore,5,I love the Behrend campus. Erie is a great place and the staff on the Behrend campus are always kind and helpful. I work fulltime and am a single father. And my commute from work to home and from home to school is quick and simple.
Junior,5,"Penn State Behrend has exceeded my expectations so far. I will be entering my junior year in the fall, and already I feel as though I have gotten so much out of my college experience. I have had some very wonderful professors ranging in fields from English to Accounting. There are always resources and faculty available when you need help. I love the small community feel of the campus. Professors actually take the time to know the names of their students and actually engage. I could not have picked a better college for me."
Freshman,5,"Even though this I say first year, this is where I feel I belong. Professors care about your education and are willing to help with anything. People I am surrounded by are fun and focused. I feel confident about my future years here."
Freshman,5,My favorite thing about this college is it’s welcoming and warm environment. Being a freshman I never felt excluded and like I don’t fit in. I would love to see a change in their parking. I had many issues with finding a parking spot while still paying a lot of money for a parking space. This is a very big issue because I wasn’t able to make it to class on time multiple times. I know that many other students also struggled with this issue.
Freshman,5,This is my first semester at PSB after taking a gap year to work full time and I absolutely made the right decision. All staff members are relaxed and very friendly.
Sophomore,5,I like how beautiful the campus is and how different almost all the buildings are when compared to each other. The professors  are super nice and helpful. They are willing to help you get the best of your education as long as you put in the effort too.
Alum,5,"The student-professor ratio was very beneficial. There was a large amount of diversity on campus, and also diverse clubs and organizations. Behrend was a beautiful campus with many opportunities for all students. I appreciated the Penn State culture, without the HUGE campus chaso."
Sophomore,5,"Penn State Behrend is a great college. The campus is a perfect size, not too large but not too small. The school offers alot of resources. Class sizes are small so you get one on one interaction with professors. There are a bunch of activites, sports and clubs that you can join."
Freshman,5,Just starting out but so far it's been a wonderful experience. Looking forword to all my new experiences at Penn State.
Freshman,5,"Penn State Erie - The Behrend College is a nice little campus located outside Erie, Pa. The staff here are fantastic. Definitely world class. Student-life is pretty good, most people here are really cool individuals. The athletics are amazing. My favorite would have to be anything involving basketball."
Sophomore,5,Penn State Erie is a small and beautiful campus. The professors here are super personable and really want you to succeed! The diversity on this Penn State campus is insane and it is such a cool environment to complete your education in.
Junior,5,"I really like the opportunity to get involved here. There sre hundreds of clubs and you can do research with professors! One thing I would like to see change is a a bridge fir students to walk over the main road, would hate to see someone get in an accident."
Sophomore,5,Went here for first two years. Really beautiful campus. 10 minutes from peach street which is the us-19 and 5 minutes from buffalo road. Lake Erie is a nice place to have fun after class.
Niche User,5,"Great intro to their business program, friendly staff, great set up for working on campus, good student encouragement ,opportunities"
Freshman,5,Penn State Behrend is a excellent school for engineering and business majors. The professors are no bullshitters and get straight to business the first day. There are over 5000 parking spots for comuters and additional parking space for students in dorms. Behrend is a smaller campus so it is easier to find classes and get to each class. The only problem with Behrend is the location. Erie is a small city with no local business' for internships. The weather is very poor with an average 100 inches of snow a season. Lots of salt and plow trucks roaming every street. Penn State Behrend is a beautiful campus with many scholarly opportunities for students to engage in. This school is a full five stars all together.
Sophomore,5,small school with amazing staff.  A freindly student body. great assistance and awesome tuition prices.
Senior,5,"why I like the most about my college is the diversity and the feeling of the student life . There is always something to do , professors are always willing to answer all my questions . Overall I will highly recommend the college"
Niche User,5,"I really loved Penn State Behrend. My sister is a junior there right now and I will be joining her next year. The campus isn't too bug or too small, it's the perfect size. In addition, the campus is extremely safe. I never feel scared walking alone at night and have never heard of my sister having problems there. The academics are also great. The investment is well worth the education you get out of it. Obviously, any college student would like to see tuition go down, but you get the education you pay for!"
Niche User,5,I like the friendly community of Penn State including the professors not just the students. I also like all the different opportunities that are available there and the extracurricular  activities that are student led.
Senior,5,"Behrend is a beautiful campus: it has acres of land and most of that is woods, a creek/gorge,and scenery. (We even win awards for arbory). Although we get about 1000 students each year, most classes are small. A typically class only has about 30 students so it makes the learning more one-on-one especially since teachers will work to remember everyone's name (it's nice when you took a teachers class last year,but when they see you in the hallway they make sure to call out and say hello!). The party scene is not huge at Behrend, although there is always something going on. The school itself does a great job of hosting fun (always FREE) events for it's students during the weekends. Behrend (being the biggest Penn State branch campus) is a small campus that still gives you enough big campus feel. Plus: when you graduate you're still getting your degree from Penn State (a very looked after school)."
Sophomore,5,I love the community. It is so diverse with a variety of people from all different kinds of places. You can easily fit in and find people who have the same interests. There are so many extracurriculars that people can participate in. The professors are really nice and work hard to provide for their students.
Freshman,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful! The staff are friendly and easy to talk to and work with! The campus life is very nice with many clubs to join. I would definitely recommend a tour to anyone who is even remotely interested!
Niche User,5,Penn State Behrend has provided a comfortable atmosphere for me on my search for colleges. The staff have been extremely helpful and pleasant when aiding me or providing answers to my millions of questions upon application to the school. Not only that but the school itself has a beautiful and safe campus thus leading me to highly recommend this school :)
Freshman,5,"I'm currently only a freshman here at Behrend, but I loved every minute of it. The small campus atmosphere adds so much to your college experience. Small classes allows you to get to know your professors and fellow peers. Getting involved is relatively easy and there's a great variety of interests on campus. I'm a member of the Swim Team and being involved in a division 3 athletics program is amazing. Everyone is there because they want to be and I've never seen such a hard working group of people."
Freshman,5,Penn State Behrend is a nice campus with smaller classrooms and great professors. You will get to recognize a lot of students around campus. Dorms are nice and everyone is friendly.
Freshman,5,"What I love about Penn State is the beautiful campus it's on, especially during fall and winter, it's very beautiful. I also like the size of the campus along with the number of people that attend. The class sizes are also very nice, which lets you get some time with the professor. The overall atmosphere of the school is also great. I'm glad I picked Behrend!"
Niche User,5,"I loved the campus size, the friendly professors, and the overall atmosphere in snowy Erie. The facilities are very well maintained and comfortable dorms. I also loved the Black School of Business, the facility is fantastic for an Engineering major like I will be! If I could suggest anything to improve upon, I would say to improve the variety of food served on campus."
Freshman,5,"Best kept secret in the Penn State community.  The education is incredible, professors are engaged, clubs for everyone, activities, and the campus is beautiful.  The Wintergreen Gorge is next to the campus which makes hiking fun.  Students are friendly and outgoing and willing to help anyone.  You can find parties, but most are here to learn. The class size is smaller which makes it easier to get to know your professor, the classwork is challenging in most majors.  Engineering, Nursing, Business majors are popular. PSU has the largest alumni network making it easy to find a job after graduating.  The only cons would be not enough apartments close to campus, no town with stores, restaurants within walking distance, and the wind and snow everyday for 4 months makes it rough to walk to class."
Sophomore,5,I couldn't be happier with my choice to go to Penn State Behrend. The quality of education and is more than I could have ever asked for and the professors are wonderful to work with.
Junior,5,"Penn State Erie, The Behrend College is a beautiful place full of talented individuals. The professors know each student by name and face, making no one feel like an ant. The advisers are all helpful, as I have visited many and they have helped me guide a path to my career. 
For changes, I wish there would be more parking. I have trouble parking often, even though I pay hundreds of hard earned money to park. We need more lots because traffic jams are a problem and it should not take so long to leave Behrend in a car."
Freshman,5,I really fell in love with the nature and comfy environment. Here you never going  to get bored. Lots of opportunities and activities. Sometimes it's hard to keep up but there's a lot of good workers always ready to help.
College Freshman,5,"I enjoy this school very much. It's easy to get around and enjoy Lake Erie, and the weather is pleasant (assuming you love snow)."
College Freshman,5,The student center is great with setting up interviews and helping students to find jobs and internships. There is a large majority of students who get internships while still in school and continue with them after graduation developing their careers.
College Freshman,5,"The professors here are all very welcoming and made the transition very easy for me and my peers. The classes can be large depending on your major, but the professors work hard to make it a one on one course with generally open office hours and assistance."
College Freshman,5,Each student is required to take several modules of training on campus safety and security. There are emergency phone located all around the vicinity of the campus and the police take all situations seriously. The school is very safe and responsible.
College Freshman,5,Greek life is definitely present on this campus but it is not the main focus for every student. They all host events for both greek and nongreek students to attend and help make the campus experience fun for everyone while helping the community as a whole.
College Freshman,5,"The overall atmosphere of the campus is very home like and welcoming while also being two minutes away from downtown buffalo road. The teachers are very welcoming and understanding, making the transition way more relaxed."
College Sophomore,5,"Our Penn State engineering program is highly regarded.  I am from Western New York, so I will compete with Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) graduates and University of Buffalo (UB) graduates.  I am confident that I will have the best engineering degree possible."
College Sophomore,5,"Feel at home on campus, like the look of the campus and its size, likes the professors in general and the swim team.  Worth the money"
College Junior,5,I play for the women's soccer team on campus and we have won our conference the past 5 years. Varsity sports on our campus are a big part of our school and there is much school spirit.
College Sophomore,5,"Penn State Erie - The Behrend College has been a great experience overall. There is so much to describe about the college. The course are very helpful. There are many classes to take for many students. The professors are very helpful. They have certain types of ways to help a student. For example, student can report to a tutor system to seek help. Tons of course are offered. For example, if student like more creative art classes, then there are more than 10 course available in that category. The class styles depend on things like teachers, subject, size, etc. The class sizes depend on what kind of class a student takes. For example, if students are in classes that mostly lecture type, there might be a class size of over 100 or so. The college is great. In my opinion, I wouldn't mind spending all my four years at Behrend."
College Sophomore,5,"Penn State Erie has all great college qualities. I describe myself as a student of technology and this campus has given me my first glimpse of the college life. For example, During the school year, I lived on campus to get to know more experiences in the student life. Another example is that I have joined multimedia clubs such as the video game club, engineering demonstrations, computer science seminars, etc. Also I have apply and worked at a job in the dining hall of the campus as a way to have some spare money to help with regular expenses. The college is unique because it fits the level of great education. In this campus, students have the opportunity to meet the professors/teachers to get to know them and also to request help when needed. I would do it all over again because it made me feel like my dream career was just one-step away from coming true. Overall it has been a wonderful school year and I look forward to another year."
College Senior,5,I have walked around alone at night feeling very safe.
College Senior,5,"Great professors, environment and learning atmosphere. Penn State Erie is an up and coming school and is one of the best kept secrets in PA!"
College Sophomore,5,"From my understanding, it is fairly safe on campus. I don't get emails or texts about sexual assault, etc. I haven't heard of any stories where something bad happened to someone."
College Freshman,5,Health and safety are very big importance here
Junior,4,"Most of my classes are currently online and with Canvas integration, it makes things easy. Some professors use Pearson as well, which also makes learning easier. The professors understand some of the learning difficulties online and are open to accomodating the student's needs."
Junior,4,It accommodates all students no matter their needs. Awards academic-based scholarships. Beautiful and rewarding campus. Has lots of resources for any student.
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are well qualified and the teaching is enthusiastic. The walk between buildings can be a bit of a struggle due to the snow and the steep hill the campus is built on, but then I can consider my walk to class as my workout for the day. The staff is extremely helpful and the environment is friendly. The campus is smaller in size but I feel that students here still get the full college experience."
Sophomore,4,"My in-person classes were transferred online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The teachers were able to work quickly to transition the classes in a way that we still effectively learned the course content. The two biggest struggles were working around the lack of access to printers at home and uploading assignments online, but teachers were flexible as we all learned to adjust to the new setup."
Freshman,4,"Friendly atmosphere, professors make you feel welcome and they are really friendly.  As an untraditional adult student it was hard to return to school after 20yrs, but the professors welcome you and understand/respect the fact that that I work full time have 4 children and still manage to attend every class."
Sophomore,4,My experience is just starting but I have had success communicating with the faculty which is always a plus. I know the campus is close to some good places to eat and I have the opportunity to meet plenty of new people.
Sophomore,4,Online learning is always weird and has it's setbacks but with the way things are right now the teachers are doing the best they can and I think they are doing really well. The classes are going pretty smooth and the teachers are always willing to talk to you to clear things up.
Graduate Student,4,Outstanding school with plenty of experience. You receive instruction in small class sizes from beyond accomplished professors who push you much harder and encourage you to your limits. Its tough while you go there but stand out among others when applying to jobs.
Junior,4,Penn State Behrend offers several opportunities for students to be active and involved on and off-campus. The majors offered are structured to engage students in their learning and academic careers.
Freshman,4,Penn State Erie has a great campus but it does get a little quite on weekends. A lot of people go home for the weekends.  Professors are really good and I believe the Penn State name will help me get a great career.
Sophomore,4,The teachers always seem to be excited to be at work. All the teachers have a Ph.D. or are in the process of getting one and are all very knowledgeable in their fields of study. The advisors are very helpful if you reach out to them with a question.
Senior,4,I love how easy it was to make friends. Being able to connect with professors in a small class is a big plus as well!
Sophomore,4,small school. You'll walk around and constantly see people you know. Really easy to meet people and make fast friends. The hills are rough but they'll keep you in shape. Food options are limited to dining halls unless you have a car. Buses run every hour or so. housing is great especially ohio hall and ugates apts across the street. Parties are at ugates and 2 frats off campus. average academics. The gorge behind campus is beautiful so definitely check it out. The town of Erie is poor but there are some fun places to explore and Peach street has soo many shops. If you're a B student who wants a small school and doesnt easily get depressed this is a great school. Without a car can feel isolated tho. Feels like home with the community there and everyone knowing each other. Go to main campus for parties for Halloween and state patties. if you dont have a car make friends with people who do and you'll be fine
Junior,4,Overall the teachers are good. Some leave a lot to be desired when it comes to teaching ability. It is a great school and the smaller class size help you learn more effectively
Freshman,4,"I love my campus! It’s filled with amazing people and professors! I am a second semester freshman, here at the behrend campus I feel welcomed and safe."
Freshman,4,With this school being so small it makes it great because everyone is so friendly to each other. When I went to see it I immediately fell in love with the school. The athletic programs are great and it was really great to see how everyone goes to support everyone.
Senior,4,"This college is excellent if you are interested in joining a small Behrend community. The teachers in the advanced levels really try to help advance the students to their graduation. Some professors even go so far as to help you get internships and scholarships. It is a very small knit community, but excellent academics."
Senior,4,Behrend college is a great place to attend. The teachers are willing to take time out of their day to help their students excell. The campus may be small but that makes it easier to get to know your classmates. Everyone is friendly and there are plenty of student activists and clubs to join.
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Behrend is a beautiful campus and has a lot of potential. With it being rather small, there is a small amount of diversity. A lot of the men are racist and disrespectful to women which is very frustrating. However, if you find a good group of friends, you will have a great time. Very important to get involved there because there is not a lot to Erie."
Niche User,4,"I had a very good time getting to know the campus and the area around it. I thought that it was a very good size for its population, maybe could use less hills if that was an option. Overall I can't wait to study their full time starting in the fall of 2018."
Freshman,4,The people there are so nice and will help you in any way possible if you ask for help. The professors for the most part are very understanding and care about what you have to say. The environment makes you feel safe as it is a dry campus and everyone's main goal is to keep everyone safe and feel secure.
Freshman,4,I have had a great experience at Behrend. It is so close to so many restaurants and fun things to do. There are also so many great professors and faculty who make you feel like you matter as a student and person.
Freshman,4,"I really like the big college feel on such a small campus. The structure of the campus and the university really stands out from other universities. It is a nice feel when everyone can get along with each since the student population is small. However, the hills are annoying and the parking garage is small and unfinished. So, it will have its goods and bads."
Sophomore,4,"The school is pretty small only about 4000 undergrad students, so if you're looking for a small school this is a good option.The winters are very harsh so if you don't like cold weather don't come here.The professors here are outgoing and easy to reach and understand how it's like to be a student."
Sophomore,4,"I started out with a very rough start with being as far away from home as I was, and not entirely knowing what I wanted to do with my life with the pressure of not wanting to waste my parents money. 
I am now the president of an organisation, and a student leader on campus headed in the right direction doing something that I love with the support of faculty, staff, and alum around me."
Freshman,4,"The professors and staff are always there to help and often times, know students on a first name basis. The campus is large enough to expand your interests yet small enough to not be lost in the crowd. However, the students don't seem very open to new people. They are friendly, but always keep their heads down unless they already know you. Overall, great school to attend."
Sophomore,4,"People in Behrend College are friendly and willing to help others. There are a lot of international students in Behrend College. I have met people from China, Taiwan, Italy, France, Malaysia, India, Philippines, etc. Most of the professors I met in Behrend College are kind and responsible."
Freshman,4,"Penn State Behrend feels very much like high school. With rather small class sizes, the professors are able to learn your names (if they are interested in doing so,) and make the atmosphere feel more personal and familiar. The students are exceptionally social and willing to help newer students. There are many clubs available to students, and on-campus activities nearly every day. The only problem with the campus is that it rests neatly on a large hill, which makes it an exercise to go from class to class, but it definitely helps fight the freshman 15."
Junior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Penn State Behrend. I think that it is the perfect school for me and I am still very happy that I decided to go there. I think that the campus is beautiful and the buildings are up to date and fresh. It is also nice that it doesn't take very long to get to your classes. However it sometimes can be a trek because of the hills. All of the teachers that I have had seem very interested in the topic they are teaching and make it easy to get in contact with them. However, there are some things that could change. For example, more things to do on campus like sporting events and more places to eat/hangout. "
College Freshman,4,The dorms are a great way to meet friends since each dorm hall has a large study lounge and living center in the lobby. The dorms themselves are a little small at least in the freshmen hall but the honors housing is definitely a major boost. The cost of housing is a little high but overall the convenience of where they are placed on campus makes it central to most classes.
College Freshman,4,"Penn State has a large crowd of supporters at each sporting event no matter the sport. You can always rely on the community around the campus, alumni, and current students to be supporting the Nittany Blue and White."
Recent Alumnus,4,so far my experience at penn state behrend is amazing. the psychology department and the professors are outstanding and are giving their students the knowledge and confidence to not only do well in the classes but to excel in the field of psychology.
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of work in my engineering program!  I had one teacher who was teaching for the first time and was terrible, but the rest have been very knowledgeable.  They do care about me as a person and helping me to learn and accommodate me with my swimming schedule. On the other hand, I do put the effort in.  Swimmers are cut from the team of their average is bad.  We are there to learn first, not be athletic first.  When a class has to be canceled, we are given assignments on line.  Many assignments are handed in on line so there is little paperwork.  Need a good and reliable laptop."
College Sophomore,4,"Has the blue light system, which helps to make me feel safe, although I have never had to use it.  I never walk alone on campus at dusk or night. The police are actual officers, not just campus police."
College Sophomore,4,"Was in the honors dorms and had one bathroom for 4 people, which was great, but other dorms have a bathroom down the hallway for many people and would never like that.  Cleveland State University had the BEST dorms!"
College Sophomore,4,"Not necessarily well attended by the students, only sometimes.  Swim team has won their conference title for the past 9 years. Softball field could be improved.  Difficult curriculums at the school, so many do not have the capabilities to attend sporting events.  The sporting events should be pushed more.  Many commuters, so all are not necessarily on campus all the time to be involved."
College Junior,4,The campus really helps you out to get internships with the career fair and having websites for us to apply too.
College Junior,4,I love the class sizes but i wish the teachers would be more active such as study sessions.
College Junior,4,Our campus gives out alerts overtime something is stolen or emergencies. I feel very safe on campus.
College Junior,4,I love the way my school makes me feel like I'm at home.
College Sophomore,4,Very isolated school so you are not going to run into trouble here.
College Sophomore,4,"In the Penn State campus, they have many events that describe student options for a career after they get there degree. For example, like most colleges, they have a career fair to teach most students about there job decisions. Another great prospect is that sometimes students can get connected to alumni through the college website  for tips and advice and maybe some help."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is a nice place to go and to explore. The security on campus is impressive. There is a Penn State police station. Emergencies are easily reachable. There are students out on the campus ground which makes a student feel much better.
College Sophomore,4,"On my campus, sports are a big part of the Behrend campus.Student involvement is good.In detail, student can do lots of activities to help of teams such as apply for a job that requires federal work study. the team performance is outstanding because the team plays very good in many of the sports and has made it to the top final teams. Fan support is described good because the events include family members and friends attending there. school spirit is average and reason is that the campus hold some event and activities that support each sports team but there are less rallies and celebrations for them. The athletic facilities is great because the players are trained to perform their very best."
College Sophomore,4,Job prospects are great. There is a career fair on campus twice a year every year to those who are interested in going.
College Sophomore,4,I have never questioned my health or safety on campus. We have a Health and Wellness center along with a police station on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Freshman Year, I stayed in Perry Hall. I loved my neighbors and my roommate. The room included a mini fridge and a microwave. The bathroom and hallways were cleaned daily, the only thing you had to worry about was cleaning your own room."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience at Penn State Erie is great! I love my classes, my campus and the new friends I have made. I feel very fortunate that I was accepted. What has made my experience unique, is that I am a cheerleader for the basketball team there! I love that my coach keeps an eye on our grades and gives a talk to let us know when we need to reevaluate our life decisions."
College Sophomore,4,Penn State has one of the best degrees in the US and has a huge alumni.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I would say the education is okay as for learning. Penn State has one of the most valued degrees in the US, so whatever education you get, is worth it for the job. However, the engineering and physics at Behrend are taught with a flipped classroom method which is honestly, harder than traditional. The flipped classroom method is only at Behrend, not any other campus. If I wasn't proficient in physics, I would go elsewhere. But, the other classes are like other universities. Some teachers are okay, fantastic, and terrible. If you use rate my professor, you will be much more satisfied. As social life, since it's cold and there aren't too many places to go to unless you have a car, it's prevalent on campus and off campus (by nearby apartments). If the people weren't generally nice, this review would get a ""3/5"" rating instead. As far as work goes, it's really easy to get a job. The food is okay. It's not as bad as everyone complains about. Its either hit or miss. They make the same food every 2 or 4 weeks (For example, if it's brussel sprouts monday 7/11, it's brussel sprouts monday 7/25). As far as academics, there's a fair number of above average intelligent people and below, but mostly average. Say maybe, 25 above / 60 average /15 below percent as an example of what I'm trying to say. Overall, it's a good campus if you're doing 2+2. Some people love it and want 4 years, but I personally love it for 2 and want to transfer after."
College Sophomore,4,"Housing at Behrend is mostly good. The normal residence hall dorms are exactly like every other public college/university dorms. From my understanding there is always a ""party"" hall every year. Honors dorms are better; they have their own bathroom and computer lab with a printer. The rooms look bigger, but they probably have more space due to the door being on the side and not the middle. I don't know much about the apartments but they have a kitchen and living room. Senat is the best residence hall because of location, also has own bathroom. I know honors dorms have air conditioning and freshman residence halls don't. I don't know about apartments and Senat."
College Sophomore,4,"As an overall theme, the education is pretty good and teachers are helpful and understanding. However, I find that certain classes or teachers may be more difficult than they should be."
College Sophomore,4,Housing is great for those who do live on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Many professors are interested in making your experience the best it can be.  The advisors are helpful in the ACPC. Behind has a lot to offer!
College Junior,4,I think the safety and security on campus is great on campus. There have been a few instances where I felt unsafe but I think law enforcement did a great job taking care of the problems. Campus police take their job very seriously which I think is a great thing because it makes everyone feel very safe.
College Senior,4,"I love Penn state Behrend and all it has to offer. Specifically, I find the people to be great, warm, and welcoming to new students as well as keeping a tight community of the existing students. I love the music department of which I play the double bass and bass guitar in the semesters I can do that and have a blast with the people in the band. As part of a great privilege, we were able to play for the former present of the United States of America  Bill Clinton! As of a calmer note, I am apart of the gaming community as well which has a closeness here at behrend were all forms of gaming are accepted. I play the card game magic the gathering in which we play at tournament both in the community and here on campus. I was also able to put on the first convention of nerd culture that had everything from a magic the gathering tournament, laring live chess, and cool panels on all things nerd. My school is unique  because of all the cool things we get to do in our free time here on campus as well as having a great balanced education. Especially for me, I am a psychology major and being able to have the opportunity  to construct and do my own research as an undergraduate is a great opportunity that many other schools don't have. While on the other hand we are aloud to go and have fun here in our psychology  department this summer class called cross cultural psychology is taking a trip to Japan to learn more about other culture's psychology techniques. I'feel I would do it all over again I would still choose behind because it was a place that I never visited, came to know and love, and as a result have become my new home away from home that I want to come back for graduate school for clinical psychology."
College Freshman,4,Penn State Behrend is really a great school!
College Freshman,4,Athletics are pretty good. there not the best though.. they could put more money into them
College Freshman,4,I love my school academics are hard but greek life is great !!! I recommend joining greek life.
College Freshman,4,The health and wellness center is a great resource on campus as appointments can be scheduled fairly quick and its like going to a real doctors office to get checked up!
Senior,2,"At Behrend, there is a lack of options for courses. You're stuck with the same options every year, which is usually a given, but the selection is poor to begin with. There is little room for advancement. The majority of professors don't seem to care for their students, with exception to a few (ratemyprofessor.com holds some truth; use this to determine your professors)."
College Sophomore,2,There is school spirt for an sports and the weight room is terrible.
College Sophomore,2,"Very small rooms, compared to other university dorms ours could be much better."
College Sophomore,2,"Unlike the main campus, Penn State Erie does not stress athletic programs, our school is a joke."
College Sophomore,2,"It's mostly white and if they're not white, they're probably an international from China. As far as acceptance goes, it's not like everybody is racist and hateful, but it would be better if you were white and not a difference race/LGBT."
College Freshman,2,Since Behrend is a small campus sports aren't really the focus just academics
College Freshman,2,We do not have any good teams and just a few rec areas
College Freshman,2,"For my particular building, it was one of the first-if not the first- building to be built on this campus. Taking that into account, there's no carpet in the rooms, nor does the heat work. Also, the showers have little to no pressure (except for the handicap shower) and they take forever to warm-which contributes greatly to the waste of water. Luckily we have an excellent cleaning staff but there could be some things improved greatly in this building. But it is one of the most convenient dorm buildings here as it is located in close proximity to classes and dining services."
College Freshman,2,There really isn't much food choices but you make the most of it and we have the galley which is a food convenience store that you can buy more foods with your meal plan which is nice
College Freshman,2,"It is a small town, not really many choices out there let us to choose."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is small, so there isnt much party going on unless it is off campus."
College Freshman,2,not alot to go around.
College Sophomore,2,"It's Erie, there really isn't much to do or see other than other colleges"
College Freshman,2,its a smaller campus so there aren't many parties that go on
College Freshman,2,"Erie is definitely more for a nature lover, there are tons of really pretty parks and your next to the lake (15 min). as for going out nightlife, there is University Gates apartments, and that's about it unless your over 21 then there are clubs and bars downtown that you can go to."
College Sophomore,2,It is very hard to get scholarships even with a perfect gpa.
College Sophomore,2,"If you are a girl, you get into parties but there are some sketchy fraternities so make sure you bring a guy friend.  If you are a guy, you need to join a frat, know someone well that is in a frat and pay money, or drink in your dorm/university apartments.  There are no fraternity houses within walking distance."
College Junior,2,My major is not offered here
College Sophomore,2,It is pointless in my eyes.  All they do is pledge in order to wear meaningless Greek letters on their shirt. No one cares.
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life at Behrend is a joke. I would highly recommend not getting involved. They don't really have Greek housing, and the house they do have is run down. You don't have to go Greek to be ""cool"", recognized or get involved on campus. If you do sports, that'll be WAY better anyways. The sports parties are 10 times better than any frat party!"
College Freshman,2,It's Erie. Lot's of Snow and Rain in the winter/fall. 
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of Asian and caucasian people on campus. There is a handful of African American students on campus and I think that's how it somehow splits the campus. Although don't get me wrong most students on campus get along and there always planning things together. Bus as far as our organizations on campus that split everyone up its not that positive.
College Junior,2,"I got nothing from the school. For a university that prides in giving resources to students every scholarship is either for the ""needy"" like I actually am, or the genius, which I didn't make the cut."
Recent Alumnus,2,"3/4s of the year, the weather is awful.  Whether it's from the rain or the infamous lake effect snow, classes rarely get cancelled.  But when the weather warms up, Behrend is honestly one of the more beautiful campuses out there.  Many students go to the gorge which is right on campus and can get lost in the wilderness.  Everyone comes to bring their dogs, take a run, or can just hang out by the river."
College Sophomore,2,"Its a dry campus, but for some reason alot the RAs are SUPER stuck up.I lived in Niagra my freshman year and loved it. Its not as nice as say Senat, but you get to know people alot better."
College Freshman,2,"Not that much to do. Places to eat and go are only accessible if you have a car, because they are not close. There are parties at the apartments but it would be fun to do other things."
College Freshman,2,"Not very many...three I think for girls, not sure about guys."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of snow at Behrend. Classes are not cancelled. Every other Penn State campus will be delayed or cancelled, but Behrend will not. It is not fun commuting to campus those days, or walking to class when its snowy or icy. However, everyone's always outside when it's nice out (there are a lot of intramurals at Behrend fields) and Peek n Peak isn't far away."
College Sophomore,2,"Behrend is in the middle of Harborcreek- 15 minutes from Peach Street. You have to take a bus to get anywhere unless you have your own car. Sometimes, you might feel trapped. There is always something to do on campus, but there never seems to be a big turn out. Many students go home on the weekends."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of students look down while they're walking around campus. It seems that a lot of them don't want to get involved. Some have no relationships and others are obsessive with them, while others are hooking up all the time. There are a lot of fun people at Behrend, but it would be nice if they were more involved."
College Senior,2,Winter weather is somewhat stressful at times. It is a nightmare because when a storm occurs classes are not cancelled so one has to basically walk to class in the middle of the storm.
College Junior,2,"When I asked the campus financial aid office how I could get money for school they did two things. First, they scanned my student ID card, which provided them with my FAFSA information, then told me I was considered ineligible for any easy free money. Second, the handed me a cookie-cutter list of scholarship sources and basically told me I was on my own to find out what I was eligible for and not, as well as acquiring what I was qualified for.

Basically, if the FAFSA says you're not getting anything, you're on your own."
College Freshman,2,"If you like meat heads with their ears pierced that is the only type of guys at Behrend. For girls, there are two sides of the spectrum. You are either really weird, or a stuck up bitch. It is really hard to make friends."
College Sophomore,2,"No Where to Park Near Dorms – There are never spaces near the dorms, but near the classes always have space"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Lake Effect – I would say the worst thing about the campus is the snow and the lake effect. Classes are never cancelled even if it's a blizzard outside. Although they do a fairly good job of shoveling and salting, the wind is just terrible. But the summer and warm weather in Erie is fantastic, every one hangs out outside playing sports, and there's 11 beaches to go to."
College Sophomore,2,Bus Schedules – We do have buses that come to campus often but most of the time the bus schedules are not that convenient. They run at odd times and cost money there and back.
College Student,2,Not Too Hot – I didnt recieve any financial aid and wish I got more help finding Scholarships
College Freshman,2,"Although drinking seems to be a huge part of college life, I have seen worse campuses. There are many parties and abuses of alchohol throughout the campus."
College Freshman,2,"Erie has the WORST weather ever.  I live here but did not realize how bad it can get until you walk across campus and feel the need to wear a full snow suit.  The wind blowing in your face isnt pleasant, while needing snow shoes to get to class.  I feel that class is NEVER cancelled."
College Freshman,2,This has been a hassle since day one.  verry stressful situation and some of the employee's were not that helpful and now finding out i have a bill that was not covered by tution or financial aid due to adjustment made to this for 2010 year which is over but never got that bill unit now
College Sophomore,1,No one cares about greek life unless you are in it.
College Sophomore,1,"-Lack of diversity (a lot of lowkey racism going on)

-Students mostly hangout in their on ethnic group 

-Courses are very easy 

-50/50 professors, had very nice/bad (do your research before selecting courses)"
College Sophomore,1,"The value of earning a degree in Penn State Erie is a joke. Didn't have a car first semester, took a lot of Ubers. Three drivers I met in their 20s all graduated from Penn State Erie, still no job to be found. Our school is a joke, get out as soon as possible. On the bright side you can always be an Uber Driver."
College Sophomore,1,"The biggest problem about Penn State Erie is that it doesn't feel like a university but rather a high school. Universities are suppose to be a place where people can open widen their prospectives and explore new things. There should also be a diverse group of students that are accepting towards one another. You will not find any of this in Erie.  Most of the students are white caucasians who seem to have never stepped a foot outside of Erie. Most people are extremely narrow minded and in my whole year of living on campus, I have never seen two students of different ethnicity interact with one another. (Anyone on campus who uses the app ""Yik-Yak"" can tell you that most students in Penn State Erie are bigots). I would've rather chose to attend a community college for two years and move on to an actual university then Penn State Erie. Thankfully, I only need go to this hell hole for one more year then I can transfer to a university that actually feels like one."
College Sophomore,1,"Pretty bad in terms of guy to girl ratio, infamous actually"
College Sophomore,1,"The only real options are Ugates and Hudson lofts, both of which are incredibly expensive. Other options would be to rent an apartment or house in ""downtown"" Erie."
College Junior,1,"There's a horrible guy-to-girl ratio, aka the Behrend Ratio.  It's about 4 to 1, which is better than 6 to 1 which it was a few years ago.  It seems like half the girls here are on a sports team and therefore only associate with other athletes and won't even look at you if you're not a male athlete.  The other half of the girls are stuck-up as well.  The Behrend ratio makes girls that be average anywhere else appear extremely attractive.  This leads to the girls getting big heads and thinking they are God's gift to men.  There are a few really nice girls, but they all have boyfriends."
College Freshman,1,I was valedictorian and I didn't get much of anything
Recent Alumnus,1,They charge way too much for the permits and I have many memories of circling for 30 minutes before being able to find a spot.
College Sophomore,1,"Do NOT live in University Gate apartments. I live there now and it is awful. Yeah it is right across the street from campus, but it is SUPER expensive and for how much you pay they are not that nice. Kids get drunk on the weekends and break stuff and you have to pay. We had people kick in our front door and we owe almost three hundred dollars for it, and the landlords do not care at all about you."
College Sophomore,1,It is AWFUL in the winter. Absolutely miserable. Two feet of snow can hit in a matter of minutes and that is not an exaggeration. Wind is always in your face and it either snows or rains.
College Sophomore,1,"The food is ok, but there is one place and it is expensive."
College Senior,1,You almost always have to walk really far because close parking can never be found and it gets filled very quickly.
College Freshman,1,"Mine is offered for all four years, so regardless of my grades they should have let me into main."
College Junior,1,"The entire campus consists of white, middle class, meat-heads. I honestly have not seen so many cut-offs and pierced ears on guys in my entire life. They're a good many students from china however, but they keep to themselves. Most of the cocky white kids (basically the entire campus) actually make fun of them behind their backs. It honestly feels like I'm still in high school here."
College Junior,1,There are no off campus places to eat unless you drive or know someone with a car. they are all too far to walk to and the buses dont go there. you have two places to eat on campus and they are both horrible and repeat the same things over and over.
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely nothing to do here. If you are looking to have a good college experience don't come here.
College Freshman,1,"No Fun – The Behrend campus is not full of parties for older and underage students. The ""nightlife"" is not very lively on campus and bar/clubs that are around our campus are not very welcoming at times. But, there are some house parties near campus that are fun and are a way for students to hang out and have a good time."
College Junior,1,"Expensive, and because of all the snow we get here, you usually end up having to dig your car out. 4-Wheel drive recommended. Freshman halls are somewhat far from parking lots."
College Freshman,1,Very Strict – It's really serious if you get caught doing something.

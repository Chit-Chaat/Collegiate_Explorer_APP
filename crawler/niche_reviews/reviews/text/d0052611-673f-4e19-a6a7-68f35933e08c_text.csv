Sophomore,5,"This is the friendliest, most family oriented place I've ever been to: When talking to other colleges, I felt like just another face, but with Kentucky Wesleyan, they made it feel like I was already apart of the family. They remembered my name after one visit, contacted me regularly, helped me with financial aid, and even did everything they could to help me with a smooth transition from high school into college. I always feel safe. They have great sports and arts programs. The professors are very kind and love to help their students. The food service is fantastic; they have a great staff. It's a clean and beautiful campus. The campus ministries program is fantastic. Chapel is a truly enjoyable service, and their pastor is amazing! They have great fraternities and sororities. They have lots of fun student activities. They allow their students to be as involved as possible. They offer plenty of on-campus jobs, and they do everything they can to help find outside jobs and internships."
Sophomore,5,"I love attending Kentucky Wesleyan College because the faculty and staff remembers who you are, and takes the time to genuinely care for each and everyone. In a bigger college, this would be hard to do, but with Wesleyan's size, it's perfect."
Junior,5,"I like the faculty and staff at the college, along with the diversity of the campus and the generous financial aid packages that they offer. They want students to succeed and constantly contact us about jobs, internships, and campus activities going on. The teachers want us to succeed and make an effort to ensure everyone understands the subjects."
Niche User,5,I don't want anything to change because I love everything about the college. the professors are very nice and are willing to help you whenever you need help. The campus is a wide-open beautiful field so it is not like you are cramped up in 1 little building. and you are not far away from the city so you don't have to drive a bunch of miles to find stuff that you need.
Senior,5,"It's a great environemt to be around, and it's a welcome home type area. Everything about Kentucky Wesleyan if perfect!!"
Freshman,5,"Kentucky Wesleyan College allows me to get a private education near home. I get to journey into my future career while still having the comfort of a familiar feeling. The students may come from a different place, but Wesleyan makes it feel like home."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love attending Kentucky Wesleyan. Since it is a small provate school, class sizes are much smaller and more beneficial. All of the staff, from professors to mainteneance staff, know you and are very friendly. I live on campus, and the dorms are a little better than average. The campus food is also about average. Since the student body measures about 700, it seems as if everyone knows everyone, and cliques are almost nonexistent. Athletes are friends with the students in Greek life, who are friends with the students who participate in performing arts."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at KWC. I have , in a very short period of time, developed and grown so much. The professors know you by name whether you are in their classroom or not. The atmosphere is one of encouragement, personal growth and development for all. The campus is beautiful and easy to get around. Campus life has something for everyone and it's strongly encouraged to get involved whether it's clubs, athletics, Greek life or community service. There is also something going on around campus to get involved and if you're bored and have nothing to do it's your own fault. There's something for everyone . Most important for me is that there is a family atmosphere and I'm proud to call KWC my home away from home for the next 4 years."
Freshman,5,"Very helpful, and joyful staff that are excited to help with your college experience. I came across several issues along the way with getting ready and the staff helped me every step of the way."
College Freshman,5,I love it! The scholarship that I have paying for it makes everything worth it no matter what.
College Sophomore,5,The possibility of getting a job is high
College Sophomore,5,Professors care and will help you in any way
College Sophomore,5,My school is very accepting and helpful
College Freshman,5,"I have never felt like I was in danger while on campus. It always fells safe and inviting, never dark and dangerous."
College Freshman,5,"Our career development office has some of the best people working there. They are always happy to help you look for a job or internship, they will also happily look over your resume and help you improve it."
College Freshman,5,The professor are extremely helpful with anything you need. They are also very approachable whenever you need anything.
College Freshman,5,"The RA's are the ones that help build the social atmosphere, and they are the ones that make sure we are all happy and getting along. The RA's are honestly the best part of housing."
College Freshman,5,The first time I stepped on campus it felt like I was home. I knew that day that I wanted to go to Kentucky Wesleyan College and that was the only college for me.
College Freshman,5,"Considering the size of the campus, everyone would know very fast if anything bad was to happen on campus. At all times there is campus security riding around and security cameras almost everywhere. The campus here is very safe and friendly and something dangerous almost never happens."
College Freshman,5,The campus is very diverse. They're very accepting and there's rarely any intolerance.
Junior,4,This is my first semester at KWC but so far I have enjoyed myself. I'm not going to lie...the classes are challenging and the expectations academically are very high.  But so far I have had a positive experience on campus.
Freshman,4,"Kentucky Wesleyan College is a small but diverse institution in Owensboro, Kentucky. It offers a wide selection of majors, minors, and courses for students of all interests. The faculty and staff are excellent, and the only complaint I have is the price. KWC is a very expensive school, averaging at roughly $20,000-$30,000 per year."
Freshman,4,I liked the smaller campus and smaller class size feel although after staying in the dorms for a while I realized that they were overpriced with the cost with what the quality that was the room. I felt that i could find a cheaper rent for a better room not far from the campus. They also just got a new food service for the school but i find it adequate at best and the most you're looking forward to in those meals is that it is a hot meal for people to eat before or after class. The best part of the campus would definitely be the teachers who guarantee to help you if you're struggling and it is easy to do that since there are few people in every class.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is wonderful. It is a small campus and allows for everyone to know one another. The professors are great, friendly, and willing to help."
Freshman,4,Excellent school! Teachers are more than willing to take time on you and the environment is amazing!
Junior,4,"When I came to Kentucky Wesleyan, I wasn't expecting anything that came my way. I was planning on sliding by and getting out in 4 years like I did in high school.  But this college is much more than that. From KWC I have gained a friends, sisters, and a family that I will have for the rest of my life."
College Freshman,4,I'm not too familiar with this but hopefully soon I will be able to be recruited when I am done with my degree.
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, I know that any one of the administrators would take action to help anyone if they were put into an unsafe situation."
College Freshman,4,I have a scholarship that covers me staying here. So I'm grateful for whatever housing I have.
College Freshman,4,It is such a great experience. Everyone wears their school gear and is ready to go when the games begin
College Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere here. I can't wait to continue schooling here.
College Sophomore,4,Title IX is super supportive and helpful
College Sophomore,4,I love Kendall. Deacon is spacious but not clean
College Freshman,4,"Greek life gives a certain vitality to campus, and they give the student body means to come together and interact with each other."
College Freshman,4,The fan support at this time school are some of the best I have ever seen. The students really care about coming out and supporting their fellow peers.
College Freshman,4,Over half of school emails are about job oppertunities and internships. They are very effective of helping students finding jobs and internships for during the school year or over the summer. The quality of them helping students is very high and almost guaranteed you will get a job or internship.
College Freshman,4,Each greek organization has members that think strongly of their group and a lot of die hard fans. The greek life is very involved all over campus and is very effective when it comes to getting the word out about the certain events they hold for everybody.
College Freshman,4,Over 75% of the students that attend this small college are college athletes. The fan base is very strong and each sport supports each other. Each sport on this campus has very high quality players and each has high expectations for their play and academics.
College Freshman,4,My first year experience at college is great so far and I enjoy it. My school is very small and you pretty much know everyone and it is like one big family. The downside to my college is that it is private and more expensive than others. I would choose my school again because I enjoy playing soccer here and the class room sizes are small and makes one on one experiences happen often.
College Freshman,4,"Due to the size of my school, everyone knows everyone else.  It's a big family almost.  The town the college is in, is outstanding and reminds me of home.  All the sporting events are fun as well.  And the teachers are great.  They are very interactive with all students, and I personally find them all pretty funny as well.  And my school is really easy to get around as well.  It is a perfect fit for me."
College Sophomore,4,Wesleyan Village apartments are close to campus and close to eating and shopping venues. Students are desparate to move off-campus to avoid issues in the dorm (disciplinary and poor living quarters)
College Sophomore,4,"I applied for enough scholarships to cover the expenses at KWC. Also, I received several merit based scholarships through the science department."
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of places off campus to eat the only real problem is that they don't stay open late.
College Freshman,4,I love the majority of my classes and feel like the work is understandable. My teachers are always ready to help.
College Freshman,4,"The security are all very friendly and willing to help. I feel completely safe on campus and don't worry about theft, rape, etc."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of unique people at this school and everyone gets along pretty well.
College Freshman,4,"I've lived In Owensboro almost my whole life so I know good things to do off campus, which allows my friends and I to always be active. Most activities require the weather to be good though."
College Freshman,4,The weather is usually pretty good and we hardly ever have major issues with it.
College Freshman,4,"KWC isn't the strictest of schools, but they do care about students safety and will carry out punishments if certain rules are broken. But no one's mean about it, just respect them and they'll respect you."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is very secure, and close to a top 100 hospital."
College Freshman,4,"Excellent music, and biology programs. Offers zoology"
College Freshman,4,"Very cost effective, and close to classes."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very accepting to all diversity.
College Freshman,4,Everything is done very fairly.
College Sophomore,4,Owensboro is a fun safe place. 
College Sophomore,4,"There are almost always computers available. The printing and copying is a problem, it can be rather expensive. "
College Sophomore,4,It's cheap and there are almost always spots available. 
College Sophomore,4,There are tons of restaurants to choose from and they are located pretty close to campus. 
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy the weather in KY. 
College Junior,4,"Owensboro, KY is a very beautiful little town with access to a riverside park, delicious family owned restaurants, and live music venues to enjoy."
College Freshman,4,The dining hall and subconnection is easy to get to and is available throughout the week. It's the weekend that you have to be careful because the schedules change. The cooks in the dining hall are really nice and are very good at what they do. The dining hall always tries to have new options everyday and you can tell them what you think of them on their website or in the opinions box.
College Freshman,4,"People are really nice in the dorms, at least at Peebles anyway. The size of the dorms are decent, they aren't too small like you'd find at Western Kentucky. "
College Freshman,4,"Though KWC population is mainly science majors, there are plenty of opportunities for English majors as well."
College Freshman,4,Owensboro is a vibrant city with a riverfront that has lots of activities and there's quite a few opportunities for students off campus.
College Freshman,4,Small campus-lots of athletic events & nice people
College Freshman,4,It's small and a very friendly environment. 
College Freshman,4,Facilities are nice & free student Y membership 
College Freshman,4,The steps are clearly stated
College Junior,4,Athletics are really big at KWC. Our schools athletes all hang around campus together and a lot of them even have the same classes. They condition and exercise pretty frequently early in the mornings. The are absolutely respected around campus! :)
College Junior,4,"At KWC, I am very satisfied with the way the CIS professors conduct classes. They make sure we have plenty of power point slides and extra notes to study from. The course work is plenty busy but they provide tutors for anything that we may not understand"
College Junior,4,The professors and advisors at KWC are the best! They are always there to answer questions or help solve any problems I may have. They are always willing to help and they will make sure you succeed as their greatest task.
College Sophomore,4,"Registration process was easy, curriculum is pretty good, they have some unique study options."
College Junior,4,"It is college, so alcohol and some drugs are there. However, the school does a good job of keeping it off of our dry campus. It is hardly noticeable unless you're looking specifically for it."
College Sophomore,4,"Wesleyan has a gorgeous campus and is nestled right in the middle of the town, it's easy to get there from anywhere!"
College Freshman,4,I feel relatively safe here.  My only problem is the campus is very open and people can come and walk their dogs or ride their bike here.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many different minorities and different backgrounds There is not any problems between races and there are many African Americans on campus. There is always international students on campus from Australia and China. There are people of different religion, political and economic backgrounds and many openly gays on campus. With no problems"
College Sophomore,4,MAny people on campus are in Greek life and many enjoy it they also have a lot of different activites for students
College Sophomore,4,"Plenty of Choices – KWC is right off Frederica, which is basically the main drag of Owensboro.  There are plenty of choices there, and if you get sick of those, you can take the by-pass out to Hwy 54 for even more choices.  I hardly ever eat on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Mostly White, but Not Too Much So. A majority of students are white, but it is not such a huge difference that minority students feel uncomfortable or overpowered.  We're also a small enough school that everyone gets to know each other pretty easily, especially within your major or department."
College Freshman,4,"A Head Above the Rest – I feel like Wesleyan excels in every area, but also has room to improve. The academic programs here are amazing, and there are lots of practicums and internships offered. We try to be prepared for every aspect of real life, and I think it's the completeness of the education that makes Wesleyan stand out."
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene is non-existent at KWC. Drinking and beer pong does occur nightly in the dorms, but the parties happen at the Wesleyan Village apartments, right across the street from campus. (they are considered off-campus, so students are allowed to drink.)"
College Sophomore,2,Campus housing is overpriced and underquality!
College Sophomore,2,"I am an athlete and my team is kind of for fun and not taken seriously. Other sports are big on campus and attended by a lot of people. Intramurals are okay, but mainly for the Greeks. "
College Sophomore,2,There is no school transportation. But there are public buses students can use and almost everything is in a short distance. 
College Sophomore,2,I live at home with my parents. Campus housing is expensive and not great buildings. 
College Freshman,2,you can only live off campus if you're 21
College Sophomore,2,"No One Uses Them. We have plenty of computers to use around campus, mostly PCs, and a (dated) Mac lab in the arts/communications building, but pretty much everyone has their own laptop.  WiFi is kind of slow, but most of the time, you don't have much trouble with it."
College Freshman,2,"There's Nothing to Do – Owensboro iS a small town, its near a big city called Bowling Green there's a little more to do in Bowling Green but there's nothing to do on or off Kentucky Wesleyan's campus."
College Senior,2,"The comuter labs at Kentucky Wesleyan College are far too few. The computers themselves are okay and work well. However,it is normal to go into the labs and not see any available comuters. The school only has two computerlabs in the student center and each lab has about 15 computers. The printing is great and free. I do recommend getting a personal computer if you are to attend Kentucky Wesleyan College."
College Junior,2,It depends on what you study. A lot of times I do not feel challenged enough. I sometimes think that high school was easier then college. If you want to be challenged go somewhere else
College Sophomore,1,"There is no accountability for students to follow the rules and no accountability for RAs to enforce the rules. For underage drinking violations, students only get community service. But greeks and athletes get special treatment."
College Sophomore,1,"You must be 21 to live off campus, no matter what your GPA is or how any scholarships you have. I think it is a terrible decision to try to keep students on campus until they are 21. "
College Sophomore,1,"I've only eaten in the dining hall once, but it was so disgusting, I'll never eat there again.  When we had our Oak & Ivy ceremony, which is a very prestigious honor for our seniors, the dining hall staff catered and it was horrible.  If that's their FANCY food, I'd hate to see their every day food!  Subco is alright, just a simple sandwich station.  Jazzman's is my favorite coffee shop.  I'd pick them over Starbucks any day.  Their hours suck though."
College Sophomore,1,"Too Hard to Live Off Camus! There are plenty of great, affordable off-campus options but KWC makes it way to hard to live off-campus!  They have a hundred and one rules about who can live off campus and some of them are just too much."
College Sophomore,1,"The college has a dry campus policy and those in charge of enforcing it can sometimes take it too far.  I recently witnessed an entire group of students written up and assigned service hours for ""having alcohol"" because the RD saw them carrying a cooler (which was full of Coca-Cola, no alcohol).  One student, who lived in the room the cooler was brought into but was not present at the time of the incident, was written up as well.  Most of the time, if you're not causing trouble or harm, they won't say anything, but occasionally, they like to create trouble where it doesn't exist and pin it on students."
College Senior,1,Buses Are a Bad Option – I have took the public transportation once. It was too expensive and not time efficent. At Kentucky Wesleyan College you either need a car or a friend with a car. Hardly any of the students use the public transportation.
College Senior,1,Horrible Dinning Room and Horrible Food Service Employees – The average meal plan that most students get is the 12 meals a week. I believe this is because the food in the cafeteria is horrible.  The only vegitarian options is the salad bar( which is the same everday). Most students recieve $200 in flex that can be used at Subconnection or Jazzmans coffee shop. Most of the cafeteria workers have a horrible attitude and are mean if you ask for seconds. The Subconnection employees have the worst  attitude I have ever seen.

Senior,5,It is affordable for a 4 year institution. Most of the professors are relatable and easy to get along with. Their math department is fantastic and the engineering lab techs are a jewel.
Alum,5,"I am so grateful for the two years I spent at MSU, which shaped me into a prepared English and Film Studies student for Graduate School. There are several really good professors in the English department who go the extra mile to shape their students into more knowledgeable human beings. I highly recommend this school for committed people."
Alum,5,"Because MSU's English department offers so many online classes, I was able to complete my Bachelor's degree as a single mom. I am forever appreciative to my professors who shaped my education. I loved MSU Denver, and you can ride the train right to campus from many surrounding cities!"
Junior,5,"Metro State University of Denver is an excellent school. It is extremely inclusive, accommodating, and progressive. I have not had  a single negative experience with a professor, grading issue, or had to have a professor I did not like. They truly have the best staff, and care deeply about their students. The advisors, peer mentors, and faculty go out of their way to support and educate students. The clinic on campus offers a variety of health services, the campus itself is a safe, diverse, and friendly environment, and the learning resources available to students are outstanding."
Alum,5,"I loved the small town feel of Metro and loved the small class sizes. Even though the University is in the middle of downtown Denver, once on campus I felt like I was at my small community college back home. The professors were personable and always ready to support you during after hours needs. The teaching program was engaging and gave me the knowledge and skills I needed to be a professional licensed teacher."
Sophomore,5,"I love learning here. They've handled the shift to online learning in the middle of a pandemic and social unrest rather well, actually. I've been able to both learn and keep my grades up. Everyone in Denver should consider this college."
Sophomore,5,"they're doing a great job, across the board. They've handled the unusual circumstances of 2020 very well, in my opinion."
Senior,5,"Class sizes are small and professors are easy to access. Discussions become more intimate and the structure makes for an excellent learning experience. The student portal is easy to access and the relative uniformity of the class formatting makes online classes doable, yet challenging. For students that work and / or have families, this is the way to go. The wide variety of online classes available makes the online experience a viable option for busy people."
Senior,5,"Metro State is a diverse, and personal college experience. Located in the heart of Downtown Denver, Metro State offers a wide variety of cultural experiences. The college has smaller class sizes, so professors get to know you on a more personal level. The student body is active and very diverse and inclusive of people from all backgrounds."
Niche User,5,My mom did most of her classes online and I remember while she would type up her essays I would work on my third grade homework from across her table. It also really helped when I was diagnosed with Heart Failure she was able to take care of me and still get some of her work done.
Alum,5,"A well connected university in the heart of downtown denver, don't mistake it for a simple community college. Metro has so much to offer it's students, and loves to see them succeed. If you go here, make sure to venture out! You may find yourself surprised by what this school has to offer you."
Freshman,5,Metropolitan State University is a very diverse and inclusive campus. So far everyone that works for the campus and the students are kind and outgoing making me as a freshman feel safe and wanted.
Junior,5,"Professors at MSU Denver care about their students' education. My first classes at MSU were during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result, I've taken both in-person and online courses at MSU. I personally prefer in person for most college classes as they are more engaging than online. With online classes at MSU, there are two types, synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous classes meet at the same time with a live lecture and are priced (at this time) the same as in-person classes. Asynchronous classes have no set meeting time and are priced as online classes. Taking the synchronous classes I find is better for an enriching education than the asynchronous classes, as you interact with the professor in real time."
Graduate Student,5,I recently graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver this spring with my bachelor's degree in hospitality management. I loved this program because they had small classes and teachers actually cared about you as a student. I never thought I would miss school and the teachers that are in it. I got excited to go to campus and learn more about what I am passionate about. It was such a fun and comfortable environment that participation was so easy.
Sophomore,5,"I have been pleased with Metro ever since the start of attending and I am looking forward to continuing the pursuit of my college education with them. All my professors have been helpful and supportive, especially during the recent transition of moving classes online unexpectedly. My professors and overall school was there to help regardless of the circumstances."
Sophomore,5,"I took four classes online, all of which exceeded my expectations and eased my nervousness with the abrupt and unexpected change. All my professors did their best and were always available to help with any questions or concerns, making me feel supported and cared for during uncertain times."
Senior,5,Metro is a great school with great teachers and students.  It has an affordable price and great education
Senior,5,They transitioned very well and helped the students as much as they could through this corona virus pandemic
Niche User,5,"I haven't been to college yet because I've just graduated high school, But I've visited it and I'm very excited to attend there next fall."
Sophomore,5,As a 2nd year student at Metropolitan State University-Denver I would love to start out by saying I love this college!! It is completely affordable while also providing quality education. I have never had University staff care so much about me and my education.  I love how we are a community who strive for excellence together! This college offers diversity as well as educational programs that help you succeed.
Freshman,5,"MSU is a great college for those who want to attend a university at a low cost. The staff is amazing at Metro, the campus is beautiful and I have had no issues at this school at all!"
Senior,5,Metro is an amazing school that offers so many opportunities for students from any background. Diversity and success of students are highly prioritized at this school.
Sophomore,5,"I love the diverse community that make up the student body on campus! There are so many people from different towns, states, and even countries! On top of this, each person sports a myriad of interests, classes, and work experience. Students are very ambitious at this campus, which allows you to surround yourself with people who strive to be the very best at whatever they apply themselves to. Ultimately this pushes you to challenge what you know, defend what you believe in, and in the end, make you a better person."
Niche User,5,"I like the affordable, easy going, and helpful resources Metro has been able to offer to their wide range of students. They adjust everything to around your needs and wants."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love attending MSU Denver.  They are transparent when it comes to communication, they have so many resources that you can use, MSU Denver is very diverse which I really appreciate, and everything is easy to access."
Freshman,5,"I get to know Metro State when I first saw it a couple of months ago. I remember meeting the school professors and other students who were here as a great experience. I also view their study abroad program which is neat whereas a student, you can travel around the world as a fun thing to do with other students."
Senior,5,"I love the program I’m in, I have met a lot of great friends and mentors in my time here and I believe I am receiving a quality education that will leave me prepared for a career after I graduate."
Graduate Student,5,Metropolitan State University of Denver has been such a great place for me to grow and learn. I am very lucky to have graduated from a school that has been so helpful with me financially and giving me the best education. I couldn't have done it without my professors and MSU Denver's staff. I highly recommend this college to anyone.
Niche User,5,"Very safe and small campus, in a big city! Tons of opportunities for classes, majors, and jobs. There are very nice people here too."
Freshman,5,Very diverse culture on campus. All classes have small class sizes allowing the teachers to be more effective. Many many resources available to all for free to ensure success. Failure is only a choice here. Many options for food for all
Junior,5,"The ability to take so many classes online and build my own schedule has been phenomenal! My teachers have been very communicative and supportive in my learning as a student, not to mention their availability and openness to help me when I have questions. Even taking online classes, I feel engaged with my teachers and other students and it has positively impacted my learning."
Junior,5,I like the location and low cost when enrolled. The class sizes are small and teacher interact well with students. What I don’t like is that they changed that after 12 credit hours it was free. Now you pay for all credit hours being taken. They also don’t really take into account that this is a committee school and when weather is super bad that they keep the school open. Over a good school but there are a few things that need to be changed. My program of social work is a great program for the type of school that it is.
Alum,5,My college experience at Metropolitan State University of Denver was very good! I had quite a few great professors who are really passionate about their jobs and loved the subjects they taught. They made sure they taught the content well for the students to understand the subject and succeed in the course. This provided me with a lot of motivation to work harder towards my goal to be a Physician's Assistant.
Sophomore,5,It was fairly easy to access all of the information needed. Advisors are very helpful and the student board is also a huge help. The campus is diverse in culture and ethnicities it's great to see different faces in a metro environment campus.
Freshman,5,"I love Metropolitan State University of Denver because of how welcomed I feel by the professors, and my peers are super nice. It’s nice seeing such a diverse group of students at this college. Everything about this college is great."
Senior,5,"My experience at MSU Denver has been great.  The campus is in the middle of downtown Denver, so it is convenient to commute.  There is light rail access and RTD access on campus.  The parking on campus is difficult and expensive for students like myself that have to drive most days.  The campus has close access to resturants, entertainment, and activities.  MSU is also a very diverse campus.  Academically, I have been impressed with my professors.  Many of my Biology and Chemistry professors have worked in the fields that they are teaching.  This brings a lot of real world knowledge and guiedence to the students.  Overall, I have had a great experience at MSU Denver."
Junior,5,"MSU Denver is a Fabulous school! There is a great amount of majors students can pick from that include basic or extended majors as well as minors. The staff is very involved and care a lot about the success of students, along with the school advisers. The student life is vivid given the location of the school in Downtown Denver where there is also a wide diversity among the students as well as the staff. A big issue that is seen across the country is how expensive school can be; MSU Denver has a financial aid office that allows for walk-ins at any time and gives great help with any financial questions that students may have. Not only is there financial aid, but the school is affordable to many students. MSU Denver is a great school for anyone!"
Senior,5,"MSU hase been great! I transferred after attending a Community College, and had no issues with the help of the staff. Great experience and will continue at this school for my masters program!"
Sophomore,5,"Ever since the thought of college entered my mind, I’ve only had MSU Denver in mind. Now that I’ve been there for 2 years I love it even more. I love the environment, the diverse classrooms with professors who are understanding, helpful, and most of all, care about your education."
Sophomore,5,"The university is very diverse thus very welcoming for all students, so far my classes feel fulfilling and the professors are well versed in their subjects and seem enthusiastic to teach. Some shortcomings the school includes are slow or unavailable wifi in some buildings although this seems to be a problem throughout other buildings in the Auraria campus, another issue is the parking charges are high so you're more inclined to use public transportation."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school, because my major is Psychology and their program for it has multiple different topics that are fascinating. There isn't a doubt that these topics won't be insightful for the future. Overall pricing for receiving such education is quite cheap compared to others like for example, Colorado State University. Student diversity is very high, as well. However, the only thing Metropolitan can improve on is their Financial Aid Program. Because, unfortunately, they don't ensure that the student hires that have on staff push through paperwork when they should and sometimes misinform students about loans and other financial-related procedures."
Freshman,5,"Great commuter-college experience. There are tons of on campus clubs/sports teams, you are also enrolled in university insurance which is included in your tuition if you take 9+ hours a semester. The prpfessors I've had so far genuinely seem to care about teaching, and the campus has lots of green space AND a brewery!"
Sophomore,5,Classes are close together and the campus is easy to walk around to get to classes.  Transportation to the school is very easy and convenient from all areas of Denver.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the music program. If you are into performing arts, it’s a great school for that. There isn’t a football team, which I don’t mind but others do and there aren’t any parties at all since you can’t actually live on campus."
Freshman,5,"as a freshman I love this campus and staff. The classes are challenging, however the professors provide all the education needed to ace the class. Campus itself is awesome and the staff are equally as great."
Niche User,5,Metropolitan State University is a good place to go to College because they have a lot of things that can help you to persevere and is a safe space
Junior,5,"Metro has been amazing in all regards, specifically price and class selection. The teachers are also very engaged and helpful"
Freshman,5,Going to Metropolitan State University of Denver I like how the campus is in downtown Denver. I like the environment of the campus. One thing I would change is the parking because it can get expensive. They should have a parking ticket available to purchase instead of paying to park in the garage.
Freshman,5,Msudenver create great environment with campus service that all students. Including that which its connected to the other two Universities as well with Colorado state University of Denver and Community College  of Denver. All 3 is called the Aururia Campus and it creates that all campus is quite diverse communities and lives in the downtown area which brings students all together.
Freshman,5,"The people that you work with all really great and they make the college experience great! It is also in the middle of downtown around everything, which is really convenient."
Senior,5,"I was a transfer student from a junior college in Southern IL. I was hesitant on the move and how I would adjust, but it has overall been an excellent experience. They help transfer students adapt and get involved in student activities on campus. The teachers have been outstanding as well. Also, who doesn't like low cost college and being able to live in the beautiful state of Colorado."
Freshman,5,As a new coming student the amount of resources that this university provides is outstanding. Amazing scenery for being downtown Denver.
Sophomore,5,"I am enrolled at the Detroit Institute of Music Education extension of MSU Denver and if you have dreams or aspirations about making your career centered around music, this place is the best there is at giving you the tools and knowledge you need to give yourself the best chance of being able to do what you love and being successful as well. The professors and staff are true professionals and have helped me every step of the way to better my craft (drums) and become disciplined and well-versed in the inner-workings of the music industry and how to adapt to its demanding and unrelenting nature. So far I’ve been able to play live shows all around metro Detroit with my fellow students, attend various festivals, shows, and masterclasses, and experience playing and recording in a professional studio setting with professional studio musicians."
Senior,5,"I love almost everything. The professors talk to you like an equal. Classes are challenging but professors are compassionate. The parking isn't great and you have to pay for it, but there is are three light rails that take you right to campus. Since it is downtown, there are many job opportunities within biking/walking/busing distance."
Niche User,5,"Metro is a beautiful school with a lot of people and diversity,  but if you are not involved on campus by being in an organization, receiving tutoring or using other resources it is easy to drop out or lose interest in classes because they help motivate students."
Sophomore,5,"It will be my first semester at MSU Denver, but so far is has been very amazing. The orientation was very helpful and informative. I was struggling a little with some financial aid stuff and scholarships, but I got a lot of help at the office of Immigration Services. Right now there is nothing I can suggest they improve because I haven’t had much experience. But if they keep doing what they are doing so far, there might not be much to improve."
Niche User,5,What I like about MSU Denver is that it is in the heart of downtown Denver. Which means that it is pretty centralised for students from the surrounding suburbs of Denver. The one thing that I would like improved is the amount of parking available to students and staff.
Junior,5,"The Metropolitan State University of Denver is a great university. They offer budget friendly tuition, a diverse community of staff and students, as well as provide a at-home feel in the heart of Denver."
Freshman,5,I like how everyone is there for the same purpose of learning. I always meet someone is also interested in a major or knows something studying the same major as I. I would like to see more awareness about our athletic programs because I didn't  know about all the sports teams we have
Freshman,5,I had great experience as an international student so far. I got big support and immediate answers to my emails.
Freshman,4,"I managed to learn so many new things, especially about history, it learned things I never would have imagined learning before, and I learned new philosophies and new ways of seeing life. Honestly I am actually enjoying what I am learning, which is something I can't really say about my other schools."
Freshman,4,"I've been going to metro for my first college semester and so far it has been really great, the staff are really great and helpful and the teachers try their best to work with you, it has been hard doing school through online classes but it has been made easier by the helpful teachers and staff."
Junior,4,"For the most part, they've done a good job of transitioning to online. Things were a little rough when it happened in the middle of the spring semester, but fall semester has gone fine."
Junior,4,"Overall, it's pretty good. Two light rail stations on campus make getting there easy enough. Parking would be better if there was some sort of pass."
Senior,4,"When the pandemic struck, it was a rough take off, but for the most part, it has been good since. I recommend metro for working professionals or people who don't want to be in student loan hell."
Junior,4,"Amid the pandemic, many classes were transferred to an online format. The professors had done an amazing job making this change mid-semester. I did have one class which was fully online, and the professor did a poor job presenting the material, and was completely unreachable. But, that is the only one who seemed to have any issues. Everyone else did a wonderful job."
Alum,4,I only took a couple of online courses and had no issues with them over the course of my time at Metro.
Alum,4,"I only took a few classes online but the teachers seemed to do well in the classes, I felt that I got my credits worth in online classes."
Alum,4,"Metro was a great college as a non-traditional student I could really tell that my professors really wanted me to succeed and adjusted their help specifically for me and my needs, and found new ways to explain complex problems."
Sophomore,4,"My experience in Metropolitan State University of Denver has been great, I like how they work as a team, and help students to feel like it's their home. There always try to help students in that specific area where they need most help. Metro is a university where they motivate you to keep trying hard and give the best of you."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with online classes was very good, with this pandemic I had to finish my courses online. Honestly I don't like taking online courses but this semester my professors work really hard to manage well their time and help us with our learning. They were always trying to emails us if everything was going good. I use Teams to have my online classes and communicate with my professors, at the end I finish well my courses."
Senior,4,"During these unprecedented  times, Metro has done a great job in switching things over to online while ensuring that their students still get the most out of their classes. My professors were flexible and creative in this new way of teaching and did their best to help their students remotely"
Senior,4,"I love this school. The professors have been wonderful, I enjoy the smaller class sizes, and I feel like I've received a high quality education and skills I can take to my graduate program without the financial burden I would have received elsewhere"
Niche User,4,While growing up my mom went to metro and I remember when she couldn't find a babysitter for one of her teachers let me sit in on her class. At that moment I knew I wanted to go to college.  It might also be that they had a cupcake food truck and me a 8 year fell in love.
Alum,4,"Although I did not take any online classes, I know students that did, and they enjoyed their experience. I did taker a few hybrid classes, and those were excellent."
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student in my second semester at MSU Denver. I am only taking online classes so I can't speak for the students in traditional classrooms; however, I have had positive interactions with faculty."
Freshman,4,"I personally have never been a fan of online schooling. But in the mist of this pandemic is something we have all have had to adapt to, Metro has definitely it as easy as possible to keep classes going as normal as possible."
Junior,4,Professors are amazing and care about their students' education. Administration and Financial Aid can be a pain to deal with as it's fronted with Workstudy students rather than full-time faculty.
Junior,4,Fairly easy courses! Online classes are very bland and hard to pay attention to. In person classes are much better!
Sophomore,4,"Great school. Lots of activities on campus and lots of events that give away free stuff like cultural events or food events where food is given out free. Large, well- kept campus right in the heart of downtown Denver. Good academics. One thing I would change are the classroom sizes. They are kind of small and there are a lot of people crammed into a small space. Great library with many resources."
Sophomore,4,"very diverse, in the middle f the city where you are surrounded by everything and you can just go out to all these places"
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very beautiful. Most professors are really helpful and are willing to work with the students to help them out. The student services such as the financial aid offices, the bio and chemistry department are occupied with informed and knowledgable employees who assist students efficiently.The students are cooperative and willing to work in groups. Overall, I don't regret ever choosing Metropolitan."
Freshman,4,"At first, the team helping me choose my first semester classes were not extremely helpful. They helped choose some gen eds and such, but did not answer many questions. After that, it was smooth sailing. Professors are nice and give you enough information to contact them. Classes are interesting and diverse, even the gen eds. From what I have heard, it is one of few schools that have a women in history class. The LGBTQ+ carpenter always has friendly staff and good events. Multiple places for food and constant deals in the library."
Freshman,4,"What i like about this college is just that its open to everyone, never felt like i was in danger, really close to home and easy to get there, one thing i would like to see change is that the dorms, make them more experience and opened."
Sophomore,4,"Metro is a great school! I chose Metro because of it's affordability compared to many other universities in Colorado.  Many of the professors are great and really care about your success; there are also tons of resources that even I myself haven't taken advantage of.  The only downside (or upside, depends on how you view it) is that it is a commuter school.  There is not necessarily a ""life on campus"" as there aren't even any dorms on campus itself.  This makes it harder to stay involved."
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student this year and so far I am really enjoying it here. The professors seem very knowledgeable on what they are teaching, also they care about how you perform in class! At my previous university I was just a number to them and they never knew my name."
Junior,4,"Commuter school, bad wifi, buildings are old. There is no dedicated nursing building. Professors really depend on who you get. The financial aid office isn't really helpful if you don't qualify for financial need. Not much mentorship. I like how friendly it is in general compared to CU denver"
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the overall atmosphere of this school and I love most of the teachers there! There are a wide range of classes to take and plenty that are wonderfully interesting. Financial Aid and payment are difficult to work with. They advertise as a cheap school, and to a point they are. However I struggled a lot with their financial aid office, as they do verification from time to time, and they lost my paperwork! It was such a hassle."
Senior,4,Great commuter school for working students. Plenty of degree options and on campus engagement. In the heart of Denver. Would highly recommend.
Sophomore,4,I have really enjoyed the professors and the classes. The professors are very engaging and want you to learn.
Freshman,4,I enjoy metro because of the diversity and kind faculty. I love the campus and as apart of the athletic programs we have very nice facilities. Love getting  one on one with professors.  I hope it continues to grow as a community and gets better academically and athletically. Happy to be a roadrunner.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love MSU Denver and have enjoyed the pasted year and a half I have spent there. I love being in Denver and there's always something going on. It has amazing professors who understand that most student don't have a lot of money and have to work in order to afford to go to school and are willing to work with these students. Since it is a commuter university there are people from ages 18 to 50 and all have different view points which makes class discussions more interesting. We have a good basketball team, but no football. Also, student living is okay, but not great and if you're looking for a party school this is not the school for you."
Freshman,4,MSU Denver provides an inviting environment for working students. I would highly recommend attending here if you are trying to focus on a true education outside of the party college life. If you need more one on one with professors this is great for you. The classrooms are smaller for a university in which professors can be more focused on individual students learning. If you do want a social life Metro is still great for you. There are two other major campuses that are shared with Metro. This is a great way for you to meet different people on campus.
Junior,4,I believe MSU is a great college to study at due to the fact there are excellent professors and it is financially convenient. It also offers a great diversity of students from all over the place. Not only it is reasonably priced but it is also located in downtown Denver where one is able to appreciate the city views.
Sophomore,4,"I love the environment of Downtown Denver, and with the campus sitting in the middle of it makes it very enjoyable to be at everyday. Parking is very difficult and expensive."
Sophomore,4,"Nice size classes, professors are available amd will work with you.  Good value, good education & good reputation and a good price."
Senior,4,"Usually everyone is there to help one out. There are multiple resources there to help you out. There are tutors, financial aid help, counslers, advisors and much much more."
Junior,4,"I enjoyed the structure of the campus. So far, I have not had an issue with any of my classes being too far apart from each other. They also make it easy to see what credits I have and what classes I still need to take. 

I did have a lot of issues when it came to communication with the financial department when I was petitioning to get in-state tuition, and after months of going back and forth, I wasn't granted in-state tuition, which is unfortunate."
Freshman,4,"I attend the DIME program in Detroit but it is still a good school. The staff is kind and caring of the students and their situations personal, financial, and academically."
Junior,4,Great teachers! Lowest cost possible for a college degree in Colorado. Available class schedules cater to real life working people of all ages who have work/family/kid obligations outside of school as well as traditional college students. Very divers population. Down side- parking sucks. Over all great school!
Freshman,4,"I found this school to be a good initial input into college life. Because I did not live close to the university, I had to rent an apartment and live in the heart of the city. Though that part was difficult, I believe that the education I am earning is worth it. The instructors seem very dedicated in to making sure their students succeed and do their best to provide them opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"I truly do love this school, when I am on this campus I had feel at home while also being in the heart of Downtown Denver. While I was looking for schools I hadn't heard about it but when I was a senior one of my teachers told me that for the degree I want to get and where I want to go this might be the ideal place without having to pay a lot out of pocket. I am glad my teacher had told me about this place because I can't going to a different campus and liking it as much as I do with this one."
Junior,4,"I like the Auraria campus, there is so much diversity and so many people to meet. There are also plenty of resources for students."
Sophomore,4,I like that the people that work there are very helpful.  The people that work in the access center are very nice and very helpful.  One thing that can be changed is not having all the homeless everywhere on the campus.
Senior,4,It is a great school but becoming crowded. The diversity use to include more working adults but has now become more focused on the youth which is great but is a distraction from those of us that are older and more serious about our education.
Senior,4,I like this school very much. I would like to see more hands on experience to have experience for future jobs.
Freshman,4,"I have been at Metro for about a year now. I enjoy that I have the option to take night and online classes that work around my work schedule. The best thing about taking evening classes, are that the class size is a lot smaller. The only thing I would change is, finding tutoring on campus was made easier."
Junior,4,"Metropolitan State University of Denver has amazing resources! The campus is very diverse and if students go out of their way for help they will receive it. I have made many friends on my campus! The academics can have a little more work, but overall I've been having a good experience."
Sophomore,4,"The school has a really good community on a huge beautiful campus. Since it’s in the middle of downtown, the security isn’t as great as some, but they do what they can."
Junior,4,"Metro is a fun and lively campus; however, it is shared with CCD and CU Denver so parking is a bit of an issue. Metro accommodates this by adding a RTD (bus or train pass) to your tuition bill,if you have on campus classes. Be mindful about dates, things move quickly at this campus so triple check dates and emails. Over all it's a wonderful campus that provides a wide range of clubs, events, and services for all students."
Freshman,4,"I am sophomore at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. metro located in downtown along with the University of Colorado Denver and Community College of Denver, so everything is close to the campus.  the campus is really nice, diverse, and have a beautiful view so I highly recommend Metropolitan State University of Denver to all students"
Sophomore,4,Metro State is a great college to attend especially for in-state students! It is affordable and it is a super fun campus to be at! There are plenty of student activities and events to partake in which helps relieve some stress from our college life. I recommend Metro State!
Senior,4,"Metro is a commuter college right in the middle of downtown Denver. Beautiful campus with everything you need. Some buildings could use an update, but most are ok. Smaller class sizes and very diverse."
Freshman,4,"Personally, I liked Metro's small classroom sizes. You receive a more one on one or personalized learning experience, as opposed to a ""normal"" college or university where you would be packed in an auditorium and the teacher never learns your name. The other thing that is caught my eye was the tuition pricing. Their prices are affordable to gain an education. One main thing that I didn't like was the heavy foot traffic throughout the day."
Senior,4,"The value with this university is what is key. It is the most affordable university in the state. It is important to understand that it might not have the best amenities or community, but it is considered a commuter campus. The value you get from the price and the fact that the students that are there actually want to learn and attend. I do not care very much about football, but the basketball team does not get much attention since it is D2."
Sophomore,4,"So I have been visiting Metropolitan State University of Denver quite often. I started my studies at the Community College of Aurora, and believed transferring to Metro would be the best option for me to further endeavor my academics. I recently attended orientation and found the staff and students to be very friendly and organized. So far I have no complaints about this school and I’m so excited to start in the fall!"
Junior,4,"I love the academics at this university. The professors really strive to prepare you for the job that you are seeking. The student life is also very big on this campus; you will find almost anything to get into there! Overall, great university!"
Freshman,4,"So far so good. The teachers I had this past semester were awesome. Use RateMyProfessor.com before signing up for a class. I didn't, but I lucked out mostly so. This school is safe and inexpensive compared to other universities which is awesome. I am definitely going to finish my bachelor here."
Freshman,4,"I love metro, its a very diverse place and overall love the atmosphere. I am really in love with the art department."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed going to Metro in Denver. Have had great professors and good classmates. Also, nice to be on campus and see all that Denver has to offer. Its affordable for students paying their own education versus other schools. Lastly administration is very helpful."
Junior,2,"My only experience with online classes at MSU Denver has been as a result of the coronavirus epidemic. The college was obviously not prepared for such a transition, so the classes have been somewhat disorganized. I'm sure if it was set up to be online in the first place, it would be much better."
Alum,2,'Blackboard' is an archaic e-Learning platform. No one should be using that garbage system. It is NOT user-friendly AT ALL.
Freshman,2,"I do not like Metro, the campus us really crowded and homeless people hangout all over campus. They have a lot of food options on campus which is nice. It is really hard to make friends on campus though."
Senior,2,The student services especially TRIO SSS are a joke. They are very discriminate. They say they love to help students but they don’t. They just care for student money. Cheap schoo comes with sucks student services. I am the victim of this school. People are nice on campus but the school being run by bunch of idiot.
College Junior,2,"There a lot of cops down on the actual campus, but for most students they are walking through downtown to get to campus at all different times of the day and it can get uncomfortable sometimes."
College Freshman,2,I have only heard once about Greek life and I have never seen anything they do for our community nor do I ever see parties.
College Freshman,2,The sporting events are rarely advertised nor are there any pep rallies its very difficult to attend a sport.
College Senior,2,I couldn't even name one sorority or fraternity on campus...
College Junior,2,"I lived on campus for my freshman year at Metro and it was miserable. The dorms are terrible, the staff let you have like no freedom, and they charge you way too much for what you get."
College Freshman,2,not really many options for on-campus housing.
College Freshman,2,We don't have a Greek life in our school because we are a commute university. There is no student housing for that.
College Freshman,2,not very friendly or aprochable
College Junior,2,"The campus housing always smells heavily of weed, and there are a lot of room break-ins. Management is terrible."
College Junior,2,MSU Denver is a joke. The professors offer little feedback and neglect to teach students. I have learned far more from reading books than I have from any class. The only reason I would recommend this school is because it is cheaper than other colleges in the area.
College Sophomore,2,"Being that the campus is in Denver, there are often homeless people around and people who aren't students or faculty roaming around campus as well. It makes me feel uneasy and uncomfortable walking from class to class."
College Junior,2,We don't have student housing
College Junior,2,I don't play sports so I really wouldn't know
College Sophomore,2,"MSU is a commuter college, so not much housing"
College Sophomore,2,My school is unwelcoming and there is little to no sense of community.
College Junior,2,"There isn't really a party scene. Metro is mostly a commuter campus. There is little Greek life, so there are no Frat parties either. If you want to party you have to go to CU or CSU."
College Sophomore,2,The basketball team is supposed to be really good but no one ever goes to games.
College Sophomore,2,WAY to expensive. It's just like living on campus. It's ridiculous. Also if you live off campus I promise you won't make any friends.
College Freshman,2,i had a lot of issues when applying for my aid which took me almost the entire semester to get done and in the end i still pay out of pocket more then a thousand dollars a semester because i didn't get approved for anything but loans. not only that but there was a lack of communication from the university on paper and things i needed to get the proper aid which i believe i still haven't gotten.
College Freshman,2,i don't like the campus food because i like to eat healthy which means i don't eat fast food which limits the choices i have.
College Freshman,2,The scholarships are not the best. You have to apply differently.
College Student,2,The housing isnt great. just about everyone get the off campus stuff.
College Student,2,"They cornered the market well, auraria campus. Expensive but if you are hungry well you are screwed."
College Senior,2,"The campus food is bad, I usually go off campus, to a food truck, or bring my own..  There are no healthy options and even the healthy ones are expensive or poor quality."
College Junior,2,"Due to the amount of money my parents bring in on paper, they are expected to contribute quite a bit of money toward my schooling. Unfortunately, my parents are not in a financially stable state enough to help me pay for my schooling, so each semester I struggle to cover the bill of my tuition. When I attempted to receive aid through my school, they had no options for me, leaving personal loans as my only, very undesirable option."
College Junior,2,In the middle of a city it's hard to find cheap apartments. It's easier to commute or live on campus
College Senior,2,"Everything surrounding the campus tends to be pretty expensive and hard to get into. Denver is currently going through a beautification (read: gentrification) process, but the only thing they seem interested in building are expensive apartments and penthouses. That's city life. You're better off living several miles out in a suburb and commuting in like I do. The travel time and cost is still less than a $3000 monthly rent payment."
College Junior,2,Cost is outrageous to park on campus you would rather spend the money on food
College Sophomore,2,"Parking for anything close is $6 a day, and goes down depending how far away you're willing to walk."
College Sophomore,2,"The whole campus is a dead zone. My phone is from Denver, and as a transfer student coming from Alamosa, Metro's wifi and network is a huge disappointment. I had better service and the network was better for work on my phone and laptop in Alamosa which is shocking since Metro is located almost right in the middle of the city in Denver"
College Senior,2,Not much Greek life at a commuter campus
College Junior,2,There are only two options and they are not even located on campus.
College Freshman,2,"MSU Denver is not very social, at all. If you want to make friends you have to join clubs and communities because it is hard to make friends when majority of students do not live on campus. The students both guys and girls dress pretty causally for the most part and everyone is pretty independent and I think its because most students are friends with only a few people on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The Auraria lofts and the campus village center, although nice, are so expensive it is unreal. Hence, commuter school. However they are very close to campus and if you can afford the rent then you save a lot of money on parking, gas, and transportation fees. The social atmosphere is horrible, again commuter school. There is NOWHERE to hang out and socialize. The Tivoli is overcrowded with little seating and if you can find seating it's on the floor or in a designated quiet room. Just about every person I have met on campus goes immediately home or to work after/between classes. It's Denver, so the cost of parking, rent, utilities, transportation etc. is insane. But the gym, although small and very competitive if you are trying to use the weights or a treadmill, is nice, the rock climbing wall and swimming pool are also perks. The buildings are awful to be in, making you feel like you are in a 1970's catholic horror movie with the discoloration/wear and tear. Many of the classrooms lacking technology, windows, and space. Classes are often overcrowded and the desks basically touch each other."
College Student,2,"If there was more school spirit then, sports would be better recognized."
College Student,2,"I do feel like when the snow is really bad, they should close the campus."
College Junior,2,They put a hold on my account until I pay off loan.
College Freshman,2,I can hardly walk outside most days due to smoke.
College Sophomore,2,"It's been hit or miss for myself and most people I know. I'm still struggling to fix certain issues and decided not to take out anymore financial aid (if possible). Just, a lot of delays and confusion."
College Sophomore,2,"It's really difficult on days when it snows. That's the worst (and only annoyance) I can think of. Getting to school and finding parking can be a bit of a hassle on these days. 

When it's not snowing, it's actually nice. 16th street mall is a walk-able distance away, and the Pepsi Center (a concert/sports venue) is about a ten minute walk away."
College Freshman,2,Every time I have a question it seems like the staff doesn't know what to say or do. Most of the time it feels like the staff does care.
College Student,2,Winter makes me hate being on campus because I have to walk  to my classes when it is snowing.
College Senior,2,"There is a health center but you pay an arm & a leg for it, and the service is less than stellar."
College Sophomore,2,They really don't care what goes on in campus as long as no one murders anyone.
College Sophomore,2,"They need to make sports more known. I haven't really heard much about them. This would be a great place to meet people, so they need to make it more known."
College Sophomore,2,A couple of decent places but most leave something to be desired 
College Junior,2,"When it is cold it is very miserable walking from class to class, because they are fairly far apart. Also getting to school in the winter and the snow can be very difficult for some who live far away and our campus never closes even when it should due to the outrageous weather."
College Junior,2,"There are not a lot of healthy options on campus. Most of the food is quick, sloppy, unhealthy, and most of all expensive. The dining halls have food available but its either fast food, or its food that tastes like maybe it was made yesterday. All the healthy choices are always the same they never change out the menu and they are very expensive."
College Junior,2,"There are hardly ever any spots, the cost for every half hour is $3.00. It is really expensive to park and go to school especially if you go everyday. We are already paying a fortune for our education, why do we also need to pay a fortune to be able to attend our classes on a daily basis?"
College Sophomore,2,"The food on campus is fairly affordable, but there are not many nutritious options. We have McDonalds and Taco Bell in our student union! I really hope more options are available soon."
College Junior,2,High crime area in a big city.  Campus police does what it can but it is a big city.
College Junior,2,Campus WIFI has poor reception in many parts of the library.  There are always homeless people taking up space where there is good reception it seems sometimes.
College Junior,2,we need more food places and better food
College Junior,2,it can be much better. needs to be updated and easier for students
College Junior,2,too much snow makes it hard to get there 
College Sophomore,2,Parking will cost you an arm and leg if you do not use public transportation.
Junior,1,"Terrible school. Completely de-funded my program with no prior warning or reasoning, refused to answer any questions I had about the process until they decided to set up a q&a significantly after the announcement. Displaced an entire program of students out of the blue with no clear path to earn a degree.

Additionally, during my transfer process into the school, they were completely unhelpful in answering any of my questions or working with me to get my previous credits applied to my degree. 

Overall, small minded authority, slow to answer questions and give help, little regard for the well being of their students."
Freshman,1,They didn't handle paperwork with care which led me to debt. I wouldn't suggest going here if you don't have tuition or a scholarship.
College Sophomore,1,"Again, commuter school. Only people who live on the campus village party"
College Sophomore,1,"Again, I go to a commuter school. So there isn't much night life"
College Freshman,1,Nothing is pretty the dorms are not close to campus and are not in a good spot in denver.
College Junior,1,We do not have greek life
College Freshman,1,The Regency at Metropolitan State University is overpriced and offers poor amenities.
College Freshman,1,Metropolitan State University of Denver does not have a Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,Because this is a commuter school there is no Greek Housing which makes the Greek life pretty mundane and hard to maintain becuase many students work full time on top of going to school full time
College Freshman,1,There are no  campus dorms in my campus. So I am currently not living on campus.
College Freshman,1,"There are very few if any Greek people on campus. In my two years on campus I have yet to see a sorority or fraternity. This is because there is very little social Interaction on campus.Everyone just goes to class and then goes home. Since my school doesn't offer on campus dorms, it plays a role in Greek life being virtually non-existent."
College Junior,1,Teachers neglect to teach anything of value.
College Junior,1,"There is only one sorority: Tri Sigma. Greek housing is not available. The chapter isn't very involved on campus and there are not many sorority events, partially due to the lack of funding. I am not sure if any fraternities exist."
College Junior,1,There is no school spirit.
College Sophomore,1,"Again, it's a commuter campus."
College Freshman,1,They think they are great. Expensive
College Freshman,1,"Being that the campus is located in a major city, any sort of living near campus is outrageously expensive and very hard to find. Availability lists are nearly non existent and are month long waiting lists. Parking is also incredibly expensive unless it comes with your apartment but even then it's not that great."
College Sophomore,1,There is like no presence of greek life within the auraria campus.
College Sophomore,1,"It is SO expensive to live in Denver, its not worth it"
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't a party scene, and everyone is pretty much a meth head."
College Sophomore,1,I became ineligible last year because they failed to find the graduation date on my transcript until far after the due date of scholarship applications.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus housing isn't an option, everything is several miles from campus."
College Sophomore,1,Applied for 30+ scholarships and financial aid and it's been the worst experience. Metropolitan University's financial aid office is hard to work with and I am going into my third year. They STILL have not helped with FAFSA issues.
College Freshman,1,Since I commute and don't live on campus and its typically a commuter campus it's harder to make friends and have a social life. If I did want to go have a night life I would typically go to another university or downtown Denver!
College Freshman,1,Not many options. Metro is a commuter school with very few housing options.
College Freshman,1,"Metro is a commuter school, not a school with a  lot of housing options."
College Student,1,"Its greek life, its always bad."
College Senior,1,"Aside from the handicap problem, there aren't enough spots to handle the large amount of students on campus. There are more parking garages being built, but they are far from the center of campus. The price is ridiculous for a young student (up to $30 a week). The parking attendants are shady, purposefully resetting parking meters to read as expired and issue tickets to cars. It's terrible."
College Sophomore,1,"I have not received any aid, even after applying."
College Sophomore,1,"When someone thinks of Metro, no one thinks about sports."
College Freshman,1,Most women look at me like I'm some decrepit goon.
College Freshman,1,"It just simply sucks, the staff doesn't know what they're doing. Most frustrating thing I had to do at this school, even after I had a my paper work done, and all they had to do was to plug in my number in the computer. It took multiple attempts and multiple people."
College Senior,1,Campus Village at Auraria is a total joke. Their prices are extortion of the worst kind.
College Sophomore,1,"It is mainly a commuting school, so not a lot goes on after classes"
College Sophomore,1,"When it snows, it feels like the worst thing ever. Our campus never closes, and because of the long commute from Aurora, its tiring and usually uncomfortable to have to come to school. The sidewalk is usually not too clear, and very icy. It makes me not even want to bother when the weather is bad. But when its hot and sunny, its not too bad."
College Sophomore,1,This is one of my main concerns while going to school. They don't make any information known. I don't know where to go. I think since I was a transfer student they don't feel the need to aid me in this problem.
College Freshman,1,I can't hardly ever find a parking spot that is reasonable price. It is too expensive for me to park all day and if my class is too long certain spots have time limits that will end up costing me more money when I get a ticket. 
College Junior,1,Great facilities for the athletes but nothing is available for students.
College Junior,1,Greek life is stupid and has no place in college life.
College Freshman,1,"The varsity teams are apparently excellent, but nobody knows because they are not advertised. There are no intermurauls to help students have a sense of school spirit or healthy competition. The try-outs for the varsity tea are not advertised so nobody knows when or who or anything about the sports on campus. "
College Junior,1,"Parking anywhere downtown is TERRIBLE! The parking lots that are close to campus are usually always full and outrageously expensive. The ones that are a bit further away are emptier but still expensive, and don't even think about trying to park outside of campus. It's even worse. This is why I take the bus! "
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid office at Metro have lost my paperwork many times and I cannot rely on them to send any important information to other potential colleges.
College Junior,1,"I don't think this school even has a ""nightlife."" "
College Sophomore,1,I always park at the top of the building to avoid the bs.
College Sophomore,1,There is not enough parking avaliable on campus to find a spot to park.
College Sophomore,1,There is hardly anything going on on campus in terms of extracurricular activities. I see the teams practicing on the fields sometime but for what? Nobody knows when or where the games are and there is a minuscule amount of school spirit.
College Junior,1,There is never enough parking to park and the price is to much.
College Junior,1,It really hard to get a scholarship I have applied so many times and nothing make me sad I never get picked.
College Senior,1,Most of the dining options are non-nutritious/ fast food.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking is expensive and limited. I never park on campus. If I do, it's because I'm 20 minutes late to class, which never happens."
College Junior,1,The campus does not have student housing. There are three dorm services students can use in downtown Denver.
College Senior,1,"unfortunately my loans are in default due to a car accident and now Im returning and have to pay for my last two semesters. 
they don't car what is going on or do they try to have an empathetic ear and help you get the resources or anything to help. its a dog eat dog when it comes to them getting their money. which now that Im overwhelmed by having to pay for my last two semesters, I know once i graduate i have no issue on paying them back for the education i have recieved"
College Sophomore,1,"The Greek life isn't very big at Metro. Since we are a commuter college, it's hard to have a standard Greek life. That said, the Greek's on campus are always trying to get more people, and always running some fund raiser or something. They seem very active."
Recent Alumnus,1,There are limited student discounts around Denver. There is a large variety of restaurants. You are in the middle of Denver so catering to the college student is not expected as it would be in a college town.
College Freshman,1,"I think that parking is definitely overpriced. It is difficult for me to afford, and it would be more convenient for me to take my car and go to my job. Instead I take the bus. There are parking passes, but they only give you a dollar discount or so. That is still not affordable for me. Also parking can be chaotic in the afternoons with the large student body. I mostly dislike the amount of money required to pay for parking."
College Freshman,1,The authorities are no where to be found when you need them. Eccentic people are always wandering the campus and if one was ever in danger the police would more than likely miss the entire incident.
College Freshman,1,There are absolutely no officers that walk around on campus to make sure everyone is safe and I constantly have to be on the look out for potential harmful people since the school is located in a busy city.
College Student,1,I use my laptop most of the time but there are buildings with wifi connection problems that interfere with my progress in completing my work. I don't like to have to go to a computer lab to work on something when I could easily do it on my labtop.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am about to graduate and up till this past semester, I had enjoyed my time at Metro.  However, due to this last semester, I would not recommend Metro to anyone.  The Office of Financial Aid is VERY unorganized.  They will give you bad information and there is nothing that can be done to fix it, but you are the one that suffers.  The Registrar's Office has one of the rudest and degrading administrator's that I have ever met in my life.  I complained and nothing was done, they all know they will keep their jobs no matter what, so they treat people poorly without any recourse.  Lastly, my department has made changes this year in staffing and I think they are doing an injustice to the university.  The new professors are below the school standards and it saddens me that they have taken this route.  The school recently became a university and the changes that have been made are not for the better."
College Junior,1,"There is no strictness that I have encountered. The bums that walk around freely and check for cigarettes left behind is disgusting. There are homeless people surrounding the light rail station. There are also so many people being loud and screaming at students to buy their rubbish from the corners. The campus does not seem safe after sun down at all. I like my school I really do, and they try to be a great a school, but the area seems to be what drags them down. I think that they have done as well as they can given those circumstances."

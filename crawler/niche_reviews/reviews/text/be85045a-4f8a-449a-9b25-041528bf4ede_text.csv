Sophomore,5,"I am now a sophomore at Fisher College and so far, my experience has been great. Fisher has been a place for me to open up as and person, it is a place where I can truly be myself. Fisher is such a diverse and open school, they celebrate their students differences and they encourage individuality!"
Sophomore,5,"When Covid caused classed switch from in person to online, our professors worked with us to make our learning as normal as possible. Although class is online, our faculty makes their lessons as engaging as possible!"
Senior,5,"The professors were accomodating with the remote learning transition and were great sources of help, in my experience."
Junior,5,"The classes were very convenient considering I had been previously been enrolled in online courses. It was such a great opportunity. Great professors providing thought provoking yet fair assignments. Unfortunately, due to fiances I was not able to continue on my Fisher experience.  I loved every moment of being enrolled and would love to have an opportunity to further my college experience and get my bachelors degree so I can fulfill my dream of becoming an elementary school teacher."
Niche User,5,"When I took a summer course for Criminal Justice program, I learned a lot about Fisher College. They always take that extra effort to make sure their students succeed. You can definitely learn a lot there! I would recommend it to everyone."
Junior,5,I take the online classes and work full time it’s a wonderful way to get my degree at my own pace. Also the degree I’m going for will help me gain growth in my field of work.
Freshman,5,I am enrolled with fisher online and I enjoy it very much. I have a busy schedule and the freedom to take online classes is great for me. The professors all answer their emails within 24 hours and are very helpful.
Freshman,5,I am enrolled in the online fisher college campus and it has been absolutely fabulous. From being able to follow along online and still be a parent and work makes it so much eaiser to get my degree.
Senior,5,"I transferred into Fisher College my junior year and I can honestly say I am very happy I found this college. I chose Fisher because of the small class size and the location of the school. I am not just another student; my teachers know my name and I can reach out to them for extra help and recommendations. Our classes are filled with students from China, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, etc. It's been great to be able to hear different perspectives from different cultures. The location of the school is AMAZING. Everything is a T-ride away or a twenty-minute walk. When it's nice out, you can hang out on the docks behind the school, eat in China Town, bike around the Charles River, and explore all the events happening in the city. This is not a party school but you will live in a city with over 200,000 college students. Do not let partying affect your choice when picking a college. You will find plenty of things to do on the weekend that are off campus, trust me!"
Junior,5,"It is such a great experience in Fisher for the last 3 years. Although Fisher doesn't have a big campus, the location in the center of the city that makes it really convenient for everything. The admission process went smoothly because the counselors were extremely helpful. There are a lot of activities on campus. The thing I like most is the small size of class. I get a lot of individual attention from professors, which is impossible in big schools."
Alum,5,I would recommend Fisher College to anyone.  They really care about your success.  I have grown so much since I attended Fisher College.  I believe I can reach my goals with the help of the staff from Fisher College.
Sophomore,5,"From the office located in New Bedford the staff are very friendly and super helpful. The overall atmosphere is very welcoming. It's not a huge campus but the staff/professors respond quickly via phone or emails and provide you the best information possible. Classes are super accelerated, so semesters change every 8 weeks. The hours for the classes are convenient for the working families and online classes are also available if needed. I have enjoyed attending Fisher College. I highly recommend attending!!"
Freshman,5,"even though its my first year, it was very enjoyable. Fisher is a school where you have to go find your own fun and activities."
Niche User,5,"The students are friendly and can help you if you have trouble adopting to the new environment Fisher College has in store for you! But not just the students, the staff are always there to help if you have any trouble living comfortably on or off campus. Their housing opportunities are just as abundant as their educational and intellectual opportunities. It's no wonder that they have been nationally recognized as one of the nation's most prestigious liberal arts and business colleges for centuries since the college's establishment in 1903! But, they don't offer degrees in just business and the liberal arts! You can take a whole variety of courses and end up with marketable jobs at the same time! The staff at Fisher College will go above and beyond to help you find your ideal job with the best pay. That's why, in my point of view, Fisher College works! Don't miss out on your opportunity to study in the most liberal neighborhood in all Massachusetts!"
Senior,5,"Fisher College gives you the tools to succeed, but you have to want it. Their professors will bend over backwards to help students that actually try and care about their grades and their future. The Academic Center for Enrichment (ACE) is a free tutoring program that offers tutors with masters degrees to help students in any subject. The location is prime being located in the Back Bay. Its not often you get to live on beacon street so if you have the opportunity to live on campus take it!"
Senior,5,"Attending Fisher was the best desicion of my life. Making the change from high school to college is never easy but at Fisher it is. In my first semester they provided me with a class called ""The Common Experience"" this class teaches you everything to expect from college. It teaches you how to deal with college papers, exams and even gives you a layout of the next four years. When I took this class my teacher was my Psychology program director. She gave me/us a full layout of what to expect with our major. What was amazing to me was that Fisher offered free tutors for my classes. I've honestly never seen a school that does that. They even help you find jobs. Fisher College had a department named Career services that is dedicated to helping students get jobs both in and after college. They've help me to perect my resume and even helped with finding my internship. I honestly love Fisher, it has been a great four years."
Freshman,5,"Fisher College is a student committed college, they want you to have the best experience and are focused on the student."
College Freshman,5,The people are just wonderful and very friendly. The campus is very nice and also very clean. The reason why I chose this rating for Fisher is because they really do focus on your education and your future.
College Junior,5,Fisher's online program for returning adults is one of the most affordable programs I have found.
College Junior,5,As an online student living in a different time zone deadlines get complicated sometimes.  I have been very fortunate to have such understanding and adaptable teachers.
College Junior,5,"The career service director is extremely helpful! I had a meeting for an hour with her and she told me how to improve my resume, about online networking and also how to get your name out to increase the probability of getting hired after graduation."
College Freshman,5,"I like that it is online, but I am 5 minutes away from a physical campus.  The professors are helpful and the students are friendly."
College Freshman,5,"Online lectures, discussion boards, and communication vi email make it like being in a classroom with the flexibility of making own schedule.  This requires a lot of discipline."
College Freshman,5,Access to several online databases plus the Boston Library are helpful. Even online students may use the computer labs at the campuses.
College Freshman,5,"A lot of students are majoring in  Human Services.  They are adding brand new courses, like Substance Abuse, which I am enjoying."
College Freshman,5,"Workload varies depending on the class.  100 level classes have less of a workload than 300 level classes.  Doing classes online requires a lot more studying than one would think, but the time flexibility is worth it. There is a listing of internship oppurtunities"
College Freshman,5,"I love that I have the option to take classes online or on campus.  Since I work full time and have a busy life, the online option has worked well for me, bbut it is important to make time to study!"
College Junior,5,There are students of all different ages and backgrounds in my online class.
College Junior,5,Having a computer is essential for online classes.
College Junior,5,The admissions dept. and my advisor worked diligently to make sure everything went smoothly.
College Junior,5,It's awesome. The registration process was quick and easy. 
College Junior,5,It was quick and easy. I got a book voucher almost instantly.
College Junior,5,They have career counseling and will stop at nothing to help you find a job.
College Junior,5,Everyone at Fisher has been so helpful. I applied and was able to start classes the next week.
College Junior,5,I'm taking online classes at Fisher College. Everyone has been so helpful. 
College Junior,5,"I have not yet completed my internship, however the program and workload is challenging and worth the effort."
College Junior,5,The online classes at Fisher are outstanding and I can't say enough good about the quality.  Thank you.
College Junior,5,The best choice of schools for me....I'm a lifer at Fisher
College Junior,5,"The best school, so glad I am part of the Fisher community."
College Junior,5,I am always a fan of Fisher
Sophomore,4,Fisher college is in downtown Boston. There is no better place to be for commuting to jobs or if you live locally. Professors are amazing they help you one on one and make you think outside the box.
Junior,4,"Fisher College Is a small College located in the heart of Boston, Location is one of the best featured that this college has to offer."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Fisher College is  a positive one. To me, Fisher College's greatest strengths lie in it's surrounding area and professors. The area around Fisher College is also one of Fisher College's strengths. By being located in the Back Bay of Boston, there is always something to do off-campus. TD Garden, Fenway Park, the Boston Commons, and the Prudential Center are just some examples of locations that are accessible from Fisher College. Another example of one of Fisher College's strengths is the college's professors. The professors that work at Fisher College are all proficient in their respective fields and are dedicated to ensuring that their students succeed. Overall, Fisher College is a great school that provides a small size and quality education for a reasonable price, all while being located in a big city like Boston."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere and the way the staff treats the students. Everyone is so welcoming and I never had a dull moment. It's located right in the heart of downtown Boston so there are many things to do around campus. The only thing I would make better are the living facilities. They aren't bad, but they could be better. I also am a two sport athlete and I love playing for Fisher, but the sport facilities could be better for the teams. Other than that, Fisher is a great school. The academics are great too and the teachers help with anything you need help with."
Sophomore,4,"Since I come from a small high school, Fisher seemed to be a perfect college i could transition into.  Classes are small and gives you the opportunity to have one on one with your professor! Also, the staff is very professional as well as having a laid back vibe to be able to relate and bond with the students"
Freshman,4,"My overall experience with Fisher College is very good. Even though it’s a small school, but professors, students, and the location are ideal."
Alum,4,The small class size is great for sparking discussion and getting one on one help. the evening classes are split in to quarters allowing a working adult to take a full course load every semester with out overloading.
Junior,4,I am taking solely online classed at Fisher College and each instructor and administrator has been very helpful in guiding me along the way to be sure that I am getting the correct amount of credits in all my program requirements to complete my degree. This has been a very convenient and easy transition after not being in school for many years.
Freshman,4,I love the people and teachers of fisher college. Everyone is very nice and friendly and the people are diverse. However if i could change one thing about the school it would be the set up of the dorms and allow everyone to have equal space.
Junior,4,"Transferring into Fisher College I was initially attracted by the beautiful buildings and beautiful location on the corner of Beacon and Arlington street in Boston. After leaving a large school I was nervous about the small size, and found it to feel even smaller than expected. However, I fell in love with the care and attention given to students from professors, staff members and everyone. I'm, very much enjoying my last few college years here."
Sophomore,4,"The best part of Fisher is the close-knit community. Everyone here knows each other, which makes it a more comfortable and laid back setting, while still maintaining a professional look."
College Junior,4,"I say that it is great because many students will strive for an easy college experience. The classes are mostly easy passes, and students do not have to be brilliant, or even do much at all, to get good grades. For example, my roommate barely went to class and got average/below average grades on her assignments. Towards the end of the semester she spoke to her teacher who, within less than 24 hours, raised her grade from a D to a B+."
College Sophomore,4,"As what I consider an older student, I didn't feel belittled or marginalized when I asked lots of questions. Taking online classes is very new to me and it does take discipline in order to get through your class and to get a good grade, but I made it through and hopefully passed with flying colors. I have not received my final grade as of yet."
College Junior,4,With one or two exceptions the online faculty at Fisher College has been phenomenal.  They make themselves available to students and are knowledgeable in their subjects.
College Junior,4,"I have not had an internship yet, but I know there is a class recommended for second semester of Junior year. I wish that was earlier therefore I can get credit for my internships if I would live to do one even my sophomore year. The career service director encourages students to get a Linked In profile in order to make connections with people who graduated from your college, or even people in a specific industry."
College Junior,4,"All of the professors I have had were great. They want to see their students succeed. The sizes of classes are great. When I was applying to college's, I was specifically looking for a college with small class sizes. Fisher College is perfect for that. It is beneficial to everyone because of the personal attention each individual gets from the professor."
College Junior,4,I have had a great experience at this institute. I wish their were more fashion merchandising professors so their was more than one time available for a course.
College Junior,4,The overall program for my major (Fashion Merchandising) is excellent. My professors love what they do and they have so much experience. They have many connections and want to see their students succeed in the industry. We visit corporate offices and learn a great deal of material that is helpful and necessary to know for our future careers.
College Junior,4,The work load isn't too bad. The professors are always there to help assist with anything. They want to see their students succeed and become successful. They want to spread their knowledge to us.
College Sophomore,4,The financial aid office helped me with my FAFSA application.
College Sophomore,4,My experience was great and not stressful at all.
College Sophomore,4,It has been a long time since I attended college and I am enjoying it.
College Sophomore,4,The career center is extremely helpful.
College Sophomore,4,They have a degree that interests me.
College Sophomore,4,I attend on-line classes.  It works for me.  I only wish the some of the classes were longer than 8 weeks.
College Sophomore,4,The curriculum to me is pretty straight forward there is no surprises usually in the classes
College Sophomore,4,I love working with children so my major was the best fit for me
College Sophomore,4,The small class sizes and all around great teachers
College Junior,4,My program is mainly online. I really love it. The advisors and professors are very helpful.
College Junior,4,The different classes for my program are interesting! The class registration process is clear and easy as well.
College Sophomore,4,The school is very urban and diverse
College Freshman,4,I only had one class that was a problem in.  Generally a great experience thus far.
College Freshman,4,"The tuition here is really worth it. Nice class size, wonderful dorms and the teachers know what theyre talking about"
College Junior,4,There are many programs offered at Fisher college.  The academic experience is above and beyond.  My advisor is Lisa Fey and she is so helpful and easy to work with.  Everything about the school is exceptional and I'm proud to be a student a Fisher College.
College Junior,4,They have an underground walkway to help avoid walking outside in the cold. The classes are easy to understand in and the teachers are great with helping the students become better each day.
College Sophomore,4,"I have not take classes online yet but if in the future is needed, I will take it and hopefully have a great experience."
College Senior,4,The school offer a variety of campus activities for all type of interests.
College Senior,4,Online classes offer the flexibility that I need as a full time worker and a mother of two young boys.
College Freshman,4,The professors are really hands on with the students and make sure the students know what they are doing and what they are learning and fully engaged in the class
College Senior,4,"The lab is pretty good. Not an A+ because there is always printer problem, no ink is the most fustarting. You take computer courses such as Computer Concepts, Advanced Computer Concepts, Web Design, Database Design, etc."
Freshman,2,"Attended for a semester and absolutely hated it. The academics are awful, it’s no wonder why the graduation rate is only at 38% 
The food is awful, ended up eating out a lot. 
It’s impossible to communicate to professors as some never answer their emails
Only good thing about Fisher is the location which is right in the back bay of Boston"
Sophomore,2,only thing I like about the school is the admissions team.................................................................
College Freshman,2,There are some alumni that have managed to go out and make a name for themselves. I have not personally experienced this but I have heard that this school does not have a good reputation in the business community.
College Freshman,2,"There are very few courses offered per semester, so sometimes you might not be able to take one of the courses you need."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few evening courses offered, so I'm worried I won't be able to take the courses I need. The online registration is difficult to navigate and is not clear on how much you owe when you register."
College Sophomore,2,there are better schools out there for half the price
College Sophomore,2,if you miss the deadlines there is no help for you
College Sophomore,2,It is not hands on
College Sophomore,2,Way too many stairs and everything is very old. The bathrooms are very inconvenient.
College Junior,2,There is no athletic or fitness center. The student center is very minimal. Library hours are terrible. Not many campus activities.
College Junior,2,The school seems very job oriented but companies don't want people with sub-par degrees 
College Junior,2,School is very frustrating. The day to day experiences are a pain. I took a college math class in highschool and fisher would not take the credit
College Junior,2,We are in the heart of boston.
College Junior,2,"The professors are alright. They just teach the material but don't go into depth about it if you need them too. The curriculum is very minimal and easy. Registration process is a nightmare, everyone is at each others throats. The programs at my school are only subpar, not even good."
College Senior,2,"The work load is Average, there arent alot of elective choices, and I had to struggle to find an internship at a certain deadline on my own."
College Senior,2,Sometimes you have to wait till the next year to get the course required to graduation but if you ask persistently the academic advisor might let you take the course as an independent study.
College Freshman,2,"There are equal positives and negatives about my experiences with Fisher College. So far, I have had only 2 classes that I truly felt that I learned something beyond the basics of common knowledge. The attendance with students is one of the major problems at Fisher College. Also, they don't offer many healthy alternatives beyond the basic salad bar. On a positive note, they have small classes, which is very helpful for people who need one on one learning experience compared to 200+ people in one class lecture."
Senior,1,"I transferred from a mid-sized university in the midwest, which I did not enjoy for the 3 years I attended, yet I have still regretted my decision to transfer to Fisher. 

My advisor went on maternity leave mid-semester without notice and became MIA for any form of help. When I'm lucky, she'd respond within 2 weeks. There is maybe 1 or 2 staff who can help you out with advising besides your advisor but don't expect them to know anything about the prerequisites/qualifications needed for graduate school, nor any help applying to them. Most of the administrative staff are seemingly indifferent to students and their aspirations; the only exception is the professors, who all have been great in my encounter by far.  The previous school president was boastful about Fisher not taking any business loans to finance its operations. Congrats, but nothing about it is boast-worthy when the budget is nonexistent in each department. There's a reason why they don't publish their retention rate."
Niche User,1,"We are not in da heart of Bostin, we are in the heart of  Bostin, not a a great experience is you ask me my honest opinions I mean it is kinda a joke if you ask my honest opinions like really disappointing serious like I was expecting much good out of Fisher and my experience has been terribl at worst and horribl at best"
Niche User,1,"I attend Fisher College for one semester&had a horrible experience.The dorms are disgusting.There is rat poison all over the rooms.The residence halls themselves are loud.The RA's do nothing&even join in on the ""fun"".When I reported this security did nothing.My residence hall was across the street from the main building&we had no security guard at all. When my roommate had a sexual harassment complaint about a female student the head security guard said that sexual harassment only occurs between an older male and a younger female.The student body is just as awful as the rest of the school. Bullying&racism are a problem here&no one does  anything about it.The only good thing I can talk about is the classes.My professors were well trained in their subjects&I learned a lot from them.
If you are looking to move past high school&want to be surrounded by intelligent people do not go here.The location&class size is nice but not worth it.Overall I do not recommend this school."
College Freshman,1,The fashion merchanding classes are very easy. It requires a bit of creativity to complete some of these classes. There was one class that I did learn a bit from and actually found valuable and that was my fashion merchandising class. The professor was professional and knew the material she was covering in and out. She is the person that I trust most in the school.
College Freshman,1,This school did not challenge me in any way. It is way too small and most of the students are immature. There are not many activities for students to participate in. The academics are a joke. I truly have not enjoyed my time at Fisher and I would not recommend anyone to come here.
College Junior,1,Not many computers and they are all taken. I get shut out of the wifi every 45 minutes. Its a pain.
College Junior,1,The one great thing about my school was it gave me the opportunity to meet with Gary Steffan the President of Globalization for Hilton. I then got a job after that meeting with him. I wouldn't choose my school if I could do it all over again because they talked the talk but didn't walk the walk. The school is really good at selling itself but the school itself is terrible. 
College Junior,1,The school is way to expensive for the education level. School work is extremely easy and teachers don't care.
Recent Alumnus,1,"TOO EXPENSIVE!! the cost to go here is about $43,000. and personally thats way too expensive to be going to a college thats basically the same as high school. Financial aid is very easy to get from school but they don't give to that much. Tuition keeps going up and the amount of financial aid they give you is going down. Unless your parent have money or you have a trust fund, your gonna be taking out loans. the financial office is very helpful, probably the most helpful office."
Recent Alumnus,1,Not Happy – for the money i paid to go here i would expect a lot more. during orientation they drill in your head how great the school is and how theres so much to do on campus and around the school area. BUT THATS A LIE!! i was bored majority of the time and you everything around boston is either too expensive or you need to be 21+. the worst part about the school is the food! its the same fried food every single day!!! with very little choices. also the cost of the food is way too much. the classes area small but most of the teachers don't even know what there doing. some classes all you need to do is show up and the lowest grade you will get is a B. all you need to do it read the book and you will do fine!! but sometimes you don't even need to do that cause the classes is so simple. the classes are like high school all over again and even sometimes easier then high school
Recent Alumnus,1,Can Not Have Wireless in the Dorms – my first year of school i was allowed to set up my airport from Apple. but my second year they blocked all wireless and made everyone use an ethernet cord. which isn't as big of a deal but the internet was VERY SLOW!!! plus the place where to plug in the cord to the wall is always in a very awkward place.
Recent Alumnus,1,Gym Centers – the school lies to you on  the website and says that they have a gym on site. the gym is a public gym about 2 blocks down the street. Also you need a pass to go to the gym. Theres are only 15 passes for the whole school. which doenst' fit with peoples schedules sometimes.
College Sophomore,1,"Basic High School – The 25,000+ in-tution payed for the education is probably the same amount I have gotten in high school it was a complete waste."
College Freshman,1,Not Challenging – For the majority of the limited courses Fisher College offers are very easy workload and don't challenge you as a student. The internship/job opportunities that they offer are very limited to a select companies.

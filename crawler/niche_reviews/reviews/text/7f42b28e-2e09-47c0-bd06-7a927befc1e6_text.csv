Sophomore,5,"I love Mid Michigan College. Most of the professors are great and very helpful. If you show interest in the class and your education, they will be more than willing to encourage you and help you with anything you need. The faculty is also great.

Junior,5,"The staff at the college are all very helpful and kind. There are many resources at this small college to help you succeed in whatever it is that you are trying to accomplish. Class sizes are small which gives you a better relationship with your professor and more 1 on 1 time if needed. The college is a small, tight knit community that has the best interest of it's students in mind. There are also many different clubs and activities on campus that draw students of all backgrounds and there really is something for everyone."
Junior,5,"Very nice campus, great professors. Student resources are easy to access such as getting help with writing an essay, help with math problems in the math center, or getting help with science classes in the science center."
Sophomore,5,"I am a 48 year old woman returning to college after 27 years. I never in my wildest dreams thought I would be going to college to earn another degree after all these years but I realized you are never too old to start over. I had a serious health scare 8 months ago and was not expected to live. I prayed that if I made it through, I would take every opportunity available to me and make the most of it. Mid Michigan Community College has made it easy for me to do that.
If I would change anything about the school, it would be to see more people my age fulfilling their dreams of education like me."
Junior,5,"they really care and invest in their students, offering many different kinds of assistance whether it be help with financial aid or helping you find a tutor if needed. they offer a math lab for free where there are at least two teachers available to help with whatever you're struggling with. all staff members are very nice, knowledgeable, and helpful."
Graduate Student,5,Love that it is a small college and much more affordable than university for getting your gen ed classes done
Sophomore,5,"Taking classes at Mid is so worth it. All of the staff are super helpful with applying for school, registering for classes and with financial aid. I also like that they offer full degrees online. The online classes are easy to maneuver and the instructors are very helpful and patient with all of their students, especially the new students."
Freshman,5,"Mid Michigan community college is an excellent choice for any students who enjoy smaller classrooms. There is two campuses that you can choose to attend. One is in a smaller town and the other is in the city, so, it has great variety for choices on where you want to live. The staff is excellent and usually gets back to you if they miss your call. There is resource centers for tutoring, financial aid, counseling, etc.. There is clubs available, I only remembered softball because I love it, but, there is definitely more choices. Also, there is a café and a book store."
Junior,5,They make getting to and taking classes to earn your degree as easy as humanly  possible.  The professors eagerly take the extra time to help in areas you struggle in.  The Advisors are great!  They have your best interest in mind and are completely honest from the start with no sugar coating.  This college works in great harmony together to offer up your best possible future concerning your education and career!
Sophomore,5,"Going to Mid has changed how view the world around me. Engaging with different perspectives and challenging myself have all encouraged a growth of mind that I have not experienced in any other school. I would highly recommend going here to gain a jumpstart on University life, and to help prepare you for the rest of your life"
Sophomore,5,My overall experience at Mid Michigan Community College was great. The staff was very welcoming and treats you fair. The professors are very understanding and is always looking to help you succeed. The environment there is incomparable and so soothing; you can study peacefully. The only thing that would make Mid Michigan a better school is adding a better cafe.
Senior,5,"The teachers here are very supportive and strive to see the students succeed. I felt very comfortable in all of my classes to ask questions and tell the class my opinions, which is usually rare."
Niche User,5,I'm currently dual enrolled at MMCC and I absolutely love it! I love the small class size and my professor. I can't wait to attend here as a freshman next fall!
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely adore MMCC! its the perfect college for the high school graduates who aren't 100% ready to leave home and head for a big city. A nice transitional school. Very affordable, diverse, and social life is amazing."
Niche User,5,Since I got accepted to it and i took a campus tour and i feel at home and completely comfortable with being there. They answer the questions that I have and they make everything easy for me to access to the things that i need. They are there to make sure that I  accomplish my goals for my future job. This school is amazing !

College Senior,5,"Great school, small classes and great instructors!!!"
College Freshman,5,"I love Mid-Michigan Community College, I came here after an academical dismissal from a large university. I had going through a hard time and took about a year off of college to go to counseling and take control of my social anxiety/clinical depression. When I decided it was time to go back to college, I came to MMCC and they are helping me get back on track with college and working towards my goal of attending a large university and getting back into Pre-Med."
College Sophomore,5,"The college I attended before Mid Michigan  Community College was not a good fit for me.  I had no trouble with the course work, but it was the negative attitudes of most of the staff and instructors that made the experience troubling.  Mid Michigan is great!  Plenty of positive attitudes and helpful people. I was surprised my credits were transferrable, and grateful."
College Sophomore,5,My experience has been great!  I would tell everyone to attend Mid Michigan Community College!  The staff/instuctors are all helpful and positive.  The students are as well.
College Sophomore,5,"I believe the grade we get, we have earned!  This is especially important to me.  Course work may be demanding at times, but I also believe it is beneficial, not busy work.  Class sizes are always comfortable, not to many students where you might not want to get involved in discussions.  And the professors try to have everyone participate at a level they are comfortable with.  Its a great school."
College Sophomore,5,"It is definitely more affordable to attend a community college over a university.  I receive financial aid and when I have any questions, the retention officer and financial aid office have been very helpful and answered them thoroughly.  Biggest tip I could offer, is ask questions.  The staff will help you find an answer."
College Sophomore,5,"My specific major is a 3+1 program with Northwood University.  I am going for a Busi Admin with a major in Accounting Bachelor Degree.  At Mid Michigan Community College, the atmosphere is all positive and everyone is very helpful. I am attending full time, so I am doing school work while classes are in all the time.  Mid Michigan has many areas all over campus where you can find a spot to work on your course work."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel the instructors are all fair and encouraging.  I feel challenged above what is just required to pass the class.  The Learning Services Center helped me narrow my interest to a degree I could acquire.  They are great, and helpful whenever you have a question concerning anything to do with attending from registration, where to find a quiet place to study, or a tutor  for an online class."
College Sophomore,5,"Mid Michigan has a great Learning Services Center, I use them regularly.   They have math and English help available all day, and you can get tutors through them that are a great help.

The staff in the library is also very helpful and friendly."
College Junior,5,"BEST professors I have EVER had! The course work is designed around not only book work and lectures, but also lab time and hands on practice."
College Freshman,5,"Many computers and labs are available, along with open, quiet, comfortable study rooms. There is a work out center and student center free to students. The library has many resources but if you can't find what your looking for there are multiple online resource data bases. "
College Freshman,5,Financial aid is pretty straight forward. Just apply for FASFA and it sends it straight to the school. You can track everything online or through the Financial Aid office. 
College Junior,5,I had a paper due for my religion class but my internet at home wasn't working so I could not finish the paper before the deadline.  I talked to my professor about it and he said to get it in before next class time.  My experiences with professors has been good.
College Junior,5,I was awarded a scholarship that pays for two years of tuition and also my books and supplies.  There are definitely many opportunities and different options for financial aid to help pay for tuition.  
College Junior,5,THere is a great computer lab on campus if needed.  I don't work on campus.  I provide my own computer and network.
Sophomore,4,"Professors were very willing to give extra help if needed. Some professors take more than a day or two to reply. which can get frustrating sometimes, but overall, you can tell that they professors really care. Communication is sometimes an issue, but that depends from professor to professor. The zoom calls or recording were especially helpful for lecture. One big complaint for online classes is that sometimes the links are outdated so students can't see the information they need."
Freshman,4,Most of the classes that I have taken through Mid Michigan Community College were online. The online classes were excellent and the professors try as best as they can to stay in touch and make sure the student understands the materials.
Freshman,4,Mid Michigan Community College is a great way for someone to start off their college career or even take just a few classes. There is a wide variety of pathways that someone could take through this college.
Freshman,4,I haven't been here for that long but everything seems pretty average. I'm enjoying it so far. It's a nice way to ease into college.
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere of college is much to take in. However, at mid I have been in love with everything about it. From teachers to other students i feel welcomed everywhere."
Niche User,4,For Mid being a small college its faculty and staff are amazing! This is surely a place that is inclusive of its students and active in its communities.
Sophomore,4,"i liked how the experiences were very down to earth and personal, yet i was still able to get the degree and experiences i needed to advance to a higher institution. i am also very happy that they have partnered with my high school to allow me to participate in an early college program."
Niche User,4,"I am currently still a high school student, but I attend Mid Michigan Community College for some dual enrollment classes. I have taken both online and on-campus classes through Mid and felt very comfortable and at home through both. The professors are very helpful and understanding. You feel like less of a number at Mid compared to a University."
Sophomore,4,They are very nice people. The class sizes are smaller so students are able to have one-on-one with the teachers. There is also a few teachers that could use some help on explaining some things or even need help enjoying what they are doing. I had a teacher that taught over the classes heads because he normally taught 300 classes and my class was a 100 class. Over all it's a good school.
Freshman,4,"I love how low key everything is. Like a laid back atmosphere that is full of positive lighting, and with wonderful people who are willing to assist you."
Sophomore,4,Great place to save money when considering a 4 year college degree. Though the Harrison campus has a high presence of high school students dual enrolling at the college.
Freshman,4,"Mid Michigan Community college has been a very great experience. Professors are all helpful and understanding, there are many student resources but is definitely on the expensive side of community college."
Sophomore,4,Mid Michigan Community College is a wonderful 2-year institution in both Harrison and Mount Pleasant. The campus offers both Associates degrees and also transfer programs for other universities. I highly recommend Mid for any students looking to get a higher education at a two year college!
Sophomore,4,"With only one more semester left until I complete an AS degree, I have had a relatively good experience with MMCC. The majority of the instructors seem to be dedicated to their work and try to make the classroom a good learning environment. The cafeteria shut down several years ago before I got here, it would be nice if it was up and running again. Also, the book selection in the library could definitely be updated."
College Senior,4,"The online courses were great - however, it seemed like the teachers often gave an extreme/unnecessary workload. Also, as said before, their is not a great class selection."
College Senior,4,"Many of my teachers were amazing! They worked very hard to teach the class and help students who were struggling. They were very understanding. However, i did have a few that only saw the class a a job - they were uncooperative and seemed to do the minimal needed."
College Senior,4,"The admissions staff are very helpful and encouraging. However, some of the teachers seem to lack enthusiasm and drive in their classes."
College Freshman,4,I have been very impressed by the flexibility of the classes. I can find whatever class I need given at almost any time I need it. I appreciate this because I have to commute to college and it is nice to schedule all my classes on the same day instead of having to drive up every day.
College Freshman,4,I have only come across one uncommunicative professor in all of the classes I have taken here. Most of my professors have been eager to help me learn and willing to answer questions. They try to find new ways to present the material in an understandable manner and care about their students.
College Freshman,4,I appreciate the value of a degree from this school. When I was talking to one of the Professors they mentioned that this college is careful to try and provide job opportunities to its students when they graduate. I am glad of this because there is nothing worse than getting a degree and not being able to find a job with it.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy this school because they are very welcoming. Whenever I have a question about what I am supposed to do next or what classes I need they are very willing to talk to me. When I was first trying to find a college to take classes at I went to a counselor's office just to ask a question and I ended up having a tour of the college itself!
College Student,4,"I loved CMU while I attended. I graduated from the early childhood education program. I would say the only downfall I have with my education is that they didn't prepare me for the real world. They have a child lab that we have to student teach in and it, in this lab they have everything you could ever want while teaching. This is unrealistic. In all the programs I have been in we have to scrape by. I also would have liked to know that I wouldn't be able to pay back my student loans due to the low paying job."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, I love MMCC! I have had the most helpful advisers and they have helped me get everything figured out for starting over at a new college after having a lot of personal problems."
College Freshman,4,I have had some teachers who have been totally perfect with my hassles. Many teachers have been able to switch things around for me.
College Freshman,4,"The school has taught me a lot, and it has been a great buffer for my 4-year college experience."
College Freshman,4,"It was a great experience, though there are some tough times to fully understand the professors wishes. A better understanding of online learning from the teachers would help the students understanding of the topic."
College Freshman,4,This is a great school because of the tuition. The money I have paid was never excessive and the people were genuine when helping me get my tuition paid.
College Freshman,4,"Since there are two campuses in separate cities there are some perks I do not receive, though there are the necessary resources. I have been satisfied with the resources provided. There is no need that goes unnoticed. The campus is basically one building though, it is a community college."
College Junior,4,Overall good experience. Some of the best professors I have ever had!
College Junior,4,"I couldn't ask for better professors! They take the time to explain things, and they truly are concerned with your success not only in the classroom, but also in your career."
College Junior,4,The Radiography program is set up for Mondays and Tuesdays. It works out well considering I can still carry a full time job with school.
College Junior,4,Printing allowance is good considering in today's day and age we e-mail assignments or have our own personal printers. I think $10 per semester is good when it's .10 a copy.
College Junior,4,I really appreciate how accessible the instructors are if you have any questions. They really go above and beyond to make sure that you are understanding the material and moving at a comfortable pace. They also make sure that they are available to you at any time when you need help.
College Sophomore,4,I did not have any problems. the financial aid office was great they helped me alot
College Sophomore,4,I havent had any problems with the network or any of the equipment.
College Sophomore,4,"great flexibility in class times and locations, we have had a few snow days and teachers are willing to adjust curriculum and when it is due."
College Sophomore,4,"I like the lower costs for tuition and that it is close to home. the flexibility of classes available and the locations, smaller class sizes."
College Sophomore,4,After being out of the school routine for so long i was scared to jump back in everyone has been great helping where they can especially the staff.
College Sophomore,4,In the field of drafting i was nervous to be a girl in a guys field but the drafting instructor is great and i even have men asking for my help.
College Freshman,4,There are no dorms but many places to take a nap. There multiple hang out spots. 
College Junior,4,The English department is one of the best ones in the area and the discourse is very interesting.  It is simple to start a  club or organization that is not already offered.  
College Junior,4,The internet is very fast and easy to access.  There are open computer labs and printers available to students.  
College Junior,4,"There are not many as it is a community college, but they are very nice and useful to students.  "
College Junior,4,"At a community college, I didn't expect to see so many different kinds of people.  There are many different race, religious, and economic backgrounds all together here.  "
College Junior,4,The English courses are better than any university in the area and you learn a lot more than expected.  All of my experiences with the different aspects of the school have been great.  
College Junior,4,"Professors are genuinely interested in the students succeeding and encourage them to come to them with any questions and always do their best to answer.  The workload is a typical college workload, no less or more than a university.  The registration process is very simple and there are advisers there to help you with that also.  "
College Junior,4,"Even if my fellow students were single, married, had a job...ect. They all have been determined to be a faithful group member. I have not yet had anyone I have had an issue with, they are all outgoing, hardworking, and a great assest to class."
College Junior,4,The classes were very planned out so there was no room for confusion or mixed up assignments. The teachers have been very prompt in responding to questions. Very pleased with my online courses.
College Senior,4,"Mid has a lot of resources at it's College.  If there isn't something there that someone needs, then the college will get it.  There are plenty of tutors and staff to help anyone."
College Senior,4,I personally did not like the online class to much.  I found it harder to get myself motivated to do the work.
College Senior,4,I chose this school because I was not sure what I wanted to go into.  I didn't want to jump into anything before I knew exactly what I wanted to do.
College Junior,4,The ASC is good about tutoring and helping with any questions students may have.
College Junior,4,I am very pleased with the flexibility around my personal and work schedule.
College Freshman,4,"I use the writing center all the time, i will be using the math lab this week as well..i do find it very helpful."
College Freshman,4,I am a non-traditional student and was very nervous to go back to college at my age..I felt the transition was very easy and the instructors were very nice and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"MMCC is still a growing school, but the few professors they have are extremely knowledgable in their field. Class registration is based on how many credits you have, and usually has enough room to accomidate everyone who registers."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Tuition rates are great at this college, which makes it an ideal place to start out. The financial aid I received almost always covered all of my costs. I only had an issue when I was attending 2 institutions at the same time and wasn't getting the information I needed to properly process my financial aid. However, it was all worked out and I have no issues with the schools tuition and financial aid."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is very nice at mid michigan. i see students hold dorrs for eachother, and are helpful in and out of class and ive built strong relationships."
College Sophomore,4,Great Learning Center – They have a learning center which also has after school tutoring sessions which help you in particular classes that you have trouble with such as math and biology and english classes.
College Junior,4,"Uncertain of Where to Go, Advisor Helpful. I wanted to do business management, but I didn't realize that so much more was involved. My advisor took the time out to show me the difference area of field that I could lean towards, she made me realize I had opition, but I was the one who had to make the choice of what direction I would follow, and once I figured it out, she would be there to help me."
College Freshman,2,I like the school becasue the class room sises are smaller and there is more one on one time with teachers
College Freshman,2,you only get 20 dollars worth of printing after that you have to pay for it and the printers are always messed up
College Sophomore,1,I dont have college experience what so ever going here.
College Sophomore,1,"For the teachers, the tuition is way too high. Sometimes I think I could teach the class better."
College Sophomore,1,"Teachers are garbage, like they got them off the street. I do not get the full college experience here and I can not wait to leave."

Alum,5,There weren't any when I attended. NA MA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
Alum,5,"Prescott College is unique and what you bring to it is what you get out of it.  It is bad school for you if you want the classic college experience of parties, football games and large classes where you disappear into the background.  I had no class at PC larger than 16.  I double majored (art and psychology) and completed multiple independent studies.  I had a fantastic time- the education is very hands on and interesting.  My psych classes were aimed at people who wanted to be therapists, not researchers, so the focus was on helping others.  It was a good focus for me as I went on to be child therapist.  

I was fairly academic in high school and got good grades, but I wanted a new and interesting college experience, with more of a focus on my own personal growth.  I got that in spades.  There were draw backs- for me theI also got into three competitive grad schools coming out of PC.  This school is not for everyone.  But if it is for you, it is fantastic."
Alum,5,The profound impact that Prescott College has had socially and environmentally is immeasurable; there is no end to the ripples of positive change that this institution has created. I am so proud to be a Prescott College graduate. The dedication and passion of students and faculty to learn and grow to make the world a better place is unparalleled.
Alum,5,"I transferred and most of my credits were accepted! : ) . (Unlike several other colleges & universities I had looked into).   The orientation was informative and hands on : ie. we were shown how to navigate the college's various platforms as I was taking their Distance Learning program.  Earned a Bachelor's in Human Development with an emphasis in the Performing Arts.  Their was a spirit of healthy competition in all of my classes.  (I worked my butt off to be in ""the running"" and enjoyed it).  My advisors were extraordinary, (a shout out to Esther Almazan), and they raised the bar quite high academically. For example we had to write a thesis in order to earn our Bachelor's Degree.  If you are motivated - Prescott College is a great choice!      p.s. We converged on the College's campus twice a year & there was an international student body that was sizable!"
Niche User,5,"Prescott College is devoted to experiential, interdisciplinary learning and that is, quite frankly, invaluable. Teachers and students alike are passionate in their pursuits and it is liberating to be around such likeminded people that desire to make a positive change in the world."
Junior,5,It has always been my dream to complete my education. Prescott College has made my dream come true. I am a junior at Prescott College. The professors work with and the students especiallt with us older students. I love Prescott College for making my dream a reality!
Junior,5,This is a very pro - liberal college. I like it because the faculty are so helpful. They all have good idea and have been very willing to go the extra mile to see me graduate!
College Junior,5,"So far my college experience here at Prescott College has been great! I have small class sizes, so one on one with the professor is easy. What makes my school unique is how hands on we are in our classrooms and curriculum. our courses aren't strictly lecture based, actually they rarely are. My classes are really interactive and offer flexibility in your learning style.  I would definitely choose my school if i could do it all over again, the only thing i would change would the orientation offered at the school was somewhat difficult for me. Because my school is outdoor based and environmentally conscious, out orientation is a three week backpacking trip that I wasn't nearly prepared for. But otherwise our classes are really informative and after we learn as much as we can we go outside or act out what we learned in real life whether its about math, animal behavior or sciences."
College Freshman,5,Small campus that focuses on conservation and beauty.
College Freshman,5,"The majors are geared toward creative thinking, ecology, social justice."
College Freshman,5,Good for school environment and study ethics.
College Freshman,5,"I have toured the school, met counselors and staff as well as students. This year will be my first year at the school. The community is fantastic."
College Junior,5,The experiential based learning is the most unique learning experience a student could ask for. The teachers truly care about their students success and help them achieve personal career and educational goals to the best of their abilities.
College Junior,5,I've always lived off campus and have never been without a place to stay. People are even open to allow couchsurfers if you are in between housing situations.
College Junior,5,"Prescott College is very open and accepting, although we the ethnic diversity on campus could be increased"
College Junior,5,"There is no ""Greek Life"""
College Junior,5,The town is small enough that there are a lot of local eateries but big enough that there is a lot of variety.
College Junior,5,The weather is extremely pleasant.  The winter's are mild with a few storms a season and the higher elevation makes it nice in the summer.
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved the mentor BA program.
Recent Alumnus,5,They are accepting to everyone.
College Freshman,5,Very unique.  Lots of independence and experiential learning.  Very accepting to different points of views and interests.
College Freshman,5,"The academics at Prescott are great.  The classes focus on experiential learning, which allows the students to get the most out of their education.  There is a wide variety of subjects, and many options for creating your own degree plan and independent studies.  I find this very helpful because it allows me to grow as an independent person and explore my own areas of interest."
College Freshman,5,"My photography class is awesome,  My teacher is very knowledgable and is also able to incorporate other topics into our classes; such as using photography as a way to create social change, or photographic history.  There are also many other photography classes offered at Prescott so there is never a shortage of places to go."
College Junior,5,"The school is a mix of inspiration, ideology, action, and education.  The school community strives to enact the beliefs they stand for, while not perfect, the community is very unique."
College Junior,5,"I receive a lot of financial aid, and during the application process the admissions counselor worked to get me as much aid as possible."
College Junior,5,"There seems to be a lot of support available for doing a psychology major. The teachers are knowledgeable as are the advisers. In doing the limited residency program I had thought my days of required classes were over, so I was a bit disappointed to find out I still had a required course to do. However, it online so it wasn't so bad. Since I am in the limited residency program I can now find mentors in my own community to be teachers and as such build contacts in the community for when I do my internship."
College Junior,5,"The teachers I've had at Prescott for online courses so far have been great. They are easy to get in touch with, very honest if they don't know an answer and are willing to find out information if they don't know it. "
College Junior,5,"I am doing the limited residency program and just love it. I wasn't required to move, though you do have to attend orientation. In the program you then do a combination of online and mentored courses. Mentored courses are where you find a mentor in your field of study and set up one on one classes with them. The mentored courses allow for a more hands on experience, one on one time with the teacher instead of being lost in a crowd, and form contacts for when you graduate."
College Junior,5,"I love the mentoring aspect of the limited residency undergraduate program. Instead of just online classes, you get to find mentors in your field of study or in your home town. Then you create classes with those mentors. This provides a great one-on-one learning opportunity and also allows for a lot more hands on type work instead of just book studying."
College Junior,5,No need for a car on campus as all buildings are within walking distance. No permits needed for parking. Parking was convenient and easily available.
College Senior,5,"There are many neighborhoods within walking distance of the school with very reasonably priced housing. Most of the houses closest to the school are older and may not be in tip-top shape, but they are worth it for the price. Many rentals allow pets and keeping gardens and chickens is not at all unheard of. Because Prescott is such a small town nicer, newer homes in newer neighborhoods can easily be found within 15 minutes driving time from the school."
College Senior,5,"Self Directed, but Never Alone. Prescott college really encourages students to take responsibility for their actions and to create a learning program that best fits what they want out of their education.  Although they encourage you to take your education into your own hands, they are with you every step of the way, making sure you get the most out of your college experience."
College Junior,5,"There is lots of parking around campus, very close to classrooms, and it's free.  Bike parking, too!"
College Sophomore,5,"Campus is not very strict. You can use classrooms until midnight (if the security guards like you), you can be barefoot and wear whatever, you can dance, you can sing, anything. PC is great."
College Sophomore,5,"Prescott College is great for it's dedication to sustainability and use of green energy. The buildings have solar panels, are built with repurposed materials, Butte creek has been restored and protected, native plants grow on campus, and there is a certain respect that goes along with it (from students and staff)."
College Senior,5,Prescott College is great at supporting students to do exactly what they are passionate about in their majors.
College Junior,5,"Its wonderful! It's best known for the bluebird sky and 365 days of sunshine. When it rains, the monsoons in the summer cool off the desert. If it snows, you can have a giant snowball fight and it will probably be 70 degrees again by noon. It's the best weather, and it's really hard to complain about."
College Junior,5,"The weather in Prescott is perfect.  Yes, it might take a while to adjust to less than 20% humidity for most of the year, but the air is soft and dry and the sun comes out shining brightly almost every day.  And just when you've had enough sunshine, there will be big puffy white clouds or a little rainfall.  Being a mile high in elevation, we do get snow in the winter, which is fun!  The spring brings strong winds which can be a bummer when you're walking or biking to class.  Because we have such beautiful weather, we get to spend class time outdoors sometimes, which is awesome.  We also spend a lot of time in the field on class trips."
College Senior,5,Prescott College is a very open minded and accepting institution. There is no discrimination whatsoever doesn't matter what topic.
College Junior,5,"I'm at Prescott in the Adventure Education Program, and it's one of the best in the country. The professors are passionate and knowledgeable about the subjects and skills they teach. I'm not as well versed in the other programs, but Adventure Ed and Environmental Studies are excellent and offer all of the experience, knowledge and networking opportunities you would want in those fields."
Freshman,4,"I love that the dorms are very close to downtown and that the campus is all within walking distance. The student community is great, and there are always activities to do. However, there is no clinic and the administration is not very involved in student life. Almost all activities are sponsored by students and faculty."
Freshman,4,"Prescott College is an excellent school for self-driven learners. There is lots of freedom to pursue independent studies, studies abroad, and even self-designed majors."
Senior,4,Great for people who want to create a unique degree plan. Must be extremely self motivated to pursue dream degree because teachers do not challenge you. You have to challenge yourself!
Alum,4,"The instructors and the library workers made up the core of this school for me. I adored all my instructors, and greatly valued the one-on-one time I had with them to help my academic and general life learning. The administration was unimpressive. They spoke about themselves well but the admin frequently disappointed students. The school is very ableist overall. I came to this school as a transfer student. I did well as a transfer student, but know I would not have stayed if I'd started my bachelor's degree at this school. I was involved in some Title IX work at the school and was disappointed by the school's lack of action to help students seeking protection under Title IX. This school was moderately trans-friendly. It painfully lacked in diversity, but in some ways is very well-suited to neurodivergent students with non-traditional learning styles."
Senior,4,The Adventure Ed program is great however the school's operations and logistics leave something to be desired.
Sophomore,4,Prescott college is great for anyone that loves the outdoor and has intentions to pursue a career relative to the outdoors. The whole college mainly revolve around adventure education degree. they offer many other and are very student driven. Student in this college have a lot of power.
College Sophomore,4,"Prescott College gives you the unique experience that no other college can offer. They do this by having excellent faculty who teach through experiential education. For example, someone that is studying Adventure Education or Outdoor Recreation is not qualified to graduate until they have completed the Adventure Education Semester, which involves learning and teaching others skills such as backpacking, rock climbing, whitewater rafting, and so on. Prescott College has a sensational Environmental Studies program, which is what I am in currently. I hope to obtain an emphasis in my course of study in Wilderness & Parks Management."
College Sophomore,4,Alfonso's Alfonso Burrito. It isn't on the menu and it is under $10 for an arm long burrito with everything on it. Get it and you will thank me.
College Sophomore,4,"Up till about the halfway point through the semester there are parties every weekend after that they are more sporadic but there are often at least one or two things going on, except for during block. The parties tend to be very relaxed and theme parties are common. The best places vary with the kids living there at the time but the dip house, the panda house, the mansion, and casa de chaos all tend to be solid."
College Sophomore,4,They really work with you to get you as much aid as they can and they offer endowed scholarships for you to apply for every year on top of the scholarships in the aid package you are first offered.
College Sophomore,4,"The menus are great they are flexible and you can make most things your own. I often double up the meat, but they also offer options for gluten free, vegan and vegetarian too. They serve breakfast all day and there isn't anything I have had that I wouldn't eat again though I must recommend The Prescott, or the smoked turkey with chipotle mayo."
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are nice and are well kept. The RAs tend to be good people and are personable. I would recommend the dorms to most incoming students but if you are older than the typical freshman ages I say steer clear.
College Freshman,4,"I'm coming from Silicon Valley, CA, so the prices cannot be beat for what you get, in my opinion."
College Freshman,4,Beautiful town with lots of charm. People are warm.
College Freshman,4,There are four seasons. Beautiful area.
College Junior,4,The campus is strict with problems involving use of drug and alcohol but are very lenient in student-related problems and are open to hearing student voice's to any problems happening on campus
College Senior,4,"Off campus housing has been relatively easy in the past but I hear it is getting slightly more difficult.  There are lots of apartments and old cute houses available.  It is definitely much cheaper prices than I am used to coming from a big city.  When I got to Prescott, I was able to sign a lease and move in right away.  My landlord has been incredible.  I definitely recommend renting from landlords as opposed to renting companies.  I have heard bad things about multiple rental companies in Prescott.  Parking is easy in most areas and there is most likely a grocery store in your neighborhood."
College Senior,4,"I am under the Cultural & Regional Studies Department where I am majoring in Social Justice (a major I designed).  I love the fact that I had the ability to design my own major and take course I wanted to take instead of 2 years of general education courses.  Everything I have learned has been super exciting!  My studies have taken me all over Arizona, to California, and even Kenya.  I can't say enough good things!"
College Senior,4,If I could do it all over again I would!  Sometimes I wish I could extend my time at school because there are still so many courses I haven't gotten a chance to take.  My career goal is to work and/or start a nonprofit organization and I am well underway with all the skills that Prescott College has given me.
College Senior,4,"The actual town of Prescott has Whiskey Row, which is home to many different bars that have different feels but tend to have the same music and vibe all the time.  If you are 21+ it is fun to check out every once in a while.  Prescott College students are always having house parties and potluck gatherings.  More and more fun on-campus events are happening too such as open mics, community dancing, and movie showings.  I personally have never had a lack of something to do.  I have a harder time trying to figure out what to choose over another!"
College Junior,4,The campus is very safe however there are some questionable areas next to the campus due to the homeless and addict rates in the town. But school is very safe and there are rarely fights
College Junior,4,"It rarely rains or snows, and when it does everyone loves it.

Otherwise there is endless sunshine and bluebird skies.

If it snows even an inch they will close campus for snow delay or closure since the town isn't used to handling snow"
College Junior,4,Lots of sun all winter long.
College Junior,4,"Pretty relaxed as far as I can tell, but they would take any real issue seriously."
College Junior,4,The professors are great.  The academics can be rigorous if you take the right class
College Freshman,4,"We have really amazing weather here. It is super rainy for maybe the first month of the school year, and then the rest of the year is pretty mild."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms here are more like town-house style apartments. There are five rooms in each, two singles and three doubles. Two rooms share a toilet and a shower, with individual sinks for each room. At the most, four people share a bathroom. Each house has a kitchen with two refrigerators, two stove/ovens, and lots of cabinet space. People are always hanging out in their own and each other's kitchens, and they can be really cozy, homey places."
Recent Alumnus,4,The student center is very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,4,The mentor program is very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,4,Very helpful in all areas.
College Freshman,4,"As far as race and ethnicity go, there is not much diversity, but there is a lot of sexual and religious affiliation diversity.  Everyone is very accepting of everything.  "
College Freshman,4,"Very nice cafe that has healthy, organic, vegan, and vegetarian options as well as meat-lover dishes."
College Freshman,4,"Beautiful blue skies almost every day.  Gets hot and dry in summer, but very nice and in fall and spring. Winter gets cold and we get a bit of snow."
College Freshman,4,"Small campus, but beautiful brand new dorms that are eco-friendly.  Beautiful buildings made of old wood and metal.  Landscape around campus is also great."
College Freshman,4,"Cheap housing very close to campus.  The houses aren't exactly mansions, but if you are a college student I don't think you will be complaining.  Better, but more expensive housing up in the hill farther away from campus."
College Freshman,4,"Very small town, lots of old western charm.  Good events go on in town, but sometimes it gets a little boring.  THe bars are always fun!  There's a street called Whiskey Row that has a bunch of old western bars"
College Freshman,4,"There are many small, local restaurants that are great to go to. Also a lot of authentic mexican cuisine.  There is also a good amount of fast food and chain restaurants if you are looking for something cheap and quick."
College Freshman,4,"Prescott is a small school, which makes it a very safe place.  Barely anything goes unnoticed there, kids going missing or causing a scene because of their drug use never happens."
College Junior,4,There's no social pressure to do drugs or drink to socialize.  
College Junior,4,"The best aspect of the campus cafe is the atmosphere.  It's a beautiful spot where other students work and hang out, and study.  The menu items are pretty solid, but it can be repetitive."
College Junior,4,"Wireless in all campus buildings, plenty of Macs and PCs available at the library.  The digital photo lab is well equipped with Mac computers."
College Junior,4,New dorms built a year ago.  Beautiful facilities with kitchens.
College Junior,4,"The campus is a safe environment.  There is campus security, but they are not seen much.  Things like theft and vandalism are very rare."
College Junior,4,"There are no college funded sports teams, but the college is a hub for outdoor education / adventure education.  There are a lot of athletic, outdoorsy students here, rock climbing is very popular.  There are some intramural sports available."
College Junior,4,"Professors are great, classes are great. The other students' lack of efforts can bring a class down sometimes."
College Junior,4,"When I was there for orientation in September, the weather was great. The nights were a bit cool for me, but then again anything below 60 I consider too cold."
Recent Alumnus,4,I did not attend the campus daily. I only had to go for orientation. I did the mentor program in Tucson.
College Senior,4,Prescott College takes pride in promoting healthy food choices. They serve all organic and non-GMO foods. They also have their own garden. The prices are a little high but I believe it's worth it. 
College Senior,4,Prescott is a very safe town. I don't worry about my safety on campus. 
College Senior,4,"Prescott College is a green school. They use solar panels, they compost and recycle, and they even have a garden where locals can buy fruits and vegetables. The library is beautiful and the librarians are very helpful. "
College Senior,4,Prescott Arizona is beautiful. There is a real nature like feel to Prescott College. The school is close to downtown Prescott. The culture is very much that of a small town and people are very friendly. People here are very active and take good care of their bodies. 
College Junior,4,"The weather is almost always beautiful, a great reason to enjoy the outdoors!"
College Junior,4,"From the students I've talked to and met, it seems to range from all ethnicities and backgrounds, even international."
College Junior,4,"I did not encounter any challenges while applying for this program, my application process was very streamline and simple. The most important criteria for admission was the essays and letters of recommendation. Tips for admission would be to utilize the admission counselors, they are wonderful!"
College Junior,4,"I worked with a few permatculture students in a watershed management class, and they were very hardworking and outgoing."
College Junior,4,"I haven't been able to participate in any yet, but I have heard form current students that it is a beautiful facility with a strong emphasis on the outdoors."
College Junior,4,"Although I am starting in Spring, I have heard from current students that the classes are challenging but very rewarding."
College Junior,4,"I really like the limited-residency aspect of it, and am very excited for the colloquia. The program seems very independent and close-knit."
College Senior,4,"What you see is what you get! Prescott College is the only school I know that lets you enter your information online and see exactly what your award amount will be! I haven't seen another school transparent enough to tell you up front what scholarships you'll get. A basic, upfront, online calculator is identical to what the financial aid office uses to determine institutional aid amounts.  Compare numbers with them…they’ll match. Got to http://www.prescott.edu/apply/true-cost-calculator/index.html"
College Senior,4,"Prescott College is really supportive of self-directed learning. The school has offered so many courses that I am interested in and are right along the lines of my degree plan, but when there were areas that I wanted to study that the school didn't offer, staff and administration practically bent over backwards to help me achieve my goals. Some of those goals included learning a foreign language and traveling abroad, both of which the school has limited opportunity for with the courses available."
Junior,2,"Administration is very disorganized and consistently delivers delayed responses. Much of the student body has a demographic of faux woke hippies, many of whom are drug addicts. The academics are not very rigorous and I didn't think it was a motivating or safe environment to learn in. The selection of classes is terribly limited and the somewhat decent offerings are generally related to sustainability studies or adventure education. Only one language is offered. Everything is too tiny including the ridiculously small number of students. At least half of the people I met during my first year either transferred or dropped out.  You could find a much better value and nicer environment elsewhere. This school is for a very specific type of person. I will say I liked nearly every professor I worked with."
Junior,2,"Unless you are in Adventure Education or Environmental Science, then don't waste your time and money here as that is where all the funding goes. The college is very unorganized and there is zero transparency. They will lie straight to your face in order to get your foot in the door. The inspirational core faculty students and opportunities to study abroad through teaching out universities are only things redeemable about this place otherwise find another program. You will have more resources support and actually earn a degree that will help you in the real world."
College Sophomore,2,Prescott does not have an on campus fitness center
College Freshman,2,Tough getting scholarships for grad programs.
College Senior,2,Prescott is an expensive place to live because most of the buildings are old and it's a tourist town. If you lived off campus it would be very easy to walk to class and you'd have easy access to other shops. Some landlords in the area aren't the best. Parking can be an issue as well. 
College Senior,2,Prescott College is small so there isn't a lot of computers to use on campus. The speed and reliability of the network are good. You have to pay 20 cents per page you print which is hard for students to do. 
College Senior,2,Downtown Prescott is very close to Prescott College. There is a street there called Whiskey Row. This street has several bars. Other than that there really isn't much night life. 
College Junior,2,"The school is mostly white upper middle class privileged kids.  For Arizona, it's fairly diverse and pretty tolerant/accepting of people from different backgrounds/lifestyles."
College Senior,2,"Getting financial aid at Prescott College is easy enough. I don't think it is easier or more difficult than any other school. However, the offices here seem to be very disorganized and students should really be proactive about knowing what they need and what should be happening. Often if it is left to the school to make sure all paper work gets completed and everything goes right, it won't."
College Junior,2,"The bar scene in the town of Prescott is not very diverse, plenty of biker, cowboy, and dive bars though. As there are not very many younger people in Prescott, this is not very surprising. Yet, many Prescott College students hold potlucks at their houses and those hold a much better social scene than downtown Prescott."
College Junior,2,I dont think I can answer this question completely but I would say most rules are meant for the good of the students although I know one student who was kicked out of his house for a bad reason and that is reflective of an overstrictness that should not be used especially with older prescott college students. The compulsory dorm life for the first two years I think could be limiting as well.
College Junior,2,"The campus is small and only has one small cafe. The food is excellent and offers many vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. A lot of the food prepared comes from local farms and ranches. There is no coffee shop! The cafe does not stay open for mornings, evenings, or weekends. And it is a little bit expensive. Luckily there are plenty of cheap restaurants within walking distance of the school."
College Freshman,2,"This school is very good in class sizes and faculty! But the college as a whole is very unorganized, very expensive and to be honest not sure if its worth the money."
College Junior,2,For me it works. For most it doesn't. Aside from small house parties and pot-lucks the nightlife is non-existent.
College Senior,2,"Be Prepared – Everything is in close proximity if your stay on campus or nearby.  Any class that has feild trips there always is a van and driver. There is no college shuttle for town, most people bike."
College Sophomore,2,"No Late Night Options Available.. Nothing available past like what 8 or so, or on the weekends"
College Junior,2,"Not Much – most things are within walking distance and there is a shuttle to the phoenix airport. There are people that have cars for getting out of town on the weekends, but having one doesn't hurt either"
College Junior,2,"Not very politically or religiously diverse.  However, socioeconomic status varies greatly, and this helps to bring several different points of view to the table during class discussions.  As well, the combined resourcefulness of students and the community has helped to create an environment where those in the lower income bracket, such as myself, have not had to worry about food, transportation, or couch-surfing when necessary.  Also, this is a very welcoming and accepting community for LGBT students, with a non-profit Pride Center located nearby."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There's not really any buses around Prescott, but at the same time, it's so small you can survive quite nicely without a car. It's easy to walk to school, coffee, bars, grocery stores without a car, or to bike. There's a great shuttle to Phoenix that is very affordable, and taxis that are pretty cheap too. So, it's definitely possible to get around. The airport in Prescott isn't really worth using, it barely runs any flights."
College Freshman,2,"The computer access at Prescott College is quite average, computer labs are able to be accessed from 8am to 5pm; and the wireless internet is quite slow but gets the job done."
Alum,1,Extremely disorganized online courses with many typos and grammatical errors in the syllabi and lesson plans.
Alum,1,"If you'd like to see an example of the level of literacy this school produces in (some of) their graduates look no further than the ""NA NA NA"" review. A college with such a high acceptance rate is more invested in how much money a student is capable of paying them than their reading comprehension."
Alum,1,Extremely unorganized as a whole and administrative incompetence. If you have a valid concern or problem don’t expect them to help you at all. A lot of things about this college is not worth the money that they charge.
College Freshman,1,"No athletics really.  No school teams, there are some club sports, but they are very casual."
College Sophomore,1,They have a few but I personally am a student who cannot afford college at all. They have scholarships for this situation but don't give them out! I am unable to attend this college. Horrible support.
College Sophomore,1,"No local transportation other then taxis.There is a bus service but it is slow, rare and expensive. Not good for college students at all."
College Freshman,1,"There are none in the college. A bit sad when you come from three sports per year. More than a bit, actually."
College Senior,1,"They only offer five ""Competence Areas"" and let you self-design within those areas. There are very minimal requirements a student must meet in order to graduate and from my experience these have in NO way prepared me for graduate school or a career. I've had to transfer to a school with a similar program in order to get the education I need to actually work and succeed in the real world."
College Senior,1,Many of the buildings are old and the science labs are two rooms with less equipment than my high school chemistry class offered.
College Senior,1,Many of the buildings are on the historical roster and VERY inappropriate to hold classes in. They're tiny casita type houses and the one large classroom building only has 8 rooms.
College Senior,1,"There is no bar set for anyone- you can elect not to get grades and just receive credit. The majority of the students are bourgeois bohemians who spout communist ideals while smoking pot between classes with their parents paying the bill. It's an all play and no work school. Tests are called ""Celebrations of Learning"" and consist of poorly done PowerPoint presentations where everyone comments on the effort of the student rather than the quality of the product. You have to be so self directed to attend this school and get something out of it, and even then the course offerings are so anemic that it's hard to graduate."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Less Faculty Equals Less Student Satisfaction – the more they lay people off, the less support there is for students"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Everyone Gets in, Everyone Succeeds – there is no admissions standard, nor ore their uniform class expectations"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Everyone Gets in, Everyone Succeeds – This school has no academic standard, either for admission or for classwork"
College Junior,1,"As the school's financial situation continues to decline, many on the staff have been laid off, or not replaced upon retiring, so that there are now people doing the jobs of other former employees, often these people's only qualifications are being a warm body in the right place.  school doesn't seem to notice and/or care about how the experience of students are effected.  I know of numerous students who were accepted here to study in areas the school doesn't even offer.  These students are blamed fir a lack of self direction."
College Junior,1,"There Isn't One. Prescott doesn't have a nightlife.  There are a few bars and coffee shops open after 8pm, but almost everything closes down at 5.  A lot of the students accommodate by going to Phoenix or Scottsdale on the weekends, and by hosting potlucks with one another."

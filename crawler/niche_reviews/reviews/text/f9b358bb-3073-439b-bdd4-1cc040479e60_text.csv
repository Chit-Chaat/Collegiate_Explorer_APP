Freshman,5,"So far I have only taken a History class online. Despite not meeting any of my classmates or professor in-person, I feel that I learn just as well as if I were in a classroom. The material is very engaging and it is easy to follow along. With that being said, this online class presents a challenge that helps expand my learning and problem solving."
Graduate Student,5,"Before this Quarantine and COVID-19, I have never taken an online class. Since the change in society, we switched over to remote learning and it is good. It is new for everyone including the professors, but the transition has been pretty smooth in my opinion."
Graduate Student,5,"Ever since my first visit freshman year, the community was amazingly inviting.  Not just those on campus but around the whole town of Leavenworth."
Freshman,5,I love the small town atmosphere and being able to connect with anyone and everyone no matter where you are on campus or off. Everyone is so kind and interacting. I love the ammount of love everyone shares for sports and the crowds that go and cheer one another on. As well as the student activities they put on that open freshman up so we aren't as nervous and we make new friends right away and continue to do.

Alum,5,I recently graduated from the University of Saint Mary. I loved it here and it was a place that shaped who I am.
Niche User,5,"A very welcoming environment as well as staff. Offers detailed information on scholarship opportunities they offer. Small community which is to students advantages as professors do get to know you. So many ways to get help with school work. Overall, a place to call home."
College Junior,5,"I really enjoy this University, I have been to two different other colleges and this is the first college where I feel teachers really want to take care of you. Teachers that I have not had yet in Education courses already know you and as you walk by them they will greet you. I feel this school is very hands on and love the atmosphere."
College Sophomore,5,Being that this is a private school it offers many scholarships to help towards tuition.  I applied for a scholarship past the due date and still got awarded the scholarship.  There are also academic as well as athletic scholarships available.

College Senior,5,"Students at the University of Saint Mary are students from Texas, Florida, California, Colorado, etc.  The students are very well dressed here and show very good presentation for our school. The social life is partying or playing sports.  Interests are usually sports, drama, or school."
College Senior,5,"Being at the University of Saint Mary, and in their education program, was very enjoyable for me during my completion of my major.  The teachers were very personable, the classes were small and the teachers did everything to work around your schedule and your work load because they knew that we had to work or play sports. Job opportunities are scarce everywhere so it doesn't matter what school you went to, it is mainly who you know in the school districts."
College Freshman,5,Physical Therapy programs are extremely competitive and being granted admission is difficult.  The biggest things that lead to a successful application process are grades and the personal interview.
College Freshman,5,There are many scholarships that are available at the college.
Freshman,4,"I think that this is a fantastic University and I could not see myself going anywhere else. The only downside for some is that it is a very small campus, therefore it lacks the things that large colleges may offer. With that being said, the professors and student life on campus are very engaging and provides many opportunities for students. Overall, I would choose to go to this University again and feel that this is the best place to grow as a student."
Alum,4,"I personally enjoyed university of saint Mary for the simple fact that the student to professor ratio was great. Once I graduated I had so much respect for my professors because they treated me with respect and we all seemed to be a very tight nit community within the school. The school is also very heavy on critical thinking and developing your thoughts, so yes there are a lot of papers that I had to do but it made me a better student and it helped you learn."
Niche User,4,It has a nice small campus that has up to 30 students per class (Like a High School). The scenery is beautifl as well.

Sophomore,4,"The University of Saint Mary is a very welcoming, small environment filled with friendly smiles and caring hearts. I could not have picked a better fit school for my personality. The professors are beyond willing to work with each of their students in hopes to lead them to success and a bright future."
Graduate Student,4,As a student I hated school growing up. Teachers never understood my learning style and never gave me the patience I needed to learn and retain information. It took my Grad school at the University of St. Mary to finally enjoy school and learn and not feel judged. Very welcoming and friendly staff.
Senior,4,"The University of Saint Mary, has many great teachers. While some of the teachers are difficult  the teachers are aleays willing to soend extra time outside their classrooms to make sure you understand the material. Which isnt something  you'd get at any other  college!"

College Freshman,4,I really have enjoyed my first year

Junior,2,"Very unorganized school. The Overland Park campus could not get school placements together for student having to observe in the schools. Some of the teacher are good,
But one teacher I had was horrible she would not accept work unless it was perfect and said if it not perfect than she will fail me . I do not recommend this school. Save your money ."
College Freshman,2,The sisters are the source of this schools problem.
College Freshman,2,I am considering transferring at the end of the year. I do not fit in at this school.
College Freshman,2,The dorms are very old and need to be remolded in a bad way. There is very few floor or dorm events. My friends that go to other university have a  lot more dorm activities.
College Freshman,2,Soccer is the only thing keeping me here. The coach is amazing. A couple of professors are good. The people are not welcoming

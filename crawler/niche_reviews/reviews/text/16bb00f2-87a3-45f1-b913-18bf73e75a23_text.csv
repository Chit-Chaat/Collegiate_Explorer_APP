Sophomore,5,"I love MGSU! The professors and my financial aid advisor have been the highlights of my college experience so far. I'm a sophomore now, but the first semester of my freshman year was very challenging.  I had poor study habits; still had the mindset of a high schooler. I didn't take the class rules serious but I learned quickly that high school and college were nothing alike. Throughout my struggles, the professors were helpful. Offered tutoring and any support I needed. They continue to be helpful today."
Freshman,5,"I personally love the classrooms. The teachers have time to help you if you need something. Unlike bigger classrooms where the teachers must just teach and if she needs to help a handful of students she/he may not be able to due to the time in the classroom. The food is great you may hear otherwise but don't listen to them. You must eat the food to see and taste for yourself. The rooms are great which I lived in a suite so I get a room to myself and my roommate gets his own room. The classes are flexible and teachers will ask if you need help or see you struggling. what I would like to see improvement on is maybe if the rooms had carpet and if the cafeteria would stay open past 7pm. The student life always has something going on. movies, get togethers, and every week u receive little post cards of the parties that are going on."
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful college!! Would 10/10 recommend to any up and coming college freshmen! You save money and get to live near home, it's a win-win!"

It is one of the best programs in the country and they get you everything you need to become a successful airline pilot at a major airline.
College Freshman,5,in my personal opinion my school is really hands on with every major they offer .
Freshman,5,"Most of the classes are very mall, so this gives the profferers the chance to have one on one time with students. All of my professors know me by name. This is very nice compared to bigger colleges. All of the professors at middle Georgia strive to help students be the best they can be."
College Sophomore,5,"The overall experience foe me was great. Classes was great and the students and teachers that was in the class was amazing, and the help your received from advisors was great. Everyone we're nice and if you needed some help with anything, the teachers where willing to help you find that help. Anything and every little thing counted. The classes was average sometimes. Then you had some classes where there was about 10 or 15 people who attended. Some classes was longer than others and some teachers teacher their lesson and then you could leave. Classes was good and the many different students in them was great, because you could talk to or socialize with all different races. On the other hand, the class descriptions where simple and straight forward. Really everything was great and easy to catch on too."
College Sophomore,5,The school helps students find career based jobs after they have graduated
College Sophomore,5,"My first semester attending college was easy. Any problems that i had i always found help with the issues. As i got into my second semester, some of my classes were difficult and i needed help. Everyone was supportive especially the teachers.Any questions that i had they would help and even find time to do a study session to make sure that i got the material down. Class sizes were just perfect. They range from 30 to 40 students. They was never to big. When i sign up for my classes, it gave me a variety of choices to chose from for my degree. And also my adviser help me chose some of my classes which was best for me."
College Sophomore,5,"There are so many careers to choose from at my school. The school recently change from a college to a university so now there are many choices of career and degree programs that people can choose from. Before i even came to the school, i receive emails from recruiters about the school. Everything was a easy step such as financial aid, housing, classes, and etc. Admissions at the school were willing to help me succeed through the easiest process as possible and less stressful."
College Sophomore,5,"My major at my school is nursing. Its one of the most competitive programs in the united states therefore lot of people want to be come nurses. This degree is either a bachelors degree or a associates degree. The workload is not easy but everyone including counselors and professors are willing to help people if it does get hard. As you progress in the program, my school gives opportunities at local medical facilities where you get on the job training and also helps you learn more about being in the medical career."
College Sophomore,5,"My school is a great school. It allows many opportunity's for students. Because its away from many big cities, it allows students to focus more on there education. professors help the students with everything.

College Junior,5,5-Star program if you ask me. The New Media and Communication program is great!!! We have teachers that are very dedicated to the craft and have real world experience.
Sophomore,4,"Middle Georgia state is a great alternative if you are low on funds and can't seem to score any scholarships. The professors try their best to give you quality education and are no different from any of these other high end colleges. The only negative thing about MGA is that the events that they have aren't shared well and are usually quite boring, so the campus life is sort of subpar. But, that's to be expected because it's a commuter school."
Sophomore,4,"The online classes at MGA are easy to follow along with and we use a website called Brightspace that allows the students to communicate together with discussion posts, teachers use it to assign homework, and it keeps everything organized for you. The curriculum seems to be easier and more organized when online due to preplanned lessons and work being due at the end of the week instead of everyday."
Sophomore,4,"MGA is a school of many campuses and I had the pleasure of living on the Cochran campus while commuting to the Eastman campus. Both are quiet little towns with not much to do, which is a great thing if you’re like me and prefer to focus entirely on college. Just because there is nothing to do outside campus, doesn’t mean you’ll have no social life. MGA has an amazing group of students who always host something fun to do like mini golf nights or silent discos. Another wonderful thing about MGA is how willing the professors are to help out any and all of their students. There are tutoring groups, study nights, and all sorts of ways to help you academically succeed. My first year of being here was a roller coaster. It was going so well in the first semester until we had to leave in the middle of the second semester due to Covid-19. Luckily MGA acted quickly and students were placed online. Middle Georgia State University cares about their students, and it’s pretty self evident."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy attending Middle Georgia State University because of the small school feel and the many academic programs they offer cheaply. They are five campuses spread out over the heart of Georgia region and each campus offers an unique learning experience that you cannot get at a big college or university. I personally am pursuing a career in Aviation and Middle Georgia provides great education and opportunities for me to take advantage of, so that I may be successful down my career path."
Freshman,4,"So far, I have really enjoyed my experience with Middle Georgia. The staff and faculty have been super helpful and welcoming. I've loved my classes so far and I'm looking forward to the next few years with them."
Sophomore,4,Middle Georgia is now going fully online which i am very happy about. Their quick response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been great.
Sophomore,4,I like how they are embracing the change to fully online classes due to Covid-19. Swift change and swift action so great work!
Sophomore,4,Middle Georgia State university is a great school. I have been there for about 4 semesters; I don’t have so much issue. The only issue I have is organization. Some informations are not properly given to student which is not so good. The teachers are good and ready to assist you.
Sophomore,4,Online experience was great but you much be self discipline to get along reAlly good. My online experience during this pandemic was not so good because I was practically teaching myself complex stuff I needed assistance with. Classes with lab like anatomy and physiology is difficult to study online and get better understanding. Because the classes were shifted to online the professors changed their questions type to be more difficult which was not good.
Niche User,4,I am a upcoming freshman and my sister is currently going there and my mom graduated from there. Love the Cochran campus.
Freshman,4,The overall school administration is great! I had a few problems at the beginning of the semester but that was fixed!
Freshman,4,Middle Georgia State University is good college. I like that it is small campus and is easy to move from class to class.
Sophomore,4,"This school is pretty small, so everyone knows each other. I’m rarely on the Cochran campus because I’m currently enrolled in the aviation course. So I can’t really speak on the environment too much on the Cochran campus, but for the most part it seams easy going and slow past. What I  can speak on though is the aviation campus which located in Eastman Georgia. This campus is very busy, professors are also very knowledgeable yet humorous. The food isn’t the best and we’re basically getting robed compared to the amount of food we can get at the Cochran campus for the same price."
Freshman,4,"The classes and Professors that I have experienced have all been top tier. I love the Campus and the daily free activities that are offered. The dorms are nice and independent and run professionally. The food could be better, but other that that everything is wonderful."
Sophomore,4,"Middle Georgia State University is a great university to attend ! There is a lot of diversity, our campus is safe, and they are willing to help guide you to the career of your choice."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Middle Georgia State University because it is very flexible with classes and the times they take place. They have a good variety of online, on campus, and hybrid classes which makes things easier because the classes can work around your schedule to benefit you as you go through college."
Sophomore,4,"As far as academics and food, this school is great. The housing and student activities may need a little work but looking last these the school is great."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the students and staff members. Everyone is nice and helpful. The classes are awesome and the campus is pretty nice. I have not had many issues, but I did have mistakes made with my records when initially applying to attend. They worked quickly to fix the error however and I have not had any other issues."
Sophomore,4,Middle Georgia is a good school academically and the events are fun as well. Focus and you will pass. Teachers are great and they are willing to help if you ask just be sure to check reviews on ratemyprofessor.com first to be sure. If you have any questions you can always email your professor or stop by during their office hours. Housing on the Macon campus is great.
Sophomore,4,"I overall enjoy going to Middle Georgia State University. This would be my second year attending this college and have had a fair experience with everything. Student Life, Library, Campus, Students, Food and such are all average and well and overall a very good college to go to."
Sophomore,4,"Flexability of programs, most courses are available at alternate times or online. Class registration procedures and instructions could be a little clearer."
Freshman,4,"I loved the calm, yet driven enovironment of MGSU. I have not been at MGSU for long, but I have enojyed the little time that I have spent at Middle Georgia. THe professors are driven and really want to see their students suceed in any major they choose."
Senior,4,I would like to see the campus expand a bit. It's a small size. The professors are good and accessible. The front office are easy to contact and make financial aid and housing less of a hassle.
Senior,4,Returning to school to complete my studies at a late stage in life was very challenging for me. The advisors and staff made this transistion a smooth one for me.
Sophomore,4,The college is not too expensive and can be a good place to start your college life. I have heard that the Nursing program is really good. I wish they had a proper computer science program.
Freshman,4,It’s a very good school but it is very boring and student life is almost non existing. My classes are easy but the overall campus is lame . You will be bored almost every day .
Freshman,4,middle Georgia state university is located on 5 campuses and I go to the Cochran campus. it is a good university all round but they lack diversity in terms of international students. Also the school needs to improve on the meal provided for students. After 12 am no food places are open. Definitely needs to improve on student activities being provided. It is a good university all round but they can do better definitely.
Sophomore,4,"I would consider Middle Georgia State as a top Community College. If other community colleges want to be exceptional, then they should look up to this college. My downside with this college is that it's quite hard to make friends. I would part of that could be that Macon folks are generally cold but other if u stick to your main objective of getting an education, then the school is a right choice."
Alum,4,"Great college especially for students who may have to or want to work.  The science professors could have been better but they have 2 really great math professors.  I love the flexible schedule I was able to have, the ease of scheduling classes, availability of tutors & the easy system used to schedule them and the affordability.  Also the campus has a beautiful lake that's great to take strolls around between classes."
Sophomore,4,"Middle Georgia State is a great school surrounded by great people. The campus is nice and also the good. However, there are a couple of changes that could be made starting with the local area. When a student get hungry, the city of Cochran does not have many places to choose to eat from."
Sophomore,4,The thing I liked the most probably were the small class sizes. This made the contact with your professor more personal and it was easier to ask questions especially if you're a shy person. I definitely wasn't a huge fan of the food on campus. I was living on campus and had to get a meal plan. There's also not a lot of freedom to use your meal plan how you would want.
Niche User,4,"During my visit to Middle Georgia they seem pretty serious and dedicated to there subject of teaching. From my visit and my research they do not seem to be high in sports and club activity. I do think it is a great school if you are looking for a college with the lowest tution, in fact it is probably the lowest tutition cost you can get in the state of Georgia for a University."
Freshman,4,I like the setting in which MGA is set in and the professors I've had so far have been wonderful and helpful people. What I would like to see change is the attitude of the staff specifically in the financial aid office. They are kind of rude and have an attitude when you ask them simple questions.
Sophomore,4,"Middle Georgia State University is a great college. It offers a wide spectrum of degrees and allows students to focus on their school work. There is not a lot of student life, but it pays off in the end."
Sophomore,4,It is a good beginning college. It is diverse and the professors are there to help you as much as you need.
Sophomore,4,"Overall experience is fine, as I'm a remote student it's difficult to judge as I've never set foot on any MGA campuses."
Junior,4,"Middle Georgia State University has a big program for Business and nursing degrees. The tuition is very cheap, and you get lots of opportunities in the classroom and outside of the classroom. There are lots of great teachers that will help you in any way that they can."
Freshman,4,Middle Georgia is a great atmosphere. The campus in Macon is very beautiful and easy to get around. The library has lots of resources.
Junior,4,"Aeronautic program is amazing.  Can fly while you don't have classes.  Theres is an airport close by in Macon.
Planes are funded and up to date."
Sophomore,4,"I love this university. It’s diverse, and pays very close attention to nearly every person’s needs to the best of its ability. All of its campuses are gorgeous and the staff truly makes an effort to make sure you feel right at home."
Freshman,4,Very nice campus and housing. The cafe closes pretty early though I wish it stayed open longer. Campus wellness center is very nice
Niche User,4,I took classes at Middle Georgia while I was a senior in high school. I did dual enrollment. I enjoyed the classes that I took here. I don't think it was too hard and I never had trouble with the classes transferring to other schools.
Junior,4,"Middle Georgia State University puts an exceeding amount of emphasis on the teacher/ student relationship. The professors at MGSU are very accommodating, easily approachable, and to put things simply, really care about the academic well being of their students. A down side to MGSU is that a majority of students that are enrolled are commuters, which in turn causes an overall student life atmosphere to suffer."
Sophomore,4,I like attending Middle Georgia State university but what I don't like is the Cochran campus location. There is literally nothing there.
Freshman,4,"I've only been there a year, but I love it so far! The people are great, and the school makes me feel right at home!"
Niche User,4,"At Middle Georgia State University, I feel as if the professors truly care about their students.  They work with you and help with assignments and homework as much as they can.  Nearly every professors I've had at MGSU has had a commitment to students and they enjoy their work.  It is much appreciated."
Sophomore,4,"So far Middle Georgia has been a great university for me! I have made good grades, met new friends and learned more about myself in the process. I would encourage others to attend Middle Georgia State University as well."
Sophomore,4,Gorgeous campus with a decent staff and amazing leisure facilities. Definitely the best bang for your buck in the region.
Freshman,4,"Middle Georgia State University is not located along any major urban centers, so it can be considered a more quiet environment to be around. Teachers vary in their teaching styles but overall tend to be respectful professors who know what their doing and make sure you can get the most out of your experience there."
Freshman,4,"Macon Campus... The campus itself is absolutely gorgeous and modern. This is a school for people who do not crave a big college atmosphere. Most of the students here commute to school everyday, so the campus is not very lively like your traditional 4year college. Teachers are great. "
Freshman,4,Middle Georgia is a nice college and the people are friendly. There are a lot of activities to do on the campus. I love the programs and the different degrees that are available at this college.
Freshman,4,This is my first year here attending Middle Georgia. I have switched my majors several times but I'm sticking with the nursing major. it is a very small town just like where im from but it doesn't offer many places to eat from.
College Freshman,4,"because my school is affordable, people tend to come and get more degrees"
College Freshman,4,my professors make it known that nothing is every going to be handed you have to work for every grade you receive
College Freshman,4,what i like about my school the most is thee workload his not that bad everything is given at a moderate rate
College Junior,4,The specific major I'm in offers a variety of hospitals around me to complete clinicals in. The workload is manageable as long as you stay on task and don't get distracted from things not associated with school.
College Junior,4,Most of the staff is very helpful and try to do what they can to help you. My overall experience has been good. The school is close to home and offers the degree I want so I would choose them again if I could do it all over.
College Sophomore,4,"The qualities of careers and services on campus plays a major part at Middle Georgia. They help you with a lot of different things that other areas couldn't. They help you with aid, job offerings and internships and all more. Career services is big at our school and students and teachers use it to the best of their ability. They offend have job fairs, so it wouldn't be hard to find or get a job in your career. Really, it is a good thing, because they always give you an chance to get you a join your career.  Also the services part it , gives you great options well it come to jobs and other things dealing with this."
College Sophomore,4,"The specific major I choose to study at school was Health services and  Administration. It is a really good field for a person to study if they wanted to work in the healthcare field, without dealing with patients. Most people want a job or career in this filed because they know that it will never run out of jobs. This type of work will always be around , and now in the economy people look forward to getting a job in the healthcare field or anything dealing with it. Personally, I feel that I made a good decision when choose to study and work in this field. It as help me in school because in this field you have to keep your gpa at a certain level. It gives you classes in which you will have to take to be successful in this field. Sometimes the work that you will have to do in order to be great might be a lot, but at the end it will all be worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"From my first year experience, I have enjoyed my college experience. From then teachers to the students, everyone has made a big impact in my life. Not only was the teachers good to you but most understood you as a college student. Most teachers at my school cared for the students and tried to help us if we needed help. I was different, because coming from a big high where teachers could not remember your name to a school where they interacted with you was way different than what you would excepted. I really enjoyed it and I wish to continue my college years."
Senior,2,If you're not enrolled in the aviation school or another specialty program then this is definitely a two year and transfer school. The communication between staff and students is spotty at best and the graduation statistics outside of the previously mentioned specialty schools is abysmal.
Freshman,2,"It is decent but the professors are not always as accessible as they claim, which considering the world's current circumstances is not acceptable."
Freshman,2,"(.) Cochran is a GHOST TOWN! It's in the middle of nowhere. There is half of a Walmart. The majority of the stores are closed. There are only like 3 good places to eat. And ALL of the restaurants have a 3 start rating or below(.) If you want to go shopping, go to the movies, go to a half way descent restaurant, or just have a good time period, you have to travel to Warner Robins, Dublin, or Eastman which is about 35 min. to an hour away.(.) ALL the parties that the school throws always gets shutdown by the campus cops. No fun.(.) The Cafe only has 6 options; Deli (Sandwiches), Burgers and French Fries, Southern Food,  ""International"" (Asian and Mexican food), Pizza and a Salad Bar. The same food you have for lunch is the same food you have for dinner. And the majority of the time the food is not even good. And there is only 1 on campus restaurant, Papa Johns Pizza. So, learn how to cook.(.) There are only 3 Fraternities and 1/2 of a Sorority."
Sophomore,2,"I honestly do not like it. I am now an incoming sophomore and I wish I would have chosen a different school. I am a Criminal Justice major, so if anyone is looking to go there for that major besides Nursing and Business, DON'T GO! I feel like that school only threw that major in there to attract more students. Also, the housing is okay but the Resident Advisors are not sweet. They are rude. We get treated like we are kids.  The school not what I would recommend. I am finishing my sophomore class here just to finish my core classes and then I'm leaving."
Freshman,2,"I artended the cochran campus and it's small.I wish they would expand the university and city of Cochran.There is only four fast food restaurants and a Wal-Mart. Not many places to get groceries.I suggest that no one go to this campus without a car because, everything that you need will be 35 minutes out and there are no Ubers or Lyfts. As far as the university, they should add more to the campus.Most universities are like mini towns and they have everything on campus.This campus only has a Papa John's and a cafe.I did not have any bad experiences with any of my teachers.I like how the dorms are set up.I got a room to myself and my roommate and I shared the bathroom.The tuition for the school was really good compared to most universities.They have a pool which was fun.There was an officer in almost all the resident halls.The school is well diversted and there was about 3,000 students."
Sophomore,2,"Middle Georgia is not ready to be a University! Students who reside on campus basically have to eat of campus from Thursday- sunday due to the fact that the cafeteria is not open; when it is open, it is the same repetitive items, seriously they've been serving broccoli cheddar soup everyday for the past month. The academics are okay, depending who your instructor is. The typical campus environment is nonexistent, it is basically a commuter school with dorms (typically majority of dorm residents go home on the weekends) the students here don't have the mind set to better their future, but only living for today."
College Freshman,2,I don't even know if there is a career service or something similar to it. If there is they do a very poor job of telling us that it's there.
College Freshman,2,"I strongly suggest using Rate My Professor when picking what classes you want to take. Some professors are great and some not so much. Other than that, there is literally nothing to do at this school unless your are an athlete. There are not any credible clubs or greeklife here."
College Freshman,2,This school is not worth the money that is invested into this school. I'm actually trying to transfer as soon as possible.
College Freshman,2,Our college does not offer any of the sort
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing here on this specific campus that I attend in Cochran, Georgia"
College Freshman,2,Not many majors are offered here and a lot of the classes get filled up quickly
College Freshman,2,They don't have a career center
College Junior,2,"You can receive the aid you need if you are fortunate and paying out of pocket, but other than that you may find it difficult if you aren't good or very familiar with using financial aid."
College Senior,2,They're so unorganized. They do not answer the phone when its busy at the beginning of each semester and this school is expensive with mediocre resources. Some of the financial aid assistance workers are rude.
College Sophomore,2,They are very difficult to get in touch with and are very disorganized
College Senior,2,"I feel, as an Art major, that the classes they provide do not really pertain to the major I wish to graduate with. You are supposed to take classes from all different sorts of areas, instead of focusing on one area, like art. Some classes could be better suited for art, like Art history or History, maybe basic math, but science does not pertain to general Art."
College Sophomore,2,"If you are on a computer of their's, it is fine. If you try to use wi-fi for your smart phone or your laptop, it is terrible."
College Senior,2,"Everyone is pretty much from around the area. There is some diversity, the GAMES program is especially diverse, but for the most part, everyone is from around here, and is either white or black."
College Sophomore,2,"Take the Classroom – The problem I have with online classes is that you miss a lot of the questions on tests and quizes if you do not watch your spelling. And if you have a problem, you cannot talk face to face with your professor to settle the issue."
Freshman,1,"I have finally withdrawn my application to attend MGA. After almost three months, I feel like to world is telling me not to attend MGA. I have completed my B.S. and I was hoping to begin a new career in Occupational Therapy in their A.S. program. Having completed all of my general course requirements before, I thought the process would be easier. Instead, I have been back and forth trying to get my transcripts processed correctly. They accepted my English 102 class, but not 101. Not sure how that works. They entered my grades incorrectly (A's to B's), and haven't even tried to help me with other transcripts they should have received. I already have to retake history classes due to Georgia standards. Classes that will never benefit me as military spouse who intends on moving out of state. I was okay retaking those classes, but I am not prepared to retake multiple general classes. I may as well just pursue a Master's program at a different college!"
Freshman,1,"Never got the chance! I was so excited when I was accepted to MGA, but unfortunately too many of the college representatives just responded generically and didn't provide much meaningful help. I will add that one advisor was fabulous, but he was a minority!"
College Freshman,1,"There is literally nothing to do at this school. I hate it. All I do is go to class a go back to my room. The fact that there is nothing around this school in the city makes it 10x worse. The only thing to do here is party, smoke weed and drink."
College Junior,1,The wireless access and reliability of wireless access are almost non existent. There are however many computer labs and printers. I would recommend a personal computer and printer because individual dorm rooms have wall jacks to plug an Ethernet cord into which works well.
College Freshman,1,"Not Helpfull – When I would go to the career services to ask for any help, they gave me generic answers or no help at all.  Nothing to direct me in the right way."

Freshman,5,my cousin goes to this school and he takes online classes. he said its very understanding and the professors teach well.
Freshman,5,I haven't started holy family yet but I cant wait to start. I heard so many good things about holy family. especially with there nursing program!
Junior,5,Online learning has certainly been interesting. I think the professors do the best that they can to assist the students in learning online.
Freshman,5,I have not taken online classes but I hope the University allows us to attend campus to learn physically.
Alum,5,"Taking classes online made things so much easier for me. It was nice to be able to watch the class/powerpoint on my own time and be able to do the assignments when I could, not rushing to finish in between other classes."
Alum,5,"I am so glad that I graduated from Hofam! The professors were sympathetic, encouraging, and altogether down to earth. If you needed anything, they would be there."
Niche User,5,"My experience with Holy Family so far has been quiet pleasant. so far i have spent a fair amount of time talking to their admissions counselor about my admission status and processes, she has been so helpful to me so far and i am so grateful.  Especially regarding important factors like student loans and tuition, i think it is fair to say that no other college can quiet compete with the amount that they help reduce."
Junior,5,"As a transfer student from a two year school, I wasn’t sure what to expect. I love it. Everything is so easygoing. I loved the two classes I had to take to start the BSN program. Semester flew by."
Freshman,5,"Holy Family is a small college made up mostly of students that commute. However, I feel very close to my professors, who are some of the most kind and helpful instructors I’ve ever had."
Freshman,5,"One of the most friendliest Universities out there. The classes are just the right size, so you can have one-on-one with teachers, while meeting many new people. Best nursing program out there"
Freshman,5,Everyone there is so sweet! You’re surrounded with positive vibes! There’s a gym in there. It’s so beautiful. The president of the school is one of the most kinedest people you’ll ever meet!
Sophomore,5,"Holy Family University is a very good college, professor are very nice always helping students and they even have CAE a center that can help students that is struggle with a class, the students just has to schedule an appointment During that appointment the student will say she or he is struggling about and the instructor there will help him or her to understand the problem."
Sophomore,5,"I like that it's a family community, everyone is willing to help each other and the professors are outstanding. When coming to Holy Family, their missions and values stood out to me."
Junior,5,The first impression I got from Holy Family University was how nice everyone was there! They greeted me like I have been apart of their family for years and I have enjoyed learning there.
Senior,5,"I absolutely love the small class size and tons of activities on campus. The campus is small and safe. Also, the professors are all friendly and knowledgeable."
Niche User,5,"Very Clean Place, very friendly teachers and staff. Expensive and limited in majors. Mainly Nursing and teaching degrees. Located in a nice part of Philadelphia. Catholic college that takes education seriously. Decent library. Ok campus food. Commuter College mainly."
Niche User,5,"When I went to visit everyone  was very helpful. They showed me all the opportunities that I would have. The location was very convenient. When I was touring the campus everyone that I asked how they like the school, they had nothing but nice things say."
Freshman,5,"Holy Family University offers a broad range of majors and minors so there are options for everyone. As an undeclared student, there are options for me to decide what exactly I want to major in. 
Overall, I like how small the campus is. When it is cold or rainy outside, the buildings are close by and I always make it there on time. The small class sizes are great for learning and the professors know your name."
Senior,5,"A small school that is slowly growing. Holy Family is mainly a commuter school, but there is still options to live on campus. They are well staffed and equipped for your learning needs. Holy Family staff care about your education and want you to succeed in school and life."
Sophomore,5,"Holy Family is a very outstanding school academic wise. It isn’t a huge school so classes are very small, which makes it very easy to focus in class. Everyone knows each other so it’s easy to make friends, and the professors are very easy to communicate with. The only thing I would change about Holy Family is the campus size and an addition of Greek life. I feel as if our campus was bigger and had Greek life it would be a whole lot more interesting. Other than that Holy Family is a great school."
Freshman,5,I am pleasantly surprised with the diversity of the University.  The students resource center is available and the staff will help guide the students in the right direction.
Freshman,5,My first course at Holy Family was English 115. It was a fun and enthusiastic class. The professor was always helpful and entertaining. I never had a dull moment.
Freshman,5,Holy family is a very small school and I am going to be attending this fall. Everyone knows everyone there. The environment is very comfortable and everyone is fun to be around.
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity and the people. The offices were super helpful and got me information i needed.
Senior,5,"I like the small class sizes, and the one on one time with professors. There is nothing I would change."
Senior,5,Holy Family has lived up to their title.  They have been a second family to be and have shown that family comes first.  The professors at Holy Family are there to teach you and they always take the extra step to make sure their students are on the right paths.
College Junior,5,Holy Family is centrally located in a very safe neighborhood in Philadelphia therefore I believe security will take precaution if there were to have something happen to their students or faculty.
College Junior,5,I believe Holy Family will benefit me in the long room because they career department is very helpful in finding opportunities for students post graduation.
College Junior,5,Holy Family is a very close knit family school.  Staff are very accommodating! The faculty are very passionate of what they do.
College Senior,5,Our security does a great job. When something happens they let us know by email what is going on and show us a video. they are constantly driving around making sure everything is ok on campus. Our security guards also offer to drive us to a near by campus if needed. They make each and everyone of us feel safe and there is not any reason to feel harmed. If you need something you can go right to the security desk and they will go out of their way for you. They also have cameras all over the campus to make sure that nothing happens to the students or faculty.
College Freshman,5,"Holy Family University is a very small school and the people I know are not bad people. There has been no crime or fights since I have been there. The security on campus are very friendly. I trust one pf the security guards more than my professors or counselors with information. I feel very safe on campus mostly because we are so small and I know our security is good. Earlier this year, there was a threat to one Philadelphia University (not specified). Unlike many people, I went to class that day and I felt completely safe all day. The campus worked very well with officers and I felt comfortable."
College Sophomore,5,I feel very comfortable on campus
College Junior,5,The strictness keeps this university in order
College Junior,5,Transportation is readily available as the bus stop is right outside the school and the train is around the corner. 
College Sophomore,5,My major is CMIS. I am happy with my major and enjoy learning more about computers. most of the material I learned came easily to me. I would do it all over again IF I had too. As of now I do not know my career goals. I do hope to become successful in my field. My only concern is to find a job ASAP!
College Sophomore,5,You do not see drugs being used around school. We are a drug free school so they are not permitted.
College Sophomore,5,I take Public Transportation..but there is free Parking at the location I've been to and I also had no problem finding a good spot.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Holy Family is one of the few universities that offers my major as an undergraduate degree which is Pre-Art Therapy. They have excellent staff for this major which has provided me with unique opportunities such as participating in art therapy related activities outside of school, helped me join an Art Therapy board of professionals and provided me with amazing assistance in the internship program. All of this has helped me gain knowledge and understanding of the field and determine that this is the right field for me."
College Junior,5,"Holy Family University is located in such a convenient location.  It is minutes away from the Franklin Mills Mall, 1-95, and the Roosevelt Boulevard, which are the prime areas to be near in Philadelphia.  There are so many things to do, places to see, and areas to eat at near Holy Family from fast food to fine dining.  If you are 21 or over there are also multiple selections of bars to choose from."
Recent Alumnus,5,"At Holy Family I had a biology research intership.  The time commitment was heavy, but the professor I had was great.  He undertsood that my classes needed to come first.  As long as you apply early, you will be placed where you want."
Freshman,4,The things I like about Holy Family University is how it is a religious school and everyone on campus is a community.
Senior,4,Holy Family is a very community based university. I have come across many amazing professors who want nothing more but to see you succeed. It is very close to home and has all of the technological advances you would need at a university.
Junior,4,"Holy Family University is a great school to go to as a commuter. The small campus provides a relaxing and friendly atmosphere. The nursing program requires the majority of your time, and some of the professors will make you feel incapable of completing the program. However, if you keep your chin up and work to the best of your abilities you will succeed!"
Freshman,4,I like the people there however I would like to see more effort out into the sports as track athletes don’t receive any help
Junior,4,"I love my school. I love that it’s a smaller campus, it took me about 2-3 days to know where almost everything is. The class sizes are small and not overwhelming in a giant lecture hall. The only thing i dislike is our grading system but there is nothing i can sadly do about that!"
Senior,4,"Professors are great. Business office, financial aid office are not informative and are at times challenging to deal with. It is a very small school with very little diversity. Some of the student body have no idea of the issues going on in the city the school is located."
Senior,4,"School itself is good, the professors actually care about how you do in their class. If you are anything but nursing though you feel like you’re not cared about. Nursing may be their pride and joy but other programs are doing better."
Sophomore,4,"Small, quiet campus. Private college, therefore pricy. Free parking. Supportive faculty and staff. Grading system is different and tougher."
Sophomore,4,"The University is very small and not overwhelming, especially for incoming freshman. A majority of the classes are very small so you are able to have one on one time with your professor if needed."
Junior,4,"Holy Family University is an amazing school. The professors truly care about their students and the school has such a welcoming environment. The grading system is a little hard to get used to, but definitely worth it"
Freshman,4,"Very great academics, and support from teachers overall. Very little activities on campus, and lack of stability with chem department"
Junior,4,I love Holy Family University for the friendliness. It is a small campus and you get to know A lot of other students. The one thing that I would change is the grading system.
Sophomore,4,"Holy Family University is a pretty good school. The class size is small, which is something that I really like. The professors are nice and the campus is pretty and easy to move around. However, the tuition is a little costly."
Sophomore,4,"Holy Family is a great commuter school, and allows you to make great friends while being close to home so you are able to work, volunteer within the community, and also take part in many extracurricular and clubs."
Niche User,4,"i like the majors they offer and they were very friendly. i want to take up communications and journalism as my major. the financal is very goog and they they really made me fill welcome when i came to take a tour with my program, college possible"
Sophomore,4,"I recently just transferred to Holy Family University. I am a nursing major and i'm excited to experience the rest of my college years here because they have a great nursing program and the environment itself is very welcoming. It is a smaller campus, but it helps you create a good relationship with your professors, you are not just another student in the class. The grading system is hard compared to other colleges around the same academics, but I think it is a good challenge and will make me feel awarded after I get an A in a class."
Freshman,4,"Holy Family University (HFU) is a great school for students who are looking to be in a small and personal classroom environment. Every professor wants to see their students achieve great things and they do all they can do help students succeed. HFU is located in Philadelphia, so students have access to many types of educational opportunities and internships. HFU is a pre-ivy league school and students who attend HFU are often very committed to their studies. Additionally, while HFU is a Catholic University, it is open to many students of different races, ethnicities, religions, sexualities, etc. HFU is a welcoming community that aims to make every student happy and comfortable. If you're looking for a small, cozy school in the city with great access to academic opportunities, then HFU is the school for you!"
Freshman,4,I like Holy Family University because it is a small school. I personally did not want to be in a big school and this is perfect for me. Being a small school makes class sizes small and gives teachers the chance to truly get to know each student which is very helpful.
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love it here. Although I am a freshman, I've made many new friends in the same year as me as well as other years. The campus/student life is very busy. Professors help one on one as you need them. Gives the true meaning and value to Holy FAMILY."
College Sophomore,4,"Our school is pretty small, which means that the classes are small. This makes it easier for us to interact with the professor. A"
College Sophomore,4,"At the start of my freshman year, it was scary because I didn't know anyone. Also I didn't think that I was smart enough for college, but with the help of my wonderful professors, I gained so much confidence. That is why I think my school is unique, the teachers truly care and want there students to do well. If I had to choose again, I would still choose Holy family because the environment is so friendly."
College Senior,4,"I never had a serious problem with any of my teachers but that some of them don't speak clear english and it makes it difficult to understand what I am learning. Another problem I had was that a new teacher wasn't willing to help the students outside of class. Otherwise, I have had no problems and the problems i had the took care of right away. My professors I have are great and very professional and you can tell that they want to help you succeed in everything we want to do. The quality of the courses is great because they make it easy to understand when it is hard to understand. I like that the classes are smaller because we get more one on one time with the teacher and we usually work in groups which makes it easier to understand for everyones knowledge."
College Senior,4,Having a degree from Holy Family University is great and people say its good to come out with a degree from there. they have a huge alumni network that is constantly growing. They always have people on campus willing to recruit people for jobs and they are always having joe fairs for the students throughout the fall and spring semesters. The quality of career center and services on campus is great because they make you feel like its the real world and make you understand what you have to do when it comes time to get a job. They also do whatever they can to help you look for a job in your field.
College Senior,4,I do not live on campus but I have seen inside of a dorm. I think they are very small for the price that you pay but i know that the people who live in them treat each other like family. It is convenient for the students since it is right on the campus next to the buildings and the cafe.
College Senior,4,I feel that Holy Family coaches are very great with their athletes to make they strive to do good on the field. Holy Family athletes do great when it comes to games but I feel like they could do better with trying to get moe students to come to their games. The students do go but not as many as other schools. I feel like our pride for the athletes should be stronger but they do great with having their facilities up to date for the athletes.
College Senior,4,Going to Holy Family University was a great decision in my opinion because I feel like it is easier to learn in a smaller environment. I receive the help I need because there is not a lot of students. The professors know us by name and they make us feel very assured that we will be ok when we get out of there to get a job in our field. I wouldn't choose any other school because they make me feel like a family with the other students because they make us interact with each other a lot because they know that is how it is in the real world when you have a job. socializing with people in my major helps me understand my major a lot more and makes me become friends with people I never seen myself talking to. I enjoy this school a lot and overall I think its a good school to go to. What I think makes Holy Family University unique is that it focuses a lot on religion but makes sure that you know about the other religions outside of catholicism. I enjoyed this because it made me understand how each and every religion is different in their own ways and it showed me to except other religions just like my own.
College Junior,4,"I loved every class that I've had and taking so far. Most of the professors are great, and I learned a lot of knowledge in the courses and I also have a relationship still with most of them."
College Junior,4,"I do not play sports, but from what I envision our sport teams are extremely hard workers and have won several championships."
College Freshman,4,"The health and safety security at our campus is in fact one of the best I have come to know. The guards are always aware of who walks on our campus, and what they are doing. Even if the guards have seen you every day, for a long time, they will still ask you for your ID just to make sure everything is up to date. Many people find this action ""unnecessary"", but the way I look at it, in a matter of moments anyone could decide that they wanted to do something bad, or something between the lines. When the guards double check ID's, and know everything that is happening on campus, that it making our campus a safe and healthy campus, where the student body, teachers, and staff are free to walk around - especially in the warm spring weather.

Our campus is on the corner of Frankford and Grant Avenue, and it is a very open campus. Anyone is free to walk in, and walk around as they place if they pleased. Therefore it is necessary that the security guards keep up the great job, and continue to know everything that occurs on campus."
College Senior,4,My nursing classes are challenging (as they should be) but very valuable. I enjoy attending lectures and continuously learning.
College Freshman,4,"All of the professors I have had so far are very friendly and understanding. Four of the six of my professors are very funny, they make many jokes throughout the class which helps the class go by faster. All of my professors are extremely understanding, before moving on to another topic they make sure everyone in the class understands it and I really appreciate that especially since it was my first semester in college. My class sizes have been average, about 20 people a class. Only one of my classes I had a little over 10 people. The courses have been good. They offer a variety of courses."
College Freshman,4,"I love my school! I never thought I'd actually LIKE school. I am currently on SGA and Ambassadors. I am also in the Honors Program and I have a work-study job. It is so fun and easy to get involved on campus, even for a commuter. Part of why I love HFU is because I am so involved I get to know so many people, including faculty, and I know I will also have a support system. The only reason I only gave HFU a ""4 dot"" review is because of the grading system. It is not as bad as people make it seem, but it is extremely frustrating when a 93 is only a B+."
College Freshman,4,"Holy Family is a small school, perfect for those who are apprehensive about going to a large school and getting lost in the social aspects and change. Although on the pricey side, it has that homey and comfortable feeling similar to high school. I am glad that  I listened to myself and understood my personality in choosing a small school instead of feeling required to choose a large one."
College Junior,4,"It is a dry campus which means no alcohol ever, even if you are of age. Noise violations not very strict. they do take our safety serious."
College Junior,4,"I am a per-nursing major, you do not get accepted into the nursing program until you are a second semester sophomore. The nursing program is hard because it is what the school is nationally known for.  Once you are in the program it is very easy to get a internships at the local hospital, it is actually apart of your needed credits for graduation."
College Junior,4,"Nothing Usually. School has a 67% acceptance rate- so it is fairly easy to get into. Most important criteria would be the letters of references and community service, HFU is looking for students with good characters."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a lot to do in Philadelphia. Closer to the school, there is movie theatres, malls, mini golf, and diners.. Not too far away, there is South Street, museums, stadiums, zoos, and fine dining. There are different modes of transportation, such as cars, taxis, trains, buses, and walking."
College Sophomore,4,"Holy Family is a very diverse campus; no student is exactly the same. There are people who come from different backgrounds, social statuses, who have different religions and sexual orientations than others, yet, no one is alienated because of who they are or what they believe."
College Freshman,4,"At Holy family universities the athletes are good. Students do involve in sports, game or any kind of activities.  Team performance is good and fans do show their support."
College Freshman,4,"Holy family universities campus is very strict and great. Staff members, faculty members, and students are very helpful. The location is very good for transportation or any kind of stores."
College Freshman,4,"Holy family universities campus is very strict and great. Staff members, faculty, and students are nice and helpful."
College Sophomore,4,They make you feel really comfortable. I just have concerns about finding a job in the field because there arnt that many available.
College Sophomore,4,The weather doesn't really affects the campus experience.
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of computers available to the students. There are computers in the library with a quiet section and there are multiple computer labs in the different buildings. There is also excellent wifi available if you wanted to bring our own laptop. I have never had a problem of finding a computer.
College Junior,4,It's fairly easy to be admitted into the university as long as you meet the requirements. I believe the minimum GPA for entry is a 2.75. If you want to gain admission into one of the more rigorous programs such as nursing I believe the requirement for entry is 3.0 overall and a cumulative GPA of 3.0 in all your science courses. Please do not take my word for it as I'm not sure if they are accurate and they may have changed slightly due to the high amount of applicants yearly. My best piece of advice would be to apply EARLY! Also make sure you look at all your options because nursing school can be quite expensive.
College Junior,4,"We have quiet a few labs with computers. However, every lab is not guaranteed to have a printer."
College Junior,4,The process from the beginning has been relatively easy and straight forthcoming. All staff and professors are more than willing to assist you whether it be in person or via email. I love it here
College Junior,4,I have recently started my accounting internship and I am looking forward to hopefully being offered a permanent position upon completion.  I feel I received the knowledge required for this job at Holy Family University
College Junior,4,I see ethnic groups of all races and there appears to be no issues.  I myself talk to all ethnic groups and do not judge by race or religion or political views
College Junior,4,Security patrols the area pretty consistent in their school operated vehicle.  I have not felt unsafe in any way. 
College Sophomore,4,There is no process for getting into a major if you declared your major with your application.
College Sophomore,4,The school is an average catholic university. Holy Family has a small campus. The main issues with Holy Family are parking and some buildings are dated. The teachers are nice and I personally feel like I am getting my money's worth at this school. One unique aspect of this University that it is placed on a slope.
College Junior,4,"I switched into my major. In my major, I will have to continue on with grad school to achieve my goal. That would be true in most colleges."
College Junior,4,Small class size. Knowledgable professors. However many professors are adjunct and difficult to meet up with.
College Sophomore,4,There are all different sorts of people from many places. Many people dress the same but there are some who have unique looks. There are people who have different interest but you will always find someone that you can relate to and enjoy those activities together.
College Sophomore,4,All people are different by the way they look or act.
College Sophomore,4,There are many places around the university to eat but the dining options in the university are not bad at all.
College Sophomore,4,Student are not allowed to park where they want to.
College Junior,4,I commute but my friend lives in the dorm. I slept over a couple of times its very nice and quiet. I can study without people bother me and everyone i met in the dorms were very nice. There are close apartments complexes that are nice and inexpensive.
College Sophomore,4,"haven't attended yet , but when I've visited the campus it was pretty cool and friendly"
Senior,2,"The grading system sucks and they tell the students who give tours not to say anything about it. A:100-94 B:93-86 C:85-77. The nursing program has plenty of great teachers who want you to pass and will work with you. However, the nursing program betrayed its students this year. There is a policy where if you fail a class you cannot continue with your cohort and must repeat the class you failed and a pathways to progress class. This semester two students failed maternity and were secretly allowed to continue with their cohort. This is while others failed the same class and were not offered the same opportunity. The library closes at 10pm Monday-Thursday, 4pm on Friday. During finals week the hours remain the same, where most schools have extended hours that week.  There is no “college” vibe if that’s what you want; it’s more like a high school. Lastly, the campus security is more like a babysitter than someone who’s supposed to make sure you’re safe."
Sophomore,2,Professors to  teach better not hold students back from their dreams when they work so hard to better themselves.
College Sophomore,2,Sports at my school is not a big thing. The reason is because most people come for there nursing program.
College Freshman,2,"Very expensive, first year residents are required to get an overpriced meal plan"
College Sophomore,2,Holy Family is not a school like temple or pen state.
College Sophomore,2,The nursing educators don't care if you are kicked out. And they do not understand the amount of money thrown into the school
College Junior,2,"There is not much diversity on the campus. The majority is Caucasian and trailing right behind would be Hispanics, Middle-Eastern, Asians and African-Americans."
College Junior,2,The nursing program is very rigorous the grading system is tough
College Junior,2,Parking fills up easily in the lot and since the school is located in a residential area those spots fill up quickly as we'll. 
College Sophomore,2,There are only a few computer labs around campus. When they are open they are very crowded and you have to wait for an opening. Also the wifi here is terrible and very slow. 
College Sophomore,2,The school buildings are old and have not been refurbished for a while. There is only one new building. The athletic facilities are average but they are small and do not fit many people. 
College Sophomore,2,There are no unique qualities about our school. It is average in every way you look at it. 
College Sophomore,2,It was a struggle to keep everything in order and we had to constantly come in and fix mistakes done on our fafsa.
College Sophomore,2,"The dining options on campus are very limited. There is only one dining hall on campus and the hours are not good. If it is too early or too late, we have to find our own ways of getting food since the dining hall is closed. The menu does have a variety, but recently the dining hall was closed due to a health reason, which makes me not want to eat there. The meal plan can include up to 19 meals a week, but I would rather have no meal plan and buy my own groceries because it is more convenient and a healthier option."
College Freshman,2,They do have sports but since I do not play any I really can not be judge. I went to a basketbal game with some of my friends and they did pretty good. it was not one of their best games though.
College Freshman,2,There is little opportunity for living off campus =.
College Freshman,2,The part of town where Holy Family is is quite. There isn't much going on at night.
College Freshman,2,Too many commuters and not enough parking. Be sure to get to school about 15 minutes prior to class to look for parking on the streets
College Freshman,2,"There are a few off-campus houses across from school.  The plus is that they are conveniently located across the street.  The only downfall is that there are very few and if there were more, I believe it would attract more students."
Sophomore,1,"Horrible experience. Unfair grading, rude students and professors. Not many positives. Choose better nursing school. Nobody deserves this kind of low treatment and learning."
Sophomore,1,"Horrible experience. Unfair grading, rude students and professors. Not many positives. Choose better nursing school. Nobody deserves this kind of low treatment and learning."
Junior,1,"DO NOT GO HERE! Speaking as a prior nursing student, they do not care about your success; they are greedy and will nickel and dime you every chance they get. So far I have had only 3 professors who generally cared about me and wanted me to succeed. The assistant dean is very passive aggressive and is no help, she intimidates the students and most of the professors (they will never confront her). Look at a different college for nursing, do not waste your time or money here."
Junior,1,Ive worked ny butt off to be turned down for nursing program when others who have had lower gpas have gotten in. They pick who they want in no matter how hard you work. This is horrible they take your dream away.
College Sophomore,1,I don't know if we even have fraternities
College Freshman,1,"Grading system is absolutely horrible (worse than Harvard), the students are cliquey and not at all diverse(most come from the local catholic school). The school is insanely small making it hard to socialize and meet new people, along with the fact that it's mostly commuter. Due to the small size, classes are extremely limited I think the max size is around 23 people per class. Completely strict attendance policy and most of your grade comes from homework and participation. Overall, feels like high school all over again."
College Junior,1,no night life. Not a party school. Mostly commuter.
College Freshman,1,Student Center – The student center needs major improvement. It does not have the technology that is needed to help the students
College Senior,1,Not Very Helpful – The financial aid office is not knowledgeable or helpful.
College Freshman,1,Not a Greek Based Campus – This campus is not a Greek based campus at all. For those that are looking to go to a Greek social based university this is not the university for them.
College Freshman,1,Limited Space – There are not very many spaces you will find on Monday through Thursday.
College Junior,1,Or Lack There of – We have the Greek  honor societies but no fraternities or sororities.

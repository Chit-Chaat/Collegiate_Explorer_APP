In addition to the textbooks that are provided, my instructors provide visuals to ensure that students obtain a thorough understanding. This school understands that life happens.

They help me out a whole lot through my journey to make sure I have everything I needed before my courses got started. They even still call me still today because they don't want me to give up because I have came a long way and almost finish. Grantham University is a real good college to attend especially if busy with your personal life, there are online courses that can be offer."

I enjoy my experiences with this University and I know they are there to help me be successful.
Freshman,5,"I started at Grantham about 2 months ago and I'm so glad I did. I had it narrowed down to about twenty schools and meticulously went through them all. After all the pros and cons of each one, Grantham was at the top of my list. Everything about the process has been awesome. The student advisers and professors are there for anything at all you need."
Junior,5,This is a great school especially if you have obligations during the week. The staff is very friendly and most of the professors answer in a timely manner when you e-mail them questions. Student advisor is very communicative about how classes are going and encouraging. Overall great experience with the school so far plan to have bachelor's late 2019 - early 2020.
Graduate Student,5,I have had nothing but an excellent experience. The faculty advisors are experienced and very professional. If you are looking to go back to school i would highly recommend to attend Grantham University and the university is very affordable.
Sophomore,5,My experience at Grantham was filled with a lot of support from Professors and other faculty members that really care about students education and future.
Graduate Student,5,"Great online school. All advisors and financial aid are very helpful, keep me up to date, and always help me stay focused and prepared on what's to come next.  have recommended the school to everywhere I know! Teachers are also very friendly."
Freshman,5,Admission advisor quick to answer any questions an accommodate times I was available. Walk threw on anything I needed help on . Very impressed with school.

Freshman,5,This school has been wonderful. I am 48 yes just starting college. I have no job experience (stay at home mom for over twenty-one years) I have also been hearing impaired since I was 15 years old. I never did well in school. The staff and Professors have been so amazing. I'm getting all A's and B's! Due to their patience and help. If it wasn't for Grantham I wouldn't have lasted a week in school. I'm almost done with my first year!
Freshman,5,So far I like my classes and instructors. The students are friendly. Advisors are always helpful with keeping up with assignment dates & grades.
Freshman,5,"I am still enrolled at Grantham University online, but my experience so far has been phenomenal!  Everyone I have talked to from financial and education advisers to students and teachers have all been extremely friendly and helpful."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the overall courses and the professors. I like the availability that taking courses online allows you the flesxibility. I wish the school would allow additional financial assistance as FAFSA is not always so helpful for students who are full time
Senior,5,"In my opinion, it was a great online university. Most of the professors were understanding, helpful, and responded in a timely manner. The courses were challenging but not extremely difficult. Thank you Grantham University for the experience I received as an online student."
Junior,5,That the professor do help you with your school work or they'll tell you where to go and find what you looking for
Graduate Student,5,I loved the fact that they accepted a lot of credits that were transferred from other universities. I only had to do the minimum residency credits and a couple of capstone classes when I transferred.
Senior,5,"I was looking for a school to finish my degree that I had started while I was in the military.  I researched tons of schools and was looking for a college with great reviews from students, but one that was also very affordable.  Grantham University was it.  They worked with me to accept as many of my hours from my previous colleges and come up with a plan that would get me to my degree as quickly as possible.  I highly recommend Grantham!!!"
Senior,5,Grantham is a very good school everything is online but every teacher and advisor is there to help and they try their best to help you finish all courses with no complications.
Graduate Student,5,I completed my BS in Multidisciplinary Studies through Grantham University. I loved the ease of the schedule. You have to sign in twice a week to submit your work. You can sign in anytime and submit your work before the date it is due so you can manage your own schedule. The professors are great at communicating with the class and answering any questions you have.
Niche User,5,"I am a prospective student. I have done my research and read the reviews. Overall this university had a good rating. My experience may not be of the full time student, but when credit is due, credit is due.

If you want an excellent explanation of the admissions requirements, course overview, transfer credit review, and financial aid help this is a good institution to start talking with. 

The advisor that I am assigned is well mannered, knowledgeable, and if the question can not be answered it soon will be. Good job!"
Junior,5,If you are motivated to learn you will do great in this school. They give you all the material and guide you on what you need to learn. Exams are adequately based on material covered. Most instructors are great at feedback and helping you out.
College Freshman,5,Grantham has done a great job at being flexible. I had taken a class last semester and two weeks into it I decided it wasn't the best for me. I was able to with drawl from the course.
College Freshman,5,Getting the students involved with LinkedIn for the first course is a great idea.
College Freshman,5,"So many courses are available for a student to take, being that I already had credits from Shippensburg University, Grantham was willing to move some of my credits which was a major stress reliever."
College Freshman,5,"After completing 2 years and Shippensburg University I decided it wasn't for me, so I choose to go to online schooling. It is by far the best decision I have made so far. Everyone I've had contact with at Grantham University is fast in response time and very nice."
College Freshman,5,"It was an amazing experience, they always make sure that the student is set first"
College Freshman,5,The courses and professors are great and they always make sure that they keep you up to date on when things are due
College Freshman,5,I loved the way that they make sure that you are set as well as happy
College Freshman,5,It is a great school for the military and they always make sure that you are well taken care of
College Junior,5,the little time I've been there I've had no problems with anything.
College Junior,5,online classes are better for me because its a lot easier for me to focus on my work with almost no distractions. in a classroom I have other students that like to converse during study time or like to be disruptive and distracting when the teacher is teaching so I don't get my full lesson as I would online with no noise distractions. also I don't have to deal with any pranksters online like I would in a classroom.
College Junior,5,the classes are all online so there are only 6-9 students in each class which makes it extremely convenient for me because the teachers attention isn't to stretched. but for it to be online the teachers are very thorough with their teachings and always there to help understand the misunderstandings.
College Sophomore,5,"To me my experience with online courses compared to traditional classroom is great because you can work at your own pace aslong as the assignment is turned in on time, you don't have to be in a classroom with lots of other people who may ask questions that have already been brought up in a lecture by a teacher, you dont have to worry about being late to class, and you dont have to drive to the school."
College Senior,5,The registration process is very fast which is great because we want to make a better life as soon as possible. Students talk to each other and help each other if needed. The professor's are constantly helping you move further in your course and pushing you to succeed.
College Senior,5,The college is determined to help you get a job in the field you want.
College Senior,5,The size of the class doesn't matter especially being all online. The instructors are always making sure they tell us if we need help to email them and they will help you succeed. I love this school...
College Senior,5,Grantham has internships that are great. They have people that help you build a resume so you can start work elsewhere while furthering your education.
College Senior,5,My major is an associates in Criminal Justice and it consists of two courses each eight weeks. The only downside is you don't get a break...
College Senior,5,I would choose Grantham University all over again if I had to.... It is an awesome school and has great faculty staff that will work with you and help you succeed.
Freshman,4,I love the medical admin assistant program! Most of my professors are awesome. Im learning stuff I never thought possible.
Freshman,4,"Even though it's an online school the staff there is exceptional, from admissions to advisors to your professors. Everyone is hands on and personable and available. There are many resources offered to each student to help to obtain every level of success."
Senior,4,They are easy to work with and very flexible. Courses are challenging but not roo hard. Blackboard program is easy to navigate and the school has every resource you could think of the help students.
Senior,4,The online learning is pretty neat. The only downfall is having to write a paper for each class every week. Most of the professors are nice and help you out any way they can. The only issue I have is not being told about financial aid.
Graduate Student,4,"Grantham University was a good university. I am not going to give it less than four stars.
Good points:
-Responsive/helpful faculty/staff
-Clear courses
-Easy to work with
Bad points:
-Not regionally accredited
-Coursework not always graded correctly
-Visibly horrible students seem to pass as well."
Senior,4,It was a great school and I will be finishing my BA in criminal justice as soon as I finish my other degree first.
Sophomore,4,Very flexible environment. 100% online learning. Instructors and staff are easy to reach and very responsive to questions or concerns. Classes are similar in rigor and pace to other more reputable schools. Course material is current and relevant. Classes are encouraged to participate in group discussion and collaborate on projects. Discounted tuition for military affiliation. Overall a good experience so far.
Senior,4,Grantham works with you to get your degree and be ready for the future. My advisor works to ensure I take classes I need and will enjoy.
Freshman,4,Grantham offers a really good variety of programs. However be prepared to go through the entire financial aid/admissions by yourself.
Freshman,4,"So far I am enjoying my time in Grantham University for my first year.  I have learned so much from the online courses that I have taken so far.  So far, I do not have any recommendations regarding changes that I like to see.  I am looking forward to my future online courses."
Senior,4,THE TEACHERS AND ADVISORS STAY IN TOUCH AND MOTIVATE YOU. THERE ARE RESOURCES TO HELP WITH YOUR CLASSES. 
College Freshman,4,Online courses take just as much work as an in the class course. The advantage to online courses are that the student doesn't have to sit in a class room to learn. They can learn at home.
College Freshman,4,"The first class I had at Grantham was a class to get myself out in the real word and known so one of our assingments was to create a LinkedIn account, I feel like in the future this will help me a lot because I can always update my information for all the jobs out there to see."
College Freshman,4,"I just recently switched my major, but so far its going great."
College Freshman,4,I loved that everything is online. I am better with technology than I am with other people
College Freshman,4,The teachers make sure that you know everything and with it being flexible and great.

College Senior,4,The courses are relevant and no hard but challenging.
College Senior,4,I have been off and on with Grantham for awhile. The courses are easy to navigate and the advisors are there and willing to work with you. I am at the end of my Junior year and I will finish here. I am also thinking about getting a Masters from here.
College Sophomore,4,The quality of professors at this school is great i've only had one bad experience as the professor took weeks to reply to my questions on an email. Other than that one professor i've had great communication from them and they are more than willing to go out of their way to help you with an assignment or help work with you if you have a busy schedule the week an assignment is due.
College Sophomore,4,"The workload isnt to hard, they are willing to take a lot of time out of your day to help you learn to the best of your abilities. They will personally email you if they feel you are struggling in the class or if you get a low score on an assignment."
College Sophomore,4,Great with communicating will work with you if you are working for the military and away for training.
College Senior,4,I have had zero complaints so far when it comes to scheduling with my university.
College Senior,4,"I like online classes. I learn easier with real classes, but I can learn just as well with online classes too. The workload is very manageable. Signing up for the class was pretty easy, normal process and standard procedures. We talk to the other students a lot, so there is a lot of student interactions."
College Senior,4,"This school has many options for my degree of choice, computer science. I plan for a bachelors, but we will see if I want to get something higher."
College Senior,4,"The overall experience of school is great. I have not checked into internship prospects yet, but I believe they have those. I have an online school, however they do have a campus as well. I do not know about the other services on campus."
College Senior,4,"The academic experience is great, because my military job is administration. My schooling is in computers, and I am learning things that I can literally apply the next day when I walk into school. Computer science is a great choice for me, and I love the classes I am taking with it. The staff and faculty have all been helpful."
College Senior,4,"The school is great for a number of reasons. They support the military. Being active duty, it's great to know they have our backs. The school work load is workable. It's not a lot to where it's over bearing, however it's not a little bit to say ""this school is a walk in the park."" I recommend my school to everyone."
College Senior,4,I have been able to choose all of my electives hassel free.
College Senior,4,I have never taken online course with any other business but at Grantham the process is easy.
College Senior,4,I am curious to see how reputable my degree will be once it is obtained.
College Senior,4,I've been a student for over a year now.  So far go go as far as my cirriculum. The financial process is a headache and I have to stay on top so I don't get over looked as far as meeting deadlines.
College Junior,4,They have a Career Service center.  I haven't looked in depth into it because I still have over a year until I graduate with a Bachelor's Degree.
College Sophomore,4,I wish the programs were a little more accelerated but it was great to find in electronics engineering degree online.
College Sophomore,4,After much consideration after talking with the advisors from the school I have chosen to make this my college
Recent Alumnus,4,I only have but two more classes too go. I need a little bit of more just too get though with my class o will need about 3500 hundreds dollar so I can get done with school.
College Senior,4,I'm planning on furthering my degree.
College Senior,4,I take an online course.
College Junior,4,"I enjoy the flexibility online courses offer but you need to have discipline and patients when attending classes online.  

Sometimes it can be difficult to post discussions to peers when all the answers seem to be the same"
College Junior,4,"Overall, I am pleased with the school. It is very costly to attend. I have never been shut out of a class I need to take. They are a fair university if you have an issues. Class size is very small. The style can be boring. 8 weeks of papers and discussions, rarely varies from that."
College Junior,4,There are online career center options and help if you request it. I do not know about the alumni network to make a comment.
College Junior,4,This is an online only college. They do not offer traditional classroom experience. Registration process is easy with the help of an advisor. The workload is appropriate for most courses. The only peer-to-peer interaction is on the discussion boards.
College Junior,4,"The professors are hit and miss. With online classes, some professors are more available that others. Registration process is very easy."
College Junior,4,I have had no major issues. I have some good teachers and some teachers that are just okay. They accept most of my out of the classroom credits to apply towards my graduation.
College Senior,4,they have the best relatinship whit all there stundert they is so kind to us
College Senior,4,the career services will help whi your job application so you can get the best job you ever had
College Senior,4,in th economics class that i am in now the professors he is so nice his name is chirs this is the best school that i ever been to so far
Recent Alumnus,4,Getting a Degree in Criminal Justice from this college is outstanding for what I want to do like going to Law School after I get my Bachelor Degree In Criminal Justice.
College Senior,4,it will be a good way that people want other to do
College Senior,4,this is the best school that i ever been to
College Senior,4,I like going to school whit Grantham
College Senior,4,"Resources are on line.  Library, webinars, etc."
College Junior,4,Most of my fellow students are military or ex military. I don't really feel I need to say anymore as their sacrifice for our country speaks volumes.
College Junior,4,pretty easy to work with
College Junior,4,people from around the world
College Junior,4,"There are only online resources, however, from what I have used I think they are sufficient."
College Junior,4,"The school is 100% online, sometimes there network seems to have some issues but it really doesn't affect me."
College Junior,4,"The way it is set up is unique (8 week terms) accelerated learning.  I hear some engineering degrees take about 6 years to achieve through traditional school, and mine is about 3 years."
College Junior,4,"I think it may be hard to get all I need through online courses, but I think they are trying with using simulation programs to help with ""hands on"" stuff."
College Junior,4,Online courses are great because without them I don't think I would be able to get my schooling done.  Sometimes it is harder to interact because there is no face-to-face so it takes longer to get replies and such.  I also feel like some of the material is outdated.
Freshman,2,"So far I have been disappointed.  Supplemental materials provided for each week frequently do not match the course content for the week.  I don't feel I'm getting substantive instructor feedback or communications, not much beyond ""good job, this submission met requirements.""  I am frustrated by having to respond to a certain number of discussion posts, many of which appear to have missed the point of the assignment or contain nothing of significance to address.  I hate the fact that I cannot test out of anything and had to spend 8 weeks in a class far below my skill level."
College Sophomore,2,I have had to fight/argue with this school to get something done.
College Sophomore,2,"I simply wish i would have started at a more ""credible"" school I am very nervous about not being able to use my college credits for anything...."
College Sophomore,2,I think the only thing that was helpful was creating a good resume ( I assume it's good) I was told the resume I created with help was the correct way.
College Sophomore,2,"I am wanting to have a job now, and I have tried to reach out to numerous faculty to help but I don't get much help."
College Sophomore,2,I have had to argue and prove that some of the information provided is not up to date.  I have had to submit complaints and proof to get a better grade for their errors.
College Sophomore,2,I have read that some of the places in the work industry will not count Grantham Credits as valid credits but I am obligated now. It's horrible!
College Sophomore,2,They keep messing up my school fees and I have had to pay more then I was supposed to they also did not credit me a school credit for one of my classes luckily I caught that and it was corrected after I wrote SIX emails to dean and financial officer.
College Junior,2,"Financial Aid is a hassle, there is a lack in the communication.  Classes are easy to attend and they are flexible"
College Junior,2,they only have scholarships for the military
College Sophomore,2,They don't offer anything that I'm interested in. I will transfer after I get all of my core classes
College Junior,2,I feel like $250 per credit hour is stretching it for online classes. I feel like they should be cheaper. I am now paying a $35 technology fee each term which has increased $5 a term every year I have been with them. I am basically paying them a technology fee to use their website that I paid $750 to take a class on. I just do not think that is ok. $250 a credit hour is already up there in price.
College Senior,2,It is okay. It has a job board and have access to career specialists.
College Senior,2,All I Want to Do Is Finish. my experience at Grantham was a good one until my job didn't pay the tuition reembursement.  There was an agreement with my job to pay the school directly.  When my job didn't pay due to funding the school became hostile towards me.  They agreed to let me make payments on the amount owed but that amount was too much for me to afford.  They wouldn't let me make smaller payments.  I had one advisor telling me one theing and another telling me something different.  So as of wight now I have three classes left to complete my degree.  All I want is to finish so I can move on.
College Junior,1,"The classes are $795 and a $35 tech fee.  You will spend a good portion of time on the phone dealing with financial aid, the business department and the collections department.  They are good and transferring you to multiple departments and making you feel like you just a number, most of the time you get someone who does not want to deal with you and they will give you a run around and not answer your questions or help you to find a solution.  

I am very disappointed in the financial aid and the tuition department.  I have had better luck getting a loan from a bank"
College Freshman,1,There Is No Hope – No financial aid for people who arent active duty. Reservists will not get any help
College Freshman,1,this school is out to sucker military personnel and steal all their gi money...and if you are a reservist without TA/GI bill... they don't care about you and steal every bit of money they can from you.
College Junior,1,Frustrating for Me – The weekly quizzes include material that we have not covered. The material is very dry.
College Junior,1,"Lacking Long Term Talk – My school was most concerned with getting me enrolled, and did not discuss long term payment options. They instructed me to use MyCAA first, and get loans as I needed them. I am unemployed, and in dire need of financial aid, and I have no way of getting the financial aid that I need to pursue my education."

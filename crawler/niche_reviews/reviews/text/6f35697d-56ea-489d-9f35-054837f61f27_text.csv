Sophomore,5,This school is great. All of the professors are really nice. The on campus housing and dining is also fantastic.
Junior,5,"Online classes were something I wanted to avoid as I prefer traditional in-class instruction, but with the pandemic going on this year they became a necessity for me if I wanted to stay in school. My experience with them so far, at halfway through the semester, has been pretty good. Some classes are structured different compared to others, but I can tell the teachers are really trying to give us the full experience as best as they can given our circumstances."
Junior,5,"This is a great school. Smaller campus and class sizes, but full experience of college. Teachers and instructors are really dedicated to making sure you not only learn, but also succeed."
Junior,5,Eastern was my first choice of schools and I couldn't have made a better decision. I made so many friends and felt like part of the community! The dorms in Thomas Hall seemed to me as a second home and I loved being part of hall council. There was always activities going on no matter what day of the week.
Junior,5,"I did not take any classes online because i did not attend EIU this year. However, some classes did have online homework!"
Sophomore,5,"Fantastic school! Great professors, a beautiful campus, awesome sports teams and venues! The dorms are generally nice and feel safe! Food is decent and the party scene is unbeatable!"

The campus is very cute and I love the atmosphere here! There are so many different kinds of people here and the teachers are so understanding. I'll definitely be here for the rest of my schooling.

Senior,5,"My experience so far at EIU has been good considering that my classes were already online being relatively unaffected the quarantine.

The advisors I spoke with were exceptional in their ideas, grasp of programs, and advice!"

Niche User,5,As a informing freshman I’ve visited Eastern three times before and I honestly love the campus so much. It feels like a home away from home type of thing. The surrounding area makes it feel very peaceful and calm. The dorms are very spacious and I love how close to campus they are and not too far from classrooms.
Niche User,5,"I liked the friendliness of the staff and professors. The class sizes are small enough that if I have a question for the professor, I won't feel uncomfortable doing in front of about 30 students."
Freshman,5,the one thing I like about eastern is the small campus. everything is located close to each other and is in walking distance.
Junior,5,"Eastern Illinois University provides a great experience for students wanting a safe community, a great education, and small class sizes.  Instructors are friendly and helpful!"
Freshman,5,"There’s really nothing that I would want changed about my school.  So far, I love my campus and professors."
Freshman,5,"I love the environment of the school because the staff and fellow students are very welcoming. One thing that I would like to change about eastern is the diversity of the school, there is simple not enough as far seeing different people from different states, with different nationalities, or ethnic groups."
Freshman,5,Everyone is so helpful and considerate! Never be afraid to ask a question or change classes there are resources everywhere! I love EIU it’s a really great school with a path to hell your future
Niche User,5,"I love Eastern Illinois and their campus. So easy to get around and the staff is so caring! Everyone has gone out of their way to answer questions and help us with anything we need. 
I went to the cashier department with a ton of questions and concerns. The ladies there were so understanding and willing to help me with everything! They made time for me and treated me with the upmost of respect!"
Senior,5,"Eastern I will say is better for academics than parties,. You should focus more on academics than anything else when selecting a school."
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman going on into a sophomore. I  am still going to attend eiu. I think this university fits my lifestyle by it being so active.
Freshman,5,"safe campus, good professors, really care about your success
they aren't afraid to challenge you but overall there is help when you need it

Sophomore,5,Eastern Illinois University is a great campus. It is extremely diversed campus. the classes are small enough to have professors focus on multiple questions. there is a lot to do on campus as well. There are over fifty clubs that students can join and get involved in.
Niche User,5,"What I personally liked about the school is that I like how the layout is, I like that everyone on campus is very friendly and how their classroom sizes are they are not too big but nor are they too small. I like how you can get that one on one with a teacher and are able to make that on one connections with students and teachers. I like how the campus life is, students that I have spoken to have told me that they really enjoy it there and that it all honestly depends on how you spend your time there and what you make of it."
Freshman,5,"Everyone at Eastern Illinois is super helpful and nice. While I was looking at colleges, EIU really stood out to me. Throughout the whole application and acceptance process, they kept in touch with me and answered every question I had."
Freshman,5,I like how Eastern Illinois University have multiple helping centers that students can go to to receive help. The academic advisors also check up on students that need help every week.
Graduate Student,5,"My experience in college provided me with many opportunities and lessons to mold myself into a more confident, independent and life affirming individual I am today."
Niche User,5,"I never actually had an experience at Eastern Illinois University, but majority of my associates and friends attend this college. I have not heard any negative reviews on this college. I have heard nothing but good things at this college. The only thing I have not heard about when it comes to this college is what the food tastes like. I wanted to know if the food tastes good or not because food is a big part of mu life. I love good food and I love to eat good food not disgusting food or decent food, the food literally has to be on point."
Senior,5,"The faculty are excellent and really put heat in their work. They are very knowledgeable and humble at the same time. Care about the students and always have time for them when they need it.
Actually, everybody cares about students and their comfort - all the way to the janitor. It seems this is the trademark of EIU
The campus is very well organized like the layout and like students’ life. It offers a variety of places to eat, rest and study. For those that want to organize their life on their own, there are many restaurants and grocery stores are very close. 
One may choose to not have a car because all is in walking distance and also there is a bus shuttle that goes to town essential places. 
There are many fraternity, clubs, and activities."
Senior,5,EIU offers an excellent online education experience for those trying to complete their education while working. There is a wide variety of degree options available. Tuition is affordable and the school offers the resident rate for out of state on-line students.
Freshman,5,Eastern always makes me feel at home. It was hard findin a college that would offer exactly what I was looking for. They’re very welcoming and excited when freshman come in.
Sophomore,5,When I first stepped on this campus I was scared and did not really know what to expect. But now that I am here for a second year I proud to say that I have officially made this campus my second home. I was welcome and greeted by nice people and by the second week of college my freshmen year I have been making a lot of friend and getting involved on campus. Seriously if anyone was looking for a college Eastern Illinois University is your place.
Freshman,5,The family went here so I did too. It's really nice. Its not overwhelming . If you need to get work done you will and still can go party .
Junior,5,"I am very happy with my experience at Eastern Illinois University so far. It has gave me many opportunities, and I think it is preparing me for my goals very well. It is a school that isn't too expensive, has amazing professors who teach very well, many fun things to get involved in, and is diverse. I love the school!"
Junior,5,"The people here are so friendly. The campus is small and very quiet. They have a lot of fun events that everyone would enjoy. The class sizes are small, and you really get attention for all your professors. There are a lot of tutoring offered for difficult classes."
Senior,5,Small university with a rather diverse population for a rural town. The professors are knowledgeable and personable and the smaller class sizes allow for a lot more interaction between students and teachers.
Sophomore,5,"The school is really invested in your academic success. However, they tend to overreact and assume things instead of investigating them further. the students and staff here really care about each other and that shows."
Junior,5,I love Eastern Illinois there is alot of diversity here and you see it as soon as you step foot on the campus.
Senior,5,"Professors for the most part are approachable and willing to help out. The campus community is very inclusive, in my experience. Every class is within walking distance. The food court could be better, but there is still a decent variety of dining options throughout campus."
Senior,5,I love Eastern because everyone on campus is so friendly and helpful. The first time I ever visited EIU was my senior year of high school and I walked around campus and just felt as if I was at home. The campus is just so welcoming and inviting.
Senior,5,"Eastern Illinois University has been a great help to me. They offer so many RSO's that an individual can get involved with and meet new people. The most important thing that I noticed about EIU right away, is that the faculty and staff treat you like family before you ever make a decision. EIU has done an awesome job at welcoming me, providing me with an awesome education, and making a difference in my life! Coming to EIU was one of the best decisions ever!"
Senior,5,Didn't live on campus but I loved every day at EIU. My teachers were great and VERY helpful. The campus took a hit when money was tight but the workers keep it clean and looking good!
Freshman,5,"I have had a great experience at EIU. The professors are all there and willing to help. Every student on campus has a smile on their face when going to class, and are always willing to say hi. If I could change one thing about EIU it would be the parking. The parking situation at EIU is not the most ideal."
Sophomore,5,EIU is a medium sized school with a thriving international and transfer student population. The student-teacher class ratios are about 15-20:1. I really enjoy being able to create lasting relationships with my professors.
Junior,5,Love the class sizes and the campus is easy to get around. Most professors in the Political Science dept. are wonderful!
Sophomore,5,I like the resources and the support on campus that helps you excel in your classes. The staff on campus wants the students to be successful in their career field and be safe.
Sophomore,5,"Eastern has one of the most positive environments out of any school that I've visited and attended. The location is great, with many stores, activities, and resources within walking distance of campus, and there is always something fun to do. Eastern offers a wide variety of majors, so there is sure to be something there that you'll like, and the majority of the professors are very knowledgeable and willing to help their students to succeed. It's also a very safe campus with a very supportive student body as well as blue emergency polls that alert people to trouble and let you call the campus police. I couldn't imagine attending any other school. In some ways, Eastern feels more like home to me than my own house does!"
Sophomore,5,"Eastern Illinois University is an amazing university. With only 10,000 students, it is very easy to find your place on campus. Eastern has a very welcoming and inviting atmosphere, as well as excellent academics."
Freshman,5,"My expectations of this school was very high because it was my top choice. This school has met and exceeded some of my expectations. the professors are very knowledgable about the course they teach and the course material, they always make themselves available to help. The campus is very safe and welcoming. The student social life at Eastern could be better, more students need to participate in the programs and clubs that are offered. Overall i love this school and i am enjoying my college experience."
Niche User,5,I really loved the atmosphere. The vibe of the school is really cool and overall i just feel safe. The food was amazing and it never failed to have what i enjoyed the most.
Junior,5,"Student to teacher ratio is great have great professors here also the school is in a very quite city (Charleston, IL) and have lots on campus events that you can attend."
Freshman,5,Eastern has very good academics and a beautiful campus.  After only spending a semester in Charleston I absolutely love it!
Freshman,4,"I haven't had to take any classes online but with the few virtual meeting, I was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency."
Niche User,4,Eastern Illinois University has been an amazing experience! Everyone here has been very welcoming and helpful to my during my time here. The campus is very cute and I love the atmosphere here! There are so many different kinds of people here and the teachers are so understanding.
Senior,4,Online is ok and better then in person classes. Some professors will disappear for the whole semester though.
Freshman,4,"Learning online isn't easy for anybody. Eastern is trying their best to help us through this hard time. The classes are harder but the professors are trying their best. They also answer any questions that any students might have. If they don't know the answer, they will figure it out and get back to you."
Sophomore,4,"I had to finish this last semester online due to the pandemic. The professors did an amazing job of adapting and changing their classes so  that they could be taught online. For example, I took Macroeconomics, and the professor utilizes our college's streaming platform."
Freshman,4,"When I came to Eastern, everyone was super welcoming and got me to transition into the college life as smoothly as they could."
Sophomore,4,"Eastern Illinois has a great environment, friendly people in the neighborhood as well as friend faculty and staff!"
Junior,4,"I like that there are a lot of opportunities to get involved if it be a club or an organization, but most of all you get a sense of comfort being there."
Freshman,4,"I like the small community that the school provides, I haven't been their for very long, I just finished my first semester and so far is nice. As long as you stay involved you will be known and acknowledge. One thing that I would love to see change is advisory advising the students on specific scholarship opportunities."
Freshman,4,"I love Eastern! It really does create close bonds with both other students and professors since it's a small school. The only negative thing would have to be that it is somewhat in the middle of nowhere and to get to more populated area (such as Mattoon, the nearest city (with more to offer)) it would take having a car."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love Eastern because of the size of the school.  It's so easy to meet new people all the time and you can always walk to class and have the opportunity to see a friend and talk with them.  I also love Eastern because of the environment.  They keep campus incredibly clean and although Charleston is a smaller town, campus always has something to keep you busy. 
 There are hundreds of different clubs to join, I am involved with the women's club volleyball team.  I first came to campus knowing that I wanted to become involved and I am so glad I did, this is where I found some of my closes friends."
Alum,4,Small college town with a nice campus. Smaller classes allow you to connect with your professors. Easy to navigate and walk to classes on campus. Not much  to do around the area other than pizza joints/bars.
Alum,4,Eastern is a great school with many opportunities and is a great return on investment. The university makes an education affordable and attainable. It is important that the students come first and Eastern does a great job of showing its students that.
Senior,4,I transferred into EIU a year ago and was really impressed by the small campus size and being able to easily connect with both my professors and peers. EIU provides a wonderful atmosphere for academic learning and diversity.
Alum,4,"Eastern Illinois University is a great institution, particularly in the fields of Education and Journalism. The classes are small, which fosters a close relationship with professors, who truly care about their students. Students and staff are also incredibly friendly and always willing to help; they really make you feel at home. The only con would be the location, especially for those who prefer living closer to a large urban area. Besides college parties and local bars, there isn't much to do around town. However, the area is very safe and the Jimmy John's restaurant was founded here by an EIU alumnus. For those die-hard football fans, the football team is not actually good, although Tony Romo and Jimmy G both went to EIU. I'm only giving it 4 stars due to its location, but you won't regret it if you choose to become a Panther!"
Freshman,4,"In the time I've spent enrolled in Eastern Illinois University I have been encountered numerous of nice and helpful people. People always willing to help you with countless resources. As far as in the academic side, Eastern being the small school that it is the one on one experience with professors are very much satisfying. Campus, as well as its environment, is beautiful, calm, and a peaceful place filled with millions of opportunities in things like clubs, professional opportunities, sports among other things."
Freshman,4,I like how Eastern have lots of things you can go to for help on campus and have many resources. Eastern also is the safest college campus in Illinois. One thing I would like to see change is the dining hall food because they have the same thing every week just on a repeat.
Sophomore,4,Eastern I very quiet n low key not to busy bt also not slow. We need better food choices around here tho and more activities for student fun on campus
Niche User,4,"Low-cost tuition, high-quality faculty. The small town means that safety is very high on campus. Also means low entertainment and party options."
Sophomore,4,Very diverse school with affordable tuition. The overall campus is very nice not too small or too big. The are could use more places to go hang out and have fun though. And could also use a wider variety of food options.
Senior,4,The online General Studies BGS program was amazing! So convenient for adult learners like myself who have full time jobs and a family to support. The teachers are great and so happy I was able to complete my degree.
Junior,4,"What I like about EIU is the fact that the campus is considered very small compared to some surrounding schools. Having a small campus makes it easier to get to know people and the walks are a considerable amount shorter to get to dorms, classes, and the dining hall. Although some of the aspects of the school are “average,” there really isn’t something i would change about Eastern Illinois University."
Senior,4,"I chose to come to Eastern Illinois University because of the diversity and the strong benefits that the school provides with my major. Exercise science is big when it comes to this University. This school is also one of the cheapest schools in Illinois and it is 3 hours away from home, so traveling is very convenient. The food is manageable and there are parties going on every weekend."
Junior,4,"Being a student at Eastern Illinois University has been very exciting and helpful in many ways. The campus is the perfect size to walk to and from classes, and it is absolutely beautiful. Almost everyone on campus is very friendly and willing to help if you have any questions that need to be answered. The majority of your professors will encourage you to meet with them one on one and be very helpful and considerate of anything you may need help with. They are down to earth and very easy to talk to. Many of the professors here like to see you succeed and they will push you even when you don't want to push yourself."
Freshman,4,"Comfortable, small campus, but spread out enough. Teacher/Student ratio is good. Quality of teaching is about what I expected. Dorms are decent."
Junior,4,EIU is an excellent value for an in-state option for Illinois residents.  With soaring costs to go away to a four year university EIU offers an excellent education in a very safe and confined campus.  The social life is what a student wants to make of it.  You can always find someone to have a good time(not just partying).  Just go to the Student Rec Center and you can find a pick up Basketball game in minutes or get a work out in to get rid of some academic stress.
Freshman,4,"I am a second semester Freshman at Eastern Illinois University pursuing a degree in Music Education. So far my time at Eastern has been tough, but memorable. Many think college is just a place to come party and occasionally go to class. However, it is true that you must go to class to pass, and many of your professors expect you to show up. 
When it comes to the food, expect to only be eating chicken strips or tacos for the four years that you are here. It seems to be that those are the only meals that the dining halls can prepare.
In terms of campus safety, we have had a few incidents on campus/in Charleston this past fall, but overall you can feel safe when walking back to your residence at night from the library. 
All in all, if you are looking for a small campus with that small town feel, then I highly recommend EIU for you. However, if you are longing for the big university in a city feel, I would look somewhere else."
Sophomore,4,"It was good, I enjoy my time spent in class and walking around classes. Its great to stay active and talk to your professors on campus"
Freshman,4,I have been attending Eastern for a year now and the professors are great. Their main focus is educating the students in the best way for the student. Students are very friendly and is also willing to help each other.
Sophomore,4,I liked that the university was safe and friendly. It was in a good environment. I didn't like that laundry cost so much and I also didn't like that choices of food they offered.
Junior,4,"Eastern was amazing! It taught me so much on reality, importance of grades, social life, and family. We were truly all a one big happy family."
Freshman,4,"I choose Eastern, because my mom went to school here a long time ago and when I came to visit I feel in love just like she did. I think they could change how they advertise the school and where they put their money towards and asking students what they want to see change at Eastern and let the students be involved in that choice."
Niche User,4,"I love the campus! Its not too big and not too small. The people on campus are very friendly and welcoming. I plan to swim at Eastern Illinois University and the swim team is just what I have been looking for. The coach is great and the team is awesome. I really like all of the athletic facilities. And on top of all of that, Eastern Illinois University has the major I want. Charleston is a great city and I can't wait to attend there in the fall of 2017."
Junior,4,"A close-knit community with a great student to teacher ratio that will encourage one's education.  

Academically, it really varies in each department, but everything is really straight forward. 

It isn't too diverse, but are taking steps to be. There is an emergence of more international students as time goes on."
Junior,4,"Small class sizes. Big university education with a small school feel. The community is very safe. On Wednesdays, we eat grilled cheese."
College Freshman,4,I like that there are many resources to finding jobs and internships
College Freshman,4,"I have loved being here so far. I like my professors, I like that I am actually learning. I love my schedule, and I feel the coursework is appropriate for my level of education. I like that classes are smaller and even if a professor doesn't know my name at least they know my face."
College Freshman,4,There are many health resources to choose from and it is a very safe campus.
College Freshman,4,"I love where I stay, and how easy it is to get to all my classes. The people in my hall are friendly. Room and board takes up the bulk of my tuition and fees so I'm not too keen on that. The food is much better than I expected it to be."
College Freshman,4,I love the school spirit.
College Freshman,4,"In all my classes I have been taught by the professors themselves and not by teaching assistants. It's very easy to get around campus. Everyone is friendly. There are many resources to use, academic and otherwise. The campus is safe and it is a good study environment."
College Junior,4,The admission process went smoothly.
College Junior,4,I just started attending Eastern in August . The school is very interested in engaging students to learn and 8nvole them in los of school activities.
College Sophomore,4,I have loved the college experience. The small class sizes and the fact that it is in a small town has made the experience very personal.
College Sophomore,4,"I lived in an all girls dorm. I absolutely loved the experience. I made super great friends while living on campus. There was plenty of space in the room for my roommate and I to live comfortably in. The only complaint I have is that they are so expensive, but I think that that is an issue seen at most other schools."
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part, I have had a great experience with my teachers. The class sizes are generally small, so most of the time it is the actual professors teaching the courses in classes of about 20 students. The largest class size I have experienced was 60 students, but the professors still taught the course. For the most part, the professors have been very concerned about student success, and have been very understanding and accommodating to personal conflicts."
College Sophomore,4,They are several organizations and representations of minorities in campus. I would say everyone is fairly accepting.
College Junior,4,I am an education major and my school is known as a great school for students who are considering becoming a teacher after they graduate
College Junior,4,They help find better ways for us to graduate early and make sure we are taking the right courses
College Junior,4,I haven't heard of anything really happening on campus dealing with sexual assault
College Junior,4,Greeks are very out going and open to everyone about joining their organization
College Sophomore,4,"Great class sizes, plenty time for 1on1 instruction time"
College Sophomore,4,Their is campus police on patrol 24/7.
College Sophomore,4,The school is overall great I'm just not financially stable for it
College Senior,4,"The class sizes are great. Even in lecture halls, the professors take the time to get to know all hundred students. This shows that they care about each and every one of us."
College Senior,4,The administration has taken security measures to make sure that the students experience a safe environment.
College Senior,4,The athletics at Eastern Illinois University provide great experiences for both athletes and non-athletes. The athletes are able to participate at a level that challenges them. The fans are provided great games and experiences to attend and enjoy.
College Senior,4,"Eastern is a great environment for learning. The class sizes are big enough to give that college feel, but also small enough where you are able to experience one on one time with the teacher. The teachers are helpful and want the students to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,I myself feel quite safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Being that I am an athletic training student I am a little biased towards our athletics program. I ""bleed blue"" through and through. Our athletes are respectful and down to earth, and Eastern makes a point to try and recruit local talents as often as possible."
Freshman,2,"Eastern Illinois is located in Charleston, which is a small and isolated town with not much to do.  The campus itself is old but has some nice natural areas to break up the university buildings.  Food is very limited on-campus and most dinners serve the same food more than once a week while limiting hours available.   For weekends and nightlife, there are only a few spots that people tend to migrate to and you'll end up seeing the same people everywhere due to the small campus population.  Athletics used to be known here, especially football, but in recent years the sports teams have begun to fall off.  Very small school feel with not many escapes leaves students feeling trapped."
Senior,2,"Nice campus but town is lacking with restaurants. I’ve always had an issue every semester with something being wrong (ex. Financial aid, classes, books)."
Senior,2,"I had to take classes online due to COVID for half-a-semester. Horrible, some professors just seemed to give up and started handing out A's while others strictly tried to maintain a broken class regimen. I've never been more frustrated in my day to day in my life."
Senior,2,"EIU hurts. Collectively everyone that attends or works at this university is aloof. You won't be challenged, you won't feel safe, you won't feel any culture, and eventually you'll become numb. I attended EIU for two-years as a transfer student out of my community college, a sleek technical school about twenty minutes from where I lived at a quarter of EIU's already generous tuition. It had better facilities, more diversity, art, and engaged professors than the entirety of Eastern. 

Unless this college is close enough to be worth it or tuition is a concern don't bother going to Eastern if you want a fruitful college experience."
Sophomore,2,I feel that I didn’t learn enough during the remote learning portion. I didn’t have the hands on learning and didn’t have full access to my professors as I did when I was on campus.
Niche User,2,"The college looks nice, but they don't seem to care that much about prospective students. When I was accepted, I didn't get so much as an email, and only found out when I checked MyEIU. It was months before I got an actual letter of acceptance. For the most part, the only emails I got were ones telling me to check MyEIU, and I would only to find nothing new from the last time I checked. The most helpful email I received from them was one with a link to a survey that let you cancel your application. They canceled my application in April, and after that, I finally started getting emails about stuff at EIU, and they are still coming. I can't say I regret canceling my application, and if they cared so much then they should have started sending these emails last fall."
College Junior,2,"I, personally, don't have anything against the Greeks at my school. However, I have heard others complain about them and how all they do is party. I have had to sit next to someone who was a part of a frat on campus and he came to class smelling of alcohol and smoke every day and it was disgusting"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Unless you stay in Stevenson, Douglas, or Lincoln the dorm rooms are small. Between classes and dining halls everything is relatively close."
College Junior,2,Pretty outdated and not the cleanest space to live in
College Sophomore,2,"As someone who is Greek, seeing how Greek life functions in the everyday life of the average college age student is interesting. At EIU, I actually believe the social scene involved with Greek Life hurts students instead of helping them, as there is no punishment for not meeting the standards expected of the fraternity or sorority."
College Sophomore,2,"My RA doesn't do her job, so right now my experience is not going as well as it probably could be going right now."
College Junior,2,"Recently, there have been a lot of muggings and thefts. Normally I would feel safe on campus, but recent semesters I do not feel safe."
College Sophomore,2,I hate living on campus. Plain and simple.
College Freshman,2,"Most of the food is fast food, they should really add a different place"
College Freshman,2,There aren't really a lot of scholarships I can apply to with my 2.94 GPA
College Freshman,2,"It is expensive expensive expensive ! This is where most of your money is going , to live off campus is so much better!"
Recent Alumnus,2,Cost is ok but there are not much options in this small town.
College Junior,2,I have not got any yet
College Junior,2,Not much to choose from.
College Sophomore,2,Having to walk across campus through bad weather is terrible.
College Sophomore,2,You definitely need a car while you are here on campus because there is nothing there that is close to get to and things that i like is not there which makes me travel to Champaign where's there is more options.
College Sophomore,2,"They are very strict on everything, and I don't understand why I've gotten a write up because of roommates behavior, it had nothing to do with me i was always in the room doing my own thing, and because of her actions I've gotten in trouble and had to suffer the consequences and I did not understand why."
College Senior,2,"Especially the winter time, it gets very cold and windy. There becomes alot of snow, but I am glad the campus is small for particular weather like this."

College Freshman,2,"Professors and everyone gears things towards greek life, if you aren't in a frat or sorority here you are considered weird. It's hard to fit in being non-greek"

College Freshman,2,Some of the deals are really good but they aren't super close to campus.
College Freshman,2,"Classes are structured at all, and its only a good school for sports"
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much diversity. The majority is either Caucasian or African-American.  But there are definitely other different ethnic groups on campus.  No one is really aware of what economic background you come from.  Everyone seems to be pretty accepting of the different religions and ethnic groups on campus.
College Freshman,2,Different dining halls have different food and there aren't many healthy choices. The salad sometimes tastes dirty.

College Junior,2,"For Applied engineering and technology the workload is fairly light, and there seems to be many students with that major."
College Junior,2,"The food on campus in the dining halls can get old really quick, there isn't that much variety. Most halls are closed by 9:30 p.m. so for those looking for a late night snack there aren't that many options."
College Junior,2,There's a large selection to choose from when it comes to off-campus living. It mostly depends on how hard a student looks.
College Junior,2,"So far I am enjoying what I'm studying, and I am confident I will find a good job in my field."
College Junior,2,"There are always frat parties on the weekends, which are usually fun and safe. Mostly everything is in walking distance."

College Sophomore,2,EIU wifi is worst than ever. They really do need to fix it.
College Sophomore,2,There is more upper class parking than lower class and more upper class stay off campus.  There is a lot of extra space and they do not use it.
College Sophomore,1,"The food places on campus are awful, there is absolutely nothing there."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life here is all about fake tans, dressing inappropriately and drinking till you pass out."
College Freshman,1,"The town is so small that all people have to do is drink, fake IDs are used very often and no one seems to be punished."
College Freshman,1,There is nothing provided for entertainment in this town therefore causing students to resort to partying every night.
College Freshman,1,my majors program was awful. they require me to have it as a minor but consider it a major
College Senior,1,oh my god in my some what student is do drug trust me after school. me no seriously i hate that
College Junior,1,"There are many parking spots, the only problem is the distance to them from the dorms. There are very few/convenient underclassmen parking spots around campus and if there are they fill up very quickly."
College Junior,1,"My school is located in Charleston Illinois, it's a small town, there's a lot to farm land. There are a few parks and lakes around the school, there's not that much to do off campus other than to go to the movies.
"
College Sophomore,1,"the dining halls on campus are terrible. The food is not healthy, and there is no good selection of food."
College Freshman,1,There is no variety at EIU. I would really enjoy a Panera or Noodles & Co. but instead they mostly have fast food options.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I enjoyed the first 2 years here, but regret not transferring thereafter. I did well academically and enjoyed the social environment, but quickly grew bored with the campus and surrounding area. There is nothing to do here. Nothing culturally stimulating whatsoever. Most of the faculty are competent in their respective fields; however, much of the coursework is ""dumbed down"" and is not challenging or interesting. Many of my classmates could barely write a paper in the English language. If you wish to have a challenging academic experience and a fruitful social life with like-minded individuals, you may want to consider attending one of the larger, more selective universities in Illinois or out-of-state, or at least transfer there after 2 years and save a little money and get the general education requirements under your belt. While I have a Bachelor’s degree now and a great career, I do have some regret about not getting out sooner and experiencing a truer college experience. Every decision the University makes seems like a joke. As I understand, the selectivity of admissions and general quality of the campus, including safety, has deteriorated further since my departure. I sincerely hope this does not lessen the value of my degree. 

Pros:

- Good value (cost perspective)

- Plentiful campus employment

- Competent faculty

- Excellent career services/job fairs

Cons:

- Wasteful, bureaucratic administration

- Unhelpful, uneducated staff

- Not challenging coursework

- Low performing student body (noncompetitive)

- Unspectacular in every way (not desirable academically, or even as a party school as there are only a few dumpy bars)"
College Freshman,1,I dont feel safe on the campus at all. I hate this place dont go here
College Freshman,1,"I was over their food after the first week. be prepared to buy groceries. you will soon get tired of pizza, pasta, and sandwiches trust me. I spend about 20 dollars on groceries a week. Hate the food options period the meat looks nasty. 

And the meal plans are all stupid. You will be starving if you dont grocery shop or have care packages."
College Sophomore,1,"The selection of houses and apartments is costly and you don't get bang for your buck.  The high prices don't include utilities.  Families who need a place to live in town must still pay the per-room rent that is offered to college kids.  The places for rent are ok, some are really small and dumpy, others are in good repair with strict landlords.  A few people in town own the majority of places to rent.  They just do what is necessary to keep it live-able."
College Freshman,1,The students are extremely party-focused and most of the professors are completely unprofessional. Many of the professors also do not seem to have a master of the material that they teach.
College Sophomore,1,"They say they place you with your likes and interests and people similar to you, but somehow I was placed on a quiet floor in an all girls honours dorm."
College Sophomore,1,"I can never walk out of the office happy, they are deceiving and will say ""We emailed you about that"" when they never did."
College Sophomore,1,"Lots of Rain – It likes to rain a lot, thus concluding that when you are walking to class you find yourself trudging through water just to get there because the sewer system is horrible.  It was a good idea to invest in my rainboots!"
College Sophomore,1,"Always Fined. Parking on campus is a joke.  Its hard to find a spot to park for class, and there isn't much parking available for freshman and sophomores.  The university likes to give out a lot of tickets so be careful of where you chose to park the car."
College Senior,1,"Eastern police is very fond of passing out tickets for any reason they can find.  I have a feeling the town makes most of its revenue off of college students who park in the wrong place.  The signs aren't very clear where you are allowed to park, so it's easy to make a mistake"

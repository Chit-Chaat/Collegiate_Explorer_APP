Graduate Student,5,So far it has been challenging when connecting with colleagues. Its hard not meeting or seeing each other in person. However professors have fine a good job!
Graduate Student,5,I love how engage professor a are via zoom classes. Especially during Covid. Campus looks beautiful but can't stay because of covid. So far ordering books online has been also tough but great communication from bookstore despite all confusions. Professors also understand the challenge so they have been very supportive regarding books.
Senior,5,"Due to the recent pandemic, I have had all my classes online this semester. While I was worried I would not be getting my money's worth this semester, all the professors at APU have worked so hard over the summer to prepare for this upcoming semester and have consistently provided us the best education as well as necessary preparation for future coursework as well as post-college routes. Professors have created accountabilities for students so that students do not fall behind and they have done an exceptional job in creating a classroom like environment in the sense of connecting with each student. Although the classes have been virtual, I still feel like I am in the classroom due to the professors doing a marvelous job at creating a sense of community with each student in the class."
Senior,5,"If you are looking for a place with a great community and personal relationships with your professors, I highly recommend APU. APU has smaller class sizes, therefore the professors focus on you more. Some may be wary of that fact, however all the professors here truly care for you and will work with you day in and day out to ensure that you are not only receiving the best education, but also that you have the best experience and are ready for the world beyond college. In terms of community, I have never been to a place more welcoming and exhilarating as being at APU. Every person will instantly make friends there and everyone is so open and friendly that one would make instant connections and friendships. I have never felt such a sense of community prior to my college experience at APU. Overall, choosing APU has been one of the best choices I have made in my life."
Sophomore,5,This year is so far all online. It's tough but APU offers so many services to keep you motivated. Professors have been fantastic at getting us motivated during this fall semester.
Sophomore,5,Amazing university! I have made lifelong friends during my freshman year. We are all online this year but making the best if it. We all stay connected. Such a positive atmosphere at APU.
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any online classes with APU as of yet but will take Fall courses online due to Covid-19. To prepare us, there has been productive and resourceful interactions via Zoom and emails. Their sister School, LAPU, I had the experience of their online program and it was exceptional! The content was robust, faculty and staff very present and it is because of APU’s standards set forth to have online learning. So, I have no doubts as I begin online learning this Fall that it will be any different than the template that has been laid out with their sister School. There was ample content to be successful and achieve your goals via their online approach! Do not hesitate, try APU for higher learning you will not regret it!!"
Freshman,5,"Azusa Pacific is a Christian university who values the whole person and not just the academic side. Being someone who returned to college in my adult years, returning to college can be daunting, but they were there to make sure I was prepared throughout the transitional phase from one institution into theirs. Applying to a specific department of higher learning was made simple with the top notch admissions process."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Azusa Pacific has been a positive and life-changing time. I have been able to make strong relationships with other peers with my interest and most importantly, I have been able to grow my faith in Jesus."
Junior,5,"I am currently still attending APU, but overall my experience has been a very positive one. I have made a lot of friends and connections with people as well as learned a lot about myself. It has been a time for me to dive into my identity and who I want to present myself as to the world."
Senior,5,Due to COVID my classes turned into online classes. I think that the professors gave it their all to teaching and it showed.
Senior,5,Professors were all very understanding about deadlines and were very helpful in still giving the same type of education they would in person
Senior,5,"I loved the friendly atmosphere of students and staff however I wish we weren't as sheltered. The campus is very faith based and as someone who is not Christian, it can be hard to fit in. However, I really appreciate the experiences I had through chapel and even faith through integrated learning."
Graduate Student,5,What I enjoy the most about Azusa Pacific University is the centered focused learning that allows the student to be more closely engaged with their education. It is an adult learning program and a fast paced environment that requires a lot of dedication. It is a prestigious Christian school with a successful graduation rate and a great learning experience for a successful career. I would highly recommend individuals who are interested in nursing to attend Azusa Pacific because they will complete their program within 18 months and obtain a great experience. The staff are very friendly and willing to help and address any concerns you may have. This university will make your journey an enjoyable one with great educational background and strong foundation in nursing.
Freshman,5,"I love that it is a Christian based school! They are offer small class size, and have a great reputation for the nursing program! I have had nothing but a positive experience with gaining the help and guidance that I need in finding any resources!"
Freshman,5,"I have no taken any online classes yet! Everyone seems very friendly, uplifting. There main goal is help students succeed!"
Sophomore,5,"I love attending college at Azusa Pacific University. This past year was my first year of college and I loved it. The transition was so easy because of how small the campus and overall university is, and everyone on campus is so friendly. I especially love the professors working there. They are so dedicated to their teaching and to the education of all students."
Sophomore,5,The transition APU had from 100%  in person learning to 100% online was very smooth. The professors and all administration gave curtesy and offered help to all students so they could continue being dedicated to school work. All staff was very kind and understanding to all problems and attempted to relieve some of our stress by changing certain class methods.
Senior,5,"As far as the academics go, APU is spot on, they know what they're doing, and the instructors are great."
Senior,5,My overall experience with Azusa Pacific University has been a pleasant and welcoming environment. All the staff has been approachable and always willing to help us learn. I love that the University does incorporate a spiritual background into our learning. The University is also very diverse which is one of the things that I love.

Junior,5,"I did take classes online prior to this pandemic and it was very doable. The professor is still very considerate if you aren’t used to having a class online and they understand your needs. When switching online due to this pandemic, professors, staff, and my job, everything transitioned online was smooth and they all made it simple and easy!"
Junior,5,"I have not graduated from APU yet, but I absolutely love the school! Along with the faculty, staff, and students! Everyone is so welcoming and everyone cares about the students needs! I love how professors are understanding and even this transition to online, all of my professors and my work at the IMT Support Center have been so supportive and understanding with the situation!"
Sophomore,5,"Excellent staff, student organization and campus. Each new semester, students can join an ""Alpha group"" where they meet with students from similar areas (commuters, transfers, etc.) The school of Music in particular is home to attentive teachers and mentors that prepare them for their future careers."
Freshman,5,"I just finished my freshman year in Azusa Pacific University. I absolutely loved the environment and my campus life in APU. Since APU is a Christian school, you are able to deeply learn about Christianity and theology. I am currently majoring in nursing and I think APU has one of the best nursing program. Professors are really nice and knowledgeable. I strongly recommend APU if you want to learn more about God and if you want to study nursing. This shool has a great nursing program!"
Freshman,5,"Our classes changed to online during this March and I really appreciate the efforts that our professors made. It was quite difficult to carry on the lectures with online apps and there were some inevitable problems that we had to face too. However, our professors tried their best to solve these problems and uploaded the recorded lectures for students who had a problem listening to the synchronized lecture."
Freshman,5,I took a few classes online because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Having those online classes made me really appreciate having the opportunity to learn in a classroom but the professors were still great so that was nice!
Freshman,5,"My experience at APU was amazing! I live in Trinity Hall and my hall really made the experience a great one for me. Everyone liked each other and we were all outgoing at the beginning of the first semester. As a freshman I found myself busy a lot. I was either doing homework or I was playing ping pong in the lounge with “the boys”. For anyone that attends APU, I highly advise to be outgoing that first weekend or week that you are living on campus. I’m not from California so I needed to make friends fast and the only way to do that was to be outgoing."
Graduate Student,5,It is a small campus which makes it easier to get to class from the parking lot. Friendly staff and I was interviewed for  my graduate program. They broke down all the classes for me and what classes I should be taking each semester.
Graduate Student,5,"I'm a graduate student in Azusa Pacific University's physical therapy department.  All staff are extremely knowledgeable, approachable, and dedicated to students' success.  I highly recommend this world-class program, but cannot speak to other details of campus life."
Sophomore,5,I love this school. The community is absolutely amazing. I love the spiritual and academic resources.
Niche User,5,"When I visited Azusa Pacific University, my overall experience was nothing short of amazing. I loved its atmosphere, the faith-based community, and the many educational programs offered. I don't want anything to change here, and I admire it very much."
Freshman,5,"I think this school is all around a very great atmosphere, from the learning to the students to the dorms. Its just the school to be."
Niche User,5,I liked how beautiful the campus itself looks but also all the opportunities that come with that experience. I heard that they had an amazing nursing program for undergraduates.
Niche User,5,"Azusa Pacific is a more than a just a university. It's a place where one can feel at home. The campus is beautiful and the community is so friendly and peaceful. The local area is great and you can find fast food places like Chick-fil-a, Jack in the Box, Starbucks, Apple Bees, YogurtLand, Five Guys, Pizza Hut, 7-Eleven, In-n-Out, and so much more! The housing and dorms at Azusa are clean and very nice."
Niche User,5,"Azusa has a really wonderful community and a real sense of belonging. Every time I go to visit, it's just been a really welcoming and amazing place to be."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a second year student at Azusa Pacific University and I absolutely love the school. I was always someone who didn’t really like school, but yet at APU they really make you feel welcomed and have plenty of resources to use in times of need. In addition, the students and professors are very friendly and helpful! Although the tuition can seem like a lot, but I love how Christ-centered the school is. The school itself is a small community, but it helps a lot in growth with Christ and even in our studies. Two things I would suggest is possibly offering more classes for students because enrolling for classes can be rough at times and possibly having online classes opened to commuters more because it would help those that are traveling further than local ones and for those that can not afford living on campus. I am a commuter myself and it is pretty hard going to school everyday sometimes driving for more than an hour due to traffic."
Freshman,5,Azusa Pacific University has shaped me to be the Christ centered woman I have always aspired to be. I have learned more here in a semester than I ever accepted. The faculty and staff were supportive and knew me by name. I felt right at home at APU.
Junior,5,"I just transferred to Azusa Pacific from San Diego Mesa College. I start Jan 6, 2020. My sister attended Azusa for undergrad and graduated school. I am looking forward to playing football and running track and of course learning academically."
Niche User,5,"This university has the nicest, most welcoming people you will ever meet! 10/10 recommend. They have a near-by Chick-fil-A, Raisin Cane's, and an ice cream shop. The people are amazing, the food is great, and the location is perfect."
Niche User,5,Azusa Pacific is an amazing school. I spent the night there in a freshmen dorm with other nursing  students. I was able to know how to get around the school within less than a day and taking the trolly was great. The food was great within the school and also around it like Raising Canes and IN and OUT. All of the staff were very welcoming as well as the students.
Freshman,5,The staff/faculty at the school are amazing and do whatever they can to help you understand the concepts they are teaching.
Freshman,5,I love Azusa because is private school and the class is small and learn about God And the campus is excellent and the room too. I recommend it people are very friendly and helpful.
Niche User,5,"Azusa Pacific University is a great place to study your college education because it prepares you to become a great professional. I am applying for attending there and the person, who has been helping me through the process, has been kind and considerate to me. I really like the university because has many activities to do and is located in a great area. The university has a great environment to do your college education."
Freshman,5,Azusa Pacific has given me an overall pleasant experience during my first semester here. Everyone at APU is very approachable and sociable. I have had no trouble making friends and making great new experiences. APU academics are above and beyond what I expected and I can't wait to continue developing my education.
Freshman,5,"APU is a beautiful homey environment. Walking through cougar walk you always encounter a friend. Professors know you by name and generally want to invest in your future. It is expensive to attend a private christian college such as Apu, but the experience is worth it!"
Sophomore,5,"Overall, Azusa Pacific University is a really great school if you are looking for diversity in students and faculty. One thing I would like to change is greater acceptance of LGBTQIA+ students."
Niche User,5,Supportive atmosphere.  The theater program has outstanding productions.  Nice area.  Convenient to shopping and freeway.
Freshman,5,I like that the university cares about your academic and spiritual life and want to see you succeed in life. The professors are really helpful and nice when it comes to homework or even any concerns or questions that you might have about your future career. Everyone here is also nice and sweet and share the same interests as you.
Senior,5,"I love the sense of family that we have at Azusa. It is truly a home within the classroom. The people that are in the program with you become friends and family, very quickly. The faculty is among the most supportive that I have seen. Our professors truly want to see us succeed and do everything that they can to help us get there."
Senior,5,"The students here at APU are very welcoming and motivated to succeed. Faculty as well are helpful to all students; they really want you to succeed. Instructors are very engaging, challenging you to actively participate in discussion, showing you how new information can apply to your life, and challenging students to set challenging goals. This private Christian University will also aid you in growing your relationship with God through Biblical studies and chapel attendance."
Freshman,5,"I like the Christian community here. Lots of faithful friends and professors are here. As I am an international student, I have difficulties in understanding the lecture  but professors help me and understand me"
Sophomore,5,"The campus is gorgeous, and the staff is SO quick and kind when responding to emails! The classes are very interesting and the counselors are all so accommodating when it comes to planning a schedule that works best for you (I'm a commuter and I was nervous when starting to plan my schedule but we were able to work it out so my schedule is literally perfect for me)!"
Sophomore,5,APU has been such a great school to be at. The professors are always willing to help you no matter what and you always have someone to talk to. APU feels more like a home than a school to me.
Sophomore,5,My experience overall is great! I am able to talk about my faith with God to classmates and friends. The professors connect with students and do their best to teach them what they did in college to improve. Made many new friends and dorm roommates. They have trolleys to get to the two campus locations for faster transportation. The Chapels are great to listen to and learn about God's word and worship him! I still have three years left to finish my Engineering degree!
Sophomore,5,"APU is a great Christian University. The programs are great and the professors are very engaged with the students. I had gotten many opportunities and connections through my professor who used to work for Disney. There isn't really a party scene, for the campus doesn't have any frat or sorority houses to promote equality among the students. It's a great university to grow in Christ and to feel a sense of community within the campuses.  The area surrounding the campus isn't the safest at night sometimes, but there is great campus safety that ensures the safety of the students and always alert them if needed. The housing is great because once you are an upperclassman you get to choose to live in an apartment housing that is apart of the campus. It's a great way to help students live independently and to responsibly take care of utilities."
Senior,5,What I like most about APU are the teachers and the time that you get with the teachers. I like that I am able to speak one on one with each of my teachers and have the connection that I need for my classes.
Freshman,5,The campus is beautfiul and all of the staff members are very helpful and willing to help you. There are many clubs campus and activities to get involved with. There is always someone here to help when you need it. Faith is something that can be learned and  followed on this campus.
Freshman,5,The school is amazing and they are a friendly campus. It is easy to make friends and then become comfortable around the people. The staff are really helpful.
Senior,5,Azusa Pacific University is a great school that has an amazing student life an community presence. Class sizes are great an professors are knowledgable and very kind. The on-campus food isn't great but the athletics are fantastic and the people are amazing!
Junior,4,I have taken a few online classes. The teaching quality is still the same I just feel more stressed and overall less organized. Still getting a good understanding of each subject just not the same in person connection.
Junior,4,I love the professors and how much they care and reach out to students during and outside of class. I love the student life and how everyone wants to be friends with everyone. Love how much they incorporate Christianity in to the atmosphere and in classes. My major has tons of opportunities and all the faculty and sports staff are really about personal growth.
Junior,4,"My professors have done their absolute best to readjust their classes to be in the most efficient virtual forms. They've listened to students, which makes a huge positive difference. Half of my classes have been synchronized, the others have not."
Junior,4,"Great place for growth. Depending on your friend group, efforts to utilize all school facilities, and your preference of community; this school can be really good for you. There's a great nursing program. The business program is okay, but you have to put the effort into networking with professors to get any job opportunities. Not very many parties, dry campus. The local area can be dangerous, be aware of this before coming."
Junior,4,They have done the best job they can amidst the circumstances of Covid-19. Professors have done all they can to make themselves an available resource to all their students and I am very thankful to be as well-informed and connected to the community as I am.
Senior,4,I really enjoy the time that is invested into the students. I love that everyone is kind and easy to talk to. I have found professors that are really passionate about teaching which makes learning really engaging.
Senior,4,I loved the community and active efforts for student involvement. The environment is very friendly and everyone is open to meeting people.
Graduate Student,4,"When I began my  program it was face to face learning experience. However due to corona virus we changed to virtual online classes. It's been challenging yet the professors are very helpful and try to make our learning experience as adaptable as possible. It has required a lot of patience yet we are provided with enough resources and tools to be able to be successful. The instructors are accessible and willing to be flexible to meet with you virtually one on one if you need additional help. Overall, my experience with Azusa Pacific has been a great learning experience."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my 1st year experience at APU was phenomenal to say the least. It was smooth transition from high school, to college. Instantly, I felt welcomed by everyone at APU. In high school I would sometimes feel like an outsider, but at APU I never did. Not to say, how the school also deeply cares abut each, and every single one of their students. Everything from their professors, the classes, the environment, the people, the music and arts are all just a homely feeling that is quite unique and personally is not portrayed enough in television, nor cinema."
Junior,4,"I found a welcoming community, caring professors, and great friends here at APU! Most of my professors (in the political science department at least) were extremely caring and were always willing to help students further understand the material. Chapel is not that great, and I wish that it wasn't a requirement...but oh well."
Sophomore,4,"The switch from in-person to online classes in Spring of 2020 was relatively smooth, thanks to Teachers and Staff who did the utmost to keep us all informed on day-to-day changes. Though challenging, they provided an outlet for success, even in such a difficult time."
Junior,4,"The professors made the adjustment very seamless for their students. Because of the recent outbreak, all professors were very understanding of what the students were going through. Furthermore, professors also accommodating their students through assignments and lectures."
Junior,4,"APU ensures that they create a faith-based environment for students to feel that Azusa is truly their ""home away from home"". All members of the APU community are welcoming and loving for every individual. Faith, Academics, and Love are the three words that I would use to describe Azusa Pacific University."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time there, definitely the cost is difficult and I definitely realized that once graduating. They should have more funding options available aside from just loans."
Freshman,4,"What I like about APU is the culture here. It is not your ordinary college, you get to really know your professors and your classmates. It is christ centered and there are a lot of good role models and mentors here at APU."
Alum,4,Azusa is as good as the professors you have. They have some incredible professors but tend to not tenure them and loose them eventually. The mandatory chapel is my only real downside as you basically pay for church if you miss chapel too many times.
Junior,4,"classroom size is small so gives more time with professors one on one, you get assigned to a group on the first days of school to help meet new students and you form a connection from day one.  If you commute there are a lot of activities that you can participate in to make you feel included to the students that live on campus.  There is also a lot of opportunity to get jobs on campus.  APU also offers scholarships to help with cost of tuition.  A lot of emails are sent to students to remind them of activities on campus."
Freshman,4,"An amazing experience to be a part of the APU community. I enjoy getting to know my professors as well as my peers. Professors tremendously care for the well being of the individual, as well as very understanding. I would enjoy having more opportunities to spend time with the individuals of my graduating class, but overall, a great experience."
Senior,4,I have known many who go to this school and all I have heard has been of the positive. Smaller class sizes than many big universities and great networking base and internships.
Sophomore,4,being a kid in the Glendora area you get an idea of what it is like but the campus is great and the city of Azusa is not half bad. I would like to see the computer information systems change to be a bs but I will look forward to the next year I have in the campus
Junior,4,"I recently transferred to Azusa Pacific University. It has been a really positive transition, even through my recent medical hospitalization. All the faculty were extremely understanding to my conditions and have made this semester mostly smooth for me considering the circumstances."
Sophomore,4,"Azusa Pacific University is a very caring community. Everywhere you go, you will find a smile and kindness willing to help you with anything you need. Campus size is not very big so therefore, having access to professors and asking for help is not difficult."
Sophomore,4,Great experience for young christian adults who desire to expand their knowledge and faith in God. Many opportunities to join different clubs and groups that help ease the transition of college. Great location; 30 minutes away from some great locations in the Los Angeles county. I highly recommend this college for anyone who is looking for large personal growth.
Sophomore,4,Azusa Pacific University is a great private school because it offers so many resources and has a lot of support from staff / students. The only thing that I would like to see is more help for those who cannot afford the tuition.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I am very pleased to be able to attend this university. The professors, students, and other employees on campus are friendly and are eager to engage in conversation. Because it is a private school, professors deal with smaller classroom sizes. Thus, they are far more involved with the education and well-being of the students. In addition, student-led tutoring services are free for any students requiring extra practice or explanation on a particular topic. The food and dining services--typically comprised of mini-marts and a large dining hall--on-campus are varied and extremely convenient when traveling between classes. Unfortunately, because the campus is divided into two properties (East and West Campus), some students find it difficult taking the trolley between campuses for class during the busier hours of the day, choosing instead to walk the 10 or 15 minutes down the road instead of waiting for a usually crowded trolley."
Niche User,4,"Nice university with really nice people. Overall fun atmosphere and very welcoming to everyone who visits or attends! Sports are always fun, so many activities to partake in, and the professors are all there to help you succeed."
Junior,4,"The environment of Azusa Pacific University is very welcoming, accepting, and open. The faculty truly cares about the success of every, individual student. The campus feels like a home due to the peers being engaging and kind-spirited, even during exam seasons. The curriculum and the atmosphere is top-notch."
Junior,4,"This university has been absolutely amazing overall! I know that academics aren't at the highest ratings and most of us college students want the best education possible, however I strongly feel that this university cares for its students education as well as outside health and happiness! Lots of us get so caught up in our work we end up forgetting about our own self-care, thankfully this university is very encouraging and supportive! I love it so much!"
Niche User,4,Azusa is a great place to meet super nice people who love god. Chapel is required but it isn't that bad if you engage. You always get out what you put in.
Freshman,4,Very good school. Since I haven't been here that long I have a limited experience of all of campus life especially since classes are keeping me busy.
Freshman,4,"Really amazing! Just a couple small things would make this a 5 star, but i wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere of a small school. The professors are extremely supportive and with the small class sizes, I am given the opportunity to learn effectively."
Freshman,4,I had an amazing experience at APU. The community of students and the dedication of the faculty made for formative years. I would not change my experience at APU.
Freshman,4,"I like going to this school. The main thing that I love about this college is how friendly people are, even if you don't know them. The professors are also very friendly and approachable. The events that this school has to offer are very cheap and fun. One thing that I would like to see being changed could be improving some of the commuter events, so that commuters feel more welcomed at the school."
Sophomore,4,I appreciate the emphasis on the resources available within the community to allow students to have opportunities to grow as Christians.
Freshman,4,Azusa Pacific University is a God-first community. It is a Christian university that focuses on God and incorporates that faith in every classroom you step into. APU is a great place for new experiences and new friendships. People here are insanely sweet and friendly and overall a wonderful school. Only thing I would change personally would be tuition because school is costly.
Senior,4,"I love this school.  The sense of community here is unlike anywhere else.  The faculty and staff genuinely care about each student.  They will do what it takes to get the most success possible for their students.  If you want doors to be opened for you, this is the place.  They make it possible to male so many connections in the professional world."
Sophomore,4,This is my first time being at a University after years of being at a Community college and I can say it is a huge upgrade. all the resources that is given to the students is outstanding and being a christian school they are very open to other religions. The professors are understanding and helpful of their students whenever they are struggling. The only downfall is the mandatory chapel meetings and service hours. Not many students have the time to perform these duties because they are full time workers trying to make money for bills and school. School is expensive as it is so hard working students who are full time at work ad school need all the time they can get to strive for greatness. I feel like chapel should be optional or at least be once a week rather than the mandatory three times a week. the service hours should be optional as well for maybe extra college credit.
Senior,4,"This university really comes down to what you make of it. It offers plenty of Christian support through chapel, d-groups, prayer groups and other facilities. Most professors are willing to offer outside help as the class sizes are on the smaller side (which is a huge advantage). It is an expensive private school, but considering all the resources available to you and the opportunity for when you graduate, the price is right."
Sophomore,4,I like azusa pacific university because it incorporates faith into the curriculum and classes. I am a nursing major and the classes focus on taking care of the patient as a whole which is very important to me. Also they have intramurals and my residents advisors have been really great. I wasn’t sure about the school at first because I didn’t have many friends but after a while I got friends and now I love it.
Junior,4,Overall APU is a good school. There are a lot of professors and counselors that really care about you and want to see you succeed at APU and in your life after graduating from the university.
Sophomore,4,"Overall a great school. The location isn't great, but the academics are hard to beat. Plenty of opportunities for students to get involved."
Senior,4,"For the most part, almost all of the professors genuinely care about the students being successful and accomplishing their goals. They go out of their way to help you in any way that they can. They are the ones that really make attending this school worthwhile."
Junior,4,Love the school. The staff has been extremely supportive.  Everyone has been encouraging and helpful. Easy to access information such as grades and transcripts.
Alum,4,Good Christian school with a good focus on how students can impact whatever industry they go into in a Christian way.
Graduate Student,4,APU was a really good school. I went there all 4 years and now I'm a graduate student there. I made a lot of amazing friends there. Definitely not a party school though! :)
Alum,4,"I was a transferred into APU from a local community college. I was impressed with the resources available to students and all the opportunities to get involved with the school and the local community. Students are required to be involved with some form of volunteer work before they graduate, and I believe this is a necessary component to enrich learning. All of my professors were extremely personable and willing to assist me whenever I needed it. The facilities available to students to succeed are wonderful."
Graduate Student,4,"I am excited to begin my journey with APU as a graduate student. From the time I have spent preparing for this next step, I have enjoyed the interactions with professors and my cohort. There is a beauty in this school that is trying their best to learn and be open to the world around them. The campus is beautiful but the city of Azusa is pretty scarce. There is not much to do around, and also as far as diversity there isn't too much diversity, but as a private Christian affiliated school that is pretty average. Overall, I know APU has a great reputation amongst other schools and I am a proud APU Cougar!"
Sophomore,4,"My favorite part about APU is interacting with my professors.  Of the ten professors I have had in my first year of college, I have found all of them to be passionate, dependable, and selfless.  
            Though some of them were not always clear on assignment deadlines, all of them displayed a great passion for helping my colleagues and me to succeed.  I recall quite a few instances in which I saw some of my classmates lining up to ask our theology professor a question about whatever the current assignment was during that period of time. 
            I also remember a time when my statistics professor helped me with my community service team project.  He met with me in his office and we discussed how to format the surveys for the project.  If he had not assisted me with the surveys, I would not have been able to finish my project.  Thank you, Mr. Szeto!"
Senior,4,"APU is a smaller community of amazing people including campus pastors, staff and faculty. My professors have been so supportive of my academic and spiritual journey from the beginning. Being on a Christian campus has allowed me to meet God and begin to understand His theology and our purpose. One thing I would change is having students graduate with a theology or biblical studies minor given that we are required to take so many bible classes already."
Junior,4,"Azusa Pacific is a home away from home for many students. Whether through academics, sports, clubs, or other organizations on campus it seems as though the university emphasizes the importance of finding community in whatever niche each individual student decides."
Junior,4,"I really like the Christian environment. I appreciate how I can talk openly about my faith with most of the people I meet. I also love their approach to faith. Most faculty do not shove their interpretations down your throat, but encourage you to come to your own conclusions. I am not fond of the chapel requirements or what the morning chapels preach. They are more of a pep talk than anything important about God. I also do not agree with some of the general education requirements."
Sophomore,4,"People are really nice when you talk to them.  The environment is awesome, it is mostly sunny and students love to seat outside with many places to relax or do homework. I am glad that I chose to attend APU because I am learning so much and making great friends who care about me. The teachers care about their students, if your not doing so good with your grades, you can always talk to them and come up with a way to improve."
Alum,4,"I graduated with a major in psychology and it was a great program. The core staff is great, some of the adjuncts were not. Overall, the school provides many opportunities for community involvement if you want. One of my only complaints in the required chapel attendances. While this is a Christian University, there needs to be more leniency on chapel absences. I was a student who needed to work full time in order to pay for college. The university made this impossible to do since students are required to go to chapel three times a week. You have to jump through so many loopholes to get the absences excused, only to get told it doesn't count in the end. While the education is great and even the biblical courses were interesting, the chapel requirement is not realistic in today's society where people need to work in order to pay for attendance."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Azusa Pacific University has so far been an uplifting one. I am surrounded by driven, hard-working, joyful and bright students that always encourage, motivate, and socialize with me. I enjoy the smaller class sizes because I am more capable of having a question answered in class and I can learn better by developing a professional relationship with my professors. I believe that Azusa Pacific University overall is a great university, however, if I could change something I would encourage the university to reconsider students having mandatory chapel 3 days a week and reduce it to either 1 or 2 mandatory days. This is because balancing school work, social life, job or sport commitments, and chapel can be a bit overwhelming, especially for those who attend that aren't religious."
Sophomore,4,I love the academics at APU! The professors are very passionate and actually care for each student. I would like to see an improvement in activities for commuter students. There is not a lot of resources to get them connected.
Alum,4,"Loved every bit of my experience at APU. Met my wife here and had many wonderful teachers. My faith was encouraged and though it was expensive, I received a great education."
Senior,4,"The people, faculty, and overall community make you feel at home and make going to a small college worth it for the one-on-one experience."
Freshman,4,"Azusa Pacific University provides a great learning environment while also integrating faith into their classes. Most of the students and faculty are very outgoing, encouraging, and friendly."
Graduate Student,4,"Great school. Affordable school, able to get all classes easily.  Attending a regional campus, so I don't have much experience with the main campus."
Freshman,2,"Azusa Pacific University is located in a pretty boring area that not only has nothing to do, but is also dangerous at night. The 3 chapel requirement a week is a pain. The food on campus gets gross after a while and there is no real healthy options. The professors are all really nice and the classes are easy."
Junior,2,"The music department feels like I is disorganized, and the only ones suffering it’s negative outcomes are the students."
Alum,2,"Pros: Never had trouble getting the classes I needed. Enjoyed working on campus.

Cons: The area around the school isn't particularly interesting. If you're looking for a party school this isn't one. There is a lack of diversity. The religiosity of the school can make people with different views uncomfortable. The food options on campus are terrible."
College Junior,2,its incredibly expensive for the lack of amenities and updates within the apartments
College Student,2,It's a waste of money and time. The environment is toxic and does not prepare me for the real world.
College Student,2,It's a mistake to come here!
College Student,2,I have never been surrounded by such a large group of hypocrites and fake people. They call themselves Christians but they are the most evil people I've known. All they care about is money. They speak of God but practice evils. Get me the hell out of here!
College Junior,2,"My current RA had one meeting, hosted one event, and then disappeared for the remainder of the year. She doesn't even remember I'm one of her residents. As I mentioned before, the proximity between the housing areas and west campus is awful."
College Senior,2,There is no greek life at APU.
College Freshman,2,Azusa Pacific University does not have Greek Life on campus.
College Junior,2,Registration process is very organized and simple.
College Sophomore,2,"Parties don't really happen on campus, or if they do they don't end well for those involved"
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing for gluten free hardly and that is so hard for people with allergies/celiac disease. You constantly have to ask in the caf if anything is gluten free, they barely have it stated for you already what is gluten fee."
College Freshman,2,"There are days when its okay, but in general the food gets old pretty quickly and is super unhealthy. Also it is all so expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"We only have a vending machine at the Orange County campus, no cafeteria"
College Freshman,2,you gotta know the right people if you wanna party here.
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have a huge party scene because were a christian university, but we do have great get togethers."
College Junior,2,"The gym needs to be expanded, or the athletes need their own gym."
College Junior,2,Good luck finding somewhere to eat after 9pm.
College Junior,2,"People don't know how to be mature, and drink alcohol like an adult"
College Freshman,2,They are very strict about pretty much everything.
College Sophomore,2,"Since this is a Christian school, parties aren't really out in the open, with the exception of school-sponsored parties like ""Les Femme"", the girl ask guy event, ""Homecoming"", and a few others, which are okay. At least the school sponsored parties attract a large crowd and always are sold-out. When it comes to off-campus parties, you have to do a bit of digging. I've only been to a couple, but they were very chill and easy-going, not quite the frat party that most party schools have. Since there is no greek life, the parties are definitely not prevalent unless you look for them"
College Junior,2,This is not a party school. You have to go off campus to find the party scene.
College Sophomore,2,The health center is decent but the campus safety is a joke and they're very annoying.
College Sophomore,2,The school has no tolerance on alcohol on campus even for those over 21. Students are not even allowed to have music and dance in large crowds or will written up. Pretty much it's not a party school. Still many students party but are discreet about it
College Freshman,2,"They are way too strict. No boys past 10 and there is no parking even though you buy a $600 parking pass you still get horrible parking and when you accidentally park in the wrong spot, you get a huge ticket."
College Sophomore,2,I'm not one to have much of a nightlife so I'm not sure.
College Junior,2,"There is little to no party scene. The only parties there are are off campus and usually very exclusive and small or are with other schools. The school is very strict and if they find out you have been to a party off campus or on they will punish the students very strictly, which is probably why the parties are so small and exclusive because it only takes one noisy person to report you, and going to a christian school where there are many people who have strong beliefs on why partying is so bad one of them will over step and report you because they think that they are ""saving"" you from going down a ""bad path""."
College Sophomore,2,Hmm we don't have fraternities or sororities.
College Sophomore,2,"At first you think you have a lot of options but then you realize you are basically eating bugers and pizzas everyday. I wished for healthier options many times but all they have are refrigerated salads with mostly lettuce. The meals are way over priced. It's about $9/meal. The freshmen meal plan is about $2,000 which is required to get if they live on campus."
College Junior,2,"As a Christian University in the Azusa area, there are not that many nightlife options surrounding the school; however, the campus is only 30 minutes away from Downtown."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not a lot of options to choose from for off campus housing. Most students do not like to use there cars, they like to walk to campus, stores, etc. and a lot of off campus housing is not walking distance. Off campus housing is also not as nice as on campus housing. I would recommend staying on campus, than to stay off campus."
College Sophomore,2,It's really hard to get the all the financial aid you need to attend the school.
College Sophomore,2,Everyone is a Caucasian Christian that likes fun.
College Junior,2,"My school gives money out, but not enough to help pay for school. For the amount of donators we have for the school, they are not very helpful. Especially for those in the middle class."
College Junior,2,"Being that I am a gay student a christian university, it is really hard to find acceptance. I am also from Hawaii so I have a lot of different ethnicities that cause me to have different economical backgrounds compared to the white students at my school. We are working at diversity, but it is really hard considering 80% of the school is white. Being gay is not easy, but being someone of color is also hard as well."
College Freshman,2,"There's plenty to do in L.A.(obviously) but very little to do in Azusa(and a majority of food places are closed after 11).  A lot of people either head towards the L.A. area or stay in their living areas.  The living areas occasionally put on events, and there are 4 dances put on during the year.  But nightlife is pretty calm mostly consisting of hang outs, movies, and dorm visits.  There are parties but they are always off campus."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, it's my least favorite part of APU (which I know is nothing really to do with the university). People always ask ""what is there to do in Azusa?"" and I've never been able to provide an answer. I don't feel safe walking around at night and there is no reason to leave campus because there is nothing to do."
College Freshman,2,"Such a hassle to have to park all the way on West, and being ticketed if you didn't move your car was frustrating. We're students, shouldn't we be allowed to park on our own school campus?"
College Freshman,2,"If you thought a regular university was going to be strict, image that strictness times ten because that's what it's like to go to APU. Don't do drugs because there's too much to risk if you get caught. Don't park in an area where you aren't permitted to park because you WILL get a ticket."
College Junior,2,Need more parking spaces. Students have to walk from west campus to their home because there aren't any spaces available.
College Junior,2,I don't stay on campus. I only stayed my first year and I hated it. I was never home
College Junior,2,The campus of APU is very strict
College Junior,2,"It's not the best atmosphere. APU has its own bubble and atmosphere but as soon as you step foot off campus, it is completely different."
College Junior,2,The diversity at APU is not good. They say they want to be diverse ethnically and racially but refuse to allow culturally different students influence APU as an institution. Only one agenda is pushed at that is the wealthy white culture.
College Freshman,2,"There is absolutely no night life. Everybody stays in their dorm, or goes out to LA. It is very quiet on campus at night and the best thing to probably do is hang out with friends or watch Netflix in bed."
College Freshman,2,"you have to fit a certain mold to have friends at APU, and to be in a relationship, if you are not part of the majority, its pretty hard."
College Sophomore,2,Nothing happens in or around APU
College Freshman,2,If you get a horrible roomate it's the worst.
College Freshman,2,School and being a commuter is tough sometimes.
College Freshman,2,"They recently had an article stating that over 50% of our students are minorities. However, it doesn't like there is. It is a majority of white Christians."
College Junior,2,"There are a lot of Caucasians, and the conservative Christian culture is very highly prevalent. There is not much acceptance for others that do not fit in the circle. Homosexuals are treated almost non-human."
College Junior,2,There are rules that are still in place that were made long ago and are no longer relevant.
College Sophomore,2,The wifi is very unreliable and always goes in and out
College Sophomore,2,I have trouble trying to obtain any help from with scholarships or aid.
College Sophomore,2,There is not much to do if there are not any campus activities that are going on
College Sophomore,2,"I honestly do not participate in that. It is a Christian campus, and I strongly hold to my value of not drinking. However, I do know there are people who participate in drinking and possibly drugs. Personally, I do not know of any people but sometimes overhear things in conversations. That being said, I hope the social drug scene is bad because that would mean that a lot of people are not into it. "
College Freshman,2,"There's really only fast food. Chick Fil A, Chipotle, and The Habit are good but get old fast."
College Junior,2,"Azusa is known for being a school of Christians with blonde hair and blue eyes. Although we are in fact more diverse than that, I know if feels like that. "
College Junior,2,"I hate LA weather. Azusa is in a bowl that's constantly filled with smog. I personally hate how hot it is year round, however, I know lots of people look past the smog and love the hot weather. I just would prefer some sweater weather and rain. "
Senior,1,"I have attended APU for 5 years now. this school is money first, not God first like they claim. Chapel is more political and religious indoctrination, not biblical. Another issue is that they had an accounting error which caused them to lay off half of the adjunct professors and cut how many classes they offer. This means certain classes are not offered every semester/year, which means that we the students are now behind in getting our degrees. This makes us be there for more time than expected. Over $40,000 a year that we have to pay, now since we are delayed, we have to pay that a couple more times.Then, especially in the sciences, the classes that are lower division are actually considered upper division at every other school. Sure this gives preparation for higher education, but because it is so much harder we cant get the grade to allow us into the higher programs."
Graduate Student,1,"Pathetic at helping students going through the admissions process for the graduate programs.  NO return phone calls for WEEKS, unanswered emails and prideful faculty."
College Freshman,1,Greek life isn't heard of at this school.
College Senior,1,"It is non-existent. We have national fraternities that are honor societies for specific organizations, departments, etc. but they emphasis academic achievement, community/world service, and passionate causes."
College Freshman,1,"we do not have greek life at my school, we are centered around service."
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at Azusa Pacific University.
College Junior,1,"I seriously regret choosing APU. There are so many different factors leading to my unhappiness here at this school. Firs of all, the trolley system seems fun and unique at first, but it's actually extremely frustrating. APU boasts about having several trolleys at their disposal, but rarely has more than two running at the same time. During busy times before classes begin, mobs form waiting for the trolley and I'm literally pushed and shoved out of the way by my ""fellow"" students. The campuses are very far apart which is time consuming and frustrating when you forget something on the other campus. The wifi here is terrible, it constantly goes out and isn't capable of holding any online gaming lobby. The people here are extremely rude. I've attended this school since my freshman year and I still have 0 friends. People here are very judge mental and seem to only look out for themselves. After three years of this school, the three chapels a week requirement gets incredibly old. I feel that three chapels a week is a complete waste of my time. I've noticed in my core major classes, the professors play favorites and it's very disheartening. The 120 hours of community service that are required to graduate are also frustrating to me. As a student trying to keep up with internships, jobs, and homework, I don't have the time or the energy to do community service on the weekends. Ive cried countless times because of how deeply I regret going to this school."
College Freshman,1,There are rarely any parties ever. Most people go home on the weekends so the campus is pretty dead on the weekends.
College Freshman,1,No one is around on the weekends to have parties. The party scene here is nonexistent.
College Sophomore,1,There are no parties at my school. All of the parties take place off-campus.
College Freshman,1,"If you want to party at all, like a normal college student, you have to have a car or have a friend with a car because no parties happen on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no party scene. There are events held by the school, but no party"
Recent Alumnus,1,I never went to a party the four years I was there. Not what I am into. We had gatherings that were fun and never got out of hand.
College Freshman,1,"Parties are rare or hard to find, especially as a freshman. You can get in a large amount of trouble for even being seen at a party so there is a large risk factor in going."
College Junior,1,"As far as I know, there is no ""Greek Life"" on the APU campus."
College Sophomore,1,No Greek life at all
College Freshman,1,there is no Greek Life at APU!!
College Sophomore,1,"Well considering we don't have ""Greek life"" at all, i have to rate it as a 1. I would love to be in a sorority or at least be able to watch a sorority or fraternity and how they function, but our school doesn't have any. oh well."
College Freshman,1,"i am still behind on aide, every time the office tells me differently and the scholarships from the school are not nearly enough to cover anything"
College Freshman,1,"Permit passes are so expensive its out of control, campus safety rarely gives out temp passes, and when they don't they are constantly giving out tickets, and you basically must have a car on campus because there is nothing to do close by"
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have traditional Greek Life, but we do have academic fraternities."
College Junior,1,"No Greek Life man! I was in a sorority at my old school and i miss it a lot!

APU doesn't want a greek life because it doesn't want to be affiliated with the ""stereotypes"", which in my opinion is dumb because my sorority taught me so many leadership skill and helped me grow in so many ways than I thought was possible"
College Sophomore,1,"We do not have a Greek system, bless our souls, amen."
College Sophomore,1,We dont have greek life
College Junior,1,"The network constantly crashes and is slow. Also, most of the technology is out of date."
College Senior,1,"Majoring the the sciences is very difficult. Students have to dedicate a lot of time to their classes because they are difficult and take time to understand. Often the closest friends that science majors have are other science majors because they always study together. Students are able to do research with certain professors either for units, volunteer purposes, or as summer jobs. "
College Sophomore,1,It is often very hard to try and find parking and sometimes difficult when trying to make it to class. 
College Freshman,1,There are none at azusa it really sucks becuase thats what people want to do in college
College Sophomore,1,There isn't any Greek life since it is a Christian school. So it just doesn't exist.
College Freshman,1,"Food here is god-awful. If you want good food, go to Biola, because it is generally awful here."
College Freshman,1,"Parking here sucks. The prices are ridiculous, especially for freshmen, and enforcement is draconian."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is the worst. Not enough spaces, and very easy to get tickets!"
College Freshman,1,"The parking situation is absurd. The cost was insane, there are never any spots. It is on the opposite campus of my dorm. "
Recent Alumnus,1,there is no nightlife around campus unless you're going to applebees for happy hour. Nightlife is in LA area far away from azusa and APU people
College Junior,1,Most things close early. No good night clubs around our school.
College Junior,1,"From my experience, the school's safety and security on campus would be described as dangerous. The school has provided multiple on-campus safety personnel but they still fail to maintain a sound environment. There were several incidents in which my friends knew of someone in the campus who were victims of sexual assault and theft. Ultimately, I believe the campus could take further preventative measures to create a safe environment for the students."
College Junior,1,APU is not very diverse it is talked about one time through out the year in chapel but as much as they try and say they are diverse they are not. They also do not address sexual orientation.
College Student,1,The Town of azusa is not very nice and there are not many things to do for fun unless you drive to a neighboring town
College Junior,1,"There isn't much need for a car on campus but there is not enough convenient parking for students. There is a large parking lot, it's just not close enough to east campus to feel worthwhile."
College Student,1,"No nightlife. Honestly, if you're a person that likes to go out and have a good time, look at other schools. Azusa is great! But its depressing when everyone goes home on the weekend and you're stuck there. It's totally empty on weekends. Even the food on campus is basically closed until certain times. Its not fun and it can make a person that's outgoing and wants to have fun really dislike the school. THERE IS NO NIGHTLIFE. And don't get me wrong. Having movie night is great, but when its every weekend....just cry now. So if that's important to you, don't rule Azusa out completely, but definitely look at other schools."
College Student,1,"Really no diversity at all. In the freshman class, I'm more then sure that there is two Latino students, A handful of black students in all years, some Ha wains, and everywhere you go around campus you already knew you're going to see a lot of Caucasian."
College Sophomore,1,Azusa Pacific is a Christian university.  The school is in an area where there is not much nightlife and the school prohibits any kind of partying.
Recent Alumnus,1,"APU is a great school, but diversity isn't it's strongest attribute. In recent years there has been some change, but more work is needed."
College Student,1,"
There’s really NO diversity at this school at all. The majority of people are white. Don’t get me wrong, you’ll see Blacks, Asians, Pacific Islanders, and some Hispanics around, but that’s on a good day. The school is totally Caucasian based, do not be fooled
"
College Student,1,"If youre a high school senior that likes to go out, hit up parties, dance, have a good time out and about, you will totally DISLIKE APU for its nightlife. Theres nothing to do on weekend. Both upper and lowerclassmen go home, so if youre from NorCal or out of state youre stuck. Its like the freaking apocalypse! (no exzageration at all) If you like to party, consider other schools. If you dont care so much about parites, you wont have a problem at this school."
College Junior,1,"Not only is parking horrible, but most places around campus are illegal to park in and will be ticketed or towed by the town or school, plus they diminished the most crucial lot this summer by installing a basketball and volleyball courts. The only reliable place for parking is a 10-15 min walk for most the people who need it."
College Sophomore,1,Uhhh.. Parties? If you are in to partying there is a somewhat undercover seen to be found but never anything on campus
College Senior,1,The campus is majority Hispanic.   As a result at times it feels like there is no common community.  There is more identity for differences than similarities.
College Freshman,1,"Rules of Parking – The school is very bad with parking and their permits. Parking permits are expensive like 100 dollars. Also, some permits don't allow you to park anywhere on campus. I have gotten 3 tickets because I was unaware of the rules"
College Freshman,1,the campus is more like a boarding school than a college
College Junior,1,Greeks Who? The Greek life at APU is virtually non-existent. Being a Christian school there is only a small business frat.
College Freshman,1,"Everything is within walking distance so the need for a car is dependent on how much you want to travel for personal reasons. For those with cars, parking is horrible! There are two campuses and the one that is farther away is used for student parking so the distance causes an inconvenience. Also, campus safety does there job very well when it comes to giving tickets. The permit costs are not bad though."
College Freshman,1,Not Good and Unfair – It is so hard to find a place to park in most living areas. Parking is ridiculously expensive for freshman who have to park all the way on the other campus. I do not have a car on campus for it is unnecessary for my needs. Campus safety is strict on giving parking tickets.
College Sophomore,1,"It is ridiculous, they require you to have a permit for each campus. There is not a universal permit, students will only buy one and be limited to parking in certain complexes."
College Junior,1,"Students Are Not Treated Like Adults – In the dorms and on-campus apartments, there are not to be those of the opposite gender in your room/apartment during certain set hours. If an RA catches you, you'll be written up. Also, no drugs, drinking or even cigarette smoking on campus. Students are required to attend chapel three times a week or else you can be fined, made unable to register for classes, etc."
College Junior,1,Terrible Help – I have numerous problems with financial aid for this school for two semesters in a row. No one really helps you out when it comes to taking care of an owing balance.
College Junior,1,"Extremely Chaotic – Parking in between both campuses is ridiculous. There's always traffic after chapel, and finding a spot before or afterwards is virtually impossible."
College Sophomore,1,"Utterly Outrageous – The school tuition is already over priced and they tack on an addition $150 per semester to park and there is limited parking right in front of the school buildings but there is an old drive in lot that is huge and can accommodate a large number of cars. The only problem with that lot is there is little security a lot of mugging and near rapes and it is too far away from the school buildings, especially when walking late at night. In order to get a decent parking spot you must come to school at least a half hour early."
College Sophomore,1,"Not a Particular Necessity – It is truly unknown whether or not the greek scene is well established because there is no drinking, sex or fraternizing allowed on campus or off because you sign a statement of faith when you register with the school. There is even an underground lgbt community."
College Junior,1,Azusa Pacific University is a Christian University which is surrounded by churches. There are hardly any bars around the university. There are no clubs around the university. You are not even allowed to drink on campus even if you legal can. You are not even allowed to drink in your on-campus apartments.

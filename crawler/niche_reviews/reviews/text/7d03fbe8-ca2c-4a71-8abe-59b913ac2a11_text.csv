Freshman,5,I like how the welcome us at the beginning of the year.  This was the first year for my daughter at the school and they did a great job. I like how they were able to adapt to the change that is going on with the world due to covid.
Freshman,5,I am pretty happy with my daughter first year at the campus. They did an amazing job adapting to the safety due to the covid 19 and the teachers are doing a great job with the zoom classes.  I think this will be an amazing year due to all the changes that have happened.
Sophomore,5,"I've been going to Rockhurst for one year now, and I am so glad that I chose this school. I've met some of my closest friends while being here. They have amazing professors and instructors, and I would absolutely recommend this university to anyone!"
Senior,5,The academics prepared me to become a better leader and the extra curricular activities challenged me to get involved.
Freshman,5,Im a commuter which means that I live off campus. I am a loner but feel welcomed everywhere on campus. The lifestyle on campus is friendly and the professers are amazing and do anything to help out
Freshman,5,"I have loved my time at Rockhurst University. I am only a Freshman, but I have learned so much and have met so many great people. The faculty and staff are great, willing to help you with anything, and are super kind. The classes prepare you for the next step of you career. The campus is beautiful with updated facilities."
Freshman,5,So far I have loved my experience here and wouldn’t trade it for the world. I never felt homesick because Rockhurst feels like home.
Senior,5,Rockhurst University has the best staff and teachers out of all the colleges I visited. All my professors truly care about me and my academics. I have learned so much about myself and what I want to do. The Athletic programs are very competitive and the teams perform well every year. The students love to come out and support their school at soccer and lacrosse games. The campus is small so you really get to know all your classmates and everyone else around school. The Kansas City area is a great place to live with great night life on the weekends.
Sophomore,5,Everyone is extremely welcoming  and helpful with any problem or concern. They will do anything to help you strive in academics and strive to be a better person in general. Whenever I have  a question there is always people on campus to help me with whatever I need.
Sophomore,5,"I have had an incredible experience with Rockhurst University so far. I attended in the fall of 2018 to the spring of 2019 and I plan to continue attending there till I graduate in 2022. I appreciate how all the teachers are so helpful and they all go out of their way to make sure every single student recieves the help they need. When I decided to attend Rockhurst University, I was a little apprehensive about my decision due to the fact that I am not part of the Catholic religion however, this did not get in the way of my education and feeling at home. I am currently part of the Rockhurst University Nursing program which has taught me so many great things, overall Rockhurst is an amazing school!"
Freshman,5,"Honestly, I'm in love with this school. It has such a friendly environment. Even complete stramgers will start up a conversation if they see you alone. The teachers are amazing. They're doors are always open and they're willing to help. It's all around a great school."
Sophomore,5,"Rockhurst gives out an amazing education, and it's extremely helpful that the classes are small. You are able to build amazing relationships with your teachers, and every teacher is always willing to help you out whenever you need. One of my professors would even bring a cot and sleep in his office during finals, just so he could help us out at any time."
Freshman,5,They are very helpful and friendly. Not only that but they also have very great academics and if you are interested in medicine they are the college you need.
Freshman,5,I love the small community and how the teachers care about you not just your money. I love how big the dorms are.
Junior,5,"Great school if you want to feel at home. this is a place where everyone is friendly, and will say hello. A place where the teachers truly want to see you succeed and a place that makes you want to be at college."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved RockU thus far. I find my campus extremely welcoming to everyone. Located in the amazing downtown area of Kansas City, you get the best of college life and city life in one. Rockhurst is small, making classes more intimate and professors are always concerned with the whole student. Faith based, Rockhurst offers lots of outlets when it comes to student life. Greeks, fine arts, athletics, student government. Anything you would want is here on campus."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Rockhurst University and from the second when I stepped foot on campus I felt extremally welcomed into a new ""community"". Even though Rockhurst is nothing compared to my high school I am excited to be going to school here and looking forward to getting an amazing and highly credited degree."
Niche User,5,"I'm the parent of a Rockhurst sophomore and feel like the university has been an excellent choice for my daughter, and she agrees. Its a close knit school and very friendly csmpus. Academics are very good with small class sizes.  My daughter, who is African American, has made friends of all sorts and is involved in a lot. Sure, it does not have the big school sports scene but the college was top ranked in division two in severals sports. Security seems tight so far and there's a real emphasis on community service. If you want a school where the student will not get lost in a crowd and will get a very good foundation, Rockhurst is an under the radar gem with well respected academics as with most Jesuit colleges. Its not a commuter school even though its in an urban area. Campus is beautiful and not urban looking at all."
Sophomore,5,"Rockhurst University quickly became my home away from home. The small, close-knit community provides you with long lasting friendships, amazing educational opportunities, connects you with professionals, and prepares you for your future career. The faculty and staff are dedicated and love their positions, making the learning environment top-knotch."
Freshman,5,Rockhurst is an amazing institution where everyone can find a place to belong. Academics are challenging allowing you to feel like you truly deserve the grades you earn. Residence halls provide a great experience that everyone should try. Administration can be difficult to deal with.
Freshman,5,"The overall experience is great! The professors really care about how you are doing in your classes and will help you with any questions that you have. It's also like a small community and everyone is very accepting. My first year here is the best, I wouldn't have chosen to go anywhere else!"
Freshman,5,Academically it is a very good school. The professors really care about the students and want the best for them. Sports are pretty good but there is no football which stinks. There are a lot of ways to get involved with the organizations and different sororities and frats.
College Sophomore,5,The campus police are very polite and responsive. The employees seem to always be looking out for the students.
College Senior,5,i have loved my experience
College Senior,5,amazing!!! the small school environment makes finding help when needed very easy and quick. professors know us by name and remember us for a very long time
College Freshman,5,"I have high confidence that with an education at Rockhurst, I will be able to be accepted into medical school."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love Rockhurst. It has been a great experience.
College Freshman,5,I love Rockhurst University. I have really enjoyed my freshman year. I have made a lot of new friends. I joined many clubs like Student Activity Board and was awarded a leadership position. I live how much service is emphasized at my school.
College Junior,5,They are all mostly all amazing! I've had a few bad professors and classes but you can't win them all.
College Junior,5,I absolutely love Rockhurst! Your professors know you by name and are happy to help you outside of class. The small size is a plus too!
College Freshman,5,They all seem to really care about their students and it is awesome that they learn the students names
Recent Alumnus,5,"I loved Rockhurst, and I still do."
College Freshman,5,I love being in the classroom because i'm not afraid to ask questions.
College Freshman,5,It is challenging but thats how life is.
College Freshman,5,"I just joined Greek life here at Rockhurst and I absolutely love it! Some of my friends are in different sororities than me and some are not affiliated with Greek life. Here at Rockhurst it doesn't matter what you are involved in, everyone gets along here and does not discriminate amount another. It's like one big family!"
College Freshman,5,I love being a student at Rockhurst University! There are so many activities here to be involved in and the teachers are truly helpful.
College Senior,5,"I have had some good years at Rockhurst University. I have enjoyed learning under the majority of my instructors, and I think that I have learned a lot over the years. All of my teachers have been approachable, and they have been very willing to help if I needed assistance. The advising process, which is how I choose my classes for each upcoming semester has been really easy, and there was only one time that I had to get into a class that was full, and all I had to do was email my academic adviser, and he put me in the class. Other than that, I have had no problems getting into the classes that I needed."
College Freshman,5,The career services department is able to help students one-on-one and create accounts that help build resumes and search for internships.
College Freshman,5,"The professors I had for my first semester were all great teachers. The class sizes was on average about 28 students between all my classes, which really helped with staying focused, engaged, involved, and gave the opportunity to ask questions."
College Freshman,5,I would definitely choose this school all over again because of the way they try and help students get involved. They provide a variety of options and opportunities. My favorite experience was going to Washington D.C. for the Ignatian Family Teach-In. This provided me with knowledge in ways to pursue justice and allowed me the opportunity to lobby a senator staffer. I would recommend this school to any student seeking involvement in both the community and beyond.
College Freshman,5,"The university offers a variety of courses that typically meet the needs of every student. The professors are obviously well educated, and their teaching styles and attitudes towards students really show that they care about the well being of their students. Each class's style and size varies, though not by much, and it really adds to the character of the school because not every class is the same."
College Freshman,5,"This area is probably one of the biggest reasons that I chose Rockhurst. For almost every degree, there is a 100% graduation rate, and the school is very big on helping graduates find work within 6 months. The career center on campus is very involved with helping students from the start and they start communicating with freshmen within the first semester, and by the time graduation comes around, most students have a job lined up."
College Freshman,5,"I've only attended for a semester, and I love my school. What I found to be the most unique was that orientation for freshmen students is four days long, and it really encourages you to get to know yourself better, as well as others, and there is a big focus on service, and the importance of helping others. The small class sizes definitely make it easier to communicate with professors and learn better. Overall, I definitely choose my school again if I had to do it all over - no doubt about it."
College Freshman,5,"Kansas City is an amazing place of diversity! Some restaurants may be a little inconvenient at times, but they are well worth the drive. Plaza dining is fairly expensive, but there are plenty of other, cheaper places within a few miles of campus. It's hard to be bored with Kansas City's options!"
College Freshman,5,"The Rockhurst faculty worked as an advocate for me to get me the best financial aid possible, and I am exceedingly thankful for that!"
College Junior,5,"Fraternity Parties are a fun, safe place for students (greek and non-greek) to be social.  They are within walking distance, are regular, and are well attended by drinkers and non-drinkers"
College Junior,5,"The University has dramatically helped my critical thinking skills.  The environment is moderate-relaxed freshman and sophomore year to allow students to acclimate to college courses, and then will challenge any student Junior and Senior Year."
College Junior,5,"Money magazine rated Rockhurst #8 in the country for best value.  98% of students recieve some sort of financial aid, and the school really rewards high-school achievements"
College Junior,5,"You cannot get much better than Mid-town Kansas City.  The city is energetic and vibrant.  There is always something to do off campus (events, concerts etc.).  Whether you are a foodie, artsy, athletic, entrepreneurial, or eclectic; Kansas City has it, and whatever ""it"" is it is usually close to campus"
College Junior,5,"Our Greek System had the highest GPA in 2013 of any greek system in the country.  That being said, the Greeks also provide a great social scene for non-greeks as well as service and philanthropy opportunities"
College Junior,5,"Rockhurst does not use TA's so you always receive grades and feedback from the professor.  In the business school, most professors do consulting work and bring that real world experience to the classroom.  The combination of a solid Career Services department and open-door policy professors makes finding your strengths and translating them to an internship simple.  Teachers are always willing to help"
College Junior,5,"Almost every member of the Administration has an open door policy and is very open to student feedback.  I say almost every member because the top management (president, VP's) are usually pretty busy in their offices.  However, on any given day, you can catch them in the dining hall or taking a walk around campus and stop to chat."
College Junior,5,"Rockhurst is located within 10 minutes of four major Kansas City resturant and bar areas including Waldo, Brookside, Westport, and Power and Light/Downtown.  Chains are very close if interested, but if you want to try new places and local eateries, there is always something new... and close"
College Sophomore,5,Rockhurst is a great school
College Sophomore,5,They have helped me with my tuition which I am very grateful for.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone in the program is willing to go extra mile to help me the teachers are great.
College Freshman,5,"I love how open and caring the professors are for the students, I feel more like a name, rather than a number. Everyone is very nice and polite and I enjoy how you can stop on campus and have a conversation with anyone because we are all open and accepting."
College Sophomore,5,A little expensive but many options to choose from.
College Sophomore,5,"Rockhurst provides a great learning experience.  Class sizes are small, and the professors actually get to know the students."
College Sophomore,5,"I am in the Communication Sciences and Disorders program, and it has been a great experience.  The professors are very helpful and friendly, and everyone in the program is very close."
Freshman,4,"Brief review as a freshman: So far, academics at this university is pretty good. The professors are very nice and are willing to help you out. The campus is very pretty, and the food is good. The only problem is that the neighborhood around the University is a tad unsafe, but I haven't encountered any problems so far."
Freshman,4,"The learning experience at Rockhurst University is going good so far. It was obvious that this was the first time they implemented this for COVID-19, but they adapted very fast during the first month, and it's going smoothly ever since."
Junior,4,"The school is very nice in both its size, curriculum, and atmosphere. The teachers are great. The food could be improved. The student population is very academically focused in the STEM and Art fields. They have great Jesuit followings and teachings."
Sophomore,4,"As most students would agree, online learning was a challenge. Most of my professors were very good about keeping us in the loop and making online learning as comfortable as it could be. There were a couple who did an alright job, but there were times where everyone was confused as to what was currently going in in the class."
Junior,4,"Online classes were a weird shift, especially during all that's currently going on but Rockhurst professors and the academics department overall made it really easy to be able to have a smooth rest of the semester (as smooth as possible) and the necessary transitions to go online was very quick and efficient. While there was a bit of a struggle with some professors, the majority of them were very understanding and helpful."
Junior,4,"I love Rockhurst and the community feeling that it has. Not only is this felt with students, but with professors and other staff members all around campus. The housing options are good and it's really easy to feel at home here."
Freshman,4,"Rockhurst is a very good academic institution with many opportunities to get involved. The athletics are pretty good, although we are missing some sports. The area is not very good. Housing and dorm rooms are pretty good, nicely sized. If you want a party school, this is not the school for you. But otherwise, the school is a very nice one."
Senior,4,I like how small the class sizes are and the professors know you by name. The campus is also pretty small (but beautiful) so it is easy to walk to class in no time.
Junior,4,The professors are awesome and accessible. Very nice buildings and plenty of places to study. Tutors in the Learning Resource Center are fantastic as well as the supplemental instruction teachers.
Senior,4,"I transferred from a school in Chicago, I chose to go here mainly for the education. The Physical Therapy school here is great, and I really enjoy how every class that I take is applied to what I want to do in the future, which is to go to PT school. As well as having certain clubs and opportunities to get involved around campus and possible interact with your professors (if you decide to attend PT school at Rockhurst). Rockhurst University is great because from your freshman year to your senior year, you will gain a lot of connections with people who either work in the field that you want to enter or can help you be meet someone who is in that field. Service is also a huge part of Rockhurst, rather it be cleaning up the Kansas City area, or working with children and helping them stay active."
Sophomore,4,"At first I was unsure what to expect when I accepted a scholarship to a small school of only 2,000 people.  Looking back now, I would not change my decision of choosing Rockhurst for so many reasons, especially the fact that it is a smaller university.  My teachers know my name and class load and are more than willing to help me when I need it.  The university gives out great scholarships to their students.  Each staff member you meet cares about you as an individual and wants to do their part in helping you succeed."
Sophomore,4,my friend's coach professors Rockhurst has given me a better worth ethic all people I have talked to said they wished they would've attended Rockhurst.
Sophomore,4,I love this college as it really has let me grow as a student more than I feel like I could have in a larger environment. The people are amazing and the only problem I have is that our theater program has little love and money dedicated to it.
Senior,4,"Rockhurst is a small, Jesuit school right the heart of Kansas City.  Currently working on my accounting degree, I believe that the Helzberg school of business is the best school at Rockhurst.   They provide students with ample opportunities for connections in the Kansas City area. With that being said, the area is a bit sketch.  Be VERY careful and do not walk to college parties.  Always get a ride."
Freshman,4,Everyone is very welcoming. Easy to create a relationship with your professors which allows for it to be easier to get help from them when the time comes.
Sophomore,4,Great school. I really loved my time here. The atmosphere is like no other. Everyone here is accepting and nonjudgmental of  others. The adjuncts are competent and fair in grading.
Freshman,4,Rockhurst University is a small community in a big city. This small school has a big impact in the local community and not only educates students but shows them how to be leaders.
College Sophomore,4,The staff works very hard to make sure you are set up for great opportunities. They also help to communicate these opportunities to you and try to make every student aware of the possibilities.
College Sophomore,4,The greek life I have witness so far has indicated it is a positive community meant to build quality relationships.
College Sophomore,4,I have not attended the school long enough to have a true opinion. The little I gave seen has shown me that Rockhurst uses sports as an outlet and a motivator and not a indication of popularity or privilege.
College Sophomore,4,"Coming from a larger school I have really grown to love the small school environment. Rockhurst does a fantastic job making all students feel important. While at first I did miss the extra amenities available at my previous larger, public school, I quickly understood the small sacrifices I was making in order to have a more personal and positive experience."
College Freshman,4,It is kinda scary walking around campus alone at night but security is always willing to give you a ride home. There are cameras everywhere.
College Freshman,4,I really loved living in Mcgee. Yes there are some possible updates they could do to it but overall it was a good experience.
College Freshman,4,"I am not part of Greek Life but my friends are. Since this is a very small school, it is not a big deal whether or not you are involved in greek life."
College Junior,4,I know that the alumni network is great. The career services is one of the best things on campus!
College Freshman,4,There is great diversity in each area
College Freshman,4,There is a great campus security presence
College Freshman,4,They work hard to form an alumni network and often have employers recruiting on campus
College Freshman,4,The freshmen girls dorm is very close to the most commonly used buildings
College Freshman,4,It has been great so far!
Recent Alumnus,4,Everybody can go to the parties
College Freshman,4,I love watching the sports teams here.
College Senior,4,"Here at Rockhurst, the most popular sports seems to be men's and women's soccer. Men's and women's lacrosse teams were recently established, and men's and women's basketball seems very popular. The women's volleyball team also had a good season this past year. All of the sports are Division 2, so sports are not as popular at Rockhurst as they are at other schools, but the soccer games are fun to go to. We also get updates on the performance of the sports teams in our student portal, which is nice."
College Freshman,4,"All the professors were great and I'm very happy with the variety of courses offered by the school. There is plenty of study areas both on campus and off. The workloads are average and the professors are flexible, when students properly inform the professors on there situation."
College Freshman,4,"I've been offered to drink and always decline the offer, but have never been pressured to drink or felt embarrassed of my decisions. People seem to cooperate and understand."
College Freshman,4,"The campus has an extremely low crime rate and has several security measures in place. The campus is very secure and offers 24-hour security watch and assistance. The students are all given the security service's number at the beginning of the semester, and are encouraged to get to know the officers to build confidence in calling whenever help is needed."
College Freshman,4,Greek life at Rockhurst is a great way to get involved and helping students learn more about the opportunities offered by the school. The Greeks and non-Greeks get along very well.
College Freshman,4,"Because the school is a part of the Jesuit community, the campus is located in a bad part of town. However, though, the security and safety is really great. There have been incidents of crime around campus, but there had never been a time where I felt unsafe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is what you make of it - if you join, it can be great, but not joining, can also be great. The school doesn't allow rush until second semester, so throughout all of the first semester, you are able to make so many friends. It's nice though because I am non-Greek, and I have many Greek friends that I absolutely love. The school is too small for there to be Greek housing, and I think that makes a difference, but not in a bad way. It allows Greeks to be around non-Greeks just as much, and even allows there to be no cliquiness or anything."
College Freshman,4,"The school's biggest sport is soccer, and it really shows with the students and how the team did this season. For every home game, the stands are packed with students and families, and the student spirit is one in the same with a D1 school's spirit. This past season, the soccer team made it all the way to the Final Four for D2 soccer, and I think a major part of this was the fan support as well the athlete's skill."
College Sophomore,4,I absolutely love Rockhurst! It's an excellent school with a great reputation. The school helps one develop a strong work ethic. I have enjoyed getting involved in it's community and giving back to the public at the same time. The student activities are abundant and the opportunities to make more friends are endless. The only thing i would do over is finding more scholarships prior to enrolling because unfortunately the tuition went up making it a financial strain on my family.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the small community, and everyone is super nice. I never feel like I'm being judged here. The teachers know my name and the classes are interesting and challenging"
College Freshman,4,There are lots of great and different areas for food and fun near campus.
College Freshman,4,I find Rockhurst to have a very positive atmosphere with wonderful and caring administration.
College Freshman,4,"The Administration here at Rockhurst works hard to ensure student safety from any and all potential harms. This campus has campus security patrolling 24 hours a day, doing full coverage of dorms, buildings, and around campus. The policies are fair and are in place for the students' protection."
College Junior,4,The local restaurants are abundant and delicious but also expensive compared to cooking on your own.
College Junior,4,"Despite being in a low-income neighborhood, campus security is always patrolling 24/7 365 and the student culture is one of watching out for each other.  Emergency procedures are practiced every semester"
College Junior,4,"It is easy to find a place that fits all budgets.  If you have a small budget and are ok with a less safe neighborhood, you can find housing.  If you have a bigger budget, you can live in some pretty upscale apartments on the Country Club Plaza.  Security patrols two blocks in all directions off campus, which is where the majority of students live.  Also, UMKC houses are across the street and offer a college student-heavy atmosphere and great security"
College Junior,4,Resident staff is very nice.  Freshman Residence halls were renovated in 2007 and 2008.  On Campus houses and Town Houses are also available.
College Sophomore,4,Taking the general classes freshman year helps you to determine if the major is right for you. It is usually not hard to get into a program unless you waited until your junior year to switch or decide (not a very good idea). Academic advisors are really great because they let you know if you are on the right track.
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the buildings look new and up to date. The library is one of my favorite places because there are plenty of options to study at. Never worry about finding a computer because they are everywhere. And buildings are open at night using your id, so it is easy to find a class to study in and a computer to use."
College Sophomore,4,"Plenty of fast food options for a small budget. So many options downtown too. For every budget there is a place to go and eat off campus, and nothing is too far away."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the class size and most of the teachers that I have had have been great. There are some whose teachings methods you have to get used to. They have office hours where they are able to help, even with the smallest question."
College Sophomore,4,Opportunities of job fairs and networking are available on campus and at UMKC
College Sophomore,4,"Small class size is great for me because the teachers get to know you and are easier to talk to once a relationship is established. Best advice: Go to Student Instructor review sessions-its the best way to study! And the library is the best place for group projects or quiet space, and its open until 12."
College Sophomore,4,CSD is great field that I learned about while at RU. I am excited to explore my major.
College Sophomore,4,"Getting and keeping good grades are a must. They are pretty good with giving scholarships, but if you slack off it will be decreased. I would recommend applying for outside scholarships all four years to decrease the amount of loans."
College Sophomore,4,"McGhee and Corcoran are the best dorms on campus, they are cleaned once a day and there are actives to do for your floor. X-L is not the best dorm because it is older, there are usually upperclass living here- it is cheaper though. The THVs are great and spacious. Living in an off campus house may not be the best idea unless it is closer to the school."
College Sophomore,4,"Kansas City is beautiful and fun any time of the week. Being close to the city makes night life fun, but there are other options such as movies, shopping, sports teams, etc"
College Sophomore,4,"This is a school that will give you a lot of money to come there if you do well in high school and ACT/SAT. That's how they get you, and then you get there and realize the mistake you made."
College Junior,2,"Rockhurst is a very small school so most ""partying"" takes place off of campus."
College Junior,2,The administration routinely inhibits organizations on campus and is fairly inaccessible to community concerns.
College Junior,2,"Expensive. Moderate quality. Limited food options. Forced, large meal plans if living on-campus."
College Sophomore,2,I don't enjoy attending parties I am a christian.  I don't drink or smoke.
College Freshman,2,"The housing for underclassmen is good, but XL is in great need of improvement.  There is not enough availability for on campus housing besides the dorms, it is a very competitive process and is very biased."
College Freshman,2,Most people live on campus because the neighborhoods around Rockhurst are not usually the safest
College Freshman,2,"The few lots we have fill up quickly, and no one wants to park in the garage"
College Freshman,2,The street Rockhurst is on makes many students feel unsafe. You can often hear police sirens or gunshots.  Going to a nearby store alone will almost always make for an uncomfortable experience.
College Freshman,2,"Most students are not aware of when athletic events are happening, I have personally never attended one.  The school spirit is high in certain circles but in general not a big thing."
College Freshman,2,"I thought I would enjoy Rockhurst because I loved how small my high school was.  I still like the one-on-one relationship I get with a professor at Rockhurst, but group projects and class time with little participation or effort from other students makes it difficult to enjoy learning.  I would not choose my school again because people here are very cliquey, rude, and are not open to new ideas.  Also, since it is such a small school and I live on campus, I often feel stuck here.  There are not a lot of options for food, activities, etc.  I think I will enjoy a college with more going on and one with more choices."
College Junior,2,"Coming from being a member of Greek life at the University of Missouri, Rockhurst University offers little national PHA sororities. However, I have been told that just about everyone joins a sorority here, so in that aspect the Greek community is strong."
College Junior,2,"Because our student population is so small, there is not much diversity. We have a handful of international students."
College Junior,2,"My university is very small, only 3,000 students, therefore our athletics are lacking. We do not have a football team like most colleges, but we do shift our attention to soccer. Our soccer teams do well as well as our volleyball team. We have a tennis team, basketball, softball, and baseball."
College Freshman,2,"Not the best, the food is pretty much the same every week."
College Freshman,2,"We dont have football. But we have soccer, the real football."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Dangerous Neighborhood – It's not the safest neighborhood. So that limits night life, but keeps you safe."
College Sophomore,2,"Good, but not great.  Freshman dorms are good, but the upperclassmen dorms are a step down"
College Freshman,2,The nightlife at Rockhurst is pretty crappy. There are not many options for students. A lot of older students go to bars in the Power and Light District. There are some house parties however there are nights where nothing at all is going on.
College Sophomore,2,"A College Shaped Toilet – I found the curriculum rigorously useless. A large waste of time, entirely unchallenging and half the profs are too absurd. Rick Janet is well worth your time. The English department was an utter dissapointment. Poor at developing critical thinking and worse yet at assigning much other than busy work. I would not pursue this education unless you desire science or bussiness degrees and enjoy a good party."
College Junior,2,"The library is small but adequate for the size of the school. The gym is extremely small and always crowded. There is a nice student lounge, (the Rock Room), where students can hang out and play ping pong or watch TV."
College Junior,1,"Make an appointment and ask about every option available to you. Otherwise, financial aid does nothing to inform or help you."
College Sophomore,1,"The Rockos are constantly looking for something and creep around. Once you get caught with something one time, they are vultures on you the rest of your time there."
College Junior,1,"not much available in the immediate walking area.  if you have a car, the city is yours to take on."
College Freshman,1,"Pretty Average – The most Rockhurst has going for it is the awesome scholarships that are easily given. The social scene is not that big here and many people clear out on weekends either to go home or visit Mizzou. The food also is not that good compared to other colleges, but one can live on it."
College Junior,1,"Rockhurst is a wonderful school located in a horrible area. It is not uncommon to hear gunshots at night or during the day. Police sirens are common, as are mass emails about crimes that have occured on the streets surrounding the school. It is definitely not somewhere you want to be walking alone."
College Junior,1,Not Too Safe – There are always cops and school security around but the area is really poor and safety is constantly an issue.
College Senior,1,"""24 Hour Computer Lab&quot – This lab is supposed to be 24 hours so students can use it anytime.  While it is open 24 hours, there are classes in it all day leaving students who do not live in a dorm, without a place to print things or use the computers in the science building when they need them."
College Sophomore,1,"Overpriced and Underquality – The meal plans are ridiculously expensive. The least expensive option is still way too much. Being forced to pay thousands and thousands of dollars for food makes it even more difficult to pay for school. The meal points don't roll over to fall semester, making it a huge waste of money. The food is also not anywhere close to reasonably priced. I'd rather live on Ramen noodles, which are way cheaper, and even though they're not the best for you, neither is the food offered on campus. Everything seems to be fried and full of fat. I wish there was a healthier option. Also, you'd think if you're spending $10 on a small meal, it would be delicious. However, that is not the case at all. There are only 3 dining options on campus, and usually only one or two are open. Sometimes none are open. There hsould be some food source that is constantly open, or vending machines that accept meal points instead of cash. There aren't many close, safe dining options off campus, as we're smack dab in the middle of a very dangerous neighborhood. The campus dining needs some serious work."
College Freshman,1,"Work Needs to Be Done – I play baseball here at Rockhurst. I really enjoy playing, but the facilities that are at our disposal are minimal. The basketball, softball, and soccer teams all use the basketball court as an indoor facility when it rains, minimizing the amount of productivity during wet weather. Not the best facilities and more concerned with the religious part of the university."

Freshman,5,I love Saint Augustine’s university because of the small oriented nature. Students are given easy access to attention meaning there’s literally almost nothing you can have worries about here and not get the proper help. Saint Augustine’s put their students first and for the small environment we have here they do it very well and I couldn’t be more pleased!
Freshman,5,"I went to Saint  Augustine  University for the orientation and to meet some of the professors, students, and a tour around campus. It was an amazing experience I could never forget! They showed us around the university and talked about the history and meaning of every building there, also they explained to us exactly what they expected from there students and there expectations were high because they believe everyone can succeed if they have a good and focus mindset. The students there are very encouraging and outgoing, they know how to make a good first impression on you that you will never forget. I believe St  Augustine  well be an amazing college for me and everyone else."
Sophomore,5,"It's a really nice and quite university. Everybody is friendly and quick to answer you needs to help you. Always somebody that will point you into the right direction. Very professional and neat so nobody loses your information, they actually care about you unlike some schools will toss your paperwork right to the side, the staff is not like that."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy it wish it had more programs . I really enjoy the fact it gives others a second chance. Also really enjoy that it’s a small college
Sophomore,5,My experience at the school so far is great it open avenues for you get internships and later jobs. The life at the school is pretty good becasue you get the chance to be involved in activities that are being held on the campus.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at saint augustines is a very good experience, I have done so many things here on campus and I have met so many people who acts like me. I have been able to focus without any distractions. I've also gotten to know my professors and they know me. I was undecided about coming here but I do not regret it. Great people. The campus isn't big but it is a perfect size for me."
Junior,5,"I can say that saint augustine's university is a very small school, and you can get to know your professors better and its a very safe environment. What needs improvement is financial aid because they're raising the tuition and they're giving less money."
Sophomore,5,"Saint Augustine's University is a place any high-school graduate would love to attend. This university would show you whatever you set your mind to accomplish you would do so. Saint Augustine's is a place of change it would help you become the person that you want to be in life. My experience so far at this university has been the best, I left high school with a 2.0, now I am maintaining a 3.0 therefore I recommend saint Augustine's for anyone."
Senior,5,"I have learned how to be an adult. The four years I have been at St. Augustine's. University I have learned responsibility.

College Sophomore,5,I believe that the business departments is one of the best departments other then STEM majors. The teachers actually care about the students future. All of the Accounting majors stay focused and try to be the top students at the school.
College Sophomore,5,Being that North Carolina State University is right around the corner there are many affordable off-campus housing that is available.
College Student,5,"I chose Saint Augustine's University because it had a pyschology program, the campus is small, and the instructors are very engaged with the students."
College Sophomore,5,"The off-campus dining options near SAU would be Buffalo Wild Wings, T.G.I Fridays, Chipotle, Burger King and Bojangles, and these restaurants are rated an A, because they are all indeed convenient, and the prices are very convenient and affordable as well. At a few of these restaurants, a student discount is given, and for the most important part, these restaurants give a decent amount of food that will definitely fill you up and leave you satisfied."

Junior,4,It has been a great experience. Academics are great. Every professor cares and takes time to know you.
Senior,4,Something that I like about the school is that there is teachers who are always advising you to be successful and the importance of going to graduate school. It is a small campus so everyone know each other. Something I’ll like to see change is the good that is being provided on campus. Better variety that student could have and actually enjoy so they do not spend so much money buying food outside.
Freshman,4,"Saint Augustine's college is a wonderful college that provides a great learning environment and ensures black excellence. It's a private  HBCU in Raleigh, North Carolina and my experience was great. The teachers care about their students and make sure they can do everything they need in order to succeed for their degree. The environment is peaceful with lots of learning activities throughout the school. Me personally I say my freshman experience at Saint Augustine was perfect and i recommend this school to anybody."

College Freshman,4,I like that my school is very small so u get a lot of one on one time with my professors. They are really understanding and they will let you come Ina t anytime during their office hours or while they are just in there and help you with anything you need.
College Freshman,4,There are so many internship opportunities that my school offers. If you are into news broadcasting and radio then you can get internships with Fox News. Also with internships you can travel to places like New York of California.
College Freshman,4,With the dorm building I stay in its close by to all of my classes which is a plus for me. Most dorm halls have to share community bathrooms but in the building I stay in we have our own bathroom which we share with a suit mate. I love that we have our own because we can decorate it and it always stays clean.
College Freshman,4,Since this was my freshman year off college the Greeks have made my college experience better. I've seen the way they help us also with their charities and fundraisers that they do is incredible but they also like to invite us to join some of there festivities also.
College Freshman,4,With attending a HBCU I learned things about African American history that I never knew. It was really empowering to hear guess speakers all over talk about history and their background. This school is unique because it was the first hospital for African Americans and slaves down south which is currently on our campus today. I would choose to go to this school again because attending here has made me learn so much more about our history.
College Sophomore,4,My experience so far has been great. I have been on deans list since my freshmen year of college. Although i have financial issues from time too time i tend to make it through by either applying for scholarships or academic scholarships.

College Junior,4,OUR TRACK TEAM IS GREAT
College Junior,4,THE TEACHERS IS GREAT I AM LEARNING A LOT ABOUT MY MAJOR.
College Senior,4,Off campus housing is great
College Senior,4,There really aren't many on campus parties. If you want to have a good time you must get off campus. There is ALWAYS a party or club to go to.
College Senior,4,I love the city of Raleigh. People here are nice. Its a great place to be and hang out. Its always somewhere to eat and chill. They even have great cafés when you want to get off campus and study.
College Senior,4,I love the Greeks on campus. Its a small school so its easy to get to know them. They are cool people for the most part.
College Senior,4,"Saint Aug is an HBCU. So of course the majority of students are African American with the exception of a few other ethnicities. Even though we are African American, a lot of us come from different countries and cultural backgrounds."

College Senior,4,If you do the math it is cheaper than on campus housing. Nice places to live as well.
College Senior,4,"The off-campus dining options are pretty good. They are not that far from campus, we have a decent variety of foods to choose from and the prices are reasonable.

College Junior,4,"There are many different food places, museums, festivals, parks, etc. in the area that you can explore."
College Sophomore,4,They are always on standby and alert.
College Sophomore,4,I was not eligable to recieve or apply for any of the scholarships but the financial aid advisors we very helpful. Since I was involved in a activity I was eventually ablel to find the money. But the best advice is to always ask for help and never give up on finding the money.
College Sophomore,4,this university has zero tolerance in the academic and strictness in their students lives.
College Sophomore,4,"saint augustine's university is very accepted of religin beliefs, their background for economic background is exceptable to any student who attend their university, sexual orientation is not a problem towards their student environment."
College Senior,4,The nightlife is good because this is a college town being that their a lot of other universities surrounding ours 
College Junior,4,"the prices are okay but the parking spots fill up fast
"
College Junior,4,it's very good housing for people who doesn't want a roommate

College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of fun activities off campus. Although I am not from I am not from the city that my school is in , it didn't take me long to adjust . Being a young college student who doesn't smoke , drink , or party , i can still go out and have a good time."

College Sophomore,4,i ride back and forth with my family.
College Sophomore,4,"The computer access is great but, from time to time the wireless service in some dorms is poor. "

College Junior,4,Nice student to a class ratio allow the teacher to show more individuals better attention
College Junior,4,"not alot of snow, but the weather is not all that bad."

College Sophomore,4,I love going off campus because there is so uch more to do. I love visiting hillsboro street it has eveything including resturaunts and diners it even has a bowling alley!
College Sophomore,4,"They are great for the most part, some just need to be updated and system is down to often"
Sophomore,2,"Saint Aug is a poorly functioning institution with low student morale, poor faculty retention, unkempt facilities, and underwhelming academic programs. I was dripped on by a moldy ceiling tile in the ladies' room. Water leaked into a lighting enclosure during my class. My professors often cancel class. The faculty, staff, and students mistreat early college students."
Junior,2,I would like to see them change the way they run the school. They run the school how it used to be ran in the 1970's.
Freshman,2,"I am a international hispanic student, I enrolled at saint agustine's and as soon as I started I saw that some of my expectations and things i was told were not 100% true but not 100% lies, they were in the grey area. The for its terrible, like disgusting, except for wednesday's lunch is acceptable. The facilities are old and the smell of weed is EVERYWHERE!!!! but rumor is that the school will be closing next semester so we'll see. Its not horrible but it could defiantly be better with simple changes."
Senior,2,Its been a long grueling process. Stressed is the best way to describe it. I transferred here but I couldn't see myself attending this University for 4 years.
College Junior,2,"Student center is old dated, with not many resources."
College Senior,2,"Gym is small. Unfinished stadium. Not many campus events. The yard is kept up for the most part, but needs some work. The library is nice."
College Sophomore,2,They said that they had it but they didn't and no one had a clue that it was part of the program.
College Sophomore,2,Its not the best and there is a lot of shooting that happens.
College Sophomore,2,Even though there are rule students don't seem to follow them.
College Sophomore,2,There should be speacial housing for the greeks to make their experience and organizations more exclusive. 
College Junior,2,You need a decal to park on campus if not displayed security will give you a fine. Parking usually try to get a spot before somebody else do
College Freshman,2,I AM FROM NEW YORK CITY AND I FEEL THAT RALEIGH IS JUST NOT A PLACE FOR A BIG CITY GIRL LIKE ME.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much student life on campus, there is nothing really to do on campus. We can go to student center and play some pool and that's about it."
College Freshman,2,There isn't to much to do on campus. Our gym is small and not much room on there. I play football and I love our football field. If I want to do a lot I have to go off campus to do it.
College Freshman,2,The weather is ok except when it rain hard or snow. when it rains hard you have to run to class or to your room because it rains so hard. If it snows you have to be carful not to fall. When it looks good outside everyone is out.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a variety of minors offered, but I would have to say that there isnt enough. Some of the students arent willing to learn so it makes the class environment dull."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are not the best , they need a lot of work but they are in living conditions. The upperclassmen dorms are way better, for example fallcrest you have your own room and only share a bathroom with one other person unlike sharing with three other people. The positive thing about the freshmen dorms are they are closer to the building where classes take place."
College Freshman,2,The bathroom could be better and the elevators always breaking down
College Freshman,2,Not much variety at all. The cafe hours is something that should be changed. No on campus resturants other than the grill which is always out of something. The cafe has its good days though.
College Junior,2,"We don't have much of a nightlife on campus. We only get one party a month and most times that gets canceled. However when we do have one they ar normally really good and don't cost a lot. However, we are not far from the downtown area and most clubs send shuttles to campus to pick up students who want to party off campus. So it's not that bad."
Niche User,1,"Long story short, saint aug puts on a front as if their school is well organized and a wonderful hbcu. THIS IS THE WORST HBCU TO ATTEND IN NC. DO NOT GO. Socially, the people there are rude and money hungry, the cafe is disgusting, and students are only there to party and worry about anyone else but themselves..not sure how some even made it to college. Most of the buildings are falling apart and hardly any elevators work, and the dorm rooms are disgusting. This is not a good school. Save your money."
Sophomore,1,"Black mold, leakages, and roaches in residence halls, Very disorganized school in finance & student affairs departments. School is in debt & they take it out on the students by making their tuition skyrocket. With all the money they raise & take from students you’d think they’d fix campus issues like unfinished field, no locker room for athletes, closed down buildings, and limited parking. I understand that the school is in debt but no student wants to enroll into or stay in this environment."
College Junior,1,"I HAVE BEEN THEIR 3 YEARS AND  THEY JUST CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER, ONE PERSON WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE OWN 3,000 AND ANOTHER PERSON WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE A CREDIT OF 520.00. THEY ARE NOT ON THE SAME PAGE THEY NEED TO GET SOME 6 GRADERS TO COUNT FOR THEM,"
College Junior,1,THE OFFICE IS THE WORST THEY NEED A BETTER PROGRAM.
College Senior,1,"I love my cafeteria ladies, but the food is horrible. I'm not a picky eater either. On Thursday and Friday. The cafeteria is where its at. Thursday is fried chicken and Friday is fried fish."
College Sophomore,1,driving to campus does not apply to me.
College Sophomore,1,"The food is not good, and it does not help in the winter when its freezing cold and you have to wake up to eat walk across campus to eat food that's not even worth it. All the food places around are far and the neighborhood is to dangerous to walk to them any ways"
College Sophomore,1,There are a lot of individuals that feel like that they are at school just to show off. Having the best outfit on campus is not going to get you a great career. Fighting is only going to get you put out of school.
College Sophomore,1,"Majority of the officers are cool as long as you are respectful to them.  A few of them are accustomed to rude and obnoxious people, so they may treat you the same way before you can disrespect them and I don't like that.  Sometimes they worry about the less important things.  For example, instead of filling noise complaints they should be worried about people's dorms getting broken into."
College Sophomore,1,"There are only two places to get food from on campus; the cafeteria and the grill.  The cafe is open during select hours and the food is not enticing.  Food choices are limited.  The grill is like an upgrade from the cafe, but it does not make much of a difference.  Again the choices are limited and they also aren't the healthiest."
College Freshman,1,as a psychology major I've learned and seen for myself that there are people that has been here since 2006 because it is just that hard to pass psychology in this school. majority of these majors either end up dropping out or changing their major because they just can't do it.
College Freshman,1,this school just recently became drug free but campus police doesn't treat it that way because when you get caught with it over and over again it's just a slap on the wrist basically.
College Freshman,1,"Feshman's can't have cars on campus, because of the lack of parking space. There is not enough space for us to have cars as well as the upperclassman."
College Sophomore,1,Printing and Network Reliability Is Bad – Almost every computer lab lacks paper supply or either students are stealing paper. It seems that every every other week the Wireless network is down. This is a serious inconvenience.

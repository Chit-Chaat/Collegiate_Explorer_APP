Senior,5,"Relatively inexpensive for a university, and it offers a variety of programs for many different disciplines."
Sophomore,5,The campus is beautiful and the people here are really friendly. My dorms are awesome and the food is great. Can't complain.
Sophomore,5,The online courses taken so far have been great. Professors spend extra time and attention to ensure the online programs are just as effective as in-person courses.
Sophomore,5,"ETSU is a great school.  Professors are personable and genuine. My only complaint is cost, but most quality educational institutions are."
Sophomore,5,Teachers were prepared when the Corona virus stalled in school classes. The school already has an online system for students so the transition to online was seamless.
Sophomore,5,Teacher and other faculty members alike are punctual and happy to help when a problem comes up. Teachers are well prepared for class and give students the best performance to get great grades.
Senior,5,I have enjoyed being enrolled at East Tennessee state university. I take online classes and the professors have been extremely helpful.
Senior,5,The entire time I have been enrolled at etsu I have taken my classes online and enjoyed the experience.
Senior,5,"Ive taken about a fourth of my classes online, and I have found that it really depends on which department your class is in. The sciences will always be harder online, but the psych and more liberal arts based classes are fairly easier. It also depends on your own motivation to do well."
Senior,5,The faculty and staff in the Health Science department are dedicated to their students success!! I have always had the support from my professors and advisors that I needed to excel and now go on to get my masters.
Junior,5,Great location and people. I love Johnson City and all that the area provides. My experience with professors has been great as well. They are always helpful and knowledgeable.
Junior,5,All of the online classes that I've taken at ETSU have worked smoothly. My professors were able to use the software well and to their advantage and they were still able to effectively teach.
Junior,5,I love my online classes the professors make sure we have access to all the materials to the course. I have done very well in all my online classes and that is because of the amazing professors that I have had.
Junior,5,East Tennessee State University is an amazing campus everyone is so involved making it an amazing place to go to college. I love that it is in the mountains cause there is always places to go to hike and enjoy the outdoors. There are also places all over campus to study and that is very important to me.
Graduate Student,5,"I really enjoyed the size of the university. It wasn't too small, nor too big. Some of my starting classes were large, but as time went on the class size got smaller. The only thing I would change about the university is the buildings. Some are older and outdated."
Graduate Student,5,I took plenty of online classes at East Tennessee State University and never had any problem with them. I often preferred them over regular classes since I could do them on my own time. The professors were always helpful when I reached out to them for help.
Junior,5,So far this is an amazing college to go to school! Every decision is made with having the students in mind.
Junior,5,I did take online classes and they were very easy and understandable. So professors are harder to understand than others but they correct themselves and help with one simple email.
Sophomore,5,"As we all know, Covid-19 has put a huge dent in semesters. We had to switch to online learning. I was very worried about it at first, but the professors did an amazing job at still continuing with the effort and enthusiasm of teaching and helping!"
Junior,5,Overall I am having a good experience at East Tennessee State University. The atmosphere is well rounded and diverse. The faculty are very helpful in accordance to any situation you may be going through. Also the athletes keep the campus up beat or leisure time.  Renovations were made to the campus in order to make campus lie better for the students.

Freshman,5,I like the amount of friendly people on and around the campus and everyone makes you feel welcome to be there.
Freshman,5,It is a good and friendly campus that makes you fill welcome and you have a lot of opportunities for a better future.
Niche User,5,I loved the diversity and professor connection with students. It really makes you feel at home. The college itself is beautiful and scenic. The staff and students are all very friendly.
Niche User,5,"I did not take any classes online, being as I am an upcoming freshmen. But, seeing the college and the colleges interactions I can only imagine how easy the online courses would be."
Junior,5,"I love ETSU. It is in my hometown, so I can still live at home while receiving a world-class education. The campus is beautiful and the staff really advocate for the students."
Alum,5,ETSU offers a very robust online curriculum.  It was easy to get courses pertaining to my field of study.  ETSU also participates in TN online so courses offered may be obtained across the state from other participating colleges.
Alum,5,East Tennessee State is a great university.  Attending in the 1980’s and doing on line courses now has been a wonderful experience.  My first experience was as a first time college student and the campus was conducive for the college experience without being overwhelming.  The programs offered enabled students to make a career choice that would sustain them throughout their working career.  My second experience was as a working mother and wife.  I wanted to further my career in my field.  Courses were offered online and were appropriate for a working individual.  Overall ETSU is a wonderful college offering a lot of career opportunities.
Niche User,5,I met friends who turned into family & i've never had that. It was definitely a different experience but i don’t regret a thing.
Sophomore,5,"The campus at East Tennessee State University is not too big to where one may be overwhelmed with everything, but it is also not too small to where one can feel trapped without anything to do. Dr. Noland, the ETSU president, is always doing his best to listen and understand the students needs as well as get to know everyone. ETSU is beautiful and welcoming, and teachers here really do care. The students create an opening and welcoming community. There are many different clubs and opportunities to be involved on campus, as well. In addition, the new Culp Center creates a super easy going and fresh environment to enjoy your favorite foods and hang out sessions with friends. Overall I have met some amazing people here, and the teachers really care about your success and well being."
Sophomore,5,East Tennessee State is one of the most friendly and welcoming campuses i have visited. The moment I showed interest in attending the students and staff communicated with me through email and over postal mail being super welcoming and encouraging.
Freshman,5,"East Tennessee State University is a beautiful place surrounded by shops and restaurants. If you love the outdoors, Johnson City is the place to be. It has amazing views and trails for your everyday enjoyment. The people are super nice and the campus is always monitored by the campus police. It is very protected and safe."
Sophomore,5,I am currently a sophomore at ETSU majoring in nursing. This college has a tough curriculum but the faculty and staff are very supportive and willing to go the extra mile for their students. The amenities are outstanding at ETSU as well!
Freshman,5,"Very good school and atmosphere! The D.P. Culp is currently under construction but when it is finished, it will be a great place to hangout!"
Junior,5,East Tennessee State is such a welcoming and beautiful school! Everyone has been so kind and helpful.
Freshman,5,My experience at ETSU has been astounding. I have met and made alot of new friends. I have learned the skill of balancing work and academic success. I value teamwork and achieving my goals through studying and hard work.
Freshman,5,"The people are are so nice. My professors are great and actually try to make sure you know the material. The campus is gorgeous and not too big. You can get across the campus in about fifteen minutes. The dorms are nice and well-kept. I feel really cared about here and I know if I need help, I can talk to anyone."
Senior,5,I love how it is different from northeast state. I love the students and staff. They are so nice and willing to work with you.
Freshman,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience here at ETSU! I live on campus with a fantastic roommate. The dorm situation has worked out very well for us. The only drawback is the required meal plan. The food is good, but I don't use it nearly enough to make it worth the money. Beyond that however, I have made many wonderful memories and had a great time as a student here at East Tennessee State University."
Niche User,5,East Tennessee State has the most gorgeous campus I've visited so far. The view is utterly amazing and the campus is very safe. 10/10 recommend.
Niche User,5,"This school has a beautiful campus with a decently priced tuition. What was the greatest thing for me? Well for me it was how amazing their classes were, for cybersecurity that had classes that were so mesmerizing and intriguing they were fun still a lot to learn but that was to be expected. Their administration was great as well as people on campus who are usually very friendly, I just fit right in and it was great."
Freshman,5,ETSU is a great environment to be in! So many different types of people and great educators. There are also so many opportunities to get involved.
Niche User,5,I am a dual enrollment student and this my college choice for the next four years. From my experience this is the best choice for me. The professors give great feedback  and the atmosphere is safe. It is an around great and communicable.
Freshman,5,"I loved ETSU! It is more then a University to me, it is one huge family and you can notice that as soon as you step foot on campus. Everyone is so welcoming and respectful, they make you feel like some sort of celebrity. Hands down one of the best universities in the nation!"
Junior,5,"I have been here for 3 years so far, and ETSU is my dream college. This college has great diversity in culture, race, and athletics. You can come here and make so many friends from many different places and expand your horizons. ETSU has a numerous amount of clubs you can sign up for and meet new people who have the same interests as you. It's campus is great. It is not too big and not too small. The atmosphere is very welcoming and any staff member is committed to helping you. I love this school and I do not regret attending it."
Graduate Student,5,"My experience at East Tennessee State University has been a very positive one. I have taken classes part-time as an undergraduate and have been very satisfied with the education, the professors, the convenient location and the overall good communication from staff. Having been accepted into the Physical Therapy program,  I'm eager to start learning from their well trained staff. The chief recommendation I would make is reducing the cost of classes so students are not saddled with such high student loans."
Sophomore,5,"I will be a second year student at ETSU. I love this university and all of the people that come with it. I am a cheerleader for the University, so I am super involved in the athletic department and meeting a lot of new people. My major is Dental Hygiene which is a very competitive program there. I think that this school is a good fit for a lot of people. There are many extracurricular activities for anyone. It is so easy to find other peers with the same interests as you! One thing I would like to change is more scholarships."
Junior,5,"This is a great experience, with an awesome staff. The culture is great and the level of academics/competition is as high as anywhere."
Sophomore,5,"While being an out of state student I was rather nervous to attend such a well known and reputable college. Like any other freshman it was intimidating to go into a lecture hall filled with so many different people. I soon realized that ETSU would become not only a place to further my knowledge , but a second home. The people are more than kind and I have yet to meet one person who doesn't support the well being and growing of our beloved university. I am currently an incoming sophomore and I am beyond elated to be continuing my education at East Tennessee State University."
Sophomore,5,"It is such a diverse campus that it’s impossible for one person not to fit in somewhere. Also ETSU is such a spirited school that everyone is always coming together as one to support local, and nationwide, causes."
Sophomore,5,"The teachers are very kind, in my experience. The school is very diverse, and offers many programs to get involved with. It also lies on a very beautiful piece of land."
Senior,5,"I have lived on campus and off. The only complaint I have about East Tennessee State is their lack of adequate parking and the ticket writing. Students should not have to pay fines for parking in the only available spots. Overall ETSU is a great school, the teachers are all very helpful. You can tell they really want you to do well."
Sophomore,5,"So far, as a current student I love it here. The community for me in this school feels like home. Professors tend to help you when you are having a hard time or are confused about an assignment. They make sure you succeed in their class and reach your goals. That is what college is about, to help one another."
Senior,5,ETSU has been a great experience for me. They are easy to work with classes wise. I have the freedom to pick my own schedule and work with it. I have also had a great time with extracurricular activities.
Sophomore,5,"I like how big the campus is, it is away from home, and it has been an experience as a first-year freshman in college. I like how I have met a lot of people in my first year and I like how the campus is close to some stores. The campus is big to a certain extent and the campus is not far from too much. The two main things that I would change is the location and the food choices as far as on campus. The people here are okay as well and since ETSU is located in Johnson City, there is not much to do so I have to travel to do some extracurricular activities."
Niche User,5,"With just my visits, I knew this is the place. The school offers the big school academics and feel but in a smaller town & culture. I felt happy & very satisfied in my decision to attend ETSU."
Freshman,5,"Great campus, beautiful tow, nice people! Would be great if they offered more scholarship opportunities."
Freshman,5,"East Tennessee university is so homey and welcoming. Their nursing program is very well known and good. Their diversity and culture make the university seem so lively and well. No other college I would go to, I love this place!"
Sophomore,5,Overall I think that ETSU is a great school. They offer so many different opportunities for student to get involved in activities out of school. Also most of the teachers are very personal and are willing to help you out.
Niche User,5,"East Tennessee State university is a great college with a wide variety of options available. The facilities are well maintained, they make it easy for students to change their gender markers and to file name changes for those who do not identify with their assigned gender at birth. They offer a wide variety of facilities for students on campus, such as a well maintained library, a gym, and a newly updated eating area."
Sophomore,4,Online classes are the hardest when you first attend them. After awhile you get used to keeping up with the classes. You do need to set aside time to work on everything and check D2L frequently.
Junior,4,I had my very first online classes here and the instructors made it easier getting used to a format I wasn't familiar with.
Junior,4,"I ended up going to the campus in Sevier County. I enjoy it because the location is very convenient, and I can get there rather quickly when I need to. The staff there are also helpful whenever I have any questions."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I really like the school! Many of the professors really care about their students. The advisors are able to work with you. They have many groups for people to get involved in."
Freshman,4,"The professor really help with your experience online. The are really flexible! The websites are easy to work with, and there are many online resources that are available."
Freshman,4,ETSU is a pretty decent school in a beautiful area. Most of the teachers are very understanding and will help with anything if you ask for it!
Freshman,4,I had a couple of online classes. I worked at my own pace (and got ahead) so that I finished the majority of the material by mid-semester.
Sophomore,4,"My experience with this university has been a rough one. I started going to classes here in the fall of 2019 as a first generation freshman and some of the facilities were under renovation. Due to this and not being able to stay for the full spring 2020 semester, I was not able to have the full experience of what this school had to offer. What experience I did gather from it, it was a great time! The classes I had taught me all that I expected to learn from them and the teachers were more than willing to help a student, if they asked for some. The housing was fine for living in one of the mixed gender dorms. The food was great with plenty of variety and there are some chain restaurants set up. I'd say overall it's not a shabby university and a great one, if you live in east Tennessee."
Sophomore,4,"East Tennessee is by far the most welcoming place that I have ever experienced! The way that every one is so genuine is really helpful when you're a nervous and shy freshman like I was! I'm going into my sophomore year, and I am more than excited to be greeted with warm smiles! 

There has been a lot of construction going on within this last year! There is a lot of add ons to the cafeteria and it is really nice so far! 

The diversity on campus is amazing! There is a lot of foreign exchange students and learning from them is such a wonderful oppurtunity!"
Junior,4,"I took Psychology online over Summer 2019. The flow of the class was very easy and expectations were well explained, so it made the process easy and did not add any stress."
Junior,4,"So far my experience at ETSU has been pretty good! The campus is nice (especially in the spring and fall) and there's always some type of activity or event going on to partake in. The professors, at least in the Computer Science department, have been great to work with and for the most part, are very understanding and approachable. The dorms themselves are fine. Some of them are a bit dated but that's to be expected at almost any university."
Alum,4,Absolutely loved my time at ETSU. Everything you would expect from the college experience however I never lived on campus so I can speak to that aspect of the school.
Junior,4,"ETSU, so far, has been a decent experience. I love how I’m not required to live on campus- this allows me to stay at home and save money! My professors have been very helpful and caring."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy this school. It's the perfect medium between too small and too large. At ETSU, you're not just a number."
Senior,4,"Etsu has a very pretty campus, especially in the fall and spring. Everyone here is very nice and kind. Downtown Johnson City is near campus, its good place to spend your weekends or a night out. The cafeteria food is alright, but the restaurants on campus aren't bad. Professors are normally good. If you find an excellent professor I recommend taking more of their classes and staying in touch they will appreciate it and it will help you when you approach them for help in the class. The dorms are nice, but a little outdated. The Davis efficiency apartments are where I stayed and they were pretty good. Complaints I have is there's no elevator and some of the dryers don't work well. There are many activities and club to attend and join. walking through the campus you will see ads for events everywhere. The library is the place to go to hang out, it's nice and open but gets crowded quickly. Overall, its a nice school and I recommend coming for a tour if you're interested in attending."
Junior,4,"It offers many different programs of study and has generally good professors but unfortunately has a very large price tag to go along with it due to constant renovations and additions to the campus.(28,000 a year in-state)"
Sophomore,4,"ETSU has grown so much over the past few years.  Tucked between mountains in Eastern Tennessee, you wouldn't expect to see as much diversity in the student body as you do here at ETSU. Professors are knowledge and willing to go the extra mile to see success from their students."
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed my time here. Great atmosphere and wonderful staff. Professors are very friendly, helpful, and care about the students needs and want them to accomplish their goals. Campus is very nice and easy to get around with a lot of great places to eat."
Sophomore,4,I really love campus and most all of my professors have been great. I really want the student center construction to be finished though.
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at East Tennessee State University. My favorite part about the school is the community and Johnson City area. The opportunities at ETSU are vast, and with the right mentors and self motivation one can go far with a degree from this school."
Alum,4,"I loved the campus, it was beautiful and one of the main reasons I chose to go there. My freshman year was when they started the football team back, which I thought was fun to have. I also thought it was a good idea to build the football stadium as it allowed the students to meet and socialize on Saturdays."
Sophomore,4,The tuition like most Tennessee public colleges was very low. The city the school is located in has fairly cheap rent and very low cost of living. The city is also an entertainment and drinking hub for the whole area so it has a high ratio of bars in comparison to it's size. The professor's there are very helpful and are willing to go the extra mile in order to help the students there. The instate tuition is very low. The only real problem I had was that many critical facilities where barred from entry due to renovations. I was still able to enjoy my time there and make progress on my degree there.
Graduate Student,4,"The process of meeting with an advisor and scheduling courses could be explained better for graduate students. Other than that, the students and professors are very kind and invested."
Niche User,4,East Tennessee State is very clean and everyone is very friendly. There are a lot of housing options and the facilities are beautiful. I wouldn't change anything.
Junior,4,So far my experience with ETSU has been great; the professors and advisors really go above and beyond to help a student succeed!
Senior,4,I absolutely love East Tennessee State University. I love this college simply because it has a lot to offer and can make great connections.
Freshman,4,"The school was great!  Besides a couple bad teachers (4 stars), most professors care about their students, and try to help them succeed."
Sophomore,4,I love ETSU. It has a small school feel without being too small. Professors are fantastic and genuinely care about your wellbeing and your future. My only complaint is making all underclassmen buy an expensive meal plan.
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see this University become a safer environment for students. There have been several accounts on harassment or being attacked by male students to females. Other than this the experience has been great, I am in my hometown and it is a great school."
Sophomore,4,"East Tennessee State University is a university where professors care and want to see students grow, they are willing to help and be there as long as you’re willing to do you’re part as well! The campus is nice and majority of the time there is always an event going on during the week! The only issues I have had with this school is financial aid but overall it’s been a good experience!"
Alum,4,"Enjoyed the Nursing Program staff. All of the professors were very knowledgeable and amenable. There response time to questions from online students was quick and they answered all my questions clearly and professionally.  Financial aid was difficult to work with as a long distance student. Responses were at time short and irrelevant or simply not helpful. Many times I was given short notice if funding was not in my account and often was not given guidance on how to resolve the problem. The school overall was fabulous, I would simply recommend having more helpful people in the financial aid department."
Sophomore,4,The on-campus involvement is wonderful. I love all clubs and organizations but I do not enjoy some of the professors. I am doing well in the classes where the teachers are great at teaching and worse in the others. The living options are pretty good.
Sophomore,4,"There are many activities and events that take place all over campus. The professors are often helpful and accommodating. There is also a great diversity here, unlike many other places in Tennessee. Whenever there are attacks on or near campus, emails get sent out to warn students to stay safe and there are several ways that the campus tries to cut down on any kind of attacks. The only reason that I did not give five stars is because the financial aid office is often filled with clueless staff. However, I have seen an improvement in the financial aid office since 2017."
Junior,4,The atmosphere at East Tennessee is very powerful. The energy is uplifting and everyone really is there to help you along your college career. When arriving for orientation they had music playing and many current students greeting all the new students. There is also many activities and chances for you to get involved in at ETSU. All the students and staff really do work together to make your experience the best. The only thing that I would like to change about ETSU is that I wish they had more informative and descriptive details about the activities and programs.
Sophomore,4,"I love my school. The atmosphere is great and the campus is a good size. They always have events going on on campus. I love it here, it is close to downtown Johnson City and they also provide a shuttle service which is cool. The only problem is they have been under construction for awhile so it makes it harder to get around, and there aren't many parking spots."
Sophomore,4,"East Tennessee State University is a fine academic institution with a friendly environment and inviting campus and community. The campus offers many different clubs and organizations that fit most peoples linings and if there is no club gor one's interests then a club can be made. The faculty and staff is very friendly and always happy to accommodate anyone who needs anything or is simply looking for an area on campus. The only real problems is the local life around the campus is very dull as one will quickly find that there is really nothing to do in the city of Johnson City where it is located. That can be overlooked but the major problem is that the financial aid office is very unreliable as many students turn in forms and they are somehow ""misplaced"" several times and make the beginning of the semesters very stressful as it is hard to purchase required materials for classes."
Junior,4,"East Tennessee State University is a great school for those who like smaller communities. It's a beautiful campus with many different opportunities for a variety of interests. The classes and professors are challenging but interesting, and it's clear that the staff cares about your success."
Senior,4,"ETSU is a beautiful campus nestled in the Appalachian mountains of Tennessee. Although the campus is not very large, it offers a good variety of on campus food options and clubs to participate in. ETSU is going under many renovations right now which should make the college more prospecting in the future. This college offers studies in many fields, so finding your passion should not be an option. Overall a very enjoyable and peaceful campus in a small city with plenty of activities and nature around."
Senior,4,"East Tennessee State University is an all-around excellent college. It has a large variety of majors and minors. One thing that I would personally change about this University would be the fact that there should be more resources and better help for those who struggle with paying tuition. It can sometimes come across as if the University does not particularly care whether or not you as the student needs help. However, the University is a nice college and has excellent professors. There are numerous academic organizations that students can be involved in. Plenty of parking, however, if you want a good parking spot; you need to arrive early in the mornings."
Senior,4,Its a beautiful campus. Everything is easily found. Classes are a good size not to big. It also has a variety of places for food.  I would maybe add more parking if its possible. Not enough student parking for the amount of students that attend.
Freshman,4,"I love how diverse and friendly everyone is!! However, I've made appointments and the staff member not even show up and I had to see someone else."
Senior,4,I am a transferring Senior to East Tennessee State University and have received so much help from the faculty and professors here. They really try to make you feel included here.
Senior,4,"Being from small town Wyoming, I came to Johnson City because it has the same feel. I am going into my second year at ETSU and have enjoyed it this far. It is a gorgeous campus, the faculty are wonderful and helpful in every way possible."
Senior,4,"Overall, I have been impressed with the type of experiences I have been able to receive at East Tennessee State University. As I am studying to be a future teacher, I have had many opportunities to work with young students at the University School on campus. This has allowed me to gain experience with students by actually doing my lesson plans with real students. Almost all of my professors have been enthusiastic and passionate about the content they have been teaching, which creates a more engaging classroom. The campus has many different options for food and entertainment, with weekly emails about upcoming events. With over 200 student clubs and organizations, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus, make friends, and develop new skills!"
Senior,4,"I liked the campus and most of the professors. Most professors have a good style of teaching and don't make things too difficult. I would like to see the prices for the apartments on campus go down and the conditions in those apartments increase at least a little bit. The one thing that everyone would say is bad is the parking. There are just not enough parking spots, but there's not necessarily enough room to create more. The bus saved my life."
Senior,4,"Campus activities are very Greek life oriented, for those that do not enjoy the environment that fraternities and sororities provide it is difficult to engage in campus events."
Sophomore,4,ETSU is a great medium sized school. There are tons of resources and research opportunities on campus and plenty of ways to branch out into just about anything you wanted to do.
Freshman,4,The professors I have encountered want their students to succeed. Most foster a good class atmosphere and conduct their classes well.
Freshman,4,"I have been here for almost a year now, I am really enjoying the university and the teachers that are here really show that they care about us as students. I have come to the conclusion that I made a really good choice with coming to a different state to further my education I love it."
Freshman,4,I can say nothing but great things about ETSU. The community is full of welcoming people. It is a very beautiful environment with many reserve spots for hiking. Transitioning from high school to ETSU was easier than i thought. ETSU's amazing community made it much easier to settle in. Living 3 hours away from my family was a worry for me but overall i know that my future is in the palm of my hand.
Senior,4,ETSU makes everyone feel like they have a place they belong. It feels like my home away from home. The reason I did not give a 5 out of 5 is because I personally think that the out of state tuition is a lot of money for as small of a college they are.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, it is a pretty decent school. Sports teams could use some work. Academics are good, lots of majors offered. Professors are decent with a few shining gems. A few sororities and fraternities, but overall ETSU is not huge on greek life."
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed having welcome week and sports. If I could change anything about ETSU it would be better food and more parking for students.
Junior,4,"The campus environment is great and many new programs are being brought to campus as well as some redesigning. However, some of the advisors are  little vague when going to to get help which can cause problems if you arent sure of what you want to do with your life."
Senior,4,"Personally did not like my nursing advisor. I enjoy the pretty campus, food options,  new parking garage, and football team/stadium."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the small campus feel of the college. ETSU has so many great people that run these great programs and organizations. Preview, Intramurals, and the CPA is where I have met all of my ; the more I participate in these areas the more people I meet as well."
Senior,4,"ETSU feels safe and like home with great outdoor activities. Since a lot of students are commuters, I feel like there should be more outreach to get them involved."
Sophomore,4,I love the beautiful Appalachian area where ETSU is located. ETSU offers a couple of great academic scholarship opportunities for incoming students. I'm a Digital Media major and this department is the real deal.
Sophomore,4,"My first time coming to East Tennessee State University, was two years ago when I was a freshman in 2016. At first I was a little hesitant because it was my time actually being an responsible adult on my own. In the beginning of freshman year I started to meet friendly new people and getting involved with the campus. I joined a group called, ""Black Affairs"". It was great experience for me to meet new people.  East Tennessee State University is a great campus to get involved and everyone there cares about you and help you to your success. I struggled a lot through my freshman year because I was used to the new college life. But with help from advisory, students, and professors that keep me motivated to succeed, I planned to do better each step of the way and to stay positive."
Junior,4,The campus I the most beautiful one in the state. You are 10 minutes from great hiking. It's a same city. The dorms are great. It's a great school for pre health kids. It's very tough but if you do everything and work hard the professors will help you out. You are never just a number at this school.
Senior,2,"Online classes are probably one of the major faults at ETSU. Perhaps this is because I don't learn well in an online environment. However, the work seems to be tedious and overwhelming at times."
Freshman,2,"I really have not enjoyed my time here. I feel like some teachers could care less whether you pass or fail and it is a huge money racket. All they care about is your money, not you."
Sophomore,2,"This university was difficult to take seriously when my professors didn't seem to know their own material, when the professors were not being paid for their job, and when the school severely lacked in standard practice in dealing with students going through family loss."
College Junior,2,"No one cares about this little universities sports teams. To make it worse, they just increased tuition to reintroduce their failed football team which I believe, lost every single game last season."
College Sophomore,2,"no one wanted them to bring back the football team because it raises tuition prices, but they did now everyone is mad."
Recent Alumnus,2,Seems to be some general discontent regarding athletics. This has been particularly pronounced since the football program was revived. Most students don't want it due to the increase in tuition associated.
College Sophomore,2,"No one really pays attention to the varsity teams, but a lot of people do intramural. The gym is amazing, though."
Recent Alumnus,2,"They are only there to take your money, but they never actually care about the livelihood of students who live at the campus.  They raise tuition to have a terrible football program, as well as keeping the board members happy, but they never place funds into what actually helps students.  My roommate was robbed at gunpoint right behind our dorm, and we were told that the Cameras were too old to actually be of help."
College Junior,2,you have to verify a lot of paperwork which isn't very easy to get to which makes the process very difficult.
College Freshman,2,"It's not great, takes some work. Tough to get aid."
College Freshman,2,"ETSU is a good school if you are from the tri-cities, and you are just wanting to spend a pretty chill four years to get your degree. For outsiders, I would recommend looking at different schools. This is really a pretty generic university"
College Freshman,2,Johnson City is pretty lame overall.
College Junior,2,They can never really tell you anything for sure. You just have to keep calling almost weekly if you are needing something done.
College Junior,2,I applied for several positions. I did not hear back from two places and the third rejected me. By my second year of grad school I assume more options will be available for me.
College Junior,2,My overall history program is amazing and with the right effort I should not have too much difficulties.
College Freshman,2,"We are a tobacco free campus, but no one enforces it or takes it seriously. I can not stand walking around smelling smoke. Put in some specific areas and let them be.."
College Freshman,2,D2L is almost always down. I can never do any homework in my room because the wireless sucks and I don't have an ethernet jack on my side of the room.
College Sophomore,2,Alot of students have been said to sell or do drugs o or around campus and always having it on or near them.
College Sophomore,2,There are not that many scholarships out there for us to get and it is very difficult yo receive them.
College Junior,2,"Our athletic support is pretty low. The school is a commuter school and support for sports has fallen behind in priorities. However, we should be getting football soon and some people are excited for that."
College Junior,2,The parking is pretty inconvenient and most students commute. It's a battle to get a parking space every day.
College Sophomore,2,I lived at Campus Ridge which was off campus housing and I didnt like it at all.
College Junior,2,"Parking cost is in tuition but parking is awful. I have to get there 30 ,minutes early to have a spot and walk a mile to class."
College Senior,2,"Nightlife and things to do is very poor. But outdoor recreation during warm months is great because there are several lakes, hiking trails, etc."
College Freshman,2,You have to take  17 hours a semester
College Freshman,2,The wifi is a pain to saty connected to and always is spotty in most places. 
College Freshman,2,The actual application was a huge headache and I did not even receive the financial aid that the office said I would be receiving. 
College Sophomore,2,Bus Car or Walk and usually walk that is it. 
College Sophomore,2,Finding a spot on campus is close to impossible and the extra school parking is a far distance from the classes.
College Sophomore,2,The athletic programs aren't a big part of the school.
College Senior,2,"As of now, parking is being built for the growing university. In the past, it has been torture trying to find a place to park before class. Hopefully the new parking will help."
College Freshman,2,Parking garage in progress but parking is horrible
College Senior,2,"What I see of Greek Life, is party going. I know not everyone is like that in the groups however most are not nice people."
College Junior,2,"Drinking is among a fairly high crowd at ETSU, but its normally those wanting to go out and meet new people. Other drugs are minimal from my point of view with smoking being the second biggest crowd pleaser."
College Sophomore,2,"We are in the middle of constructing a new parking garage, so the parking while it's being built is awful! Be sure to arrive 30 minutes early before your class just to find a parking spot! Hopefully, this problem will be fixed once the new parking garage is finished."
College Freshman,2,"Parking on campus is usually awful. Unless it is a holiday weekend and everyone has left for home, be prepared to lose your spot as soon as you leave campus. It is not often that you are able to get a good spot close to your dorm building. Living on campus is helpful because you do not have to leave campus as often. However, for the commuters, parking must be a nightmare."
College Senior,2,"Everything about ETSU is average. Not bad, not great. Study and shut up kind of place."
College Senior,2,"The rainbow melting pot of patriotism. They're all here. Rednecks, jocks, jeeks, nerds, inbetweeners, hipsters."
College Senior,2,"For a college in east Tennessee it is very diverse, but that's not to say that  it doesn't have it's expected dose of racists whites."
College Sophomore,2,"The school isn't as strict as they once were. Visitation hours do not exist in the dorms any longer. Also, the greek office and student affairs office allows fraternities and other student groups to cause problems with nothing more than a slap on the wrist."
College Sophomore,2,"""Main Meal"" at East TN State University in my opinion is not something worth going to everyday. The food is the same every day and sometimes not fresh. I suggest you do not get a meal plan after Freshman year"
College Sophomore,2,"I have worked hard to receive financial aid from East Tennessee State University. However, the student staff in the financial aid office was not helpful in the least and repeatedly gave me wrong answers to questions that I really needed answers to. Additionally, they attempted to keep me from asking an actual financial aid officer my questions. My advice is be firm and unrelenting in getting the help you need from the person who can best preform the job."
College Freshman,2,"Its pretty average, between looks and dress.. Interests I am not really sure."
College Freshman,2,I received not even half of my tuition in scholarships I have student loans out to pay for the rest. The process was HORRIBLE it took me almost 2 months after school started to get my money and then I did not even get all of what I was owed. They lost forms and  I had to refill them out. Very hectic.
College Junior,2,East Tennessee State University is a suitcase college with most students either living off-campus of going home for weekends.  There is little school-spirit for sporting events especially in light of the fact that there is no marching band or football team.
College Senior,2,"It sucks to park on campus. Even if you live on campus it can be hard to find a spot sometimes, makes you not want a car."
College Junior,2,I think the athletics department is mediocre. Many people dont go see the games and seems like a waste of money to me.
College Junior,2,One new building for housing. The other dorms are older than I am and haven't gotten much update since I have been on campus previously in 2007.
College Sophomore,2,"There really isn't that much to do in a small town such as Johnson City. The bar/club scene is mediocre at best, so most of the nightlife takes place within the downtown area, which I personally consider ""okay."""
College Sophomore,2,There isn't a lot of diversity simply because it's in east Tennessee. But we still do have some.
College Freshman,2,you have to be at the right place at the right time to get a space.
College Freshman,2,"ETSU is located in a small town. If you're looking for some fun partying or crazy nightlife besides the mall and movie theaters, you're looking into the wrong college. Although the town isn't hopelessly boring, you'll find nothing more than shops and restaurants. If you really want to go out and party, you'll have to make the twenty-five minute drive to the next town, and even they don't have the most amazing nightlife. There are things to do around the campus, but choices are limited and they tend to get boring really fast."
College Junior,2,"Honestly the sports here are kind of lame to me. There is no football team which is what I like to watch. Our soccer teams are fairly good. To be honest I don't really keep up with the other teams. There isn't a whole lot of school spirit, I don't even know when the games are because they are not well advertised to the students."
Recent Alumnus,2,Too little parking and they are very quick to ticket
Recent Alumnus,2,ETSU never has enough parking often resulting in late arrivals to class. This has been an ongoing problem but should be resolved once the parking garage is built. They are aware of the situation and making a huge effort to improve. ETSU needs to be more laxed when issuing parking tickets until they improve the parking situation.
College Sophomore,2,"Lack of Consideration – There aren't many parking spaces at ETSU available, so it's very hard to find a place to park and arrive to class on time. Most of the time students arrive hours early just to find a place to park. If you get a ticket, Parking Services has no consideration for any situations of any kind. I accidentally didn't see a poorly placed parking sign indicating that a lot was reserved for Faculty/Staff, and, by the time I noticed, my chemistry exam would start in just five minutes. I got a ticket, and, even though I informed PS (Parking Services) of the situation and that I didn't have enough money to pay the ticket, they simply ignored my request and demanded that I pay the ticket."
College Sophomore,2,"Misplaced Strictness – Campus police are very strict about things like parking (having a parking decal on your car if you want to park anywhere on campus at any time), but lenient about things like smoking (and alcohol, most of the time) which is not supposed to be allowed on campus at all. I think the school just says it's smoke and alcohol free because it gets money for it. Even though it isn't true."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretentious Greeks – Greeks act all hoity toity like the run the place, but the only real power they have is within their Greek households. They are generally scoffed at by the rest of the university. They are a minor annoyance when you have a class with one, but you don't usually have to interact with them, otherwise."
College Freshman,2,"Persistence Is the Key to Success. When I applied as an incoming freshman, I had to mail my transcript to the Financial Aid office three times; they kept losing it. Some of my friends went straight to the source and delivered their transcripts in person due to their tendency to ""lose"" things. 
Aside from that, everyone was very adept at helping whenever I needed it. The financial aid application online was very straight-forward, although it was time consuming. The thing that'll get you is deadlines. DO NOT miss a deadline! I'm getting less aid for next year because I neglected to re-apply for aid until it was too late."
College Freshman,2,"Rain, Sleet, or Snow.. There Is Still Class – When it is snowy and rainy no one really wants to go to class. Sometimes when it snows badly, classes are never cancelled."
Alum,1,"School is for leftists, feminists, and other scum. Stay far away. Do not hire anyone with a degree there also. They will only cause trouble."
Niche User,1,I did not attend online classes there which is why i did not want to rate it. I only gave it 1 start because I couldn’t relate but i’m sure those who took online classes at ETSU had help from amazing professors.
Alum,1,I came back to this school twenty years later just to learn that this school was useless in every aspect.
Senior,1,"The school is at, but the College of Nursing is horrendous.  Go anywhere but here,  It is the most unprofessional group of faculty that you will ever encounter.  The professors bicker amongst themselves and try to pit the students against each other.  The Coordinators will not address student concerns  and only say ""act professional"" when they will not answer emails in 96 hours.  I have a test in less than 8 ours online due to Covid 19 and the professor still nwwil not answer emails to tell us how to access the test. Go anywhere but here.  it had a good reputation, but it is far from where it was."
College Junior,1,"This school is ran more like a business, with education being a secondary aspect. The administration is unorganized and incompetent, and several professors see students as a necessary burden that they must deal with on occasion in order to continue to receive funding to work on their research. Within the past year, the school decided to reintroduce their failed football program. This school needs to invest more in it's education and take more interest in its students success rather than reintroducing a useless financial expense such as football. Only a fraction of a fraction of athletes can actually hope to become a professional sports player, the rest of us would like to get an education which would lead to career opportunities."
College Junior,1,The Greek's on campus are quite annoying since I am a non Greek. I just try to avoid them.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Complete Garbage.  The school is a complete joke at security.  The ""safety"" officers are only there to give out parking tickets.  I have had things stolen from my car, and my roommate was mugged a gunpoint behind our dorm and absolutely nothing was done.  We even asked what they could do to change these things and it's always the same ""we're looking into it"" excuse.  I was even told by a professor that ETSU could care less and that they aren't there to make you safe.  Women are raped each year, and people are mugged even in the daytime on campus.  One of the housing places just outside of school has earned the nickname ""criminal ridge"" for the last 20 years.  If you were to call them with an emergency it would take them from 5 to 10 minutes to get there, which for the size of our campus is completely garbage.  

You are not safe, and they do not care."
Recent Alumnus,1,"They are the only people that the ETSU faculty actually care about, so they act blind to the problems at ETSU in exchange.  Normal students which make up the Majority are shafted."
College Sophomore,1,I have not received financial aid or scholarships
College Freshman,1,So. Many. Forms. No one can tell me why I need to pay $600 more this semester than last semester. No one really cares about you in the financial aid office. I applied for mine in February 2014 and received it in November 2014.
College Junior,1,I get so tired of hearing about Greek life all the time. They make you feel terrible if your not a Greek.
College Senior,1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible!! Parking at this school is horrible. Teachers have tons of parking everywhere and NEVER fill up because there are more teacher parking spaces than there are teachers. But students don't have enough!"
College Sophomore,1,If you don't get there before 8ish you probably have to park off campus.
College Senior,1,"The police are very strict about parking violations on campus.  They go around all day and give tickets.  They are also strict about drinking and drug use in the dorms for it is a dry campus.  They kick you out of school if you are caught drinking on campus.  It is my advice that if you are going to drink, don't do it on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"There is not enough parking on campus, and the parking that is available is far from convient. This problem is made worse by the construction on campus that took away half of the relatively useful spots. Parking is so bad it is usually best to leave and hour before class just to try and find a spot and walk to get there on time."
College Senior,1,Parking has been a very touchy subject with this campus. It is a hassle to always find a spot without parking miles away. Teachers are not very forgiving despite this issue. Expect to miss class time frequently.
College Freshman,1,Most of the time you have to get to campus at least an hour early.  They are supposed to be putting in a new parking structure so maybe that will fix some of the problems.
College Senior,1,"Parking locations are great, but there aren't enough lots. Parking garages needed."
Recent Alumnus,1,Far too many students to parking spaces. They are however currently building a parking garage.
College Junior,1,We are diversed so don't get me wrong but I can say I see more people hang out with their own race verses the oppisite most of the time.

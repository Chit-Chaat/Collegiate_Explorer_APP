Sophomore,5,I had no online classes this semester.                                                               f
Junior,5,"I took a class online my freshman year and then when quarantine happened in the spring of 2020, all of my classes went online. My professors were very understanding and very adaptable to the situation."
Alum,5,"Wonderful place excellent teachers, not a great football program but acceptable for the size and division. The cafeteria is usually eatable and there are other options if you don't want any of the options being served in the cafeteria that day. It would be helpful if they expanded their library hours however."
Sophomore,5,"I did not take classes online, so I cannot comment on this topic.  I prefer in person classes and interaction with the professors and other students."
Sophomore,5,I love the small class sizes and the smaller campus.  Living on campus is much easier than at a larger University.
Sophomore,5,"It has an amazing campus with unparalleled community. Not only are the students close-knit, but there is truly a spirit of care from the professors as well. It is the best place to foster wisdom and pursue a spectacular education."
Freshman,5,"I love going to school here so much, and I cannot wait to see what the next three years bring. I love my friends, classes, and proffs. It is a quality education."
Freshman,5,"The professors are amazing. I had to take some classes online because of Covid, but those we also good."
Freshman,5,My experience as a freshman has been amazing!! The professors are so supportive and encouraging and the Christian atmosphere makes you feel welcome and helps you grow.
Sophomore,5,"OBU is a great place to make friends that you will have for the rest of your life. It challenges you academically, and spiritually and is a wonderful place to be."
Senior,5,My favorite part of this University is how the academics truly prepare you for a future in a wide variety of fields.
Sophomore,5,The people and teachers are great and really care about the students there. They have great scholarships and deals to help you afford tuition as well as fun activities like chior and intramurals that offer scholarships.  Great for those who have a stronge faith in Christianity as well.
Niche User,5,"When I was applying to OBU the Admissions Councilors were the best. They always made sure I knew everything I needed to, and prepared me for everything about the College."
Freshman,5,"I have been on campus for less than a month and I love it already! Everyone is so nice. The professors are wonderful. They want to see you succeed and that makes putting in the effort so much worth it! I like everything about this campus so far. I don’t have anything I want to change, but if that changes, I’ll let you know."
Sophomore,5,OBU is a welcoming place. I have yet to meet someone who has been purposely rude and after a short period of time it becomes home to you. The professors are great and are there to help you succeed!
Sophomore,5,"My time at OBU has been nothing but fantastic! The environment as you walk across the campus is so joyous, people will always talk to you or smile as you walk by. The professors are engaged in the growth of each student and are always willing to work with you through your struggles. The college as a whole has many clubs, organizations, and worship groups to give students a way to speak their minds. One of the best decisions I've made for myself was coming to school at Oklahoma Baptist University."
Alum,5,"OBU is a great school! It is a liberal arts university, so they pride themselves in academics. OBU has professors that care and want to see students succeed. Overall, Oklahoma Baptist is a place you can call home and meet people that treat you like family."
Sophomore,5,"The professors really care about you succeeding in their class, and make a point to know that you can come to them for help."
Freshman,5,Just starting so I will have to come update my review. The admissions process was great. Lauren helped me with any questions and kept in contact. I applied and was accepted to 18 schools and Oklahoma had the best offer by far. They are ideal for cost and has all of the certifications I was looking for. Not easy when looking at Christian schools.
Freshman,5,Oklahoma Baptist University is a well disposed college that allows you to connect with others and also get to learn more about God and his son Jesus. I am in my second semester at this college and have only had positive experiences. The professes here really want to get to know me and help with any situations that I might have. Being apart of a Christian-based college has opened so many opportunities to grow closer to God. I have learned so much about the Bible in just my short time being here that I have been able to share my faith openly. Oklahoma Baptist University is also very keen on making sure that every student is safe. There is an on-campus police force to ensure our protection throughout the university. I highly recommend anyone who is looking for a highly dedicated staff and Christian-based college to apply to Oklahoma Baptist University. It is a time that you will never forget.
Sophomore,5,"Their drive for excellence is evident in their classes.  The profs are professional, well versed in their field and have a general love for their students education.

I love the family atmosphere that surrounds the campus .  I feel loved and at home"
Freshman,5,All of the people I have met are so nice! I can count on at least someone helping me no matter how big or small my problem is! Overall amazing school!
Sophomore,5,Excellent faculty and staff who want their students to succeed! Student life is amazing because there are so many different ways to serve and be in clubs.
Sophomore,5,"I have loved OBU for the whole time. From the moment I walked around campus on my first tour, I knew this was the school for me. It is a great, small school where the professors and staff truly care about the students. It is a liberal arts university, so you do have to take some classes outside of you major. This can be somewhat annoying, but I think it is good that we will have such a well-rounded education when we graduate. All of the professors genuinely care about the students, both in their success in the class and also their spiritual life and lives outside the classroom. The classes are very rigorous, probably harder than some schools, so if you’re looking for the easy route OBU is not for you. However, if you are wanting a place where you will truly be able to learn and challenge yourself, then it is great!"
Sophomore,5,"The small-school atmosphere is a great experience, especially if you like to integrate your faith and learning experience."
Junior,5,"honestly, OBU has been one of the greatest blessings in my life! The people are so kind, the campus is small and beautiful, and there is so much culture to be found in the community! My professors have had such a positive impact on my education and the way in which I view the world and my place within it. It has been worth every single second and I wouldn't trade my education here for anything else."
Freshman,5,All Staff are friendly and helpful! The campus is great! Not too far from Oklahoma City if you want to get away for a day or two and have some fun.
Freshman,5,Oklahoma Baptist University provides excellent programs with an amazing academic program with proffesors who envole themselves in students lives and invests their time with every one of their students
Alum,5,"At Oklahoma Baptist University, I found a place where I was challenged academically and spiritually. To put it in the simplest possible way, I have never heard a student talking about their coursework at a different university that convinced me that their degree was harder earned than my own. In fact, I am convinced that OBU is about as good as Bible Colleges come from an academic standpoint, and I am very prepared for ministry and seminary. Also, they do an incredible job of integrating faith and learning to create a Christ-centered community of students and professors."
Niche User,5,Oklahoma Baptist University is a beautiful campus and the inside of the buildings are state of the art. The admissions office is amazing and will help you with anything you need help with! If you are not sure where to go to college and you think you would like a smaller college check out OBU!
Niche User,5,"From the little experience that I've had, this seems to be an awesome place. The campus and the scenery around the place look beautiful and the students all have been nothing but kind and friendly."
Freshman,5,It's a great christian environment. The faculty really cares about their students! The students come here for the same mindset-to get closer to Christ through their education. The campus is nice but the student life is so fun. They always have great activities to do. The classes are challenging but are christian oriented  and also all cubs and sports are as well. They incorporate a biblical worldview into every aspect of campus life!
Freshman,5,"I love Oklahoma Baptist University. It is a great school where the professors and staff truly care about their students success. They don’t just care about your academic success, but also your spiritual success. If you work hard and follow the plan, they guarantee that you will graduate in four years. They desire not just to make more graduates, but people who will go out and be a light for the Lord in their workplace. Depending on what you choose, the academics can be rigorous, but if you are wanting something easy then you probably shouldn’t be paying for college. It is a beautiful campus. Not a big party scene, but I appreciate that. I am at college to learn. The dorms are clean, and the RAs on each hall truly desire to build a relationship with the students. There are many student life activities you can get involved in and many ways to get to know people."
Freshman,5,"I've loved my experience here so far! Everyone is genuinely nice and the professors, for the most part, want to see you succeed. It's an excellent choice for Christians wanting to grow in their faith in a positive academic environment."
Sophomore,5,"I went to OBU for my first two years of college, my number one pick throughout high school, I absolutely loved it. Meeting new people was so easy, and the teachers there were so encouraging and helpful. Anytime I had a question about how to do something, they never looked at me like I wasn't listening but to explain more thoroughly. Overall LOVED it!"
Junior,5,Great Christian school; great professors who care about students' progress; small city and campus but friendly people
Graduate Student,5,"I graduated from OBU in 2016. The academics and Christian lifestyle are phenomenal, but other students can be clique-ish."
Freshman,5,My experience with Oklahoma Baptist University has been phenomenal. I have contacted multiple offices regarding my education process and they have all been more than helpful. It is a beautiful campus and the university as a whole makes you as a student feel appreciated and important.
Freshman,5,I like Oklahoma Baptist University. It's a great campus that is filled with faculty and staff who are there to help you succeed. It's a beautiful campus with a lot of activities that go on weekly.
Junior,5,"Oklahoma Baptist University feels like home; it's that kind of university. The professors and coaches are willing to take time and help me when needed. The school has many club activities and intramural sports to be involved in and that is a great way to meet new people. I enjoy how they have many mission opportunities that I can go to, and it's not just flying across the ocean but in the community."
Freshman,5,It is a great campus environment; with caring professors that want you to succeed. This University pushes you to your full potential.
Junior,5,It's a small school with amazing professors who care about you. The other students are great. OBU is all about community and growing.
Alum,5,Great School. Small numbers generate a good faculty to student ratio. Professors invest in student success. Great atmosphere and community.
Freshman,5,"Oklahoma Baptist University wasn't even in my top 5 colleges during my senior year. Nevertheless, I decided to visit the campus during a cheerleading tryout, and I fell in love. When talking with students and seeing their love for the university, I became much more convinced that OBU was where I needed to be. I've been there a full semester now, and it is everything I could've wished for. The professors know you by name, all of the students are welcoming and inviting, and the overall atmosphere is incomparable to any other college."
Sophomore,5,"I love OBU. Everyday I am surrounded by a community. The professors, staff, and students are all family. Academics are a high priority there, as well as student life and relationship building."
College Freshman,5,"The courses are challenging, but manageable. The professors are amazing. They make learning fun and are always there if one needs them."
College Freshman,5,There isno doubt about me getting a job after college. The campus' student services help with that.
College Freshman,5,This campus is very safe.
College Freshman,5,I love my dorm and the people in it.
College Freshman,5,Greek life really isn't a big deal here.
College Freshman,5,"We have a lot of school spirit. I have never been to any games, but I plan on attending basketball games once the season starts."
College Junior,5,I feel like I will have the best experience here that will help me succeed in my field of work.
College Junior,5,"I feel extremely safe and protected while on campus. The campus is well-lit, and there are police officers on campus 24/7 to make sure things are well protected. If you are walking alone at night on campus, you can call a police officer and have them go with you to your destination to make sure you arrive safely. Also, there are multiple security cameras on campus offering safety measures in that area as well. OBU is a very safe, protected, and well monitored campus who will do anything to keep their students safe."
College Freshman,5,OBU is a wonderful community!
College Freshman,5,"OBU is amazing! Everyone genuinely cares, and it is evident in everything around campus."
College Junior,5,I feel very safe on campus and I think all necessary safety precautions are currently already being taken.
College Junior,5,I love the relationships students have with one another and their professors.  You really get the feeling that they're there to help you and they want you to succeed.  Students are not just a number.
College Junior,5,I like the Chris-Centered environment at this school.  Students and professors truly care for one another and want to see each other succeed.
College Sophomore,5,"As a Christian school, this college insures its students are protected and implements great security measures."
College Freshman,5,The value of a degree from OBU is high and seen as a true accomplishment and level of education because of the curriculum at OBU. Job fairs come to OBU and the career center is very beneficial starting freshman year and aims to ensure a job immediately filling graduation. Also each major sets up doors to a career in that major.
Sophomore,4,"This school is amazing and I would not want to be anywhere else. It is extremely challenging academically and will prepare you for the real world. The only two reason I gave four stars instead of  five is the location of the school (Shawnee is horrible) and the overly-Baptist culture. I am a Non-Denominational Christian, and I agree with most Baptist ideas. This school, however, is a little extreme in its Baptist culture. This is represented in the ideas of the profs and students. Also the campus food is awful, no way around it."
Junior,4,Amazing environment and staff. Great opportunities to grow and succeed. The success center is offered to every student. The student athlete -student ratio is very different.
Alum,4,This liberal arts university has shaped me into the person I am today. I am thankful for the professors who care deeply for their students and for their push of academic excellence.
Alum,4,"The professors did their best to assist and accommodate their students however, it was still more difficult to learn online than in the classroom. Most projects and labs had to be cancelled which impacted learning and grades."
Alum,4,"Overall, a small campus with an emphasis on community. The class sizes were small and I was able to get to know my professors well. The main downside was that some professors did not examine their subjects from all points of view and were only focused on Christian points of view."
Freshman,4,"Spectacular professors, an amazing community and much more. Oklahoma Baptist is the perfect place to call home for someone like me. As a Baptist that grew up in a small town in western Oklahoma I didn't think that I could ever find somewhere that felt like home, however OBU has made me feel like I belonged. It's a wonderful place."
Senior,4,It was a great school regarding their academics but I definitely would have liked to have more student amenities especially for student-athletes.
Freshman,4,"The school is very beautiful, and the people are super kind. My only issue with the school is the price."
Freshman,4,OBU has some of the friendliest faculty I've ever met. Everyone is so willing to give up a part of their day and sit down with you to help with whatever you need. The campus is beautiful and the traditions are exciting!
Freshman,4,I have finished my first semester and I would like to say that the professors are very smart and I really appreciate how they keep me on track. They really care about me as a student and a Christian. I am very glad I chose OBU. This University is a great place to learn and grow as a student and a Christian.
Freshman,4,"Oklahoma Baptist is phenomenal in their academics, personal relationships, and the integration of Christianity. The professors and staff really care about your well being and do what they can to help you succeed and do your best and the people at the school are kind and genuine. It is an amazing environment with incredible people!"
Junior,4,What I enjoy about currently attending Oklahoma Baptist University is it’s small size compared to the majority of other four-year universities. This allows the student to have a more personal college experience and be able to retain more information instead of the stereotypical view of being overwhelmed and feeling alone. Their Christian-centered education and student life provides a very safe and welcoming atmosphere. I overall enjoy my time attending here.
Freshman,4,"I love this university a lot. As a Christian it is interesting to see my faith intertwined into all the course I am taking. Along with this all of the staff are great and the students are welcoming. However, there are no on-campus jobs despite their claims of having plenty. They also claim to be a diverse school which they are racially. But there is no diversity in sexual identification. Meaning homosexuality is outlawed on campus which i find wrong and ignorant."
Senior,4,"I love the professors and the atmosphere of Oklahoma Baptist University. It is a small university, so students really are known by their professors and fellow students. It is a private school, so the price is in the upper range, but OBU also gives out more scholarships than most schools, so look into it to see if it works for you. (It also has a very simple application process-no stress)"
Alum,4,"Oklahoma Baptist University is a very small and close knit college. The staff are amazing and great teachers. The biggest downside is the insane price, and advisement is not great. In some departments they set you up for failure and due to them being a ""prestigious academic college"" some classes are harder than they should be."
Niche User,4,"Oklahoma Baptist University is very great when it comes to taking care of their students, whether academically or financially. The campus is very accepting of all their students regardless of race, gender, political affiliation, etc. The majority of students have financial aid of some type, which is great!"
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at OBU and I am greatly enjoying my time here. The academics are challenging and I have to work hard in all of my classes. There are a lot of options for classes so you can take many different subjects to suit your tastes. The community is very welcoming and everyone is very friendly.
Sophomore,4,"I have only completed one year of this school, but so far I really like the academics. The teachers are very friendly and will help if they can. The classroom size is amazing as well, allowing me to learn easily. The only downsize is you can't live off campus or not buy the meal plan."
Freshman,4,"What I love about OBU is the Christian atmosphere. During the fall, the entire campus is beautiful and is full of students who embrace nature together. Its relaxing and inviting vibes make OBU feel like home. One thing I would like to see changed are some of the buildings. OBU is an older campus and could have a more updated features for the students."
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Oklahoma Baptist University.  OBU is a great school with a beautiful, small campus.  Many of my classes were tiny, with less than ten students enrolled, so it's great if you're looking for a small, private school.  The students are all very friendly, and the professors are really supportive.  I had a family tragedy this year, and all of my professors have been very understanding, and allowed me to take the time I needed. The only trouble is that the administration is not always the greatest."
College Junior,4,I have a good experience with my professors and the courses that I have taken so far. The professors are super helpful and are there when I need help with anything.
College Junior,4,I feel safe on campus because I know if I every feel worried that I can call OBU police and they will come and help.
College Junior,4,I love living on campus because I am close to everything and I just have to walk to class and not have to worry about finding a parking spot.
College Junior,4,"Greek life is good, I got to meet a lot of people I wouldn't not have been able to meet anywhere else."
College Junior,4,There is a lot of opportunities to show your school spirit when it comes to going to varsity games or in intramural games.
College Junior,4,The small campus and the professors make OBU unique because they really want to be there for you and help you succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a nursing major, and we get our own job fairs twice a semester. The process is well organized always bringing in Some of the best hospitals and opportunies all around Oklahoma. I always feel very secure in my ability to find a job or internship with the help of our career counselor on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the professors here at OBU. They are personalable and dedicated to your learning and success in their class, and honestly in your over all success. I've always had professors who were easily  accessible  for questions tutoring or help."
College Sophomore,4,"OBU has recently improved lighting all around campus to  accommodate  students requests in order to feel safe everywhere on campus. Our campus police officers are great, if you feel uncomfortable in any situation or don't want to be alone walking to class or to your car they are always close by outside buildings and their station is conventionally located in the center of campus."
College Sophomore,4,"At OBU on campus living, you typically either get a newer (nicer) building or an original (older) one. As a freshman I lived in the first women's dormitory on campus, Kerr. Although it was not as nice as the new neighboring women's dorm, it was still clean and well kept. The atmosphere, I would argue, defiantly made up for the outdated feel of the building. I really enjoyed living there."
College Sophomore,4,"Oklahoma Baptist University has a great athletic center commonly known as the ""ROC."" It provides athletes and students with access to a rock climbing wall, tennis cort, racket ball rooms, general work out facilities, a basketball cort, a track, and a swimming pool. Our swim team is exceptional, winning many national titles over the years, and we just recently gained a football team with great potential."
College Sophomore,4,"OBU is a wonderful, Christ-centered school with a small world feel. The professors are both personable and  dedicated to their students. Oklahoma Baptist university has a way of making its students quickly feel like home, while offering many opportunities to travel with  Mission work all around the world. The university is great with connecting and helping the Shawnee community with multiple organizations working through mission Shawnee. I have personally been involved in a few of these organizations my freshman year and fell in love with both the Christ following leaders and the Shawnee community as a whole."
College Senior,4,This area of the campus is pretty good. There are campus police that are there to help and the overall health of the school is good too.
College Senior,4,"While studying at Obu, I have had a good relationship with my professors to help learn many different subjects within my field of study. There have been multiple times that professors have worked with me in situations that involved me completing homework or tests around my scedule. Overall it has been a good experience to be apart of a growing university."
College Junior,4,"Since I am still in college, I am not too familiar with the student career prospects. I do know the value of a degree from this school is one of high importance and admiration. An OBU degree is not taken lightly, and looks very well when you go to apply for jobs."
College Junior,4,"The overall experience of Oklahoma Baptist is a great one. The courses offered there are challenging, but you get a lot out of them. The professors at this school truly care about you as a person, and what the absolute best for you during school and after. They are always available for office hours to help guide you, or help explain things on a deeper level. The variety of courses offered is also a great feature to OBU. There are numerous class options, and there is surely something for everyone to love. The class size is perfect as most of your classes have around 20-30 students, with more students in the Old and New Testament and CIV classrooms. Overall, the OBU experience is a great one, and one with great admiration."
College Junior,4,"I lived on campus my first semester at OBU. It was a great experience to meet new people and to be surrounded with people who are going through the same things I am. I lived in an apartment with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a central living area, and a kitchen. The apartment had everything we needed, including a couch and chair, entertainment center, fridge, stove, and two showers. Although it was close quarters at times for 4 people, we all enjoyed living in our apartment."
College Junior,4,"Oklahoma Baptist University is a great four-year school for those who are looking for a faith-based education. With chapel every Wednesday, you are sure to feel at home in this place. What makes OBU unique is that it is a very sought after degree. People are well respected if they earn a degree from Oklahoma Baptist University. I would choose my school again if I had to, the only thing I would change would be the cost. Attending a private school, the cost of tuition, fees, and books add up, and it can be hard to grasp how much it is. I still think Oklahoma Baptist is a great school, with great opportunity."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel relatively safe on campus.  It is well-lit, and there are campus police officers always on patrol.  It is also easy to contact the campus police by phone, and I have found that they are extremely respectful and helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere on campus is incredibly friendly and welcoming and that extends to its dorm life.  The freshman dorm is especially carefully to hire residential advisers who attempt to form relationships with their charges and help them adjust to life on campus.  I felt confident that I could have approached my RA with any problem.  The dorm rooms themselves are always nicely furnished, but the sizes vary, with the freshman dorms being the smallest.  Once a student reaches their sophomore year they are able to apply for a four person suite.  The application process is simple, and the suites are large enough to accommodate four people.  The campus maintenance services are also generally easy to contact, and quick to respond to complaints."
College Sophomore,4,"I have had a good experience at Oklahoma Baptist University because I have found people that I can connect with there.  Everyone there is not only nice and deeply concerned with the welfare of others, but I've noticed that they are not ashamed to  embrace their interests.  People go on mission trips to dangerous countries, but will sit and talk about the latest episode of Dr. Who.  Unlike in high school, I know I can be myself around the people there without judgment.  I would definitely choose this school all over again."
College Freshman,4,OBU is a safe bubble.
College Freshman,4,OBU provides a degree in which one is prepared for the workforce with a job in line.
College Freshman,4,Athletics at OBU are top notch!
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of opportunities for any career.
College Sophomore,4,The new men's dorm is super cool.
College Sophomore,4,The have an excellent swim team and track team.
College Junior,4,Most people with degrees from OBU find it easy to find jobs after graduation. The school provides many job fairs for their students.
College Junior,4,"Most housing options are within a good proximity to classes, the cafeteria, the chapel, and athletic facilities.  The community developed in the dorms is also a great perk to campus life."
College Junior,4,Greek life isn't a huge part of the campus social scene but those who are a part of it enjoy it.
College Junior,4,"Student athletics seem to rally support from current students, alumni, and the community."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are intelligent and convey what they know fairly well. Most teachers about and avidly try to get to know student very well
College Sophomore,4,This school has a high academic prestige. Its education is as good or better than how they present themselves. there is no doubt with possible statistics that students graduating from this school get jobs.
College Sophomore,4,"It has the best statistics of any school in the state for my major. Class sizes are nice and small, but so is the school; so its not exactly the best college experience."
College Sophomore,4,"We're not a very athletic school our footbalk program is new, our basketball is average, and although our track is great but we dont have many fans for it the football team doesn't even have lockerrooms so a section of the nearest boys dorm is used for the visiting team each game."
College Sophomore,4,The school is investing in more lighting on campus and the campus security is great if you call the campus security department they can take you from one area to another. Its extremely helpful
College Freshman,4,The health and security of campus is very nice. I cannot say excellent because I cannot speak for everyone. The campus police I see quite frequently patrolling which is nice and I myself feel safe but try not to be alone too late at night outside. I do appreciate all the information and preventions OBU offers to us.
College Freshman,4,Athletics are neat at OBU. They are not everything but a fun experience for those who choose to support or be involved in. I love the facilities and enjoy working out in them. Varsity is very serious and club/intramurals are not looked down on but seen as important too! The coach are Christ lead as well and I think work hard. Athletics are centered in Christ and there are chapels that emphasize giving God the glory in sports as well!
College Sophomore,4,The school has many connections and many job fairs.
College Freshman,4,I love my classes and the Professors. Oklahoma Baptist University itself is so community based and I enjoy that. I also really love the diverse student body.
Niche User,2,I am currently a senior in high school and because of Covid I was not able to take the ACT or SAT tests and the people at the school won't stop calling me asking me for the scores. It's repetitive every week. I still am not able to take these tests and they won't stop asking. I feel harassed by the people from this school
Sophomore,2,"Oklahoma Baptist University is not for everyone. If you meet the right friends and have the right group, you will probably survive. But, if not then no. If you are a big person on wanting the college life experience you will not get it here."
College Sophomore,2,Theres nothing really up in the partying scene unless you're an athlete or hang in that crowd. The scenes that arent house parties are 30 minutes away and are impossible to get ro without a car
College Sophomore,2,There arent very many jobs and the ones that are available you aren't able to get many hours or you get way too many hours. Some of these jobs need to hire more and some need to hire less. The hiring processes are not very fair either
College Junior,2,I never hear about parties except the one with dj two bowls or whoever that is. I mostly just have small get togethers.
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid office at OBU is very frustrating. They can not get their bills to match up. In one bill I will owe nothing and then in another bill I owe over a $1,000. That is a very big mistake. If you do not stay on top of your bills at OBU they will take more money from you then you owe."
College Freshman,2,Rules are outrageous. Pricing is horrendous for the conditions. Res life is the worst part of OBU in my opinion.
College Freshman,2,"Hate it. Dirty, smelly, loud"
College Freshman,2,safety is fine except for sexual assault
College Freshman,2,There are few parties at OBU.
College Freshman,2,Shawnee can be a pretty boring town. Don't expect to love the entertainment here.
College Freshman,2,Nightlife on OBU's campus is hanging in the GC or sitting on the step of Shawnee Hall. What else would you expect from a baptist college?
College Sophomore,2,There really aren't many options in shawnee.... Like at all
College Junior,2,The only kind of transportation is provided by the students themselves.
College Freshman,2,We need more spots on campus. GC is bad and girls parking is bad. But unless there are is game noble is okay to park in.
College Freshman,2,Very strict on unimportant things.
College Freshman,2,Don't have real Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not into that stuff, but I know that there are not many bars around here. I don't know anything about the parties. I do know that there is a lot of underage nightlife and I have a friend who volunteers all the time to be a designated driver."
College Sophomore,2,There are a few fast food restaurants and a very small shopping mall.
College Freshman,2,not much to do in immediate area
College Sophomore,2,"I have a laptop, and the wifi is very finicky most of the time. I don't know about the computer labs because I don't use them."
College Freshman,2,Low scholarship amounts given and the scholarship amount you get at the beginning of your freshman year will remain the same all four years as long as you maintain the required GPA. You will not get a better scholarship even if your GPA improves.
College Freshman,2,There is no public transportation in Shawnee. College students who do not have cars have to rely on friends for rides to the grocery stories or other places.
College Sophomore,2,"Weather can be terrible at OBU, last spring we left school the 15th and two days later a tornado came by the school. Snow is very common in the winter times as well as ice and rain with high winds. "
College Sophomore,2,For living in the dorms its a pretty strict place and the fun can be limited at times. Although that is where you will make most of your friends. 
College Sophomore,2,Drugs and Alcohol are not very noticeable on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"OBU doesn't necessarily have a ""Greek life"" but do have social clubs, they don't boast and brag like Greeks so it isn't bad having them on campus. "
College Junior,2,"Parking permits are free, but there is not enough parking for students especially those who live on campus. Most students who live on campus usually have to walk half way across campus in order to get to there parking spot. "
College Freshman,2,"I am not a huge fan of the cold, and it has been getting pretty cold here, especially in the mornings. The weather is bipolar. Some days it is sunny and a good 70 degrees while the next day could be rainy and 40 degrees with a strong wind. Also, it is in tornado valley."
College Freshman,2,My RA is pretty chill. When it comes to the rules they are a strict and sometimes I find them unnecessary.
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately for the guys campus agee was a terrible dorm, but if your a lady  you have much more benefits"
College Sophomore,2,"Its a bit average, but it will be hard to eat fairly healthy unless that student could cook something their self"
College Sophomore,2,"OBU is a small school, meaning that diversity really isn't there. Most people here are white and the few ethnic people who are here, are for athletics. Also being a Baptist school means if you are anything else you are looked down on."
College Sophomore,2,"I've lived in Oklahoma my whole life, so I'm pretty used to the bipolar weather. It's not really a problem, and OBU has weather alerts and things to ensure whether we have class and safe places to go in an emergency situation"
College Junior,2,"Well, it is Oklahoma. One day it will be bright and sunny; you'll need shorts and a tank top. Then the next it will be freezing and you will need a heavy winter coat. The weather can be difficult to adjust to. But, if you like wind, then you are in great luck! We have plenty of it to share all year."
College Sophomore,2,There is not a lot to do in Shawnee and the main attraction is the mall which does not have a whole lot in it. The best thing to do is drive to the city but that's 45 minutes away.
College Freshman,2,"I experienced many difficulties. I brought in credit from AP exams and dual credit, but the people in the admissions center had a hard time figuring out what to give me credit for. It took them forever to give me a definite answer and many times I got no answer. I was also placed in the wrong Spanish class instead of the one I needed to be in. The admission center knows nothing about the majors, I would strongly suggest talking to a dean or a professor about classes because they actually know about requirements and credit for the majors and are extremely helpful."
College Freshman,2,"The food is average, its ok but not the best. Usually they have the same thing every week so you get tired of it. However, OBU gives each student with a meal plan several ""flex dollars"" so that they can get food elsewhere on campus so they don't have to eat in the cafeteria all the time."
College Freshman,2,"The weather in Oklahoma can be crappy, bipolar, and unpredictable. However, at OBU you don't have to be worried about it, because they have an emergency alert program that you can sign up for, and it will let you know if there is dangerous weather you need to be aware of. So, the weather isn't the greatest, but the systems that are in place to help deal with it are."
College Sophomore,2,"The meal plan/flex dollars are fine, but it is the food that is horrible. I would rather use up my flex dollars than eat in the cafeteria. I believe any meals that are not used by the end of the week should transfer into flex dollars to be used downstairs."
Graduate Student,1,"Not worth attending. Waste of money. If you want to become a religious elite, this is the school for you. If you are a Calvinist and enjoy calling people heretics, you will fit in well here. If you are White and come from an affluent Southern Baptist Family in Oklahoma, you will likely enjoy being at OBU. If you don’t fit that criteria you should seriously consider not attending. I was a ministry major and I made A’s and B’s in pretty much all my classes. The Things I learned at OBU didn’t add to my Ministry. If anything, the textbooks I read and the papers I wrote, weakened my faith. I felt enslaved and spiritually starved at OBU. I learned a few good things from 2 of my ministry professors but it definitely isn’t worth the $80,000+ that you will spend here. If you enjoy reading your bible and following the Lord, stay away from this school. If you want to learn how to follow God, learn from people who are in love with God’s word. Bible College is severely over-rated."
Niche User,1,"Honestly one of the worst universities I have ever seen. Faculty pretend to care about students but really couldn't care less. They protect their administration at all cost and don't really give a rip about the students. Be careful what you say or who you be friend. If you so much as step one toe out of line or hang out with someone the administration has deemed ""troubled"" you won't be there much longer."
Sophomore,1,"Where to start: mediocre facilities for science students, exclusive, unsafe, lackluster athletics, Greeks, incredibly restrictive campus life. If you are a student athlete attempting a science degree, run far away from this campus. With a graduation rate of nearly one half, it is safe to say you are wasting your time here; most athletes will transfer by their second year anyway. Non-athletes will usually transfer because this campus has literally nothing to do. The city of Shawnee is a hotbed of crime with little to no commerce. In my first year, an armed suspect of literal grand theft auto attempted to hide out on our intramural fields. Academic rigor for the sciences is ridiculous. It's a common joke that this place is essentially Baylor University, minus the brand recognition. The instructing is terrible, so expect to learn everything from reading your textbooks. Most of the science department's staff is foreign, so if accents are difficult for you, stay well away."
College Sophomore,1,Nothing really unless you're an athlete or hang out with that crowd.
College Junior,1,Can't have visitors unless in the specific time given.
College Freshman,1,OBU won't let students live off campus.
College Freshman,1,I haven't heard much about parties.
College Sophomore,1,"The strictness of when people can come to your room needs to be taken out, we are in college and shouldn't have rules based on when people can come in our rooms. "
College Sophomore,1,"Finding parking spots with the right permit tag are nearly close to impossible, as you always find yourself parking at the Noble unless it's Chapel day, then there is really no possible places to park. "
College Freshman,1,"The weather, as in any other Oklahoman College, is Bipolar--to give it an anthropic character. It is warm and sunny out one day and cold and rainy on the next. It just seems that it cannot decide."
College Sophomore,1,"The ARA, or cafeteria, food is awful and the only other option is the grill downstairs which is basically all grease foods."
College Junior,1,The campus body is not very diverse and various groups tend to stick to themselves for the most part.
College Freshman,1,Small City – OBU is located in the small city of Shawnee where there really is not too much to do. There is one mall that it not all that great. Most students tend to go back home for the weekends or to travel out to the city.
College Junior,1,"We are not even allowed to call our Greek Life Sororities or Fraternities, they are noted as social clubs."
College Freshman,1,"Too Strict – Obviously drinking and smoking are not allowed, which is pretty standard.  The thing that makes me mad is that girls are not allowed in guys' dorm rooms without having to sign in, being escorted to the room, and having a supervisor watch you.  You're not allowed to shut the door at all.  Same goes for guys being in girls' dorm rooms.  It's ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,"There Are More People That Drink – You occasinally see people smoke here and there on campus, but on the party scene there are more drug usage taking place."

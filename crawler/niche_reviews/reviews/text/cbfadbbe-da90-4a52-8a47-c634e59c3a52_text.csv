Freshman,5,"The University of the Cumberlands is an amazing school in many ways. The campus has beautiful buildings and sculptures all over campus. Another good thing I like about the campus is that all educational buildings, student services buildings, and dorms are within about a 10 minute walk. The campus itself is also very close to everything Williamsburg has to offer. The Cumberland's has an amazing staff, they are always willing to help in any way they can, and are always friendly. I chose the Cumberlands because I wanted  a safe environment, Christian campus, and a quality education, all of which the school provides."
Freshman,5,"The professors try very hard to make sure the students learn just as well online than in person. We also have a wonderful IT department, which is where I work, that can assist in online difficulties."
Graduate Student,5,"I really enjoy this university. The faculty and staff are highly qualified professionals and they come from diverse backgrounds and experiences. The university is very proficient in their level of customer service. If I need help with something or documents sent, they respond quickly. I am thankful I found this university. Not to mention, the price of tuition is beyond reasonable."
Graduate Student,5,"I currently take online classes at UC. As a full time student, the online learning environment is flexible for adult learners. We use the Zoom platform during classes. Although my peers and I are located in different places around the US, professors give students the opportunity to interact and engage with one another. Classes typically meet once per week for an hour and a half."
Freshman,5,"The University of the Cumberlands has a gorgeous campus and one of the best communities you'll find. They have recently lowered their tuition by more than 50%, offered free books to all undergrads that are either on campus or commuting, provided free parking passes, and given each student three meal swipes a day (two on the weekends). Everyone is kind and willing to help you with whatever you may need. There isn't much of a night life, and there are some pretty strict restrictions in the dorms. Due to COVID, students aren't allowed guests in their dorms. Other than that, UC has gone above and beyond the call of duty to ensure students have the best college experience they can in these unsure times."
Junior,5,"It is a liberal arts school, so the amount of people that I have meet is amazing. I never thought that could be such a large number of different people in this world and I can actually learn a lot of culture from them. Not only that, I also learnt new religions, morals, and ethics."
Junior,5,"University of the Cumberlands has an incredible online programme. So, when the COVID19 appeared they had everything well organised. It did not change anything on my experience on campus, just my schedule because I had to return to my home country."
Junior,5,It is a very loving and excellent environment to complete your college degree in. Amazing faculty that are very easy to work with. Everyone at University of the Cumberlands has your best interest in mind and will do anything they can in order to ensure your success.
Junior,5,I took a few classes online through UC while I was still in high school. The teachers are incredible and very easy to work with. The curriculum is very easy to comprehend online.
Junior,5,"My first two year at UC have been amazing. The environment is amazing and campus is beautiful. While there is not much to do in the town of Williamsburg, my friends and I do our best to make the most out of it."
Junior,5,"Online classes are very good at UC, I have done only a couple because I am a full time on campus student. The professors make it very important to know who you are and make sure to communicate very well."
Sophomore,5,The University of the Cumberland’s is a great choice for those who enjoy a small town feel. It is very easy to get to know a lot of people because there are so many events and extra curricular actives to get involved it. They offer challenging yet interesting courses and have great professors.
Sophomore,5,"Although I am an on-campus student at The University of the Cumberland’s, I have taken multiple classes online. I really enjoyed these classes. The professors are very involved and almost make it feel like you’re really in a classroom. They are all very helpful and available when you reach out to them."
Senior,5,"All of my classes have been online. The tuition is cheaper that in seat/ on campus. However, there have been a few classes that I would have liked to have the option to take in person such as biology and accounting. I am hoping to finish my degree by May 2021."
Senior,5,"Professors are understanding and will work with students. They want you  to succeed in your classes. This is a Christian University, so don't think you will get to stay out late and party the night away."
Freshman,5,"I really like my college, it was very unquiet. They are very nice and is willing to work with you every step of the way. I finished with great grades but I had to work for it."
Graduate Student,5,"The Information Security or Cyber Security graduate program is excellent! It is recognized and accredited by all the Federal Security Agencies.
Devoted Professors and staff make interactions with students a pleasure."
Junior,5,Such a great community! Everyone is so friendly and the campus is beautiful. They have a variety of options for food and housing. The student to professor ratio is small which means that the relationships between the two are wonderful because professors actually get to know you. They have a wonderful athletic department as well.
Freshman,5,I love how small the campus was and the smaller class sizes. The professors were all very kind as well.
Graduate Student,5,"It's a great school. I am completing my ESL endorsment online and after it is completed this summer, I will continue my education and receive a Rank I in Teaching English as a Second Language."
Freshman,5,"Very home like community with amazing help. A beautiful campus and such nice people. When I was first there I was very scared because I was such a young freshman but everyone made me feel at home. I had moments during the middle of the semester where I had many doubts and I was super stressed about money and my financial aid but all I had to do was go speak to the very nice ladies in the Financial Aid office and they helped me with everything I needed and more. The Cumberlands also has many programs for so many different things for you to do. So many communist service opportunities, work study positions & more. I’ve very much enjoyed my time at the University of the Cumberlands and I’m excited for the many years I have to go ahead!"
Niche User,5,"Great place for faculty and students to work, learn and grow. The University has great leadership that zeros in on the needs of students."
Senior,5,"Great college and professors. I am online criminal justice major and the classes are 8 weeks per class, so 4 classes per semester. I have learned a lot this way. Highly recommend those who work for this school. It is structured well and all classes coincide the same."
Alum,5,"UC was a wonderful family-like atmosphere. There were many sporting events as well as campus activities events to go to in the evenings. Professors were very caring and even invited students for a home-cooked meal. Great school if you're looking for a smaller, Christian, environment."
Freshman,5,So far great experience!  Great school.  Teachers care.  I feel like I am going to succeed and accomplish my goals here.
Freshman,5,"My overall experience with University of the Cumberlands up to this point has been nothing but great!  From the application process, applying for financial aid, campus tours, housing selection, the list could go on and on  the staff and everyone have been amazing!"
Alum,5,I received my Bachelor of Human Science with an emphasis in mental health counseling. The degree offered high-quality courses with very helpful professors at an affordable rate.
Freshman,5,"University of the Cumberlands has a beautiful campus, the professors are extremely nice and the students make you feel at home. The athletics are great and I love how everyone supports all teams!"
Graduate Student,5,"Great professors. Fantastic online experience using iLearn with a knowledgeable IT staff. The online library is amazing, plus access to real librarians makes everything reachable."
Niche User,5,"I have not yet started my freshman year on campus, however the campus has a ""homey"" atmosphere and I would not change anything about that!"
Junior,5,"I love the school. It’s a small, community serving school. The focus is on how to get the best, high quality education, and how to give back. It’s amazing."
Graduate Student,5,"Great school and a tremendous value, especially for graduate students who are looking for an accredited institution that is also highly ranked by U.S. New and World Report."
Niche User,5,"I loved how it wasn’t that big of a campus, it’s in a small town and it’s close to home. All the staff and students there on my campus Visit was really nice. The dorms were really nice and they felt at home."
Junior,5,"While the University of the Cumberlands is not in a very populated area I love this school. It is a very personal environment from student life to academics. I am a part of the softball team at the school, which is like my own little family. Im glad to call this place my home."
Graduate Student,5,"The graduate programs have a smaller than average student:instructor ratio. The rigorous academic curriculum means that you will work hard, and earn a strong, reputable degree."
Graduate Student,5,I'm a returning grad student and their program has made it possible for me to return to school while being a stay-at-home Mom!
Sophomore,5,"So far, college is pretty great. I suggest living on campus so you can have full access to everything and hands length. Classes are manageable if you work hard at it. The food is pretty good."
Niche User,5,What I experienced at Cumberlands was once in a lifetime opportunity. The school itself is just amazing. The faculty always try to help the college students. From the highest level of the faculty to the lowest level. They just want the best for their fellow students. I liked how they tried to make the diverted students for an example the Mexican students feel comfortable and make them feel like they were at home. To make them comfortable and feel as if they were at home they celebrated Cinco de Mayo. I would like to change the way they do their testing at the end of the year. I would like for them to give out the test around the middle of the school year. I also liked how students helped each other out and how they interacted with one another.
Sophomore,5,"This school is the perfect small town university in this nation. It is defiantly a great fit for anyone who doesn't want a lot of attention placed on them but wants to improve themselves quietly or by their own standards then this is the best place possible. I have been at this particular university for two years now, and i have worked my way past my first failed class to making a 3.0 GPA. All has been because of my teachers and friends I've made here since leaving my comfort zone in my other little town school Jellico High school. I would recommend this school to anyone in this world. "
Niche User,5,I loved the University.  The campus was beautiful and all the students were so kind.  I really liked the small classes.
College Freshman,5,I play Lacrosse here and a Freshman captain on the Varsity team.
College Junior,5,Coming to the University of the Cumberlands was the best decision I could have ever made. This beautiful university offers a family environment with plenty of opportunities for everyone. The small class sizes and effort the professors put into teaching make the cost worth it. I am confident that I am getting the best education possible and will be able to find a job in my field without difficulty when I graduate. I have also made so many lifelong friends and connections through this University that I am forever grateful for.
College Sophomore,5,I love the online classes and feel most of the professors are very dedicated to their students and subjects.
College Freshman,5,My experience at the school that I attend has been the best. If I had the chance to go back and look at different colleges I would not because I looked a lot of colleges before I choose to become a patriot and the college that I choose fits my needs and is a very rounded school and I am very blessed to get to be able to go to such a fine school.
College Junior,5,"The class size, material covered and the professors are what makes Cumberlands the best! I've been to two previous colleges and I've know I have finally found the university I want to establish my education at!!"
College Junior,5,Athletics are very important to my University and they're not treated differently on our campus. The school spirit could be better.
College Freshman,5,great housing. everything is nice and clean and there is plenty of space
College Freshman,5,"lots of school spirit. good teams, great overall"
College Freshman,5,"everything went well, great time with financial aid office"
College Freshman,5,The school is great to work with and will try to help you in every way possible
College Freshman,5,I love the strictness of the school.  It always a safe environment
College Freshman,5,"Even though we are a small college, we still have an international reach"
College Freshman,5,I love the small classes in the Accounting program
College Freshman,5,We have an awesome support system here at the school that are always there to help you
College Freshman,5,We have a super strict policy on the use of drugs
College Senior,5,There was no difficulties getting into my major.
College Senior,5,I completely love my program! It is the best! The staff is always willing to go above and beyond to help in any way and the workload isn't too much to handle!
College Freshman,5,I enjoy being on campus even when I'm not in class. The scenery is just so pretty you cant help but want to stick around on a pretty day.
College Freshman,5,I don't actually live on campus. I live in town with a relative but I still get involved with things at school! Its a very friendly and sociable atmosphere.
College Senior,5,"It is a nice, beautiful campus close to home with good programs in my area of study. I like the small school. One great opportunity is the Business Forum offered each Spring. where a few business professionals (different each year) come to class and speak with the students about business. It is free, and gives students opportunities to hear about various fields of business."
Freshman,4,"I have taken online classes through UC before and they were great! They aren't any different now. The professors are always quick and willing to respond to emails and any questions you may have! They are a little slow to grade, which was a bit annoying. The instructions on assignments are always clear, and the professors are truly invested in your progress."
Freshman,4,"Didn’t take online until the Covid-19 pandemic happened, but overall it was a good experience. It shows you how different college is from an in class setting. You mostly have to depend on yourself to do the work and you have to be very persistent. It gets tough because you are at home and you tend to get lazy, so you have to fight around that."
Freshman,4,"When I first came to UC everyone was so nice and helpful but things changed rather quickly. I wish things had been different but I know this semester will be better! If I focus on my assignments and pursue a relationship with Jesus, everything will be okay!"
Freshman,4,"Obviously, one can find a party anywhere on a college campus if they chose to be a part of that scene, but from where I stand, The University of the Cumberland's does a very good job with keeping the students safe on campus. There is a lot of activities offered during the week and even the weekends to keep the students occupied. I went kayaking the first weekend I was there and camping like the third weekend. There is just so many activities with people who seem genuine and are very kind. I love the atmosphere at the college and the opportunities/ resources available for me. The school is also very strong in their academics and there is a lot of majors offered especially for its small/ medium size. The counselors and advisers on campus have been helpful with talking out the required classes and majors that I could possibly declare. I am currently undeclared but I have time. I am excited to be at the school and am excited for future activities to join and people to meet."
Niche User,4,"I have had a wonderful experience with the University of the Cumberlands. I am currently enrolled in some dual credit classes through the university. They have made it really easy to understand everything that is going on and have notified me about everything that needs to be done in order to do my best in the classes. They also make it very easy for you if you ever decide to change paths and want to go somewhere else, they will simply just transfer your credits over."
Sophomore,4,"The Cumberlands is an amazing school that provides so many opportunities for growth! The professors are so nice and willing to help, even with letters of recommendation. The campus is super safe and holds up great values. The only problem with is it is not handicap accessible. Not all dorms and buildings have an elevator and only one building has a wheelchair ramp."
Junior,4,My experience so far with the Univeristy of the cumerlands have been good. I have had someone register my classes for me where it was my first time attending school. The only problem I have had is no return on emails. which makes it kind of frustrating when your new to the school.
Freshman,4,I really like the small class sizes and it’s a clean school and I feel safe.. the cost is really good too.. there is a large verity of food options
Junior,4,My experience has been great.  This school is a faith based private college and I’m enjoying the curriculum thus far.
Junior,4,I loved the opportunities that this school gave me. This school gave me a whole new outlook on how to make the most out of everyday in many ways. This school is always adapting and revamping itself to the needs of the students and is hearing them loud and clear. The campus is beautiful to live on and is very convenient. There is a nice family ora that it gives as this school is not that heavily populated which makes for the best friends that i hope to take with me after my degree.
Graduate Student,4,"Its a good college, Its a religious college, so if you aren't on the religious side of things, this might not be the place for you. Good professors, sometimes they forget how online schooling works, but they learn fast and it always works itself out."
Graduate Student,4,"University of the Cumberlands initially made my list to consider based on the cost and the draw of online classes (helping me spend more time with my family). But as I researched the program and spoke to previous students, I was impressed by the quality of the education and the teaching. And it has not disappointed! It is a great schedule for someone who is working and has a family, and the coursework and teaching is thorough. I feel prepared for my field! ”"
Junior,4,"I love the close knit community feel of the campus. The campus itself is beautiful and you can walk to all your classes! The professors there really care about their students. I have been able to ask professors about future career decisions and get helpful answers! The campus atmosphere is warm and friendly and that welcoming feel has made it like my second home. If you choose University of the Cumberlands, you will not be disappointed."
Senior,4,I have loved being at the University of the Cumberland's since I have been attending there since 2013. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The teachers are willing to work with you and actually take time to help you. It is a great environment and I am going to miss it when I graduate.
College Student,4,Class sizes are great. Teachers are able to interact with students more than a bigger university. And the teachers are very helpful.
College Student,4,It is a pretty safe campus. not too much crime goes on if anything there isn't any crime.
College Student,4,The campus is fairly big but lovely. Everything is convenient and everyone is fairly friendly.
College Student,4,"For one, its a safe and friendly place to be and i believe that this school will get me to where i need to be in life."
College Freshman,4,Security Cars always patrolling and police always passing by often around campus
College Freshman,4,The school provides many courses that fit me.
College Freshman,4,Everything about the school is perfect except dorm policies
College Freshman,4,Better but more hard than I thought it would be.
College Freshman,4,"The schedule is demanding, playing a varsity sport at the University.  But I enjoy it."
College Freshman,4,"The transition to college has been hard, especially with my participation with the volleyball team.  In general though, I am happy with the University and its demanding schedule."
College Sophomore,4,Love my major and classes are great
College Sophomore,4,It's great I feel I will have no problem finding employment
College Sophomore,4,Top 5 in most of the sports in the division  on top in a lot of sports several years in a row
College Sophomore,4,I enjoyed most of my classes but my professors were really easy to get off topic.
College Sophomore,4,We have had a few assaults that were taken care of properly.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the online classes, I do feel that it is sometimes a bit of a pain to register, the online site could be streamlined a bit."
College Sophomore,4,I have no worries that a degree from this school with do anything but help my job chances.
College Freshman,4,Going to the University of the Cumberlands is a great experience. All of the professors have been nice and very helpful when the occasion occurred. The only thing that could change to make it five circles is if they had more activities on the weekends.
College Sophomore,4,The tuition is very affordable and the financial aid office very nice. I feel like all staff care about their jobs and helping students.
College Freshman,4,University of the Cumberlands are very strict when it comes to the safety of the students. They only allow visitation everyday of the week from 7pm-10pm except Sunday and Wednesday no visitation at all. Also on Friday and Saturday they have visitation from 7pm-12am.
College Freshman,4,I like how the meal plan is.you get 3 meals a day. The thing I'm not a fan of is the cafeteria food. If I had to pick where to eat from the meal plan it would be first the patriot steakhouse because it has restaurant food that you can have from the meal plan and then the campus grill because its just a mixture of fast food and papa johns pizza.
College Freshman,4,"Living on Campus is awesome!  Although the rooms are a little small it makes you bond with your roommate or roommates better. Everyone in the community of the school are always so friendly. They have a lot of different amenities on campus like the swimming pool, weight rooms,indoor track, and, kind of like a game room."
College Freshman,4,I was rewarded several scholarships my first year it was easy to apply and they have been very helpful
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the grill and the patriot steakhouse
College Freshman,4,I have loved my first year here. Dorm life has been great room a little small and small bathroom but at least it's not a community bathroom.
College Junior,4,"I think that there could be more campus security but it's not too bad on campus. A lot of issues happen in ""on-campus housing apartments."""
College Sophomore,4,Professors are always available to help.
College Sophomore,4,It's not super difficult to get in. Get a good ACT
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,4,"its great, plenty of places to eat off campus"
College Sophomore,4,"in my major, workload is fair and people help you out and help get internships."
College Sophomore,4,"academics offered at my school are really good, professors work with you and help you out if needed."
College Sophomore,4,"athletics at my school are great, coaches work hard to train us an motivate us. athletes work hard and perform their best, and school spirit is great. there's always people there to support us at our games and tournaments."
College Freshman,4,"I got the help I needed and went through the process smoothly. I didn't get as much aid as I would have liked but overall, it went well and I am thankful."
College Freshman,4,The athletics at UC are pretty good. Sports on campus are popular and taken pretty serious.
College Senior,4,"There are several rules and regulations set in place in the code of conduct, but some of them are more ""bark than bite."" For those they enforce, as long as you are respectful towards others and do as you are told, you will be fine. 

The campus security guards are there mainly to enforce the parking rules. Other rules are enforced by other members of the faculty. The security is strict at the beginning of the semesters, but they are much more lenient later. They may have a slight negative impact on the view of campus, but if you are respectful to them, they will be friendly with you. I have had a good experience with parking overall."
College Senior,4,"The library is a great place to work on homework during the day, and they have fairly late hours through the week. There are several computers to use for online research and papers as well as many cubicle desks for students to work at individually. In addition to the library, some of the other buildings have computer labs to work on and print off papers."
College Freshman,4,I just park my car and don't really move it.  But it is not good if you want to drive to class
College Senior,4,Drugs is a huge no no on this campus! They will get you kicked out!
College Senior,4,"The labs are easily assessable, doesn't cost anything to print, network speed is great and reliable, access is great almost everywhere on campus and you mostly need to have your own computer especially when you have online courses."
College Senior,4,"Athletics here are great! They really get the general population of students involved, watching a game also gives us something to do."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy going to this school, I've been here for almost a year and I've loved it.  Theres no other college I would want to attend."
College Freshman,4,We have a church on campus which is something unusual for some campuses. The fact that we can talk to other students and faculty about our faith is great.
College Freshman,4,"It only costs 15 dollars to get a sticker to put on your windshield stating that you are a resident or commuter of the University of the Cumberlands. There are plently of parking lots for commuters, and faculty, and general lots as well."
College Freshman,4,There are alot of sports and all the people on campus get involved. Theres always alot of school spirit surrounding the day of a game. Alot of people go to the games and cheer on our team.
College Freshman,4,The teachers are really interactive with the students and seem to actually care about how they do with their grades.
Freshman,2,"The campus and the population were much larger than expected. I felt very pressured into participating into optional events, and as an introvert it was very unwelcoming. Dining options were poor. Overall, I felt very unwelcomed as a student on campus."
Sophomore,2,"To be honest, coming here feels much like the atmosphere of high school, which is what I wanted to escape. There is mandatory events the students must attend and I just feel like their is a sense of freedom lacking. The school would be great for someone who is made to be in a small school, but that person is not me."
College Sophomore,2,Administration does not support off-campus housing
College Sophomore,2,"Rules are very strict and enforced, but if you came here you knew that before you came."
College Sophomore,2,Not much of a party scene
College Sophomore,2,the food is ok but is not really healthy.
College Sophomore,2,"we don't have parties at school, we have to go somewhere else or to another city if we want to have fun."
College Senior,2,"Honestly there isn't much to do in this small town, we don't even have a movies. But it is beautiful, there are plenty of opportunities to go hiking and things of that nature."
College Freshman,2,When the weather is bad such as snow and ice they rarely cancel classes. Only certain professors will close if they think its bad. But the entire campus will not close. This makes it difficult for commuters like me to make it to class. I have a harder time keeping up with absences than those who can walk next door to class. I think the professors should consider closing if the roads are dangerous on account of students traveling like me. I am just as important as those who live in campus.
College Freshman,2,I have problems trying to receive aid.
College Freshman,2,"Considering this is a private Christian university, several things that are somewhat acceptable at a public university are frowned upon or completely unacceptable here. For instance, when having visitors of the opposite sex in your room, the door has to be completely open and the lights must be on at all times."
College Freshman,2,"Generally speaking, the weather is somewhat ""wishy-washy."" One day it will be sunny outside without a cloud in sight. Another day, it could be pouring down and virtually flooded. Yet another day, it will be freezing cold. This tends to be slightly annoying considering the part of the country I'm from weather tends to be mostly consistent."
College Freshman,2,"This University is mostly for those who come from extremely rural areas. The academics are okay. The professor to student ratio is generally 40:1. This school also leans towards students who are athletes. The general population consists of about 85% athletes. There are very few campus activities with the exception of athletic events. The city has very little to offer as well. All in all, this entails for a very poor college experience. "
College Freshman,2,"I basically came here just to play a sport and that is what most people do at UC. Unless you play a sport or you live close by, UC is going to be VERY boring. People here are also not very outgoing and making friends has been a har ongoing process."
College Freshman,2,"You must have a car to go anywhere in the area. Plus, if you eant to go anywhere or do anything you must drive at least 20-30 min to London or Corbin, KY. "
College Junior,2,"Athletes here make up a good portion of the student body. We have many sports and multiple teams make it to nationals. However, we do not have a workout center. We have 2 gyms and a weight room in the basement of the IM gym. It is very dirty and people cannot work out in there unless they are supervised by a coach. There are 2 other weightrooms on campus, both in dorms (one in a girls dorm, one in a boys dorm). However, the girls workout room is not very big and most of the equipment is old. And the boys workout room is mostly just weights, no cardio machines, and is packed with football players and wrestlers. There is usually a decent turnout at athletic events."
College Junior,2,Process got confusing with some of the online requirements that were not clearly stated.
College Sophomore,2,"Too Much Fast Food – There's (somewhat) a lot of different choices, but they're mostly fast food places."
College Senior,2,"Not Much to Do – I give the school some credit for attempting to provide students with on-campus activities.  Occasionally those activities are worth attending.  But as for the location of the school, there is nothing around.  It takes 1 hour to get the the closest larger city.  The county the school is in is on the radar for the poorest county in the U.S. It's very ""country folk"" outside of campus.  There is a movie theater within a 20 minute drive form the school. Not much more than that. There are some picturesque outdoors near, but those are attractors, not attractions. But, because the school primarily consists of athletes, athletics is about the only entertainment factor for us."
College Senior,2,"I Enjoy, but It's Too Easy at This School! I enjoy Exercise Science a lot! We learn all about the body and how it functions through classes such as Anatomy and Physiology, Physiology of Exercise, and Kinesiology.  Some classes are more like a lab where it's more hands on instructing and training rather than bookwork.  I transferred to this school from another school.  The other school was a lot more scientific based, preparing students for working in a clinical setting.  At this school, it's more sports based, preparing students to be coaches rather than Kinesiologists and Exercise Physiologists. The program is too easy at this school and I don't feel as if I'm learning the necessary material in order to be an Exercise Physiologist."
College Sophomore,1,There are no parties. Alcohol is not allowed on campus and dorm rules are strict.
College Sophomore,1,We have a dry school so there are no parties or nightlife.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek Life
College Freshman,1,we don't have fraternities or sororities. there is no Greek life
College Freshman,1,"We are located in small town, with not much to do that aren't campus sponsored events"
College Sophomore,1,IT RAINS ALL THE TIME.
College Sophomore,1,It's very common. We have weekly room checks and almost monthly drug busts (unscheduled).
College Sophomore,1,"We've had people robbed and raped on campus, even if it didn't come out to the general public. I work late every night and I dread walking back alone in the dark because I'm afraid I'm going to get hurt. All our security officers do is write parking violations."
College Sophomore,1,There is a guideline for everything. We have a 200 page handbook telling what we can't do.
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid office is a month behind on any information or payments made, and it is a complete nightmare trying to get anything done or get any aid whatsoever."
College Freshman,1,nothing to do for miles
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life on our campus so it's the worst I guess.
College Freshman,1,You must go out of Williamsburg to go to any type of nightlife. 
College Freshman,1,"Williamsburg is a extremely small town with nothing to do unless you like going to fst food restaurants for dinner. To go to a nice restaurant and have a fun night you have to drive at least an hour to Knoxville, TN or Lexington, KY."
College Freshman,1,"There are only a few place that allow you to actually sit down and have a meal, most of the places you will find in WIlliamsburg are fast food. You have to travel at least 20 minutes to go to an actual restaurant."
Recent Alumnus,1,"In order to go out, you have to go to the closest large cities: Knoxville, TN or Lexington, KY. Otherwise, you are looking at ""hole-in-the-wall"" bars."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Students must live on campus if they play a sport. The apartments are less than desirable, regardless."
College Freshman,1,It is not recommended and consequently there is nothing to evaluate.  Everyone is encouraged to live on campus.
College Junior,1,"This campus is pretty strict. If you are caught with a member of the opposite sex in your dorm room outside of open house hours, you will be punished extensively. If you are caught with alcohol, there are also serious consequences. The rules for open house hours are detailed... two feet must be on the floor, all lights must be on, the door must be opened, rooms must be clean. An RA will check on you every 10 minutes. Attendance is taken in almost every class. Parking is difficult because there is limited parking for resident students, most parking lots are for commuters. The security guards will leave you a $20.00 ticket for parking in the wrong lot."
College Junior,1,"There are limited amount of places to live off campus, and most apartments will not answer the phone or call you back. However the apartments that are available are very affordable. Undergrad students are not advised to live off campus at all and must provide a reason to the dean of student life as to why they should live off campus as an undergrad."

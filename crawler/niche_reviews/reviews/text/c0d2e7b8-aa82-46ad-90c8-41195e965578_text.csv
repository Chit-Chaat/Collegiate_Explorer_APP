Sophomore,5,"I have been attending the NSC for over a year and have had an amazing experience. They have always been extremely supportive when it comes to questions about the different degrees, as well as help you guide you in the right direction. I like that most my classes are in smaller groups, which really helped me learn better, be able to ask questions and have a closer connection to my teachers. Due to my great experience I’m planning on completing my entire bachelors degree here!"
Sophomore,5,"NSC is super supportive and makes sure all students are comfortable and successful learning online. I am taking 3 online classes at the moment, and I can honestly say that I feel very supported by my teachers as well as the other NSC staff."
Freshman,5,"North Seattle college is a very interesting campus than the other one i attended before. they have good student-staff relations, information travels in a very good way through campus. I have been taking online classes and i can't wait to see and experience the campus compound in person."
Niche User,5,"Everything has been seamless here- registering for classes (which I did last minute), figuring out financial aid, taking online classes, getting help at the library."
Niche User,5,"I have only just applied to North, I haven't had the opportunity to visit yet however the counselors are very helpful."
Freshman,5,This school has been great. I would advise any high school graduates to attend. All the teachers have been very helpful. Tuition is low also. Camps is safe.
Junior,5,I really like North Seattle college because all the faculty are so helpful. that helps  me succeed my dream to become a nurse. I have wonderful tutors and other classmates help me stay motivated.I really appreciate all the faculty support and my classmates.
Alum,5,I thought the teaching was great and they had plenty of resources to help me achieve my educational goals.
Sophomore,5,this college has an amazing campus. This campus has many faculty who love to teach. They have many degrees and certificates.
Senior,5,This college has a 4 year degree and works worth worker retraining programs to get you going. It’s great for returning and non traditional students with a daycare on campus for parents.
Sophomore,5,"its a good school to meet various people and students who are from different countries. 
Teachers are nice and very supportive. class size is very small so it is easy to talk to teacher in person."
Sophomore,5,"As an older LGBTQ+ student, the student body and faculty create a culture on campus that felt supportive and welcoming. North Seattle is an amazing learning environment. I felt like I belonged. It's also a great place to work."
Alum,5,Love the diversity at this community college. Professors I interacted with were all very knowledgeable and professional. Loved the coursework as well.
Sophomore,5,North is great about focusing on student success. Advisors and instructors are all more than willing to answer questions and give any advice students need. The community is warm and inviting and there are endless resources available to help students along their path toward whatever goal they are chasing.
Sophomore,5,"Teachers at North Seattle are very helpful in assisting students in their education, they appreciate hard work. North Seattle also provides many facilities to accommodate their students like, a gym, computers all over campus, a tutoring center, a library, a bookstore, etc. These little things help students in their academic performance because they are convenient."
Sophomore,5,North Seattle College is a great School. Registering for classes is easy and user friendly. The teachers are approachable and helpful. The cafeteria is nice and getting healthier every quarter and the parking as well as the public transportation is amazing!
Sophomore,5,"good school staff are amazing, all the instructors are very helpful and spend a lot of time helping student who needs extra help. so happy i attended North Seattle college ."
Sophomore,5,"North is a fantastic option for someone in my field of study (Early Childhood Education) as it is where the Early Achievers scholarship stems from. By already working with children, my tuition and books are completely covered. By far that was my hardest hurdle in getting back into school, and North saved me from student loans. They also offer a bachelor degree in my study, and that was the ultimate decision of my choice to stay there. Because of this, I can stay within the same circulation of instructors and will be able to be in a cohort of students I've known throughout my studies."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed this college. I spent several years here taking math and science classes. The classes are small sizes, which allow for better means do learning and connecting with other students and the teacher. The faculty truly care about your education and help the best they can you make you be successful."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed attending North Seattle College, it was close to my house but in a very convenient location.  The campus was set up as more of an outside campus, if the spring and summer, it was nice to step right out of the classroom into the outside sun and air. The teachers and students I met during my 2 years there were very friendly and attentive. I never had an issue getting my questions answered from any source."
Alum,5,"I have mostly taken online programs at NSC, but so far most of them have been quite good (the exception being the economics professor; he's horrible).  It seems like the overall quality of the courses is quite high and the costs are reasonable."
Sophomore,5,The vibe at North Seattle college is great. The teachers and the advisors are there to help you and they want you to succeed. The classes are fascinating and are useful to me outside of school. I would recommend going here!
Freshman,5,I've had a great experience at North! The faculty is great and always there to help when needed. The counselors are available on drop in basis and the financial aid department has been SO helpful. I've been pretty happy here and will be sad when I transfer to University. 
College Sophomore,5,"I love the small class sizes. It's nice when professors can pick students out of the classroom by name and say hi to you when you pass them in the hallways. I can say that I've had great professors here at North, and they truly do care about every student as long as you are willing to try hard in their classes. A lot of them have had a lot of workplace experience, which is really helpful in helping you to understand how the material applies to the real world. A lot of my professors give examples in their classes regarding other disciplines, too, which helps to learn the material."
College Junior,5,I wish I can take all online courses.
College Sophomore,5,I have had teachers with great flexibility when it comes to scheduling exam times. They have worked with me to arrange times that work with my schedule.
College Sophomore,5,The student center is great. I haven't been in the athletic center at all and have not participated in campus activities.
College Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed my online classes. The only downside is that I wish there were more online classes offered.
College Sophomore,5,They offer a wide variety of classes that are transferable to four year colleges.
College Sophomore,5,"They built a great new Health and Science building with a lot of updated equipment. The classes are small, and the building is clean."
College Sophomore,5,I am getting financial aid and when I initially applied the finincial aid office was great about letting me know exactly what steps I needed to take. They have been very good at getting back to any questions I have promptly.
College Sophomore,5,Counselors have been very helpful in guiding me towards next steps.
College Junior,5,A majority of the professors are really wonderful and care a lot about their students. Although the course work can sometimes be very difficult they try their best to extend themselves and aid us as much as possible. The classes themselves are also usually very interesting because the professors are very passionate and enthusiastic about it. And the class sizes are very small so it makes it easier to work with one another.
College Junior,5,"I actually really love my school because it has a lot diverse students both domestic and international. And it's a really open atmosphere so you encounter different people with different ethnicity, religions and sexuality and everyone tends to be respectful and compassionate towards each other."
College Freshman,5,"I've loved it at North. Community college is great if your schedule isn't super flexible and if you don't want to pay as much as you would for a university. I needed time to figure out where I was going to go with my career, and North was instrumental in being able to have the time and space to figure that out, and now I'm well on my way. I wouldn't have been able to do it if I was going somewhere else."
College Freshman,5,"I love the student body here. There is a LOT of diversity. People of all ages (running start through to seniors), sexual orientations, religious beliefs, different backgrounds--we've got a lot of international students, too, and they've always been pretty friendly to me. Everyone I've met seems to be really open to differences. It's really great to see a lot of different people at the school and in the classes."
College Freshman,5,"North Seattle is great if you have a lot going on in your outside life. A lot of the students here work at the same time, myself included, so there are a LOT of evening and online classes you can take. If your schedule is constrained then obviously you don't have as many choices, so if you're getting close to finishing up whatever classes you have to take, then you really have to make sure the specific classes you need are offered in the quarters you want to take them, but overall it's been really easy to get my schedule to work."
College Sophomore,5,"They have a DSHS office on campus, and partner with Goodwill, BFET and other programs to help you get the funding you need. There's a great financial aid office that is always willing to answer questions and help you with scholarships."
College Sophomore,5,"There's many evening, online and hybrid classes, you can build your class schedule around your work and family schedule."
College Freshman,5,North Seattle has just about every resource you need if they don't have it they will point you in the right direction so you can find it
Junior,4,The experiences that I have had within the science field have not only helped me crave more but also excite me for my nursing degree. The teachers are enthusiastic and good at explaining different styles of learning. Especially the chemistry teachers. I found my tutors to always be chemists. North Seattle College is vast in all ages but also multicultural.
Junior,4,"Where you are a student in your first year or finishing, studying with a present well-rounded teacher with a vice amount of content is important to have, and finding that online is even more difficult but every class  I have taken has passed with flying colors for me and many others."
Alum,4,"Online was really good, especially with Coronavirus happening. Teachers really went out their way to give the best learning experience for their students."
Alum,4,Education was really well. Teachers seemed liked they cared about me and other students to succeed. It is a really accepting environment.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently attending North Seattle College but also did running start at North Seattle College when I was in high school. North Seattle College has a pretty diverse students, a lot of Asian students which is nice because I am Asian and it’s nice to meet new people. The professors and classes are really good if you are a trying to go back to school as an adult or a student just graduating high school and not committed in a degree or have money to go to a private school. The resources are really good and advisors are really good and help you with succeeding in classes and helping with transferring. The college has a lot of college events helping students with transferring."
Freshman,4,"Overall I really enjoyed my experience here! It's a much smaller school, so the experience is a lot more personalized to what you need. Teachers are very accommodating as well as most staff. The only issues I've ever had have been their time constraints- it does seem that they don't have a lot of staff members. Because of this it takes awhile for things to happen, which can be frustrating."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the professors and students I'm in classes with. I love the international student representation throughout the college. I wish the music program offered more, but it's still an awesome college overall."
Graduate Student,4,"North Seattle College is a very tight knit campus with a small quad. There is a huge focus on the arts, and you can find statues and murals around campus done by the students. There is always new construction on the campus, so things are always changing. Landscaping is beautiful, everything is pretty functional. There are a lot of resources for students, including homework help, computer labs (including printers), bookstore on campus, cafeteria, plenty of places to study including student lounges, vending machines, and more. Most courses are led by caring instructors who help students out when they need extra help. Classes don't get very hard and are easier when you show up to all of your classes and do the school work assigned. Academic advisors never seem to know what they're doing though."
Freshman,4,"North Seattle College offers small-sized classes with various courses such as for transfer to a 4-year university. Almost everything is good for me, but the food and coffee shop here is very limited and somewhat expensive. Wifi here connects pretty poorly, especially at the library. Besides that, I am happy with this place."
Sophomore,4,"Take your classes here if you want to transfer to the University of Washington!
They are great for transferring to a Washington Universities."
Sophomore,4,"The Application Development program coordinator does a great job coordinating.
Also some great instructors! 
Financial aid processes quick and without issues."
Freshman,4,it is my first year at North Seattle and I felt very welcomed. teachers and staff were very helpful guiding me to my classes. if any questions were to occur they were ready to help when needed!
Sophomore,4,"Attending North Seattle College had been a great experience so far. Most of the teachers I've had have been helpful and one in particular has been very inspirational. The location is great; there are a lot of food places a few block up. The campus is huge and looks dreary, especially when it rains. Parts of the campus are newer so those areas look nice. There is also plenty of parking and accessible bus stops. I look forward to finishing up my Associate's here at this school."
College Sophomore,4,"North Seattle college often tailors their curriculum to the University of Washington's depending on the class, so it is fast-paced and challenging but manageable. I am a Computer Science student here and love how much attention I can get from the small class sizes, and can say that all of my professors have been really helpful and knowledgeable. A good amount of homework is given for every class, and the teachers expect you to do it and spend a fair amount of time doing so. But if you do, you will learn a lot and be ready to transfer to a 4-year program. Also, North Seattle encourages students to get internships while there, and have programs to give you school credits for doing so."
College Sophomore,4,"North Seattle is great. The teachers really care about the student's needs, and try to make sure everyone understands the material even outside of class time. There are a variety of students that go here including International, Running Start, Continuing Education, Traditional, etc., and the diversity is great. Also, classes are offered during most hours of the day, so you can really tailor your schedule to your needs."
College Senior,4,"Classes intended for working schedules, very helpful for me and my full time working schedule. No need to transfer credits. Easy interactions with everyone."
College Senior,4,"Professors are knowledgeable and helpful in making sure all students are learning, and class sizes have been small."
College Senior,4,I have yet to take advantage of these services but I know the school offers these services.
College Senior,4,"The program I am pursuing is very applicable to the career change I am reaching for, accommodates working schedules, reasonable workload, relevant curriculum, and easy access to professors."
College Senior,4,"My school has served my needs very well; flexible classes for working schedule, excellent amenities and services. For my career goals have been greatly helped by the options at this school."
College Junior,4,Seattle Colleges transfers credits pretty easily.
College Sophomore,4,"Great people. I was incredibly impressed with what a good job they did with the renovation. This city called for improvement in EDUCATION (and not hand outs of welfare money, people being dependent where their quality of lives suffered and they could not even work their way up to get into a ""different world."") Gregoire did a really very, very good job. I think it (the college) should be world renowned!!! 

I commented that it is ""Oxford University,"" but I am know to make a good situation out of anything, not that this college is bad at all. But recently I had snubbed Community Colleges as not as good as a four year colleges. I guess it is another opportunity to have a different take on it."
College Junior,4,"I haven't officially started yet, but they have been great with getting me set up again with classes and the placement tests!"
College Senior,4,Surprisingly good academics for lower-cost school.
College Senior,4,I'm currently in the Intro to programming class (CSC110) and so far I'd rate it an overall score of 7/10. The workload isn't that hard since it's an intro class but the topic is difficult to understand. I think after constant practice I think I could get coding with python down. The curriculum is very interesting! I always loved coming to class and learning all the new material even if I didn't understand large portions of it. The facilities are alright. My class only uses one computer lab but it has a lot of computers in it. I'd be a little concerned if the entire Computer Science Program only had access to one computer lab though. Internship and job opportunities at NSC are fantastic! I applied to Student Leadership and Multicultural Programs as well as a position at the Library and both hired me. I think that almost anyone could have applied for both positions because they mainly revolve around interacting with students.
College Senior,4,"I believe that the Nursing program and the Computer Science program is NSC's main priority. North wants to allow students to get their education fast in order to help them succeed. Nursing and Computer Science is currently the two most popular degrees, so the college tends to help students achieve their goals through their specific programs. I have sat through multiple lectures on a daily basis in my (almost) two years at NSC. Some were bad, however, most of the time, I felt like each professor wanted to teach the students passionately through their own teaching style. Each curriculum varies drastically. Some professors are fast-paced and heavy graders, while others are slower and easier. It really depends on the personality of each professor. 

In my opinion, class registration is sort of a pain. Since I am a Running Start student, I have to take multiple steps in order to register for each class. First, I have to talk to my college advisor to see which classes can be implemented in my degree, and satisfy me. Next, I have to bring that information to my high school counselor and have it checked by him. Then finally bring all of the information back to my college advisor, and register for the right classes. All of those steps combined usually takes two to three days, which is ridiculous. On the other hand, normal college students who are over eighteen can simply login to their Net ID's and register the classes online with three easy clicks. 

Besides the disadvantage that the institution imposes on Running Start students, I would totally agree that this college is a solid 8/10. It's not fantastic, yet the college has all the right things to support their students."
College Sophomore,4,I am only taking on-line and evening classes so I can't say a lot about this topic.The people in my classes are generally people who work full time. There is a lot of diversity.
College Junior,4,"They have a lot of options for classes and a majority of the professors are happy to help you outside of the class room to ensure that you understand the material and do good in their class. And they also provide math and accounting learning centers to help students that may require some extra tutoring, giving a more wrap around service."
College Junior,4,They have a lot of resources geared towards students.
College Freshman,4,"I don't receive financial aid right now, so I can't talk about that. But tuition is pretty cheap. Textbooks are expensive, but the Research and Advocacy Board on campus is trying to work to get prices to drop overall. Generally I've learned a lot from my classes and my instructors, so I'm pretty happy with what I've been paying."
College Freshman,4,"North has recently started remodeling the school, which is great, because before it was basically a concrete slab. A lot of people say it looks like a prison, and it does. The new buildings are beautiful, though. It'll be awhile before it's all built, but it's starting to look really good. Wi-Fi is a little spotty, but I think next year or this year we're having some people come in and help us to get it a little bit better. There are a lot of events at school, but a lot of people don't go to them because most people just want to go home after classes. But if you want to do stuff, then there's a lot to do. We have an art gallery, speakers and musicians come in, a lot of clubs have events...there really is a lot to do here. You definitely get to know people when you go to events, which is really nice."
College Freshman,4,"I don't know much about special study options or what we're most known for, but college transfer is something that I know a lot of people do. We have several DTA/MRP degrees available, so you can enter most colleges and universities as a junior after earning your associates. The class registration process is pretty straightforward; you pick what classes you want online and then pay within a week or so, a few weeks if you apply early. I've only ever had problems getting into the classes I need to take when I registered a week or two into registration, so as long as you pay attention to when registration opens, you should be fine. Returning students get to register before new students, usually by a day or two."
College Freshman,4,"I'm working towards my Associates in Business and it's been great overall. The workload is definitely doable even if you're working an outside job. The instructors are pretty good, a little bit hit or miss so you'd want to check up on Rate My Professor. There are a lot of different classes you can take, and they've recently introduced a couple of Bachelor's degree programs, including one in International Business. North also has a new building, the OCE&E or the Opportunity Center for Employment and Education. I haven't been in there much, but it looks really good and they've got a lot of help available there. There's also on-campus jobs available, though there aren't a whole lot."
College Sophomore,4,"There's an unemployment office on campus, which is useful for finding a job with your new degree."
College Freshman,4,They have plenty of computers and they have wireless access
College Sophomore,4,"The access to wireless is great only in the class, lab, lunch room, but weak connection in restroom...."
College Sophomore,4,"Its great, there is a pattern to the sequence of the class."
College Sophomore,4,This school consist of transfer students mostly
College Sophomore,4,The students usually are motivated.
College Sophomore,4,the overall school performance is pretty good.
College Junior,4,I have had no serious issues with NSCC and they have been really nice in all matters.
College Junior,4,"I have been taking all online classes, and could not have a better experience! Professors are organized and class deadlines are clear as are requirements."
College Senior,4,"I chose North Seattle Community College, because they offer a wide range of online- and evening classes, which is what I need due to my work schedule. In addition, there is a really good bus connection to the College and it is close to where I live."
College Junior,4,"This school is very diverse in general, all kind of backgrounds can be found in this school, from students to teachers and staff members. This school also offers different activities to interact with students from other background. In general I can say that this school is very good when it comes to diversity there is not a lot of discrimination going on and most of the people get along."
College Senior,4,"I think that my college is very conveniently located and easy to reach from various parts of the city. I don't own a car, so I really appreciate the fact that many different busses stop in front of the campus."
College Senior,4,"The facilities on campus are alright. The building itself doesn't look very welcoming, but the bookstore is very nice, as well as the coffee shop, where you can always find people chatting and studying. My favorite spot is the library, since it also offers many rooms and desks, where you can study quietly."
College Senior,4,"I think that the instructors are very knowledgeable and have a passion for teaching. In addition, they also seem to care about your success in each of their classes and give you the necessary support if you are struggling with something."
Recent Alumnus,4,Most of the online classes I have taken have been fairly easy. I definitely did not learn the material as well as if I had taken the class in person.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I'm happy with the school for the most part. I've had some really great professors, but also a few not so great one. I would say that the majority I've had are good though. One thing I don't like is that they don't make known the fact that online classes are cheaper than the price they charge you. After talking to someone in the financial aid office I was made aware of this and they actually refunded me the difference which was really nice, but they don't tell you this up front."
Recent Alumnus,4,I worked in the Bookstore department and the landscaping. the Staff were very flexible with my schooling schedule and work with me to earn more cash still getting all my school work done. The administrators are very helpful and resourceful to get students in the right path for success.
College Sophomore,4,North Seattle has a wide variety of students there. All of who are different in every way and North has always seemed welcoming and open to anyone and everyone. That for sure was one of the main reasons i go to school there. I love the atmosphere and the fact that no one is pressured due to ethnic differences.
College Junior,4,I am completing my AA Transfer degree so I have a lot of opportunity within that. I am not decided about what I want to do but the advisers and teachers have been really helpful and I am planning to study abroad soon and the advisers are helping me at every step to make it happen!
College Junior,4,"The tutoring services are really accessible and the professors are all really knowledgeable about their subjects. The registration process is pretty organized and the teachers are really good about reminding you to register, and recommending the right classes for you. Their advising is also pretty organized. Their financial aid department is very helpful. The only thing that is really annoying is the different processes come registration time. I think that is normal for any school, since they do not have as many staff."
College Senior,4,"This past quarter was the first for me taking an online class and a hybrid class.  The biggest challange for me was thinking of it as a real class.  I was consistenly late with my assignments and that affected my grade.  I think that becasue I had two live classes where I saw the instructor regularly, I put that work first."
College Senior,4,I feel that the programs have been desgined to give each and every student the opportunity to succeed at whatever they desire
College Sophomore,4,"The classes and schedules are very flexible.  The classes offered vary from early morning to night classes, so I can pick and choose according to my work schedule, and still manage to get the classes I want/need."
College Sophomore,4,"The computer network is fairly good at North.  There are 2 main labs, one in the library, and another in the computer/math department.  The network is fairly stable, it always remembers all of your personal settings on whatever computer you use throughout the network.  The wireless is also easily accessible.  There are also good resources on accessing your saved files and documents through using a 3rd party ftp software."
College Senior,4,"This staff continually has a line due to student population on F.A.  They are nice and extremely helpful.  There are current posting about work-studies, study abroad, and various other resources available to student nearby."
College Senior,4,You have to be self motivated more with online classes.
College Senior,4,"I have taken several online classes at NSCC and so far, it's been up to par. The website rarely break down, the workload depends on your instructor, however, most of them are reasonable and understanding instructors. Professor/student relationship is well-established. Peer-to-peer interaction rate depends on the instructor."
College Junior,2,I live kinda far. It's not that accessible.
College Junior,2,How could I possibly in 50 characters?
College Junior,2,I have a lot of horrible experiences with professors.
College Junior,2,Most teachers here are CRAP!!!
College Junior,2,I have nothing but bad luck at North Seattle College. I could go on and on and on about all of the terrible professors that I have encountered and the staff here just don't seem like they really care. I have only encountered a few really great professors/staff at this school. I really feel like I should be getting some kind of refund for all of the B.S that I have gone through.
College Senior,2,not a lot of beautiful girl
College Sophomore,2,"Do Your Research – Can be great to save some money before transferring to a university, but you won't always have the right classes available (some you can take easily through another community college though) and you should check out your teachers on ratemyprofessor.com. Some are great, and some really suck."
College Senior,2,"Communicate and Check Status Early and Often – The financial aid office does not communicate very effectively and the student is left on their own to ensure all documents are submitted and your file is complete.  I've called the financial aid office on numerous occasions and was unable to get through and unable to get any questions answered when a human did answer.  Only after going in to the office was I able to get things done.  When it was found that a document was missing, I asked ""Well, how would I know that this document was missing from my file?""  the non-chalant reply was ""You'd have to ask.""  To me that's insanity as they are the ones holding the file, the document requirements, and holding the money.  Essentially, had I not stayed on top of it, I'd have to wait to see if my aid came in and if it didn't, then I'd then have to backtrack to find out what was missing.  Had I not communicated and double checked that every document was in place, I would not have been able to pay for tuition."
Niche User,1,"My daughter went through their Accounting Program that claimed to take care of all the accounting requirements for being eligible to take the CPA exam.  THEY LIED.  Fraud, plain and simple.  Their classes are all 200 level classes and the CPA exam board will only accept "" 300, upper level"" classes.   She just wasted a few years of her life and depleted her savings and educational fund for a worthless certificate. My wife and I are now faced with depleting our limited retirement fund to help her go to a REAL school to get the requirements she needs, and she will have to repeat a couple years worth of work.   Along the way, the school was a nightmare to work with and totally unhelpful.   This school is a waste of time!"
Niche User,1,"one disaster after another with professors that put in ZERO effort, and it resulted in a completely worthless accounting certifiate."
Alum,1,"Went for culinary school in mid 2000's. Half way through they replaced our instructors with incompetent (Robert Sutzle) ACF chefs. They closed the program before a lot of us finished. couldn't finish at any of the other colleges. BIG WASTE OF TIME!!! Dean is crooked. Worst community college in Seattle. On top of all that, the instructor that was supposed to teach us gave me poor grades, even though I was one of two or three people to do all assignments and almost perfect attendance. I think its because I was a better and more knowledgeable chef, and I think he became jealous how the other students listened to me more than him. Its embarrassing telling people i went here for school, which is why I don't tell many I did."
Niche User,1,"I have attempted to use the Tutoring Center, and they are not attentive, or even mentally available. It is very challenging to find classrooms and navigate the campus to find any resources or buildings, even the Admin building, and the Library entrance. When registering for a class, I was trying to clear up my residency status, and no one knew if I had the correct documentation, they just assumed I didn't. I have asked multiple departments HOW to get onto the student WIFI, and everyone just shrugs their shoulders at me. So bad. I have been to a few colleges to take courses, and this has been the worst experience of all."
College Junior,1,People in the F.A don't know what they are doing!!!
College Senior,1,Needs Student Loan Programs – North Seattle community College does not participate in any student loan programs. This means I have to pay for it all out of pocket at the time of registration. Financial aid grants will not be awarded to me either because I already have an LPN degree. Makes it hard to go back to school if there is no way of paying for it.

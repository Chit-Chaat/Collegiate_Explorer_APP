Freshman,5,"Online classes have actually been a breeze here at the university of Nevada, Reno. All courses are run through a single platform that is both easy to use and easy to access."
Freshman,5,The University has a beautiful campus with a great outdoor environment for all to enjoy. The surrounding area of the Washoe Valley is beautiful year round and the proximity to skiing in the winter and Lake Tahoe in the summer make the location a huge bonus.
Freshman,5,"The University of Nevada-Reno is an amazing school. The campus is beautiful and the staff is amazing. I love Reno in itself, even considering it is such a small town. UNR has become my new home and I am so happy to call it that."
Freshman,5,"Learning online was definitely a hard change, but UNR made it so easy for me. I have all my classes on one website and it is so easy to navigate."
Freshman,5,The college experience has been welcoming for me. Even with a pandemic going on I have been welcomed in and brought a part of the pack just as much as others have. My transition from being formerly homeless to a full-time college student has been easier due to the support of the school.
Freshman,5,great campus and the people there were very nice and friendly. We took an unperson tour and the tour guide was great. She answered all of our questions and was very friendly.
Freshman,5,"Coming from a freshman at UNR, this school has so far been great. Everyone here has made a great first impression on me and they seem very willing to help out no matter the circumstance. I see myself completing all 4 years here and hope the experience stays great."
Freshman,5,"The online learning experience was one of a kind, very well planned and all teachers knew what they were doing and taught all students well."
Freshman,5,A University of great Diversity and with a beautiful campus with lovely teachers and staff that are always willing to help anyone.
Senior,5,"I don't believe in professor tenor. I've had some bad professors, that I don't believe should teach anymore."
Freshman,5,"This University is very open to all kinds of people, no matter what you identify as.  The teachers are impeccable and the classes are worth every cent. You will not regret choosing this school. Everyone is so helpful and the jobs you can get on campus are amazing opportunities."
Alum,5,I loved attending UNR since their class sizing were smaller which made getting to know professors and cohort easier. My professors were really knowledgeable and were eager to help any student.
Senior,5,"I have had a great experience at UNR. I am entering into my senior year, and I have thoroughly enjoyed being on campus."
Junior,5,"My online experience with UNR was better than I expected it to be. I was worried that I would fall behind on my classes and lose motivation to participate and study, however, this was not the case. I ended up doing even better in my classes once we went online. I was able to sit in the comfort of my own home, in the comfort of my house clothes and be able to focus on my school work without the distraction of the other students in my classes. Overall, I would not mind going online again, it was truly a great experience for me personally."
Junior,5,"This university not only welcomed me with open arms, but it allowed me to come out of my shell and become such a wonderful, intelligent, sociable young woman. The University of Nevada-Reno is a university that truly cares about its students, whether they are a part of the LGBTQ+ community, the black community, or any other diverse community. UNR provides the students with incredible resources ranging from mental health, physical health, sexual abuse, and even academic resources. I never feel unsafe on this campus and I will always cherish the memories that I have made during my time at UNR."
Junior,5,My online experience was not bad. I had 2 classes online and then when COVID-19 hit all my classes went online. I only had a few zoom lectures which my professors made not mandatory which made things feel better about learning at my own pace.
Junior,5,I love this school because of all of the opportunities I have found in just one year. I changed my major to journalism which has made me seen the world in a new perspective. I comprehend my classes a lot better now due to the atmosphere and how caring all of the staff is for my education.
Senior,5,"Although I was in my home town, I still felt as though I was in a new place full of new people. I have so many professors and staff helping me throughout my college career that they have become a second family. They are a group of student body that always does what it can in order to get our voices heard on any injustices."
Junior,5,"I’ve only taken one class online, but overall it was a positive experience. The other students in the class were very engaged in the material which made for more interesting discussions. Also, the professor I had was reachable at all hours of the day, and he never replied more than an hour later after I had asked my original questions. The resources for online classes were also top-notch and is readily available"
Junior,5,"I have been at UNR for 3 years now, and I absolutely love the school. It is large enough that I feel like I am going to a big school with a lot of opportunities and accreditation, but small enough that I don’t feel like I don’t know anyone. The staff, in my experience, has been incredible. All very willing to help get you to the next level in your studies, and also in life. At this university, you learn more than just your chosen degree studies, but also how to succeed post-college graduation. Beautiful facilities as well."
Freshman,5,The school has done a good job transitioning to online classes. The teachers have done their best; some have done really well.  They have tried to keep tutoring available.
Junior,5,"UNR is a great campus with many teachers willing to help their students understand material. The school has many majors and classes to chose from, making the institution very versatile and easy to major in a wanted degree program. I would recommend this institution to anyone that would like to get a well earned degree from an accredited institution."
Junior,5,"My online experience was a difficult transition, only due to the fact that I am a way better learner during in person classes. Although the transition was difficult for me, my instructors did an amazing job completing the transition with the most amount of ease. Our teachers understood that the transition was hard and did everything within their power to make the class just as interesting and important. All around a great experience."
Alum,5,"The University of Nevada, Reno was an amazing school from courses offerings to faculty and staff. Only 3 hours away from family incase of emergencies, but far enough way to start my own life and career. The University is always working on improvements to better equip their students and staff with the best educations and materials possible."
Alum,5,"My favorite part about the University of Arizona was the campus life and the type of classes I was able to enroll in. A specific major was formed during my sophomore year for Microbiology and Immunology which ended up being my passion. I now currently work at a hospital doing exactly what I wanted after getting all the experience in my specific degree. Not many colleges offer such a specific and interesting major, in my opinion! I'm very happy I had my four year university experience at UNR."
Freshman,5,So far all the teachers I've had seem to really care and want the best for you as long as you put effort in their class.
Junior,5,"The school is amazing and I'm glad I transferred here from my community college in Oregon. While Reno is currently undergoing some growth, so is the university. The campus is beautiful and most of the teachers really do their best to help you succeed in your coursework. I am in the Neuroscience program which is relatively new at UNR, so they are always keeping us updated with program changes."
Senior,5,"The environment and school safety is great at the University. With the increased acceptance of students, the amount of faculty and options for classes has been a problem."
Alum,5,"UNR gave me a great undergraduate experience. I received a quality education from a notable and renowned faculty where I felt supported and that I had every resource I needed to be successful. The campus is well taken care of and full of high quality and up to date facilities both for class work and extracurriculars. The party scene isn't anything to write home about but if you're really focused on you education, that probably shouldn't be your focus anyway. My program left me well prepared for graduate level work and is serving as the foundation for my future career."
Junior,5,"UNR is great university and the professors teach in a way that is helpful. Because they care about students as individuals, they are very understanding of personal situations. The university has a warm atmosphere and lots of opportunities for students interested in different things. The surrounding Reno area is fun to explore and you meet a lot of cool people. It's also really easy to find a job on or off campus, and because there are lots of university students, they're usually flexible with scheduling. Overall a great university, Go Wolf Pack!"
Freshman,5,"The campus is absolutely gorgeous! The red brick of the buildings mixed with the luscious green grass blends very well, especially in the fall when the trees shift from green to red. The professors are very nice and are open to help students learn even out of the classroom. The library has multiple levels, each with its own level of quietness."
Niche User,5,"Everyone at the University of Nevada-Reno is friendly, welcoming, and helpful. It seems as if everyone has their own place, but it does not feel divided. The school cares about the students safety and education."
Freshman,5,The campus is very nice and clean and it was very easy to adjust. The professors are nice and encouraging and the events are social and fun.
Freshman,5,"The University of Nevada, Reno has been a wonderful experience so far in my higher learning experience. Among the many opportunities of academic help, research, and emotional support, I believe that Reno is a nice transition from a small town high school. I feel comfortable and safe to express opinions and feelings about personal ideas. I would be happy to continue my education in their medical or graduate school."
Sophomore,5,"This school is a really good school that cares about their students and their success. There is a lot of student involvement programs and it's very easy to make friends here. This campus also embodies a diverse culture and celebrates it through their sports teams and liberal arts performances. If anyone were to consider going to college, I'd recommend UNR in a heart beat! Go pack!"
Freshman,5,"Great experience in just my first semester at UNR! So many useful and different resources to help you pass your classes, amazing on campus gym, dozens of on campus job opportunities and overall a great college experience that offers you everything you might need!"
Freshman,5,The university has an excellent community both on and off campus with plenty of resources on campus to assist academics and many opportunities both on and off campus to join the community and participate in special events.
Niche User,5,Absolutely fell in love I loved being there and I loved how so many people were really nice and approachable.
Junior,5,I am a transfer student to UNR and they have been very good to me. Being a non-traditional student as well I have had a lot of questions and UNR especially their DRC department has been very good at answering my questions and have helped me feel like I am at home. There are many places to study on campus as well.
Freshman,5,"Overall, UNR feels so comfortable and welcoming while still being modern and high-tech. I was worried it would feel ""too big"" or intimidating, but ever since I decided to attend this college I have felt completely at home and excited to walk around the beautiful campus and attend all my classes."
Sophomore,5,"UNR is a great school. The classes are rigorous and interesting with great professors. The honors program there is very good. The area is fine, and it is near the downtown sector."
Niche User,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful and all the students seem to be incredibly nice and active in their school community.
Junior,5,"I  am a current student at University of Nevada-Reno. My experience is positive and rewarding. The staff are helpful and supportive in every aspect. When I have a question or need assistance, someone is always available and willing to guide me towards the right direction. For example, when I transferred to the university, I did not understand my fees and where to address my questions. A young female walked me to the correct building and showed me the correct office I needed to go. In addition, I feel safe while on campus. Our campus police did not hesitate to assist me when I had an issue with my vehicle."
Alum,5,The campus was beautiful and so was the nature. The teachers were wonderful and I really enjoyed my time there.
Junior,5,"I love the Music Department at UNR! The student culture is so supportive, and the faculty are fantastic."
Senior,5,"Great opportunity of self-growth and clears the blurriness of the future. The location and proximity to Lake Tahoe makes for great scenery. Diversity can improve, but there are signs of increase which is good to see."
Freshman,5,"“The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena. Whose face is marred by sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotion, spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievements, and who at worst, if he fails, at least falls while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who have never tasted victory or defeat.” -President Theodore Roosevelt.  
I have always loved football ever since I was old enough to hold one. The best family rivalries would come when the Oklahoma Sooners would play the Nebraska Cornhuskers. As a family, we would prepare a huge dinner for game night despite my mom and I placing bets who would be the victor.  It was nine years ago, in 2010, the last time my Sooners defeated her Cornhuskers for the Big 12 Conference Championship."
Niche User,5,Throught many emails and phone calls their administration office has been extreamly helpful and has made the application process easy and stress free.
Junior,5,"The University offers a multitude of services to their students that are included with their tuition, many of which are centered on their health and well being. Perhaps the most amazing of these is the free primary, medical care available to all students and other majorly discounted medical services. The quality of lectures and the buildings is phenomenal. There are frequent events, most of which involve free food."
Freshman,5,I am thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere and my professors at UNR. My math professor is the best! I just wish we had smoothies available on campus.
Niche User,5,The area is very beautiful and has a lot of features around the campus. The campus has a very welcoming setting. I would like to see more restaurants.
Junior,5,"Ive had the opportunity to network and get the connections and knowledge I need for my future career. The University is also a very diverse campus with fun things to do on and off campus. Like the balloon and air races, canvas paint night, the science lecture series or the many sports on campus. So I feel there is always something new and fun to learn here."
Sophomore,5,"It's a great school, amazing and beautiful campus. The food could be better, there's not much options. The local area is mostly casinos and small food places which are nice. Other than that, there not much to do unless you have a car. I would like to see more diversity."
Graduate Student,5,"I had a very great time going there, and I recommend it to my friends, my kids, my family, and I got a great job because of it"
Sophomore,5,"The Engineering program at UNR is phenomenal, and the overall campus life is fantastic. Great vibe everywhere you go, and there is always plenty of things to do, as well as plenty of resources for your classes."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is gorgeous. There are many places to hang out with friends or study.  The professors always try to encourage students that they are there to help us succeed. Even classes that have a lot of students, the professors try to make sure that everyone understands the course material. The dining hall always has many options to choose from. The menu changes daily so students don't get tired of eating the same thing all the time. There are many options for food on campus, not including the dining hall, that are also found off-campus that are popular places."
Sophomore,5,"As a social work major, I have enjoyed the knowledge that the professors have. They have been  helpful in understanding policies, encouraging student volunteer work, I especially enjoyed how accommodating they were of students who were parents."
Freshman,5,"The one thing I valued the most was the massive family atmosphere. Leaving High school I lost many friends, and thanks to UNR I gained way more. These friends have helped me find a better meaning to life and how to be a successful student."
Junior,5,"First of all amazing campus, I have met friends for life and i couldn't be happier.  I'm really grateful i had a school of this caliber available to me. I had a rough life during my high school years and I'm really glad to be given a second academic chance. If i do well hear I feel that i will be set up for success."
Freshman,5,"This campus is beyond beautiful. They provide many different services to the students including free counseling not only financially but, mentally. They also help you outside of the school by giving you discounts when riding the city bus, going to the movies for 5 dollars by using your school ID also able to give you discounts in other places located in Reno just by attending UNR. One of the many services they provide is called ""First in the Pack"" where any student that is the first one to attend college in their family gets to sign up for free counselling throughout their college experience. I found it also not that expensive for residence in Nevada, for me it was a little over 9,000 for one semester that includes me living in a dorm, classes and meal plan. They are very good at communicating with the students and makes every student feel welcomed when they attend."
Graduate Student,4,"The university has strived to keep the campus as safe as possible, (from personal experiences). The university has added new degrees and programs to its academic curriculum. The university is very diverse in their student population and actively work to make them feel welcome, although there have been a couple of incidents of racial problems.The university is expanding and has grown bigger over the past couple of years."
Freshman,4,"Due to the pandemic online instruction has been the main way of learning. While there have been some minor hiccups, for the most part the online learning aspect has been easy to understand and complete."
Freshman,4,Very helpful online experience. Will find everything you need. They are having multiple Zoom sessions where they answer any questions you might have which are great.
Freshman,4,Due to Covid I am taking a combination of online courses and in-person.  After the first week the online course stabilized and have been pretty good.  I do wish teachers would standardize on a single way to communicate with students as some email direct while others use tools provided by the university.
Freshman,4,"Overall, I have had a good experience.  The Covid situation has been hard, but the school has implemented steps to make everyone feel safe and provide for a solid education experience so far."
Senior,4,There is a really good support system for the math and writing courses. Having this was key to learning the upper level math  courses. Its also really  close to some awesome skiing locations as well as mountain biking areas.
Alum,4,"I loved the natural atmosphere and outdoor activities, however the school did not feel diverse enough. The housing expenses in the surrounding areas are expensive."
Alum,4,"I liked the online platforms. It made managing classes very easy. There were interactive videos, assignments, and reading that ensured the material was absorbed. As long as it wasn't a science class, it was managable."
Freshman,4,"So far, the experience has been pretty good. A couple of my teachers aren't the best with using their online tools to help set up the courses, but they are slowly getting the hang of it. The students are very willing to help with whatever task may need to be done. This experience has been very nice so far and I hope it continues to stay the same in the future."
Freshman,4,"I loved the diversity and the open-mindedness of the university, but I would also like to see more time and energy spent on the arts programs."
Freshman,4,"I didn't take any classes online, but I heard from other students that the programs were more than adequate."
Graduate Student,4,I took a few classes online throughout my undergrad to fast track my degree during the summer or allow more time for me to work in the spring and fall semesters. I would say it is obviously a lot of busy work and you are basically self teaching! If you learn best this way then I would 100% recommend it.
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoyed the University of Nevada because you get the feeling of a small town who loves their university, especially when it comes sports, while not feeling too trapped. There's so much to do in Reno and Tahoe is just around the corner. The university is absolutely what you make it! There's plenty of opportunities to meet new people through joining Greek life or various events on campus. For myself, I got to join the cheer team at UNR. This allowed me to be very involved in the universities athletic departments and meet amazing people on the way."
Alum,4,Due to COVID my last semester was moved to online and my professors did a wonderful job at keeping students engaged.
Senior,4,"There are many challenges for me with online learning. Unfortunately, it is just what we have to do at this time. That being said, my professors (for the most part)  have made incredible efforts to be available and to support students in any ways that they can."
Senior,4,UNR is a great school with lots of opportunities for everyone. Professors are always available to help when needed. Reno is a fun town too with lots of events going on so one is never bored.
Senior,4,"Professors really made everyone proud with being able to switch online so fast, of course, there were some bumps in the road, but overall it was a good experience."
Sophomore,4,"I like the university, I think they care a lot about their students, I do think the communication needs to be improved though. Such as informing students and better/faster replies Shen students email staff with question and information."
Sophomore,4,"I only took classes online because of Covid-19, and during the month or so that I did I hardly leaned anything. This isn't the fault of the professors, most of them made instructions clear but it was very difficult to transition and have the motivation to complete assignments from my home/over the computer."
Junior,4,"I mentioned this in the other post about the university experience as whole. But, the online learning experience with the university is very good. Given the circumstances, my online class for the summer was actually organized and I passed the class with an A. It was a condensed summer Calculus 2 course that lasted about 1 1/2 months. The teacher (Mr. Abegwali) was very knowledgeable and was always available to answer questions before, during, and after class. It's probably one of the best math courses I've ever taken! 
The online courses with the university are pretty good, and that is due in part with the teacher I had. I would recommend looking up the teacher and course before enrolling to see if would like it. There are a couple of websites available to look up the professors and schools. The one I use is Rate my Professor. Anyways, best of luck to anyone applying!"
Junior,4,"I've just enrolled into the University and have taken a summer class. Given our current events, I would say the classes are very organized and inclusive. The teacher I had was very knowledgeable and always asked/included everyone in the discussion. The university as a whole is great so far. I get regular updates from them and there are tons of activities, clubs, events, etc to be involved in! Though, if I were to see something change it's that I would to see some classes have the option to be put on online instead of in person. For myself, I live an hour away from the school and my up and coming schedule for the fall has me going there 3 times a week. It would be nice if some classes could be moved online for convenience. Though, I understand if some cannot be moved online.
Overall, it's a good school to go to and there are many majors to choose from!"
Senior,4,Most professors were very understanding in these unprecedented times and would provide as much help as needed and then some. Professors would always as if we feel that we are struggling to learn and how they could help improve their learning
Freshman,4,I personally love the atmosphere of the campus and the actual environment. The people there are caring and helpful.
Freshman,4,The professors are kind and are willing to try and help students out when possible just by contacting them.
Niche User,4,Most classes partially used online learning during the curriculum. Assignments were posted for out-of-class learning and submitted online in addition to in-class submissions.
Alum,4,"Online classes at the university of Nevada, Reno are set up so that the curriculum can be easily navigated. The professors are very clear about what is expected and make it easy to do well in their classes. The professors are available almost all day and get back with you quickly."
Alum,4,"The University of Nevada, Reno is a great school that offers many routes for education. I personally got both of my degrees in the scene field: a bachelors in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology and Molecular Microbiology and Immunology. The staff under both of these fields were very supportive, encouraging and engaging. They allowed me to build my skills in undergraduate laboratories which allowed me to gain knowledge and skills that put me above other candidates when applying for jobs in the science field. The University also loves to show appreciation for the students who attend their school and are more inclined to hire you after you graduate. Thanks to my opportunities with undergraduate research I am currently an affiliate with UNR and get to work in the Microbiology and Immunology department; where I am currently working on various diagnostic tests for emerging infection diseases all over the world."
Freshman,4,It was a rough year with the loss of the freshman dorms. I didn’t enjoy the alternate housing. It was too far from campus. I enjoy my classes and the campus itself.
Sophomore,4,"University of Nevada, Reno is a really good school and community to be a part of. I am a Public Health major and I love being a part of the College of Community Health Sciences. One thing I wish is that there were more CHS classes available, as it’s hard to get into some of them. But overall, I’ve gotten most of the classes I’ve wanted. I am involved in Greek Life and it gives me a sense of belonging that’s needed when making such a big transition into college. There’s so many options to help students on campus, such as tutoring center, math center, writing center, libraries, etc. I can’t wait to see where the next few years take me."
Junior,4,The University of Nevada-Reno is where I have found some of my best friends. I moved up to Reno to be apart of the Wolfpack for my next 4 years and it was the best decision I could have made. I am studying to major in Kinesiology to be a Physical Therapist.
Sophomore,4,"UNR is a great, affordable school. We have a great community and there are plenty of ways to get involved on campus. I wish we had better science (chem/physics) professors though."
Freshman,4,I love the campus and the atmosphere that I know is important for a lot of students. The professors and variety of classes offered are good as well.
Niche User,4,"UNR is getting better and better every year, but still can't shake off the ""B-tier state school"" vibe."
Junior,4,"The University of Nevada, Reno is a beautiful campus. Far more so than any other university of college I have had the priviledge of touring. My experience so far has been breath taking and I would not replace it for anything else. Campus-wide traditions and community involvement opportunities are what has made my college experience blossom."
Junior,4,"Food on campus is poor, some professors are great, some suck. Student life can be exciting. Love our sports, beautiful campus."
Sophomore,4,"Campus is open and accepting to new ideas. Great staff. Good DRC, bad food. Fun events, plenty of clubs"
Senior,4,"Coming from a community college, I can definitely say that university is a whole different ballgame. I like UNR, for the most part. Most of the professors are helpful and knowledgeable. Some are knowledgeable and not helpful, though. I would say my least favorite part about UNR is the advising. I didn’t find much help where academic advisement is concerned. Their knowledge seems to be minimal at best."
Niche User,4,"I like University of Reno, Nevada because the campus is so beautiful. The people are so nice, it close to home, and my major is is Sports Science and that school is the School of Medicine."
Senior,4,"Great school but you get what you put in so work hard. Like any investment, you have to have the time to make friends go to class and learn the material. you will only be as successful as the amount of effort you put in at this university no on will be holding your hand or making paths for you. With that said they have a lot of o support for students to be successful and get the most out of there time at this school."
Sophomore,4,"Personally I really enjoy UNR. So far I’ve had pretty decent professors with a few quirks here and there. Campus is beautiful and has many different spots where you can lay and just relax in nature, that is if weather permits. Sometimes it can get dangerous since it snows here and campus and roads become slippery. Campus Life is great! There are many clubs and organizations that range from a lot of things and I think it’s easy to find your place. I wish diversity was better especially since I came from a very diverse high school."
Junior,4,"The upside? Professors who care, a variety of classes to choose from, and an actively self-aware student body committed to being fair and benevolent to its students equally. The downside? They hate parking, and there aren't enough slots for many high-demand classes. Get in early, or get waitlisted."
Niche User,4,"My experience at the university was great, kind teachers, really good campus, delicious food and many more things.
It was a great experience."
Freshman,4,"I honestly love going to this school even though at first I thought that it wasn't going to be better than high school, it surprised me. The curriculum is understandable for majors and has a large variety of programs that appeal to all people of all backgrounds. Most of the professors are great and are well trained and the tuition is relatively affordable. The food and cafeterias at campus are a little underwhelming and could use a lot of work. This university gives you the tools you need to be successful with tutoring for all classes so you never fall behind. The books for many of the classes are expensive and the online system could also use some work. Overall this is a great college that is open to all people and cultures and offers a knowledgable and fun experience."
Freshman,4,"Recommend if you are in search of a diverse, and high graded educational experience.  I will be coming to this school in the near future but i have lived out here for 4 years going on 5 , and i can tell you this school is truly amazing in all fields."
Freshman,4,Overall the school has a lot to offer and give but at the same time a lot of things are over priced. And sometimes certain areas feel unsafe.
Freshman,4,"So far I am a freshman in the University of Nevada - Reno. I have loved being at this school. There are many clubs that allow me to express any interests I have, and many of the people here are great and make good friends."
Freshman,4,"For being the biggest little city in the world, Reno, Nevada has been my home away from home for the past year. Starting college I didn't think I would be able to connect as quickly as I did. With friendly staff and students, it was easy to create a place that I could call home. Joining clubs allowed me to have this opportunity. For a campus having a student body of roughly 18,000 undergraduate students I feel as if I see someone I know almost every other turn on campus. The only downside to the University of Nevada-Reno that I have seen so far is that the academic advisors constantly switch and are never the same, so it is hard to create a connection and feel as if someone is there trying to help you out."
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my coursework and my ability to get involved on campus through Greek life, sporting events, and clubs on campus."
Junior,4,"I like the diversity of this institution! So far I have seen it all from only visiting the campus a handful of times. I would like for there to be easier navigation with finding certain major requirements online such as the classes needed. It would also be useful to have more one-day visitor parking for a quick errand. However UNR has numerous study places, from inside and out, there will always be a spot for us to sit down and do our work. There are multiple food options as well and that is great!"
Sophomore,4,"Although I am only a sophomore at the University of Nevada, Reno I have had a pretty good experience at this school. There is a lot of student involvement and it helps that there are always a lot of events occurring on campus. I would like to see there be a change in the parking services because a lot of what is/isn't allowed is very unclear and confusing."
Freshman,4,"During my time at the University of Nevada, Reno I have found this campus to be extremely accepting and accommodating to every student, not to mention the facilities are well kept and accessible to all students. I also like that this campus has taken massive steps in the past few years to becoming ego friendly and fully sustainable. There is one thing I would change about the university- the University of Nevada, Reno needs a 24 hour study space equipped with a mini, late night snack bar and multiple computers available to all students, as currently they do not have a space like this."
Sophomore,4,UNR is a great college despite recent events that cause our own little community to look down on us.
Freshman,4,"Overall, I love the University of Nevada - Reno. Yes there are small, certain things I don't like about it, but most of the time everyone on campus is great and the campus in general is just great. The campus is huge and have many different architecture throughout. There's also a lot trees, flowers, and grass areas. I like that there are a lot events, so the students can interact, not just with each other, but with the school too. Academics seem to be pretty average for me and most of the people I know. The professors aren't that hard on you, but they do also push you to do your best. There are a lot of student services on campus, so if you need help with anything or just need someone to talk to there are services for that. The local people in Reno are also very nice and make living in Reno almost like home. University of Nevada - Reno is the college to go to if you're looking for a place that feels like a small town, but has a city vibe."
Niche User,4,The student life at The University of Nevada Reno is one that inspires communication between communities and has an atmosphere of friendliness and compassion. There is a wide variety of academic courses to be taken at UNR and each course has a skilled professor that is capable of interpreting information and distributing back to the class in any way that they can.
Niche User,4,"My experience about this University was great when I went to visit there for the UNR Bound Trip. I have already been accepted to this college and I've chosen to go here already starting Fall 2020. I was very overwhelmed with the college because everything looked so nice and pretty. I visited many buildings and I enjoyed the atmosphere of the environment. There was construction going on at the college, so I'm hoping to see the finishing touches when I'm attending the college the next school year. I'm pretty excited to be able to go to the gym because it looked very nice inside and outside. I've heard from many people that this university has a very good psychology program which is what I will study. So, it makes me even more excited to attend college. The food was also a lot more delicious than I thought it would be, if I might add. Overall, I think this is a good university that I think I will enjoy attending soon."
Freshman,4,I love that the university provides free tutoring and support systems that are easily available and accessible for students. The faculty and staff at the university are always very helpful and provide good instruction.
Sophomore,4,"The school is an overall good state school and has good academics. The sports are division 1 and fun to watch and the people are overall fun to talk to and be around. Overall, if you are looking for a cheap state school with a good education this school is for you. I also think the location is perfect with Tahoe around 30 mins away, there is always something to do and you never feel trapped on campus. Dorms are extremely nice and although dining could improve, it is not horrible at all."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far as a college freshman at this university has been very prestigious. Honestly, the atmosphere is very welcoming and diverse to me. There are so many interactive programs, clubs, and courses that I can venture into and enjoy myself. Not only that, the professors I had during my fall semester were very understanding and also made sure they gave me every tool to be successful in their class and outside of their class. Although there are so many positive aspects of this university, I would improve the transportation of buses, the announcements of activities on campus ahead of time instead of it being on the same day, and allowing students to have more various clubs at their disposal. Also, there is not a lot of diversity on this campus, and as an African American I can not find a lot of individuals of my ethnicity on this campus. Overall, I met many individuals that are similar to me and I can not wait to continue at this university."
Alum,4,"UNR provides equity to its applicants. I completed a Bachelor's in Chemistry. While the early curriculum was well-prepared, the advanced classes were left to the discretion of the professors and some of the labs were out-dated."
Freshman,4,I like how big and full of opportunity it is. There's always something to do. I just think it could use better organization and a clearer way to see everything going on at the school at one place
Junior,2,"This school is filled with bureaucratic shills, top to bottom. You find yourself surrounded by overconfident underachievers who settle for a mediocre education because it’s ten minutes from their parents house. It’s almost as if no one here as any real ambition to become greater versions of themselves or just to be better. After two years of attending this school, I’ve realized my two semesters at the community college, WNC, had better quality professors and overall education. Only good thing about this school is the campus itself, and the sports programs are above average, unlike the education you will receive here. The school’s rhetoric of being in the “Top 200” is clearly false and heavily biased and opinionated, yet it’s drilled into your throat as truth during orientation. If they claim a lie is true for long enough, people will believe them. It’s one of the cheapest universities on this side of the country and you get what you pay for."
Graduate Student,2,"I, unfortunately, am not very happy with the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR). I moved to Reno for a graduate program and quickly realized that UNR had many faults. The college atmosphere is not that of a traditional college town. UNR is separate from the Downtown Reno, creating an environment that is less than desirable. There's no sense of pride for the athletic teams, no traditional college bars, very few restaurants deliver or are open past 9pm, etc. Additionally, while professors may be qualified, they often lack personality and people skills. If these things are not important to you, then you may enjoy it here and the short distance to Lake Tahoe."
Junior,2,"OH MY, can you say construction? They are always building new dorms to bring new freshman. Oh and the construction workers take all the available parking that is rarely available in the first place. This school's priorities are in the glam. Building a gym worth 4.8 Million? But why would they spend that on hiring better professors or parking so students can actually get to class! The acceptance rate says it all."
College Freshman,2,"Greeks kick you out of parties, only accept girls."
College Junior,2,i don't think  there is much different between Greek and non-greeks ...
College Junior,2,There are some classes that have really good professors and that are just really good in general. But there are other classes that are terrible. Sometimes it's because you have no idea what the professor is saying. Other times they teach the material in a way that is impossible to understand. I've taken a few classes where I felt like it was designed to make you fail.
College Senior,2,its too expensive not affordable for 1st generation students
College Sophomore,2,"There's so much pressure to join, but it's expensive and time consuming. Also the parties are the most unsafe things ever: every year there's some sort of harassment from the fraternities."
College Freshman,2,I am having a terrible dorm experience.
College Freshman,2,"Although campus housing is convenient, it is SO ridiculously expensive!!!!! I am deep in debt due to campus housing and I wish it wasn't so expensive. Next semester I plan to move into an apartment."
College Junior,2,I just want to get out of here already.
College Freshman,2,"I stayed in Nye Hall, which was the only dorm to have doubles instead of triples this year. I was surprised that the entire floor was co-ed (boy room, girl room, boy room, etc.) instead of being seperated by floor or by wing. It wasn't a huge deal except for an awkward situation with a guy in another room on my floor. The bathrooms are still seperated by gender but they are right next to each other. The atmosphere was semi-social, but there weren't any floor or dorm events to help people get to know each other and it was difficult to meet people without that. My roommate situation was terrible and my RA didn't help at all, but with about a month left in the semester my roommate just stopped living in the dorm (she lived twenty minutes away from UNR) and I never saw her again. I feel like the dorms would be significantly better if there was an interest-based roommate matching system and more floor social events. I felt like it was a bad value for the price, especially since you have to pay for a meal plan even if you hardly use it, but it was handly to live so close to classes. I've heard some of the other dorms have better social atmospheres and UNR is building new dorms to accomadate everyone who wants to live in them."
College Freshman,2,There are too many homeless men around campus. I never walk anywhere alone.
College Sophomore,2,The student workers don't know what they are doing.
College Sophomore,2,"It is very hard to find somewhere to live off campus, but no one really likes to live on campus except for freshmen. Basically you can live somewhere super expensive (Sterling Sierra) or scary where you might get your car broken into."
College Junior,2,"The dining experience leaves a lot to be desired, from food to value. The food is mediocre everywhere, with the only real pleasures being in finding some food item that's only ""less bad"" than the thing you ate yesterday. The variety is terrible, with the same ingredients simply being reintroduced in a different order than the last week. Speaking from experience, the dining scene on-campus can best be described as such: ""Half-ass staff, using half-ass ingredients to make half-ass dishes for a half-assed dining experiences leads to a less than desirable on-campus food life.""

The only real relief comes from BoDawgs, the hot dog cart in a comfortable corner of campus. The fact is, they hire students to serve another independent company's product on campus, which makes it a landmark of both quality and value."
College Freshman,2,"Its horrible all the good off campus housing is either too far from campus or too expensive to live at. There is one apartment complex that's fair but its crowded and a long walk from campus. They need better off camps housing, this school is great but the dorms and housing availability hurts the students very much."
College Freshman,2,Most of the off-campus housing was put together really quick and its falling apart and then some are really expensive. And a negative side is you cant have pets.
College Junior,2,"There are many issues with sexual misconduct. Because of the go hard, party environment, many people get too drunk and make decisions they wouldn't have made otherwise. It has become such an issue that the school has had to send out emails to students explaining that you can not give consent if you are drunk or on drugs."
College Freshman,2,"Aside from federal government help, it's hard to get selected for any scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life tries to expand throughout the university, but I do not think they do a very good job at it.  If you are in Greek life, you tend to only hang out with people also in Greek life. They do not like expanding their horizons.  There are some well known chapters on campus.  The Greek housing situations are poor because they live in run down buildings that are really dirty and ugly."
Recent Alumnus,2,Most people are very rude and stuck up on campus. It  is hard to find good decent people.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The campus police emphasis on catching underage drinkers that are walking home is outrageous.  Walking is the safe option normally, but not near campus with the campus p.d. out for one purpose.  They almost make you feel safer driving intoxicated rather than chancing a mip or mic ticket."
College Junior,2,"Sadly, if you're looking for diversity on the campus of UNR, you've come to the wrong place."
College Freshman,2,"Reno weather is very unpredictable. In May it has hailed, in January it reaches 80 degrees. You just have to be ready for the weather and dress appropriately or have extra clothing on hand."
College Sophomore,2,Each student must take the classes required for the program and get the best grade possible. Then it's a matter of waiting and seeing if you made it high enough on the GPA list to get an interview and after the interview they let you know if you're in or not. It's really competitive and what I don't like is that you have to pretty much get an a in every class because if you don't then your chances of getting an interview are slim. It's really expensive too.
College Sophomore,2,"I live not to far from the school and I thought this would be a nice, quiet area but the students from my school never miss a chance to party. I've had drunk girls fight right outside my window in the middle of the night while I'm trying to sleep. It's not fun but I guess drinking is what some college students do. It's not my kind of scene though."
College Junior,2,"The student population is mostly diverse in sexual orientation, political beliefs, and economic background. Racial diversity is very low, with most of the population being of Caucasian and Asian heritage, and the religious diversity is not particularly noticeable. Being a middle-class white female basically puts me right in the middle of the largest group on campus."
College Freshman,2,"I live off campus so I don't have a meal plan, but when I get hungry on campus it's so obnoxiously overpriced that it becomes worth it to leave the campus area to go eat."
College Freshman,2,"the campus shuttle has a bad habit of bunching up and taking a very long time getting anywhere on the relatively small campus and there aren't enough shuttles running on the busy times of day, often times you have to wait through two shuttle arrivals to find one that has room."
College Freshman,2,The first week I was here there was a reported shooting on the street right outside my dorm.
College Freshman,2,"I already have to pay to live here, why do I need to pay for my car to live here too?"
College Freshman,2,"If you ever need to fill out the Dependent Verification Form, make sure you buy lots of ibuprofen"
College Freshman,2,"I'm not the party type of person. I prefer to travel, that is what I like to do."
College Freshman,2,Underage nightlife is out of control.  A great deal of underage drinking past the point of excessive.
College Freshman,2,"I have only seen our campus police during football games, never during school.  I am on campus 5 days a week and at all times of day.  It is especially nerve racking when class isn't out until after dark, and I have to walk across campus to get to my vehicle, or wait 30min for campus escort."
College Sophomore,2,A lot of the financial aid that you might quality for is first come first serve policy
College Sophomore,2,"If the sport is not the football team or the basketball team, then there probably are not many fans coming out to watch.  Other sports do not get any coverage or recognition at UNR."
College Junior,2,Most of the scholarships I apply for I don't obtain.
College Freshman,2,Its annoying hard to get people into dorms. RD are annoying as well
College Junior,2,Getting into classes and getting good advisement is difficult.
College Junior,2,I don't like FRAT boys or sorostitutes.
College Sophomore,2,It's too expensive and spots fill up quick!
College Sophomore,2,it was kind of confusing and there were too many questions that I was unsure of and had to go through a process to find the answer.
College Freshman,2,certain loans took forever to reach my account
College Sophomore,2,I feel as if the financial aid at our school is very picky. The school stopped doing the good neighbor application which I feel hurt a lot of people financially. I hope they can make some improvements to their financial aid and scholarship program for future students.
College Sophomore,2,"One of the hardest things about living in the dorms last year was because of the gross cafeteria food they offered. There were never any healthy options and I found myself eating cereal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner all the time. I think something the school could use some improvement in would be the food that they offer on campus. Its pretty gross! The only thing I do like were the flex dollars because I could use them at Starbucks!"
College Freshman,2,"The more notorious frats on campus have their reputations due to the prevalence of party drugs, but campus police don't really have the resources to go after the contenders. Date-rape drugs are also an issue, as they are at virtually all US universities and colleges, but I feel that it's just as bad everywhere else. In terms of policies, again - there aren't enough resources to really enforce laws about underage drinking unless the inebriated person is being a public disturbance."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus and dorms are far too concerned with students behavior. Students struggle to enjoy themselves in dorms such as Argenta. Also, the parking is too strict and overpriced. "
College Sophomore,2,The only affordable parking is fairly far away from classes. I have to ride the campus bus each day in order to comfortably reach my classes in a timely manner. 
College Junior,2,The local weather during the school year is usually pretty cold which can make walks to campus miserable at times.
College Junior,2,"I feel unsafe on campus at night and sometimes just when I am walking alone. Due to multiple assaults on women on campus by non-students, I feel that my personal safety is at risk. There are emergency poles in some places but they don't seem to reassure students must. Police will come when called, but other than that you never really see them. The best campus safety effort is made through Campus Escort which will give you rides for free but they take so long to arrive to pick you up that it is usually easier just to take the risk and walk."
College Freshman,2,The wifi sucks. Don't even try to use it because everybody and their printer is using it and you won't get any of it. Bring an ethernet cable or you're screwed. 
College Freshman,2,The cost I feel is outrageous. 
College Freshman,2,"If you go greek, most people drink and there are always parties going on"
College Freshman,2,"There is a shuttle bus that goes around campus, but that's on campus. The buses that go to the school cost money and gets very expensive after a while. "
College Freshman,2,"These building are very old. They have done some remolding, but they should aim the money elsewhere. The dorms are being monitored, bust the insides are usually trashy depending on the persons."
College Freshman,2,"Students usually hang out at the library and study centers, where they study and use computers. I don't find any of the other places very interesting or fun because they are freakishly expensive."
College Freshman,2,"Some students walk into class high or drunk. There really isn't any enforcement and teacher don't do anything about it. I guess it depends on oneself, what they do doesn't matter to the other party. I have seen many people drinking alcohol on campus and doing drugs."
College Freshman,2,"I have tried getting financial aid, but I always get rejected. Sure, there are ways to get financial aid and I've tried and have been unsuccessful so far. It makes me think how I'm going to pay for school."
Freshman,1,"I hated this school. If you don't join a sorority or fraternity you are completely left out. The campus is very hilly and can often get annoying and slippery when walking around. I came from out of state and unless you join sorority or fraternity it was very hard to make friends. The frats and sororities aren't even included with the school, and are very expensive. tution expense is not worth the school at all. there is nothing to do there on the weekends except party, so if that is your scene this is the place for you. Do not go downtown unless you have a car. No parks are available. Not a very friendly looking environment. Don't recommended."
Freshman,1,"While UNR is an okay school, their handling of their students in response to the COVID-19 outbreak has been horrible. Most colleges right now are partially refunding its students for making them move our of housing, even UNLV.  Meanwhile UNR sends us emails reminding us that we have signed semester or yearlong contracts and are therefore uneligible to get refunded even though we are being evicted. To me this shows their lack of care for their students -- they just care about their money.  If I were a high school student I would look at how colleges are handling this situation as it truly indicative of how much colleges will care for you. UNR has disappointed me."
Senior,1,"As a student from the bay area, I made a terrible choice transferring out of the CSU system to here. The school spends way too much on new buildings when the old ones are fine. Academic support services are extremely limited for students struggling in classes, and due to the number of students, professors don't spend as much time for students in need.

Also with diversity, the university doesn't take the wishes of students of color seriously. We get some very nice emails each time an incident happens, however, there is no action taken. We have a student who marched with white supremacists working with campus escort and a police officer who openly wore a racist costume. 

Thinking this institution was more superior than my former CSU campus, I was dead wrong. I would've gotten much more out of my education if I stayed there."
Senior,1,"I made a very poor choice coming here. I am from the Bay Area and I came to UNR thinking that it would be a cheaper alternative to the UC's of California. I could not have been more wrong. When you come to visit, the campus looks really great and they have a new state of the art gym. Don't get me wrong that is super cool. However, what I ignorantly did not take into consideration when I was looking at this school, was the surrounding area. Reno is an absolutely disgusting city and the people here are awful. The dorms are terrible and the food is even worse. The social scene here is really terrible. The Greek life is in shambles and parties are dumpy and are not usually very fun. Outside of the parties, activities are limited. The school puts on very few student events. All in all I wish I could say I enjoyed my time at UNR, but that is far from the truth."
College Sophomore,1,So many students walk into class smelling like weed or I walk by several students smoking cigarettes. I think some students only because they think it is cool and they are peer pressured into doing so. It is mainly enforced on campus and in the dorms and for athletes if an athlete is caught their career is over. That all goes for the same with alcohol
College Student,1,"We haven't had hot water for almost a week. Some students complain about their ceilings leaking and mold. I do not enjoy my time in the dorms. I don't recall listing a 3 person room as one of my options but that's what I ended up with. Living on campus for WUE shouldn't be a requirement. They are packed full of people, very little space."
College Student,1,I don't care for things like this. I don't understand why you should have to pay to be apart of something.
College Freshman,1,I got nothing at all and I am a deans list student
College Freshman,1,its so hard to get help besides websites and nearly impossible to find local scholarships.
College Sophomore,1,It isn't the greatest there is much debate about the ongoing academic
Recent Alumnus,1,This is one of the worst schools I have ever attended. If I could have afforded out of state tuition I would be going somewhere else!
College Junior,1,"Getting money from UNR is like pulling teeth. Freshman year was easier because I qualified for scholarships based off of my high school  grades, but UNR never told me that those scholarships only lasted two years and then after that I was on my own. My parents having a single income for a year and going into debt just to keep going got me some money sophomore year, but only after I had to drag up every financial document I have ever owned and resubmitted my applications multiple times. Tips for getting financial aid; go completely broke and apply for the FAFSA and maybe you'll get lucky. Otherwise, you're on your own."
College Freshman,1,"the financial aid at this school is absolutely terrible in my experience, the computer system in my county crashed so my transcripts came in and the school refused to take that into consideration for the achievement based scholarship packs apart from the millennium I got no financial aid and had to do everything through loans. this school is god awful for financial aid."
College Freshman,1,during most the year the weather in reno is very cold which makes having classes in different building absolutely miserable
College Sophomore,1,I hate how much money goes to them
College Sophomore,1,"I've never applied at the university but was informed because I have to many ""W"" was not eligible for it."
College Freshman,1,There is a bunch of racism here
College Freshman,1,"They are based off of only financial need of your parents, rather than your financial needs. "
College Freshman,1,"Very difficult to find a parking spot if you do not arrive early. Wish they will put a good deal of the money adding another parking lot. The costs are ridiculous, they are like 200 bucks for a pass depending where you park. The enforcement is very strict and don't assume that they will not check. They know all the parking tricks and are on cars 24/7, so much it's scary."
College Freshman,1,"Oh boy! Where do I start? My campus is very strict with parking, and it's very difficult to find a parking spot. Patrols are away around with a scanner making sure you are allowed to park there or face the ticket. A typical car pass is about 200 bucks that's more than an average university and it's not usually that close to campus. They need to build another parking lot and lower the cost. "
College Freshman,1,"Reno is disgusting. I hate the down town area, it is scary and does not compare to Vegas. "
College Freshman,1,"Overly strict on ticketing, prices for permit outrageous. "
College Sophomore,1,"The places to eat on campus are not good at all. They are not very healthy, there is very little variety, the quality is very poor, and there is not a ton of variety. Its a very fast food feeling selection."
College Junior,1,First off it's extremely expensive to buy a parking pass. The meters are expensive and good luck finding a spot even if you do have a pass. It is terrible and not worth the expense to buy a parking pass.
College Sophomore,1,"I am not in Sorority so I am not sure what they do, but they aren't very involved with campus events, when they are they are unorganized or cost money. Greeks just party at my school and are pretty obnoxious."
College Sophomore,1,"There's almost no diversity, the majority of the students and teachers are of Caucasian descent. :/"
College Sophomore,1,"UNR sucks at giving scholarships. I have applied for many and my grades are good, but I have never received any aid from the school."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus is pretty strict on drinking anywhere in or around campus. In the dorms there are rules which warn those that decide to drink and if they do receive punishment, such as expulsion. Another strictness is parking. Parking regulation is really strict and on point on campus. If you do not have a permit, then don' park there! The most important strictness is making your tuition payments on time. If they are not on time then you will receive a penalty fee, which hurts students."
College Junior,1,Pleanty of parking but its extremely expensive and requires multiple different colored permits. A real nightmare for new students. The parking garages are far enough from class that it makes more sense to park on the distant non-permit streets or Circus Circus and save yourself the ridiculous permit costs.
College Freshman,1,I always hear about things happening to people and nobody was around to help.
College Sophomore,1,"The parking situation at school is terrible. If you want a good spot to park in, you have to be there at lease an hour before class and before everybody else has class. The parking permits are very expensive. However, do not try to beat the system because the parking security is very good at their job. Trust me, I've had plenty of tickets. The only thing that is keeping the parking grade from being an ""F"" is the motorcycle parking. The permit is way cheaper, the parking spots are much friendlier (smack-dab in the middle of campus), and you can always find a spot. But not everyone rides motorcycles."
College Freshman,1,"There are a ton of parking lots all over campus, but students are only allowed to get a permit in the North Parking lots. The problem with this is that the North lot is out on the far end of campus all by itself, and all of the classes are at least a half a mile away on the south end of campus. It is extremely inconvenient."
College Freshman,1,The campus is nice but once you step off campus all you see is nasty streets that people walk on to get to the next casio to lose all their money. The shoping places are nothing but rags on a hanger not worth my money unless you go to the mall.
College Freshman,1,"The nightlife for students 21 and older that goes to night clubs and bars and the 18 and older crowd who gets into clubs and house parties are just wasting their time becuase its not worth getting drunk and acting a fool; those things are not fun anyway. on campus parties that they have are boring to, no point of even leaving your dorm room."
College Sophomore,1,"The university cops are more than strict. They are bullies. They pull everyone walking over (which has increased the number of students drinking and driving) and they falsify their police reports to make it justified. If you are a young girl walking along and you are attractive, a lot of cops will stop you just to harass you. I have personally ridden along with a cop at the university and he has point blank told me that many of the cops scout out hot girls to pull over and talk to. Also, they let many people go because they're hot and write MICs to people who have a .02 if they're not. Its completely based on the cop and his attraction or entertainment value at the time. The women cops are just bitter and so they tend to write MICs to everyone as a way of trying to gain respect as a law enforcement officer. They're are a lot of harassment crimes that happen on or near campus that are not stopped because the entire university focuses on writing $700 tickets for MICs."
College Freshman,1,"Campus dining is the one thing I hate about UNR. Your first week you'll love it and it'll seem as if you have endless possibilities. One month into the semester, however, and you realize how poor quality the food is (the majority is fried) and how there is very little variety. To make things worse- the dining hall pass is overpriced but if it's your first-year and you're under 20 (which everyone is) you are forced to buy one.

Once I asked for sun butter and I was told by multiple workers that they either had none or did not know what that was when there is a sign right over the peanut butter and throughout the tables claiming they have sun butter available if you request it."
College Freshman,1,"Even if you pay for parking on campus, when it comes to big events such as football campus it is nearly impossible to find a parking spot."
College Sophomore,1,HUGE cost for little benefit. Almost no spots available close to classes.
College Freshman,1,Parking could be filled very quickly at all times of the day. Get to the campus early and get your spot.
College Sophomore,1,Stay on top of their every move they will mess up.
College Freshman,1,"it freaking sucks. I got a $400 parking pass because it was ""the best"" but it only allows parking in certain areas after 5, which is dumb. I have gotten $120 worth of tickets.

College Freshman,1,"I don't even have a car but it is still an issue for me. My friends and I have to walk way too far to get to the parking structures where the vehicles reside. The payment for them is absolutely ridiculous and unfair in my opinion. If you can afford the parking, go far it, but I would find another means of transportation such as a skateboard, scooter, moped, etc."
College Freshman,1,The campus police are really only strict on underage drinking and parking violations. Otherwise you can get away with a lot.
College Freshman,1,You can go into a class and the weather will be perfect and when you come out it can be snowing. Here at UNR the weather is very unpredictable.
College Freshman,1,"They are very strict about drug use, but many of the RA's dont really care about underage drinking and as long as its done quietly no one cares."
College Senior,1,"I applied for financial aid through FAFSA and received nothing.  I left 2 voicemails  at the financial aid office, and never received a call back.  Not impressed."
College Junior,1,Occation Crowds and Mechanical Problems – On occasion I have found finding an open computer difficult during the beginning of the year and testing times. The printers could be a bit updated not being able to print can become very inconvenient. On a few occasions I have needed to print a paper or article before class and have had to travel to various building looking for a printer that is working and a building that is open to do so at.
College Junior,1,"Recently, the University of Nevada, Reno released a newspaper article about how they are trying to get students to be proactive and want to weed out lazy students. However, I applied in the beginning of June and still cannot sign up for classes. No one seems to want to do their jobs. When I ask how long things will take, the standard response I receive is 'it depends'. My financial aid adviser has been on vacation for two weeks and isn't expected back until the week before classes start, how convenient!"
College Sophomore,1,"For one semester, it cost me well over $100 to park in a parking lot on the complete opposite side of campus. It was a very long walk back to my dorm and that long walk is unsafe after it gets dark. The Campus Escort service is basically mandatory to stay safe at night just to get from my car to my dorm room. The parking at UNR could be way cheaper and much better."
College Freshman,1,"Not only is there not very many parking spaces, parking costs 4,000 U.S. Dollars every year. My grant for housing would cover just my parking. If it were convenient I would understand the price, but it's just not."
College Junior,1,Lots of the Same Kinds of Students – I noticed a lot of white students on campus. THere did not seem to be much diversity.
College Sophomore,1,"Processed Crap – I've gotten sick eating the pizza and other types of food there. The selection looks good and there is variety, but as far as quality I always went back to my apartment to eat. Coffee shops are convenient and good though."
College Sophomore,1,"The title says it all. You're looking at several hunderd dollars a year to get a permit to a spot on the edge of the campus, 20 minutes walk from your class. There are shuttles that run but I have waited up to 25 minutes for one.

The most convienet parking is in front of the library and is metered - a quarter for 10 minutes. It is often blocked off when there are special events, which is alot. 

The second your meter rund out you will get a ticket - they really enforce."
College Freshman,1,"Sometimes a Nightmare – First off, I gave this a D because the prices for passes are ridiculous! $400 for a semester! I think it should be about $50. Another terrible thing about this school's parking is that if you have stadium parking, you have to park at the far end of campus. They have shuttles, but still, they are usually unpleasant to use."
College Freshman,1,"Permit Costs/Ticketing and Fines – Ok- This is a serious issue. Permits are expensive and if you accidentally park somewhere not specific to your permit, you'll recieve a fine. If you do this a few times, possibly because it takes you a while to really understand the parking system, it can really add up. Not that I'm speaking from experience or anything... Put it this way, parking at UNR is a system that could use a fair amount of revision."
College Junior,1,"I hate the parking in the university. The passes are overly priced, and in my opinion, the parking should be free because tuition itself is a lot for broke student like me. I park outside campus and walk to my classes. I need to be at least 45 mins early than I have to but it's a small price to pay."
College Sophomore,1,Way to Strict – Campus is way to concerned with the students personal habits. Dont try to kick them off campus for every offense that happens.
College Sophomore,1,"One of my biggest complaints about UNR is their Greek system.  The members of sororities on campus act superior to other students and are very stereotypical.  While most of the fraternities are full of laid-back, smart, fun-loving guys, the sororities are the complete opposite.  Steer clear."
College Freshman,1,There is no such thing as close parking on campus. The people that watch the meters are complete jerks. Parking spots are narrow. Parking off campus is better and FREE.
College Freshman,1,"Good Luck – Parking at the University is very difficult. If you don't buy the four hundred dollar parking pass, you better get to the campus about 45 minutes before your class just in case!"

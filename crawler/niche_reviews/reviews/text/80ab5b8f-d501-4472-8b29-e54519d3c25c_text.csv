Overall, South Texas College was a great experience."
Graduate Student,5,"I took two online classes in order to get my associates degree. Both classes were amazing and took around the same effort a traditional class would require in terms of getting a high grade. However, in order to learn in an online class you must commit to it. Since all the information is accessed through the STC portal, you will have to be constantly checking for new assignments/messages. You will also have to make sure you are keeping up with the textbook/online book if you want to learn. Overall, an online class requires a higher student motivation and organizational skills that if you are willing to obtain will reward you with a perfect learning experience."

Junior,5,"My experience in South texas college has been amazing! The classes that I took throughout the time in South Texas College have fascinated me to earn my degree in criminal justice at the end of my last semester I mastered the ability and skills acknowledge at the end of this road trip. Therefore, I thank and appreciate all my professors at South Texas College for teaching me the skills I needed for my future career in the criminal justice department."
Sophomore,5,It was awesome. So close to home and professors really care. The cost of a great education is invaluable due to location.
Sophomore,5,The campus is great and offers a midValley Campus also. This allows commuting to and from home from anywhere in the Rio Grande Valley easy.
Junior,5,"My online experience with classes has been an amazing experience to say the least. I am so thankful that online classes are offered because I am able to work them into my busy schedule. Working and being a new mommy makes life a little challenging at the moment so online classes are perfect for me.

Niche User,5,"I love South Texas college they’re very helping within the situation of the coronavirus and have been every since I started the semester. They help me find the assignments for the week in a folder so I won’t be going crazy to see what’s needed to be submitted. They’re very organized and willing to help if needed , whether it being a question or help with an extension due to personal issues. A big plus is that their staff is super nice and the teachers teach spectacular and what’s needed to learn no like some teachers who don’t vent teach the tested material.

I love the hispanic family culture that it embraces, its wonderful to have such a good education close to home."
Alum,5,"Very good college to get your associates degree. It's very inexpensive, and the classes are taught by knowledgeable and professional instructors. The campus is not very big, therefore it is not full of things to do all of the time, but it more than makes up for it by having all of the resources necessary to successfully learn and progress in school. Plus, it isn't far from the city center, so even if there's not much to do at school, there are plenty of extracurricular opportunities around town."
Junior,5,its a good campus with several opportunities. it has a good student to teacher ratio and many events
Junior,5,I don't think I would like to see anything change the college is wonderful college and professors are helpful and access to tutors and computers is easy access and there's always someone to assist if you have any questions.
Senior,5,"The reason I choose and decided to go to South Texas College is because I want to get used to college if I try to attend a college campus. Being at college campus would be my first time to attend, but I'll get lost easily. However, I want to study animation and try participate a club that I'm interested since my parents wants me to have a normal life in college. I hope that the college I've chosen would make me feel satisfied, but nervous at the same time."
Niche User,5,resources available are excellent! professors are amazing and are very helpful. overall experience was great
Freshman,5,"Overall, a great college. I have learned a lot. Teachers are great and people is friendly. At the beginning it is kind of hard to adapt to the system ( being international), but you will get used to it  very easily. Every staff member from the college is very kind and really helpful."
Senior,5,As a student in south Texas college as well as in high school I have experienced excellent selection in terms of academics. There are many classes with many different professors that provide good grading and good class lecture. Yet one thing that isn't as high in the scale is the diversity since were all the same in the same area but its a good school.
Freshman,5,It's a really nice and big college. Everyone is very friendly and nice. It has many activities that you can get in and my favorite thing to be there is to go to the library. It looks really comfy and I really love and enjoy reading books. I like how you don't have to live in the campus and classes aren't everyday. Classes from South Texas College are also cheaper. If you were to compare the cost to another college or University you'll find out how the cost is much better.
Niche User,5,"To say this institution is great is an understatement; they provide quality education at an affordable price. By providing easily accessible tuition and great service, they give hope to those aspiring to fulfill their academic dream."
Freshman,5,"My experience in South Texas college was very welcoming from the first day. The hallways had staff ready to help the new students locate their classes and find their correct building. Pecan has multiple buildings each within walking distance, other buildings are not as convenient and vending machines located in almost every building. The first day of classes it might be ""full"" but as the weeks go by the number of students will slowly decrease and their is an option of online classes, a wide selection of majors. The cafeteria also provides wide selection of food providing salads all the way to pizza and beverages ( coke, coffee, ect.). The cafeteria is  a building of itself, having indoor and outdoor seats. The thing I would change would be the building because it's hard to find a class that's close to your next/ previous building without the need of rushing to your next class."
Sophomore,5,I love the experience that south texas college provides and there are so many professors who you can tell really care about their students learning the material!
Graduate Student,5,"I recently graduated from South Texas College and my experience at this campus was amazing. All of the staff are very welcoming and helpful. Throughout my two years, the professors that I got where very knowledgeable and prepared me for the next step in my academic career."

Freshman,5,South Texas College has a variety of degree choices to choose from. They do however need improvements on some professors.

They help you with whatever issue you may have and try to give you the best advice as possible.

Sophomore,4,"I have little experience with South Texas College but i do know that it is a warm atmosphere once you walk in to the building. It is an open campus with easy to find buildings and people willing to help you in case your lost. Here in South Texas people are warm and friendly and always willing to help each other out. You will feel at home once you get comfortable knowing your professors and students in your class. 
South Texas College isn't a huge campus but it is a good thing so you wont feel lost trying to find a class. There are tons of resources to help you on and off campus."

Sophomore,4,"South Texas College is a great school. The buildings are amazing, the outside is great, the staff is available at all times. I never had any trouble in school regarding locating classes or staff availability. The people are very welcoming and always willing to help and assist you with anything you may need help with. I can honestly say that every professor that I have taken has either made me learn something new or has helped me improve my studying skills. A huge tip I'm going to give is to always listen to the teacher when he or she is lecturing they always have something important that they will repeat over and over. 
I have enjoyed the college experience and I'm almost done. Is a great place to learn and begin your college education safe and easy access to the city. Hopefully, in a few more years, the college becomes and University."

Online advisors are available, the only library is also available at all times, and is you need to purchase any textbooks you will be able to rent or purchase electronically.

Niche User,4,"The professors are very professional, yet understanding. It's nice to know that you have someone there for you doing their job and helping you through a new time, while still considering you're well being as a whole. Not to mention the campus itself. The campus alone is easy on the eyes, and simple to get around. The classes are at a very compliant pace which makes it easy to cool down when possible."
Sophomore,4,"I took some online classes. They were pretty decent, although most were from inexperienced professors. Hopefully, that will change now that more time has passed."
Sophomore,4,"The experience was pretty good. The school wasn't that hard, as expected from a community college. Overall, there are many good teachers, you just have to search them."
Sophomore,4,"In general, I liked how respectful and ,usually, direct professors are in the expectations in succeeding in courses, and I also liked how professors included active phone number, not personal phone numbers, as a way to immediately contact them. One aspect I would change or promote is a way to video call through blackboard versus students and professors having to communicate with each other on either or not an outside video chatting service works for them."
Sophomore,4,"What I liked from South Texas College is the amount of resources from free access to 30+ databases to the amount of courses, including minimesters, offered in the Spring, Fall, and Summer semesters. The only change I would like to see in the South Texas College is to link personal emails to a student's Blackboard notifications. Other than that, South Texas College is perfect for saving money on a Interdisciplinary Studies Associate's and a safe environment for both dual high school students and STC students such as having a security officer escorting students across busy main streets such as Pecan at all hours STC is operating."
Freshman,4,The online experience was good. It was easy to access and complete work. Professors also made it easy to contact them.
Graduate Student,4,The classes I took in STC as part of an early college high school all i can say is that stc seems like a real legit way of obtaining a higher education. it might not be a four year college but  the courses it offers arent expensive and they transfer to most other colleges in Texas. so its a grate option if you want to save some money before going to a four year college.
Freshman,4,I enjoy the fact that South Texas College is very helpful in a number of ways towards students no matter what the problem or situation is.
Freshman,4,"The teachers are very helpful. I do not have much to complain about other than their buses that transfer us between campuses, you can feel the bumps and the weight of the vehicle with every turn, and it is a little bit of an inconvenience on my back, since I had went through spinal surgery August 2019. Other than that, the college is great."
Niche User,4,The experience I have had in South Texas College's Dual Enrollment program has been to amazing and easy. The classes are simple to sign up for and the professors I have are great.

There are a lot of resources available to you and plenty of study room for you and your classmates to get together. It's a great school with many opportunities and plenty of help.
Sophomore,4,"I am in my second year of college here at STC and it has been great. My first year I was a nervous wreck, I was lost as to where everything was but the staff here was quick to guide me and so were some of the students here. 
I chose this college because it was closest to my home and because I wanted to save money by taking my basics here. And I don't regret it. 
The food isn't as great as I thought it would be but I'm not one to complain, food is food. 
Overall it  has been a great experience."
Niche User,4,It is very simple to get around. There are many staff members and tools available and willing to get students up to speed to have a smooth experience.

It is good to know that this college is expanding and becoming a great institution for the community in the Rio Grande Valley. STC does also provide dual-enrollment for high schools nearby. Hopefully more people are able to see just what a fine symbol of education after high school this place really is. Even if it is just for basics to transfer to a university. I’m sure as time goes by STC will be able to offer more for future students.
Freshman,4,It is a very small campus so there's really no way to get lost. All buildings are kept very clean and teachers are very great!
Sophomore,4,"It is a very friendly campus, has many activities and clubs you can be apart of. The professors were mostly very helpful and always tried to help in any way possible. Small classes which helped allowed students to learn better in a smaller enviroment."
Junior,4,"South Texas College is a nice and affordable four-year college.  For the past four years, I have been attending the college and I can say personally that I have loved it. The staff, professors, and even the students will go out of their way to help you. Everyone's really friendly and not a stranger. Overall, It's a very good school with great professors. I would highly recommend South Texas College to anyone I meet because of the amazing and unique opportunities they offer at the college."
Sophomore,4,Having the opportunity to earn an associates degree before graduating from high school is what I like about South Texas College. Highly recommend if you want to further educate yourself!
Niche User,4,"This college is amazing for young students trying to get their feet wet in the college life past high school. For me I am currently a high school senior that has been taking dual classes with South Texas College. This has been a helpful opportunity in allowing me to gain college hours and experience. I would recommend other high school juniors and seniors to do the same because it can help you in the long run. For example, when I enroll to South Texas College I will almost have all the credits to be a sophomore. This saved me time and money. Would totally rate this college 10/10 !!! I love it !!!"
Niche User,4,"There are many help to reach out, many people that are willing to help you and tutor you. When i needed help with my homework there were people tutoring all the time and they helped me pass my class with Chemistry. The food is very good and affortable with combos."
Senior,4,"In my opinion, STC was a good college to start off instead of a big college. The only issue I had is with new professors, not all, would go unprepared or expecting too much in too little time. None the less, my overall experience was a memorable time period of my life time."
Niche User,4,"South Texas College overall has a very friendly and unified atmosphere. The students are not in any danger at the campus since it is located in a safe area. The professors in the college are very respectful and will help any student in need. The Supplemental Instructor program is also a great help in helping students with their academics. In addition, the classes are not that difficult, and when one graduates from STC they do not have much debt to pay off."
Niche User,4,its a pretty good school because many people that i know have graduated from this school. The programs that this school has are amazing because many people find them helpful.
Niche User,4,Dual enrollment is very easy and clear cut. Everyone is very kind and helpful with any questions or technical difficulties.
Sophomore,4,"In overall South Texas College is a nice diverse college that has good student resources which are a Center Of Learning Excellence and a good library for references.I like that all professors  from the college strive their best to help their students.I’ll be a nice thing to create a center opened for the public for all ages that involve doing STEM hands on activities to encourage children adults to pursue their goals in joining the medial engineering, technology field."
Sophomore,4,"Great school to begin your college education or complete your degree. Wide variety of degree programs to choose from. Parking is a bit of a hassle at the Pecan Campus(main campus), but there are shuttles if you have to park far away."
Freshman,4,"This college is good, especially when it comes with helping students with setting their classes schedules. The counselors are helpful and also find ways of helping students with disabilities. Professors are not all the same, since they can be very passion on what they teach, and students learn from them (not all of them are the same). Students have access to computers in case they do not have or have issues with their own. There is tutoring available in this campus that can help students with their basic subjects (math, reading, writing/essay, and science). This college also added the music program, since before there wasn’t any."
Sophomore,4,"It is a wonderful community college where you can easily save money, the proffesors are there to help you with whatever you need, an associates degree is accessable, the books and materials are easy to grasp, and there are online classes besides physical classrooms which has helped me a lot since I take classes in the summer when I'm out of the state."
Freshman,4,South Texas College has a very competitive nursing program that really pushes their students to work harder. I would change the format of how their student loans are made.
Niche User,4,"I have taken college courses from this College while simultaneously attending high school. There have been some hiccups along the way, but overall the experience it’s offered me has been useful to know how it will be should I decide to attend college elsewhere. It has shown no mercy and has pushed me to learn what my limits have been so far."
Junior,4,What I enjoyed most about South Texas College was the campus itself. I enjoy walking around. Most of the buildings are brand new and very nice. The staff is also very supportive and want nothing but success from their students.

Niche User,4,its very friendly and the professors are  understanding  when it comes to certain situations and the classes are easy to mildly hard. students usually tend to hang out with people they know and others make it a point to interact with new people. the student activities center usually had an event going on once a week if not every other week.
Freshman,4,Teachers and staff make you feel really comfortable. Studying at STC gives you so many chances to do work. It is a big advantage.
Freshman,4,Classes aren't huge which makes learning much better and gives easier access to professors. Plenty of caring professors that make class exciting. Not a whole lot to do on campus but in a fairly eventful city.
Niche User,4,"While attending STC, I found the environment to be quite festive and aspiring for me. I loved how the teachers that work at the college were very good at their job, and how they offered plenty of good tips when it came to getting around the campus. I also found that the help that is offered at their Centers for Learning Excellence is very helpful because they offer plenty of options for any type of help that you may need, as well as how they notify you on new changes to the schedule, and send reminders when you are one on one with a tutor. I also appreciate how at STC they also have help available online with tutors that are in other states 24/7 so that you can get help at any time or day when you aren't able to come in person."
Sophomore,4,The South Texas college campus is very safe and secure for students who want to focus on studying. Professors are willing to help their students understand the concept.
Junior,4,In the past attendance the teachers were very informative and accessible to students. I would like for the school to offer  other student loans besides the only two available now.
Freshman,4,It was my first time goint to collage and i was lost i  didn’t  no where to go or are you asking people where are my classes  now is my second semester and.  And I know know my classes where they are what time I’m starting to like college I’m thinking to study other careers
Niche User,4,I love the opportunities that STC offer at very affordable prices. The people at the CLE are wonderful and always offer help and improve my understanding on the subjects. The clubs there are also amazing.
Freshman,4,I'm currently taking a accounting dual class in high school and my fall semester  has been going amazing thanks to STC!
Sophomore,4,I really like the fact that the classes are small and the professor's get to work more one on one with you
Niche User,4,A school to get into other schools. That is the type of what I would define this school as. Sure it is definitely not the lap of luxury you can see in others but besides that it is a very good school. Professors are mostly nice and all.
Sophomore,4,"I like the affordable price. Even though I do plan to transfer later on, graduating from South Texas College with my associate degree was an amazing decision I took. It saved me an unimaginable amount of money. Those savings  you cannot get anywhere else. The professionals are truly that, professionals. Put one from Harvard and South Texas College next to each other, you won’t tell the difference. The campus is great because it breaks up into specific buildings which makes it fool-proof to get lost. I 100% recommend this school for anyone trying to save money but still get a degree of their and start their career."
Niche User,4,"Im glad I had the opportunity to be enrolled at STC, the environment is great and the teachers are as well. There are a lot of opportunities and activities going on there that can be of great help educationally or socially."
Niche User,2,"South Texas College is a good place for students in the Rio Grande Valley to take the first step in continuing their education by gaining easier access to their basics at an affordable cost. However, I would like to see a growth in the college so that it can keep providing an endless amount of learning growth and social advancement for the Rio Grande Valley."
College Senior,2,There is no assistance when it comes to planning a post graduation career.
College Senior,2,Every degree is equal in value. STC doesn't offer any career assistance after graduation though.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Nothing so far, you pay for the class, and they hand you a degree and you are on you own. It is bad"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Well, one major issue about South Texas College, is that there is no such employer/student network. After earning a degree students are basically on their own without assistants from the college looking to join a job based on their career of choice."
Recent Alumnus,2,"For the past two years I have been a music major for South Texas College.Ultimately during the last two semesters I have grow to dislike the program mostly because it is too repetitive, everyone is taught the same material semester after semester. I still remember the last months before changing majors, I felt displeased."
College Junior,2,they dont have the classes that i need to take
College Senior,2,"I really did not like online courses, they are not the same as classroom experience. Professors basically just submit a syllabus and expects you to do everything on time. Sometimes when you try to contact the professors they respond really late, and test are sometimes timed, it just horrible."
College Junior,2,"I like this college because it is easy to move around. There are great teachers that show us a lot. My favorite experience is being independent and not slacking because there is not playing around with due dates.i would chose this school again, because i love everything it offers."
College Freshman,2,"This school doesn't offer a large amount of Bachelor's degrees, there are only 4."
College Freshman,2,they said I can not get financial aid because I have B1/B2 Visa
College Senior,2,"I had a difficult time with financial aid, I have been paying my classes, books and supporting myself throughout my undergraduate courses, it is difficult."
College Sophomore,2,There is not really anything unique about this school. It's very small and students usually just go to their classes and go home.
College Student,2,I see some of my friend's homework and it is ridiculously easy and even stupid. I have been told that some professors do not cover the necessary material and show up half an hour late to class every day.
College Senior,2,The student center does not promote their upcoming events and their members fail or withdraw from classes and they still remain active in the club. Which I think is wrong.
College Senior,2,There's no interaction with teacher or students nobody ever reads your messages
College Senior,2,"Class registration is not really promoted . The proffesors forget to remind you to do course evaluations. Special study options are rarely heard off,Never announced ."
College Senior,2,It just depend who you know.they don't intend to recruit new comers.
College Sophomore,2,I dont like online classes. I perfer to be in class and in person. I tend to learn more that way. I took a hybrid class once and I did great. I got an A in that class.
College Senior,2,"There aren't many graduate degrees at STC. Actually, I don't think there are any."
College Sophomore,2,For the most part the student body is hispanic and middle class. Friendliness really depends on the person you are dealing with. Some will not shy from a conversation and others appear to be confused that a stranger wants to talk.
College Junior,2,"I've had constant problems with professors who don't explain things well. Mainly just 4 professors, but it's still a struggle that I have to make due with professor's who are horrible at speaking English and aren't very teacher savvy. I don't believe my moneys worth spending on such classes that have professor's like that.

The financial aide office is always having constant issues with my financial aide going through."
College Junior,2,The student body at South Texas College lacks a political view. Students are not too motivated by the idea of knowing about politics. 
College Senior,2,since im a high school student i dont have to pay for my classes 
College Freshman,2,Everything is ok but our gym is so small the equipment is broken the student activities need to be bigger basically we need to grow that's what we need everything is small and out dated.
College Junior,2,The network is really slow during school so it is really complicated to get things done.
College Junior,2,"I feel the education that am getting is worth every penny that am paying, I got some money through fasfa which is was a huge help. As for me trying to get financial aid through fianancial aid office at south texas college was not a pleasant experience at all. Every time i called i got different answers; and i didnt get any financial aid through that school at all this semester. Thank godness for fasfa! I do wish the school did differently was to make it easier to understand they're fees, and what programs that they accept for fianancial aid at the school; because i was not aware the school did participate in the standford loans and i found out late.I didn't get the right answers when i called they're financial aid office. Now that i had to do more digging  am more aware of they're policies. Wish i was aware of them earliear; it would of made a diffence to me. I advice anyone who calls they're fiancial aid office  to demand to speak to an acutal financial aid advisor don't speak to the person who answers the phone because they are not advisors! I didn't know that when i was calling and spoke to random people that answered the financial aid office line."
College Junior,2,I wish that some professors were more knowledgeable when it comes to students with disabilities. I feel that they are not compassionate enough to these students and are treated unfairly due to their disability. Especially when it comes to making up work when it is out of their hands because they missed class. And they have made every effort to talk to the professor and  that  professor will not help out. Professors need to work with these students to help them succeed not discourage them on continuing their education.
College Junior,2,"The academic flexibility is great because I can work around my work schedule. Now that I will be starting the nursing program, that flexibility will be gone. Don't understand why your transfer grades are not included with your GPA grades."
College Junior,2,The facilities here on campus aren't as popular as in other schools. The library is always with students because of the computers and a place to relax but atheletic center and campus activities rarely happen.
College Freshman,2,"Donna High School has become really strict about internet use; it's ridiculous. Sometimes it is impossible to do a research paper in school since about 70% of reseachable data is blocked. On the other hand, out computer lab (LRC) is constantly closed due to ""important"" event happening in the school. Also, they are very strict about the computer use at the library and LRC--no computer without I.D. Other than that, everything else seem pretty good."
College Junior,2,"The Academic Experience is good, but it seems the faculty isn't motivated enough.  I do have some great professors that you can see it in their eyes that they love to do what they do, TEACH.  But some are more of a bore and mundane.  Maybe it's their age or they are not getting paid enough.  But  the academic expierence at STC needs to change.  It has to be more powerful and uplifting, more challenging and fun.  I understand that college is alot of hard work, but seriously, the professors have to wake up and smell the coffee, literally."
College Senior,2,I just found out that my chosen major would require me to retake courses that I have passed.
College Senior,2,"There are limited financial aid options (FASFA, grants and scholarships) Student lending should be an option."
College Junior,2,"the printing on campus is okay except that you can not print freely as you wish, the network is somewhat slow and disconnects, and that is why I i had to buy a printer and use it at all times."
College Senior,2,"For a Community College, the tuition is a little high."
College Senior,2,"Not the Best Crowd. Most of the students are hispanics and not much social.  They stick to their little crowd they know from High School, and are extremely judgmental when it comes to social status."
College Sophomore,2,"I am an honest person, and I love STC, yet it seems that from my expierences, that the people who are hired to work in the financial aid department, are not really doing their jobs properly or as instructed.  It's been a year now that I've been at STC, and I've gone to talk to Financial Aid about 10 times (throughout the year ofcourse) and almost each time that I remember I had horrible service.  I ask questions and they don't give me much of an answer or explanation.  I feel they are not properly trained on what to say to students.  Alot of them are even a bit hasty and rude and want to get going to the next student instead of hearing my business with financial aid.  After all it is my reward, and they should be able to help me, when I need it, that is what they get paid to do.  That entire department needs a total and complete cleaning and makeover.  Attitude wise!  The awards is awesome if you qualify.  Yet, getting answers is tough, I dislike that about these workers in the financial aid office.  They are not informative and lack the proper knowledge and knowhow on the situation.  Tuition is great and the most affordable in the deep lower Texas.  They are accredited and an awesome school to attend.  I am happy here, but the department of Finances need a lot of fixing! THAT'S FOR SURE!  Next time you are in line, make sure they answer your questions whether they like it or not.  It's there job to attend you, the STUDENT!  You need that help, the financial aid.  And the Financial Aid is FREE MONEY.  You do not have to pay it back, it is great to have the government help us the way it does.  Especially in our family situation. (financially)  Good Luck and enjoy the benefits and your college, reap all the rewards!"
College Sophomore,2,"most of the students in this school are nice, but of course there are others that are stuck up and usually those are the ones i need to work with. i hate it last semester this guy was a different person in front of the teacher than with us and still he got an A and i a C..."
College Freshman,2,La Joya Center – I appreciate the fact that they try to open a new location but cancelling the classes on the students last minute is not acceptable.
Junior,1,"I attended the college program for health. I was discriminated against and brought this to the attention of Mary Elizondo as I was scared to lose my Dreamer scholarship. I think she is friends with the director. I was late along with another girl with red hair (white), but was told I had to leave the program because I was late twice. The other girl is late all the time. Supposedly Mary is the Title IX coordinator but she is an awful person and spoke to me in a discriminatory manner."
College Sophomore,1,I don't really see anything going on with job opportunities for my major.
College Junior,1,"My experience with the financial aid office has been awful. The entire process shud be very simple. I have done this online with no issues. Our schools department is rude unprofessional and unwilling to help students that need the financial aid. I've seen many other students and parents that have had to deal with this frustrating process. I don't understand how the department can allow the person handling the process be so rude and unhelpful. We can follow the application instructions but still be denied because of other things the department decides to choose. They call this random selections. And students that have been previously on financial aid will no longer be eligible due to new changes they decide. In my experience even after following everything they asked, they decided to request more personal information about my parents even after my submissions of legal documents stating I was adopted, they actually said they didn't believe I had no idea where my parents were and I still needed to take the forms back completed. It was awful."
College Senior,1,Tuition has a lot of extra fees and financial aid office dies not advice you of the options to pay for college .
College Senior,1,Advising center always gives different and wrong information to students. Financial aid office are not familiar with financial aid needs. And the financial aid does not inform the students of the different scholarship available.
College Junior,1,"All we have is the CLE 

Center of Learning Excellence; a building where we can go if we're in need of a tutor."
College Junior,1,"The campus feels a little similar to high school only with freedom. I don't really stick around much only because there is not much to do than sit around. The gym for example is way too much for way too little equipment. I have a weight training class and we have to use the UFC gym. I am guessing STC rents their facility. Its not fair to the students, they definitely need to make some changes. The library is too small most of the time the computers and tables are being used."
College Junior,1,I don't get any help with financial aid what so ever. I only get grants but it only helps a little bit. The rest I need to pay by myself and it keeps me from getting more classes.
College Junior,1,"Registering was a Nightmare, but as you get into the Welcome Center, they can really help you out, I guess I just thought of it as a nightmare because I didn't have anyone to help me out – I've signed up with STC twice now, once about 3 years back, but couldn't attend because of my father's illness, so now that I'm back in College and doing it all on my own, I have to admit the registering process was too complicated and the phone lines to reach representatives of STC was really hard to get through to just speak with someone on the other end about registration information.  South Texas College really does need some more work on their Oraganizational Strategies, cause to be honest I was completley unsure and lost during the whole registering process, I'm just so glad it finally Over, and I'm in school now learning.  I suggest that you register ahead of time, and I""m not talking about the classes, but I""m talking about registering for STC to attend this college.  It's a bit frustrating but did work out in the end."
College Junior,1,"The professors are alright, yet I find alot of them to be unorganized in a sense.  At times I've been frustrated becasue they switch classrooms with out notice and leave papers hanging on the doors saying to meet at this other classroom.  I don't like that.  The flexibility of classes is good, but the curriculum in the classes sometimes isn't what I expected.  Basically, I am dissapointed most of the time because of the information that the teachers are teaching us.  We are now living in an age of innovations, future scholars, technology, and information over load.  These teachers are just too behind on the subjects, yet they are fascination to listen to but it's just not what the students and myself at STC want to study.  You will see most of the students rushout of class just to be on their phones, to use internet, going to the computer lab, or using their laptops.  The future of our generation is changing and our minds are looking for stimulation.  And the professors at STC are not providing us with that."
College Senior,1,"There is not too much cultural diversity here at South Texas College. Since we are so close to the Mexico border, over 98% of our school population is of hispaic or mexican descent."
College Junior,1,The career services at South Texas College was not so great since the person that helped me guided me the wrong way and have me waste my time I was and still disappointed since I could have graduated this semester if I would have gone to a counselor instead of an adviser.
College Junior,1,It's horrible I think. They're so ride when asked a question.
College Senior,1,I like when I have professors that are not boring and are not just reading off a powerpoint.
College Senior,1,"Transferring Credits – I was told that the computer literacy course that I took did not transfer, but could not get a true answer why it did not transfer. This led me to believe that they wanted more money from the students."
College Senior,1,"It was a hassle trying to talk to someone in charge in the financial aid office. The lines are super long because they only have 2 lines-1 for documents the other for questions. So if you just have a question, you would have to be in line for about 3 hours or more. The other issue was the incorrect information, everyone told me something different. Also, they get your form, put it in a pile, and that pile sits there for a month. Until I actually came in and questioned it, they made the corrections. Overall, I think this school has it's issues, but tuition is worth the education. Almost all the teachers I've had helped me out so much. If financial aid would help out more students in the process it will make it less stressful for the students."
College Sophomore,1,"PHONE LINES ARE BUSY .....ALWAYS! This is my first year here at STC, and I seem to be regretting my decision, the many reasons is that I've already had some trouble with STC resources, homework, communication, is a bit of a problem within the professors, but they're are great teachers,and I take in every word they say to us, when I registered for financial aid in the beginning of the year, January, and time was coming for FALL semester in August, I called the phone line at STC the financial aid department, and they were always busy, I tried online talking to representatives,and they did not know anything! They would keep me on hold via chat for 10 min. at a time, one I believe never responded to me.  I just wanted to know if my financial aid package was awarded and how do I go about using it, do I have to pay in person, will I get a check in the mail? I NEVER GOT ANY INFORMATION ON HOW TO USE THE FINANCIAL AID. And that is what stressed me out the most! There was a time I asked to speak to someone one for the financial aid department as they were suppose to transfer me they hung up on me! And then I had to call all over again and wait all over again! It takes about a good 15-20 min. before they can get your call, and AGAIN, THEY HANG UP ON ME. I knew it was even the same girl who hung up on me before, because it was her voice that I remembered and again she hung up on me.  So I got really frustrated on that issue.  The college students that are working for STC may pose a problem in handling the call us new STC students make.  They don't seem to acknowledge us too much, or either they're too lazy and don't want to talk. That is what pisses me off! Please fix this!
Sincerely,
-Desperate Student"
College Senior,1,"Professors are awesome but advisors don't give the correct info and have you take a class that you don't need and it hurts when it comes out of your pocket and all they can say is ""I'm sorry."" Our money is not returned."
College Student,1,It Could Be Better. I wish they actully had a gym on the campus and it was FREE! if you wanna work out or anything of that sort you gotta drive a few blocks from school and you still have to pay for the membership
College Freshman,1,The only fustration and hassles I had was fixing my Verication of enrollment. I had applied for a loan and because I got so sick I stopped going to school and the loan company wants me to start payments already. Because STC has not updated the clearing house and their description of summer courses wasnt what my loan company is asking for. Its been months and still it hasnt been fixed and Ive been thrown to the credit burral.

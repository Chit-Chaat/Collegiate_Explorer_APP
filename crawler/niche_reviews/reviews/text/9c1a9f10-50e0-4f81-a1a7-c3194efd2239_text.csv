Junior,5,"Taking online classes at CBU is so easy! I honestly enjoy taking online courses because I get to have room for other activities as well. I am able to come to the classwork at my own time. Online classes are more extreme however because of the time frame one gets. It is an 8 week course, but it is very fun and very easy."
Junior,5,CBU is such a great school! It is very nice how one feels like they fit once they enter campus. Their campus is very beautiful! There is so much to do and it is easy to meet new people. CBU has been making changes to the school that is only beneficial. There is no bad reviews for CBU from me. Lance Up!
Sophomore,5,Because of COVID most classes are online. Their online classes are very well structured. Professors are very helpful and encourage us to not hesitate to contact them if we had any questions.
Junior,5,"I have taken a few online courses at CBU which are convenient as I can learn at my own pace and review lectures if needed. As COVID has led CBU to go fully online in the 2020-2021 school year, the online experience has been challenging but continues to be effective. The professors are understanding of difficulties but our education continues to take place regardless of internet troubles."
Graduate Student,5,I love attending California Baptist University for grad school because the class sizes are small and the professors are great.

Freshman,5,This is my first time in college and California Baptist University has been an amazing experience so far. The teachers are very kind and the students are very friendly. the campus is clean and there are always activities going on around the school.
Niche User,5,I like how everyone there was so nice. They also had so many majors. When they were showing our students around the campus we all though it was a nice school. I also though that their sports all seem so much fun. They also have fun festivities going on every year which I though was pretty cool too.
Junior,5,"The process of coming to California Baptist University as a transfer student has been easy and manageable thanks to the help of the faculty. I attended a few events for transfer students and all the faculty were very welcoming and informative of everything I needed to know about the school. The application process for transferring was simple. Applying for financial aid and housing was easily walked through by faculty from the financial aid and residence office. The school is consistent with emailing/contacting their students to inform them of any campus updates, services, class schedules, extra-curricular activities, and any events around campus. Most importantly all faculty at California Baptist University invest and dedicate their time to making sure every student finds their purpose, serves their community, and is successful long after graduation."
Junior,5,"The professors care about their students, an strive to make you succeed. The class time is constructive and understandable."
Graduate Student,5,I don't have experience first at California Baptist University because this is my first time going to CBU but reading their mission and goal for the student of the university is the most make me choose CBU. Most important they engage the community and develop a professional relationship and to gain an understanding of local resources that can benefit the client and gain knowledge o personal abilities and awareness of personal bias as professional social worker.
Graduate Student,5,"The experiential, hands-on training portion of the MSW program and allows for the integration of theories and practices in and out of the classroom. They develop and demonstrate skills in social work and a sense of commitment to the profession, knowledge of the Code of Ethics, and an understanding of law as it pertains to the social work profession. They develop an understanding of the diversity of practice, with the client system, and with practice setting and the most important, they let us understand the importance of Christian faith integration to guide social work practice while maintaining social work values and ethical principles."
Freshman,5,"If I ever have a question I always call their offices and it's fast and easy. I don't have any complaints, I feel blessed to be apart of the CBU community because they give several efforts to whether any difficulty is present as to online learning experiences."
Freshman,5,I’ve learned so much about CBU such as they have a church that provides student with the right mindset needed for all aspects of life. Their engineering programs are top notch and lastly the people are amazing.
Junior,5,So far so good! Great communication and easy to learn platforms for online college participants. Can't wait to fully gain the experience through them.
Sophomore,5,What I love about California Baptist University is the staff and students.  Everyone is so welcoming and the professors always look out for each student.  The only thing I would change is if we had more activities to do.
Freshman,5,"Counselors work really well with new students and the application/financial aid process. Although they are on the pricey side of colleges, they try this best to provide as many opportunities they have available for you in order to be able to be financial successful."
Freshman,5,"I began my first year at Cal Baptist during COVID 19, and as a fresh high school graduate. I was lost and confused without help on how to go through application process and they helped me over the phone and called me on multiple occasions to help me through."
Graduate Student,5,"What I like the most about California Baptist University is mainly its community, its professors and how much it can merge between the expertise and professionalism of its education and richness of content and as well the biblical values and reflect it in a practical way on our daily lives and businesses."
Graduate Student,5,"Due to the current surrounding pandemic of COVID-19, some classes turned to be online. Actually it was a great experience, professors were doing there best that students don’t feel the difference or any gap of the knowledge they are getting, as well the interaction between students in the presentations, projects and during the class with the professors were very high which raise the engagement of students and let us get the best of the content. Virtual classes maybe a bigger load for commitment and getting the most knowledge we can, but actually it’s the future of everything coming and raise the spirit of responsability of the students to do fully their role and learn how to motivate themselves and do the best of their effort to achieve"
Alum,5,I took several online courses as I was both a full-time employee and a student in my final years. I loved the format of the courses and still felt supported by my professors in this format.

Senior,5,I'm so glad I am going here.  The teachers are amazing and they really care about helping their students learn and graduate on time.
Junior,5,"My online experience has been amazing, I feel so blessed to have the opportunity to quit working and go to school full time to pursue my dreams and the journey God has placed me on. CBU online has been a wonderful experience, the professors are well organized, very helpful, and willing to set aside the time to assist students. The admissions process was easy and I had a very attentive counselor who answered all my questions and helped me set up financial aid very quickly. I signed up in April and started in May. The cost is a little pricy but my financial aid helped a lot. I really look forward to achieving my undergraduate degree in Early Childhood Development. I also plan on applying for my graduate program in fall 2021 for Education with a duel in teaching credential for elementary. I will work in a T-K program at a public school and utilize the current experience I have working at a private preschool as a preschool teacher. I am also a mom of three children ages 12, 5, and 2."
Junior,5,"I love everything about my experience so far at CBU. My professors, counselors, and financial aid personal have been so helpful."
Senior,5,My experience at CBU has been outstanding overall. The programs and community life have allowed me to grow spiritually. I would love to see more on campus activities and more clubs.
Freshman,5,"We are blessed with an incredible team of missionary, military, and industry-experienced faculty, flight instructors, and maintenance staff. All are committed to encourage you in your walk with the Lord and prepare you for your career in aviation. This team will challenge you bringing out the very best of who you are and what you can accomplish"
Freshman,5,"The Aviation Management BS offers concentrations in logistics and operations, airport management and operations, flight operations, aerospace technology, and dispatch. As a student you can take full advantage of using electives to earn other aviation minors while completing your Flight or Management BS degree."
Junior,5,I began the semester on campus like most students and with the stay at home order was transitioned to online courses. Overall my school did a great job making sure that we had access to materials needed to transition to online and even got all film students the adobe creative cloud so we could do our work remotely.  Overall the school is amazing and I highly recommend it.
Junior,5,Overall the campus is amazing. The staff truly cares about the students and I feel like the experience you receive at CBU is unlike any other campus in the area!

Sophomore,5,I enjoyed the professors and great friends that I was introduced to on campus.  I also valued the biblical hermeneutic/perspective to learning and preparing for later life.
Junior,5,"Cal Baptist University is an excellent school for pursuing a degree. The professors are kind and genuinely care about their student's education. With the school's advantage of having a smaller student body class, students and proffers easily communicate with one another. Cal Baptist community life is also warm and welcoming, the school allows students to get easily involved in school events, sports, and clubs. I started my first semester in the spring of 2020 and my overall experience was great."
Junior,5,"If you are a believer of Christ, this institution is for you. Never had I had professors ask what I am in need of prayer and actually pray for me. The support from them is unprecedented. I enjoy being an online student and sharing Biblical findings that correlate with my school work."

Freshman,5,It's an amazing school that mixes both religious studies and your preferable major. It allows the students to get an education in a safe environment. Their academics are extremely beneficial and the sports are very well known especially their cheerleading team!
Freshman,5,This school is an excellent school. I am a current medical major student and the different opportunities that are offered open doors. Its also a faith school which suits me well because I get to learn about what I aspire my future career to be whilst connected it with the Lord.
Senior,5,"Amazing school, professors, and community. The professors truly care about their students and want to see everyone succeed.

The campus life, housing, food, and events are all excellent and the student body really puts in the effort to try and get people to participate and grow in their community."
Freshman,5,"The environemnt at CBU was the factor that stood out to me the most. The people there are so kind and supportive. It felt as if they truly wanted what is best for me. The students there were so eager to give me as much information as possible about CBU. Overall, I had a very positive experience."
Niche User,5,"California Baptist University is such a beautiful school. It has such a great environment. The people there are so friendly.

Not only are the professors very good but the school itself offers many clubs and sports that can help you get to know other students and get involved. The environment of the school is friendly and diverse. California Baptist University is a school that gives you the chance to find what you enjoy and gives you the chance to find your purpose.
Sophomore,4,The campus is very big and they also follow Covid guidelines very well. Most of my classes are online and my professors try their best to be as engaging as they can be. Some of them actually incorporate prayers or theology at the beginning of class. A little bit expensive but a great school so far.
Junior,4,"CBU is a great school especially for those wanting to receive a Christian education. The professors are all genuine and understanding when life gets in the way of schooling. I have personally enjoyed the quality of education received as although the staff is Christian, they allow for other perspectives to be expressed in the classroom and do not impose their beliefs on the class. The diversity of classes allows individuals of all majors to attend the school with a wide variety of scholarships for each major.  Expansion of the school has allowed for more comfortable living areas including newer dorms that are extremely comfortable."
Senior,4,What I experienced at this school are people who are not afraid to smile and be genuine. A school that works toward my degree. I am in the nursing program and it has been the best experience. I am grateful to call the people I have met my comrades and friends. What I would like to see changed is more student lead chapels because I believe that is where we learn the best is watching and helping our friends in time of needs and struggle.
Senior,4,Right now the classes are online and I appreciate the struggle that this school has been through. they were presented with a challenge and they conquered that challenge .
Freshman,4,"My learning experience has been amazing, I have learned so much in the 5 weeks that I have been attending. I appreciate the commitment that the teachers have to their students."
Niche User,4,I was never a student there at Cal Baptist University.When I visited the school all the students their said they loved it.
Graduate Student,4,i am currently taking my entire quarter online due to the covid-19. So far the professors have sent informative emails in regards to the transition.
Graduate Student,4,so far the school is very involved with the transition of virtual learning.  they have provided helpful resources and the director of my major has been very helpful for those who are new to the campus. She provided an informative  orientation.
Junior,4,"As we enter the new semester with virtual/online learning and lectures, all my professors are working to get a great schedule and course outline to enable our success through technology. They keep me informed of any class updates and what I will be learning throughout the course over the semester."
Junior,4,"Sometimes online classes can be confusing, but they did make an effort to try to make an easy to understand program."
Junior,4,"I did take classes online during my last semester due to quarantine, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well teachers adapted to the new form of learning and how much they tried to make the process for students easier."
Junior,4,"I very much enjoyed the integration of education and faith at California Baptist University. It is a great school for learning how to mesh your education and your faith in your lifestyle. Most of the teachers and staff are very friendly and care for your well-being. I would like to see the school be more diverse, but I feel that the change will come eventually."
Freshman,4,"Whenever I have to call their office whether it's for financial aid, student account, etc. I always find what I am looking for. They're always so nice when receiving me, I appreciate those that I encounter with at California Baptist University. I don't think I've regretted applying and enrolling."
Freshman,4,So far I’m loving everything that CBU offers. From the start they already have my career planner out. No regrets on enrolling at the moment.
Sophomore,4,"The professors here are excellent, they truly care about the well being of the students as well as the student's continual spiritual and intellectual growth. The studying areas are incredible once you know what you are looking for which makes getting your degree a lot easier. Furthermore, they take care of their commuter population like no other school I know of (we have our own parking structure and parking permits are free)."
Sophomore,4,The online courses are quite good. They are fast-paced allowing for you to get general eds out of the way quickly.
Junior,4,"I am currently starting my bachelor's degree through CBU and am already signed up for classes for my first semester. I do wish that they released the books for each class earlier, since two weeks is not much time."
Sophomore,4,Even through hard times CBU professors always update us on any situation through email and always reminds of any upcoming projects
Alum,4,"I loved my undergraduate educational experience at California Baptist University. I had wonderful and deeply caring professors that made a huge impact on me, both academically and personally. Unfortunately, the cost of private education makes it difficult to recommend pursing education at CBU."
Sophomore,4,"The environment found here at California Baptist University is extremely welcoming. The student body definitely creates an atmosphere where every student feels welcomed and ""at home."" Faculty and staff work diligently to ensure that the students are succeeding and discovering what it is to 'Live Your Purpose."" I am eager to return to campus this fall!"
Sophomore,4,"With the 2020 global pandemic, all classes were moved to remote, online instruction. Professors went above and beyond to instruct and communicate, especially in this unprecedented time. I took two online classes before the world went into lockdown and I found that each professor made making instructions for assignments clear, had a set layout of the duration of the course, and always welcomed questions."
Junior,4,Professors continued to help the students out and make themselves available to the students. Never once did I feel lost or confused in my classes because the professors make themselves and other resources available.
Sophomore,4,My online classes were satisfactory but I prefer being a classroom setting. The professors made it easy to communicate  and were very supportive.
Sophomore,4,"Overall a great school, the staff and professors are very friendly and approachable. An amazing school to grow in academics and spiritually."
Sophomore,4,The academic standards and professors provide a great experience to grow yourself as a person and religion is never pushed upon you. The campus is also beautiful! The only drawback I would say is services don't always respond or act immediately and school wifi isn't always the best depending on your location.
Sophomore,4,"Online classes where somewhat easy and underwhelming at points, but that could be due to all of the covid-19 switching from in person to online. In my own opinion I would value the in class engagement as a priority in learning at cal baptist and say it is almost a must if attending the school."
Freshman,4,"Great school, wants you to do good with good teachers. I’ve have had a great experience with the school being very religious so it is easy to be supported by your religion when you have a religion based background."
Senior,4,My learning experience at CBU has been fantastic overall. I take classes online and in the classroom. Professors are able to incorporate educational tools and implement activities to help their students learn. I feel that professors are approachable and passionate about teaching their course.
Sophomore,4,My online experience was difficult to figure out at first but after figuring it out. It was not as bad as I thought it would be.
Sophomore,4,"Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was forced to transition to an online platform.  Although difficult and new, California Baptist University was successful in supplying the academic material needed to make the most of my investment."
Niche User,4,California Baptist University seems like a very good college to go to. I love the over all campus life and the way it looks. The education is also very good.
Freshman,4,My experience at California Baptist University has been prettyamazing. The people there are always kind and supportive along with the teachers who always want you to do your best and will support you in anyway.
Senior,4,"As a transfer Junior, transitioning was a difficult process, but as you become more comfortable with yourself and your environment you can adapt and adjust well. I love the professors who truly care for you and really want you to succeed. CBU can improve on making the campus more tight-knit by creating more events that promote student health and engagement."
Freshman,4,"I chose California Baptist University because it is a private Christian institution with a great campus that has my desired career programs. I enjoyed living on campus and meeting new people. Additionally, we have a nice variety of food options located through campus. The faculty and staff are great mentors, teachers, and friends. It is a unique environment that I doubt can be found anywhere."
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus! It is absolutely beautiful. The people there were super welcoming and sweet. The professors there were also very welcoming, helpful and understanding"
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love CBU. The campus is stunning and class size is small, therefore students can get to know their professors and peers personally. Professors and faculty genuinely care about students and their well being. Professors will often check in with you, pray with you, and just make sure you're doing okay. My only complaint would be tuition is quite high, but that is to be expected at a private university. Also parking is difficult in freshman housing."
Freshman,4,"I love how they give you a lot of aid to be able to afford to go to this university. The campus has a variety of food options, including chick-fil-a, the habitat, and the school's buffet has amazing food selection with great taste. It does not taste like cafeteria food at all. The professors are easy to create a relationships with because of the size of each class. Which is super convenient!!"
Niche User,4,Food is amazing. Campus is located in a good area with lots of things to do nearby and about 40 minutes away from the beach.
Sophomore,4,"All of the professors I have come across so far have been so kind and really made it known that they care not only about grades or my personally passing of the class, but also about my personal life. Almost all have offered to talk one on one if needed and offered prayers in times of need which is very comforting. The environment is very friendly and so inviting, everyone makes you feel welcome and like you fit in from day one."
Freshman,4,California Baptist is overall a great University with a good community. The only thing they need improvement on is diversity and some of their Resident Assistant Staff need more guidance dealing with the incoming Freshmen.
Graduate Student,4,"I love how the staff is very approachable and understanding, they are willing to help their students succeed in every area possible. The courses are interesting helping students to stay engaged in their academics! They have amazon worship services that allows student to grow academically and spiritually. I am
Currently a graduate student, and I wish I went to this school for my undergrad. I would
Recommend this school for anyone looking to grow naturally, spiritually, and academically."
Freshman,4,"CBU is amazing! The Christian faculty create a very supportive, caring, home-feeling environment. The faculty genuinely care about their students and their well being. Food and dorms are great. Professors are highly trained and easy to access outside of class."
Junior,4,"I have not yet attended this University, but during my visit I had a great time and got to see all parts of campus life. I have been to 3 other schools in the last 4 years so you could say Im a bit picky when it comes to choosing a university. But while I was visting CBU I had a near perfect experience. All Universities have things they need to work on, but I really think this is one of the most quality schools Ive been to."
Senior,4,"I love the instructors and their integration of Christ in all areas of life. However, the administration aspect seems more business oriented and not primarily focused on the well being of the students."
Sophomore,4,"I really appreciate the teachers and staff at CBU. They are always willing to help students and having a low faculty:student ratio definitely helps that. The property itself is very modern, clean and regularly updated. It is exactly what you would expect from a private four-year university. The reason that they did not get the full 5 stars and were docked a star is because they lack student community involvement. I have been both a commuter and forming student, and in all my experiences, there just is not enough student involvement activities. Overall, CBU is a great campus and it would be spot on if it just gained some student bonding activities and events."
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere of the campus and how most of the faces of CBU really treat you with respect and kindness. CBU does its absolute best to provide support for their students in every way possible. The only down side I would have to say about this school, are the fees and the occasional rude individuals. Overall, I think it deserves to be ranked close to the top."
Niche User,4,When I went to CBU for a cheer clinic I really loved how the campus was set up and it looked very nice.
Niche User,4,I am very  satisfied with there diversity and the campus life that Cal Baptist has to offer. The had a lot of student life that I enjoyed and I see myself attending this school.
Senior,4,"I like that classes are small and not overwhelming and the professors are down to earth and very accessible outside of class. But, tuition is really high and keeps increasing each semester."
Freshman,4,"since I was born I was raised in a Christian family so in order not to lose my beliefs they advised me to go to a Christian university so as to always keep the principles that he instituted for me, which is why I chose this university"
Sophomore,4,"Cal Baptist was very welcoming to me for my first year of college! I very much enjoyed the events, classes and immersion groups that were offered for freshmen. My transition from high school to college was very smooth and I had help and support from a variety of people from friends to classmates to professors. I would very much recommend CBU to those who are seeking a Christian based institution!"
Freshman,4,At my orientation I was greeted so very nicely. Everyone there was super welcoming and they want to see their students succeed. They also want to know whats best for their students.
Senior,4,"California Baptist University provides a warm and inviting environment that makes students eager to learn and create lifelong relationships. It offers a wide variety of courses, great food, and an atmosphere centered around Christ. It is a pricey school."
Freshman,4,The staff is all extremely helpful and will do anything they cant to make the registration process as easy as possible. They give you lots of financial advice and options to use and don't hide anything. From what I've seen they really try to connect students to the community and job pool to make the after graduation job search that much easier.
Junior,4,"Prior to June of 2017 I had never heard of California Baptist University. My dream school was its rival, Biola University. A few days before I heard of California Baptist University I had received an acceptance letter from Biola University in the mail. I was accepted but I did not receive any financial aid and there was no way that I would be able to spend $50,000 there. I was devastated. A few days later I attended one of my friends' high school graduation and I heard ""California Baptist University"" on the loud speaker. I knew I had to apply. Call it fate, call it destiny, but I have been at California Baptist University for two years now-approaching my third, and it is a great school. What I love the most is the community and how everyone has a common goal-to learn and succeed, and all the staff and faculty go above and beyond to push students to succeed and achieve their goals."
Sophomore,4,"This school brings joy and life into student lives. Everyone, which includes students and staff are very welcoming. You will meet life long friends at CBU. CBU contains a positive atmosphere that even through struggles you will find the positive and you will most importantly have staff that is willing to help you not only as a student but in your spiritual life."
Senior,4,"I am a transfer student from the High Desert and this was my first year here and I absolutely love it! The atmosphere is amazing and it's extremely easy to get the classes that you need. The advisors and teachers here seem to care for their students and don't just treat you like you're another number. The food is quite good depending on where you go and most of the professors are absolutely amazing! The only complaint that I have is that I've been having issues lately with receiving information about grants and scholarships next year because they seem to require every little thing that you have and it puts aside me putting in an application for a grant until I receive the information so I wish it was a little bit faster but I do understand why it takes awhile. Plus, there is just way too many speed bumps on campus and there seems to be no end to them. Other than that I have no complaints I absolutely love CBU."
Junior,4,"California Baptist University is a great private university that is invested in its students. There are small class sizes and professors who want to be involved in your life and your career. The biggest issue I have faced at CBU is that it is losing its Christian roots more and more as the years go on, but they are still devoted to having all of their professors be Christians which is awesome. Getting to learn through a Christian outlook is an experience I am truly grateful for."
Sophomore,4,The campus is a nice size and the amount of students is low compared to other Universities. I like that though because it feels more friendly and has a bigger community feel as opposed to walking by and just seeing strangers. Chapel is the highlight of my week and I love seeing people come together to worship.
Senior,4,"It's a great school. I originally came here to play soccer, but then I began studying mechanical engineering and resigned to focus on my studies. I stayed because of the professors, students, and in general, the culture is very welcoming and well rounded."
Alum,2,"I have a strong love hate with this school. Academic wise I felt high school was more challenging. I made some of my closest friends here, but also experienced some of the most hurt and traumatic experiences here. 

I learned quickly the administration only cares about the money you give the school, and that to them you are just a number. When I tried going through the proper channels to raise concerns (my profs helped guide me and encourage me through this) I was told essentially ""you are just a college student what do you know?"" While working on the school paper we were only allowed to write things that made the school look good. There was a fire that burned everything in an on campus living area ""The Village"" due to old wiring that we were unable to report. If that helps paint the picture. 

The profs I had in person were amazing and would go out of their way to help you succeed. That and friends is a sole reason I am giving this the rating I am.

Overall I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
Alum,2,"I had someone tell me my freshman year ""if you don't want to learn anything in the class, but need the credit take it online."" That was some of the best advice I ever received as I found it very true. I had a prof not grad a single thing the whole class, then a day before grades were due gave full credit to every assignment I turned in on time."
Sophomore,2,"This university has very dedicated professors and interesting classes. however, it isn't very easy to connect with other students around here, there isn't anything really to do on the weekends especially if you don't live close enough to go home on the weekends, clubs aren't very active, housing is very hard to get, and the food is ok but there aren't many healthy options."
Senior,2,"Cbu displays no actual christian values from the professors. They dont care to help, although they state otherwise, and can not address issues writen to them in a professional email. Answers to important question have been consistanly wrong from different staff and professors.  This campas doesnt give you what you pay educationally speaking.  All the money goes to high salaries and construction. Lecture videos are not made for your class, they were made once, and are repeatedly shown for the next few years. The professor sits back and collects the cash. The computer system does the grading, submits test, and avgerages the total grade, the professor is just there to get paid for reading the same thing repeatedly every semester with no new contributions to class or students. This school was a mistake. i truly suggests attending a different university where education comes first, not a fake image covered by the word Christian."
Freshman,2,"Very hard to get involved in this school if you are an out of state student. Over 50% of the school is commuters and ever more students go home every weekend. Weekends at CBU are incredibly boring, no greek life or events ever happen on the weekends for enough people to go to."
Junior,2,"I transferred here with high hopes but was met  with disappointment. I had the worst roommates my first year and had no one reach out to get me involved in activities. Now, I have run out of money and the only 'help' the school offered was advising me to withdraw or drop out."
Graduate Student,2,"Beautiful in the architecture, terrible in the actual college experience. Here is why.( I came in for the graduate program by the way!)

Diversity is nonexistent. Majority of the students are wealthy white folk. 

Faculty and students are close minded. Do not even think of gaining in depth world view points here, those ideas are shot down. 

The amount of tuition paid each semester is absurd for the low quality of education you receive. Students practically purchase degrees at this institution. You will not gain the proper experience to prepare you for full time positions."
Niche User,2,I came for the tour and looked at many SoCal campuses. This was the most awkward one for me. It felt very disjointed with its surroundings and the people weren't very welcoming.
Sophomore,2,"Obviously this is a religious school but I expected the emphasis to be education not religion. I have yet to be challenged academically and while that may feel nice to some students, it will not in the real world. The dorm restrictions are very old fashioned. The area outside campus is rather sketchy and use common sense and stay alert at night."
Freshman,2,"Plain and simple: if you are not religious, do not come to this school. Everyone here is so similar it's almost scary, making it very hard to find friends who aren't carrying around overpriced colorful water bottles or heading to their third bible study of the day. The professors teach via videos and references from other universities, and have an extreme bias towards students who lean moreso conservative and reference God's word in the middle of a lecture. The only reason I gave CBU anything above 1 star is because of their generous financial aid: that is practically the only thing that kept me from transferring sooner, but I am going to be leaving the school after one year to attend a community college until I have enough credits to transfer to a UC. 
Again, it may be perfect if you came from a religious high school or have been affiliated with missionary work, but for someone with minimal church involvement and came from a public, liberal high school, Cal Baptist is not a good fit."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no Greek life at CalBaptist, so not much to say about it."
College Junior,2,Getting financial aid at CBU is a nightmare. The department is understaffed and documents get lost and accounts are frozen all the time. Accessing financial aid online through insidecbu is confusing and complicated. If you receive one award on time consider yourself lucky!
College Sophomore,2,All the scholarships i apply for i never hear anything back. Also it seems like most scholarships I dont fit the criteria.
College Junior,2,I'm all loans. No scholarships yet.
College Freshman,2,School is very strict. Only allowed to have opposite sex in dorm rooms for 2 days a week for 3 hours each
College Freshman,2,I personally don't know of anyone that moved to live outside of the campus.
College Freshman,2,"There are rules here just like every other private christian school, but if you aren't flashy about breaking them then you should not get in trouble."
College Freshman,2,"The party scene here is almost nonexistent, but parties still do happen. Mostly by athletes and they are always very low-key. If you want to party, go to UCR and just party there."
College Freshman,2,I personally dont like sororities and ive heard from people who are involved with them that it is kind of difficult to get into one.
College Freshman,2,People are really conservative at the school so parties aren't really likely.
College Senior,2,school scholarships are not advertised.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I do not like Riverside- it's not safe, there isn't much to do for young people besides biking/hiking/rock climbing."
Recent Alumnus,2,Tuition is way too high and there is hardly any aid offered.
College Freshman,2,You're not allowed to park anywhere
College Freshman,2,Freshman year is more strict than all the other years.
College Freshman,2,It's college.They are way to strict on certain things
College Freshman,2,There really aren't many options for off campus dining unless you want to drive to the mall.
College Sophomore,2,"I plan on gaining an internship with Nursing. I plan on becoming a nurse in the near future, and being able to take part in getting involved would be good for me. "
College Junior,2,"Riverside is a pretty sketchy town. I was told not to walk around at night by myself. The university does have a metal fence around it which helps. Also, there is a mall about a mile away, so that is fun. Other than that, there isn't much to do. It's not a very nice or scenic town. Some people like downtown but its a few miles away and like I said, being out at night is not safe."
College Sophomore,2,The majority of the students on campus are white leaving little room for any other race.
College Junior,2,Parking can get pretty bad here. You need to get here early if you want a parking spot close to the main buildings Especially on chapel days.
College Freshman,2,not much to do but you have friends who have new ideas
College Sophomore,2,"At CBU their are some down falls when it comes to the rules. Such as visiting hours,girls can visit guys Tues Thurs 7pm-10pm, and guys can visit girls Weds Fri. 7pm-10pm. due to the rules sometimes if you have a out of town friend you are very limited to spend time with them inside the dorms,"
College Junior,2,Riverisde is a city however it's not a big city or that safe of one. You can never feel totally safe off campus but you can while on campus because it's a pretty closed off school. If you want to find something fun to do you'' have to travel to LA which is an hour away. Riverside doesn't offer a lot of fun activities to do. Riverside however is close to other cities that offer many fun activities but you won't find to much to do in Riverside itself. I give it C- because if you travel a bit you'll find plenty of things to do but not close by.
College Sophomore,2,there is nothing really going on in the night except if your hanging out with your friends.
College Sophomore,2,I would definitely say live on campus. Its not worth the struggle to live off campus and it is not a super nice area.
College Freshman,2,"Partying is only off campus at CBU, so there isn't too much of a night life. Some people stay up late and play frisbee or volleyball, but mostly it is boring at night. On the weekends nearly everyone goes home since so many people leave for the weekend. Weekends are really boring at CBU, and the town of Riverside doesn't have much to do, plus I would not recommend leaving campus at night."
College Junior,2,"Hit's the spot quite often, but a little pricy for the quality."
College Junior,2,Car Is the Best Option – I live off campus and have a car but the area in general is easiest to navigate if you have a car. Buses take forever.
College Sophomore,2,"Needs Work!! The gym we have now how about 10 machines total. I understand a new gym is in the works but how could students handles that classroom of a gym for so long. 1 out of the 2 treadmills doesn't even work, so frustrating when you make an effort to go workout and you can't. 
The library although it may have plenty of books no one even uses, it doesn't have enough study areas. You better show up to the library early during finals cause you wont have anywhere to study otherwise, absolutely ridiculous."
Alum,1,"One of my most prevalent memories of CBU is being pulled into a room and being questioned - over and over again - about my sexuality, being forced to attend their church, and the anti-lgbtq rhetoric that was consistently happening across campus. Do not go here if you are queer or non-christian or a person of color because you will be singled out. Not to mention, if you try to transfer once you realize the mistake you've made to enroll, then hardly any of your units will transfer. I am alumni and I genuinely hate this school for how they treated me. You are not loving or accepting of people outside of your community no matter how much you think you are."
Senior,1,"This post is a review of the AVIATION FLIGHT program, and does not account for other programs, facilities, or support staff. If you’re a student with high hopes of becoming commercial pilot, I would like to warn you about this fateful decision you’re about to make. DO NOT BELIEVE for a second, that an institution of higher learning that is devoutly Christian will do whatever it takes to do the right thing for you: to provide your money’s worth for quality education and training you will definitely need, and above all, graduate. I am a USAF veteran student that was projected to graduate with a BS in Aviation Flight on the Spring 18 semester with a GPA of 3.85. It didn’t happen, and my VA benefits were exhausted FOR NOTHING. CBU TOOK NO ACTION TO COMPENSATE STUDENTS FOR THE FAILED PROGRAM. The moral values of Christianity are a façade at CBU; these are people who are bent on MAKING A PROFIT OUT OF YOU. Please reconsider and research other more reliable flight schools."
Junior,1,"I was formerly a student in the Aviation Flight program at CBU and going here is easily my greatest regret in life. Advertised as a top aviation university I felt safe in my decision. This is anything but a top aviation university and probably THE worst college aviation program to exist. Excessive aircraft downtimes, lack of experienced instructors, lack of program management, and a school that will give false promises to students to keep them in the program is a recipe for disaster. My entire class and the class ahead of me seemed to disappear, dropping out or transferring. A class action lawsuit is ongoing."
Alum,1,"I did not have a great experience with the instructors or education here. It is a great campus, however, the ethics of their operations are questionable. I will not go into detail, but I am not the only one who shares this feeling toward the college. The education you receive, at least in the field of public relations is not worth the money spent. Every other person I have met who have gone to this school has the feeling towards them. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
Senior,1,"education at this school for the price is terrible. the price for education is a complete rip off cause professors don't do anything here. time and time again i have been mislead by staff, costing me huge amounts of money, and time. The quality of education within the materials is as if its kindergarten. professors don't do much but hand feed you instructions to complete worthless task which instructional videos can be found free on youtube. Why am i paying thousands for this type of education?! I advise continue looking else where to a more educated school, in a well educated area, not San Bernardo / Riverside."
Niche User,1,"The professors teach via videos and references from other universities and have an extreme bias (knowingly and unknowingly) towards students who lean conservative and reference God's word in the middle of a lecture. I almost killed myself because of how terrible this insitution treated me and the alienation they showed towards me during my time there; I went to this school for a year and never made a single friend. People here are so similar its almost concerning. While it may be the ""right fit"" for someone else it deffinetly wasn't for me: I transferred out after a year and I was more excited to get my withdrawl notification than my acceptance packet.

If you going into any social-based major (Political Science, Sociology, Psych, etc) know that you're going to learn 20% acually usable knowledge in your career and 80% why Christians are better than everyone else and need to shove it in everyones face."
Freshman,1,"Locked me out of my dorm returning from Christmas break and all my things were inside the dorm because i didn’t pay 3,000. They’re very expensive and they don’t work with on paying it off even if you’re in a tough spot"
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a Greek life because it is a religious school.
College Junior,1,"At California Baptist University, we do not have Greek life on campus."
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life at California Baptist University.
College Freshman,1,CBU does not have one.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no family housing
Recent Alumnus,1,They only have Honor Society
College Freshman,1,"Rated worst only because there was no rating available for ""N/A""  There is no Greek life on campus, therefore ""not applicable."" Rated difficulty of getting into a fraternity/sorority ""Very Difficult"" only because there are no fraternities/sororities on campus... again should be ""N/A.""

Overall, everyone is pretty friendly on campus"
College Freshman,1,School does not offer off campus housing.
College Freshman,1,No one parties at cbu
College Sophomore,1,There is not much of party seen at this campus. It is a private religious school so the party scene does not really exist. there are plenty of campus activities they do that keep students interested.
College Junior,1,Commuter parking is a joke. There should be a parking structure.
College Freshman,1,they dont let you do anything here
College Senior,1,"There are no sororities or fraternities. The only type of ""Greek Life"" there is, is being involved in an honor society which mostly have to do with your grades."
College Senior,1,"Partying with Christians is awkward because a lot of them don't drink but the ones that do go crazy and then feel guilty afterward. If you want to go to a normal party, make a connection at UCR."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life just in case people want to be involved with it while going to this school... The closest thing we have to that is living in the cottages.
College Sophomore,1,There is no party scene on campus which I enjoy because that just means less distractions for me.
College Freshman,1,Greeks are prohibited on campus
College Freshman,1,I don't like it but its okay
College Freshman,1,We don't have a Greek system
College Freshman,1,The night life at CBU is non-existent. It's full of friends and good times but not parties and drinking
College Senior,1,We don't offer fraternity's or sorority's. 
College Senior,1,We do not have Greek life where we have fraternities nor sororities 
College Senior,1,I am not granted any aid and I am struggling and not able to attend to finish my senior year and degree. I am trying to petition for independent status so I don't have to include my parents income because I do not get any aid from them and I no longer Iive with them. 
College Freshman,1,"There isn't much partying going on, when there is its usually small parties and mostly outside of campus. This i find very convenient due to the fact the there is no disrupting in campus atmosphere including my own learning,"
College Junior,1,No smoking or alcoholic beverages allowed on campus. Partying doesn't really occur on campus it usually takes place at neighboring colleges. They do have activities such as field games for those who live near campus.
College Senior,1,"There are no parties on campus which I think is important because it doesn't distract the students. There are bars in downtown Riverside that are lose enough to campus in case students want to go out. There are planned activities by the school that happen frequently that are fun, but do not involve alcohol."
College Freshman,1,"Our school is very safe... it feels very nice and pristine on campus and it's a good school, BUT outside of our school is not so pristine or safe, especially if you have to use the buses to get around; The best part of our school is in our school."
College Freshman,1,"Public transportation is not good. I have to ride the bus to the terminal to get to my grandparents house. There were few times I had to wait an hour for the bus to pick me up in front of cbu and other times I had been passed. Some bus drivers break too hard having people slide or fall out of their seats. They pick me up,but I do not trust the public bus to take me to school."
College Freshman,1,"Very Strict Campus – Because CBU is a Christian school, Christian values are strongly enforced and severe consequences are given to the people who go against those values. The police and people on campus are very strict about drugs and alcohol. getting caught multiple times can cause you to lose your housing. The first time you get caught with alcohol, you have to take a class about it and also get written up. You also have to be in your housing before midnight because the on campus security goes around the school and locks the gates."
College Junior,1,Southern Baptist School – There is not a night life if you are interested in partying. This is a religious school with strict rules.
College Senior,1,The diversity is very low considering it is a Baptist School but there is a small diversity in Rwanda students that the school brought over.
College Freshman,1,Many dangerous things on campus have happened. I don't feel that safe in school.
College Freshman,1,Greek Students – I don't think there isn't any greek life on my campus.

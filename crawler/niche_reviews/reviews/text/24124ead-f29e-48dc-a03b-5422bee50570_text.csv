Alum,5,ACU was very helpful with the admission process and continued great communication throughout my enrollment. They were very helpful and wanted me to succeed. They made the process very easy. The faculty were great and very accessible to the students.
Alum,5,My online learning through ACU was great. It was easy to figure out. The faculty were very accessible. The classes were taught in a manner that was conducive for learning.
Junior,5,"Abilene Christian University allows me to become the best version of myself. The university provides an abundance of resources, such as the writing center, the speaking center, the career center, the learning center . . . basically, anything you need help with, there is a center for you. The teachers truly believe in you and, though strict at times, want you to grow in your education and in your relationship with God. I have no complaints about ACU. It is a place to come and find yourself in Christ."
Freshman,5,"I love Abilene Christian University, even though I've been here for a short time, the community here is very welcoming. People and students all around treat each other like family and with respect. The education system is top tier and safety among students is a top priority here."
Freshman,5,"I'm currently taking one online class and it's just like i'm sitting in class. The teacher knows his limitations with only being able to be online, but is still able to produce a productive learning session with his students."
Niche User,5,This college is amazing and you should definitely go.................................................
Sophomore,5,Attending ACU has been a great experience because of the memories that I have made and the people I have met. I am excited to go back and continue furthering my education at a school that is very helpful to all students.
Sophomore,5,"Taking my classes online was not much of a struggle, my professors made sure that they were available for me and the other students whenever I had questions. They also provided all the necessary information needed for all of my assignments, quizzes, and tests."
Niche User,5,I just now got accepted so I have to wait but from what I hear they are more than great! The students there have a great relationships with the professors and the professors truly care about you and your well-being.
Niche User,5,Over there in Abilene Christian University everything is exactly that you want it to be and honestly I'm not even bluffing.
Sophomore,5,"Due to the COVID-19 crisis, my school made the decision to move classes online. I had initial concerns, but was quickly reassured by my professors. They stayed in contact at all times and made sure they made time available for zoom meetings to explain and answer concerns!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the diversity of the college! As a young African American female, I was concerned about diversity while looking at private colleges. I am proud to walk on campus and see peers who look just like me!"
Junior,5,The atmosphere at ACU is amazing. It‚Äôs my home away from home. The teachers are awesome and truly care about their students
Junior,5,"Online classes are usually a struggle for me, but the professors made it a breeze!! I‚Äôll definitely take another online class"
Sophomore,5,Due to COVID-19 we were to take the rest of our 2nd semester courses online and all of my classes through ACU ran smoothly and there was not really anything to complain about.
Sophomore,5,I love everything that Abilene Christian University has to offer. There are so many great opportunities to do whatever you want and I would not change anything about the program.
Sophomore,5,"Very peaceful, not much going on. Gotta love the Christian environment not a typical university. Diversity could be better and a little more included for everyone but other than that not much to complain about."
Freshman,5,"Although I have not attended yet, (upcoming freshman), a lot of my family members did. My grandparents, parents, aunts, uncle, and cousin all went to ACU. My cousin is the most recent family member who went there so I actually got to visit the campus and dorms. Everyone is extremely friendly and welcoming there! There's just this happy aura walking around the campus. I get excited when we go visit my cousin because it feels like home. I would recommend going to anyone who is thinking about going."
Freshman,5,My daughter will be a freshman in the fall and ACU keeps me up to date on everything I need to get her ready! Sean Anderson is a phenomenal advisor and everyone from the VP to the financial advisors are the absolute BEST!!! So glad to be a part of the Wildcat family!üôèüèæ
Freshman,5,My daughter will be a freshman in the fall and ACU keeps me up to date on everything I need to get her ready! Sean Anderson is a phenomenal advisor and everyone from the VP to the financial advisors are the absolute BEST!!! So glad to be a part of the Wildcat family!üôèüèæ
Sophomore,5,I really like the community. Everyone there (including the staff) is super friendly and makes ACU really feel like home. This university really helps to support each student on campus.
Sophomore,5,"Due to Coronavirus, I did have to take some classes online but our professors are so understanding and patient with us, especially in difficult times. I had lots of staff reaching out and checking on me. This just represents what the experience  even on campus is like."
Freshman,5,"I have never done schooling through ACU Online, however, many of my friends have stated that ACU Online offers many opportunities for education and that ACU does it's best to put both on-campus classes and ACU Online equal in every way."
Freshman,5,"Abilene Christian University offered me more through student life than any other college did. The community of ACU is beautiful. ACU's department of music was what I was searching for in the music department. A unified community, many learning resources, and a faculty that cared for the individual instead of just a class are what ACU's music department is all about. Abilene Christian University is where the community is a priority, where students can grow in both their major and relationships and, where God is seen through the lives of others. ACU was never my first option but, after seeing and experiencing what this university has to offer, I know where God wants me to go and I know where I want to go, and that's Abilene Christian University."
Graduate Student,5,"The University student Ambassadors are excellent working one on one during phone or computer corresponding. When engaged during the course, the instructors are patient and knowledgable and respond to questions or situations that require addressing. I felt as if I was a critical member of the Wild Cat family during the discussion on attending Abilene Christian University (ACU)and welcome as part of the family with open arms by the other students as well as the instructors.  
My knowledge of various subjects and life, in general, has vastly expanded. The flexibility and range of discussions allowed in the courses delegate difficult topics that one may otherwise ignore due to a lack of understanding diversity by respectfully addressing the in-depth situations. Abilene Christian University courses prepare and enable students of all backgrounds to amicably accept one another in a Christian manner in preparing them to face themselves, each other in making the world a better place."
Graduate Student,5,"My online experience was excellent. The instructors are knowledgeable in their subject, enabling me to feel comfortable with the material provided. In most cases, textbooks, resources, and online material were available for use. The students are allowed to use creditable resources of their choosing. The instructors respond to emails, posting grades, and answering questions promptly.  If there are personal problems or situations which occur at the last second, they are willing to work with you. 
 The online classroom environment is friendly and professional. The students display courtesy and respect towards each other.  What appeals to me the most is the diversity that one encounters; It is a guarantee that you will learn something different from another student. No two are the same. The participation projects, group sharing, and brainstorming activities empower everyone's contribution, which is just as valuable as the textbooks and other learning materials."
Freshman,5,I love the kind of environment Abilene Christian University. As well as the opportunities they provide
Freshman,5,I love how tight-knit the community is at ACU! Classes are small so you are able to develop close relationships with both your classmates and professors!
Freshman,5,"I am not joking when I say that Abilene Christian University is home. The professors and staff care deeply about your well being, and they make sure your college experience is one you could not possibly dream of. ACU helped me strengthen my walk with Christ and helped me meet some great people who I now consider my best friends. ACU is my home away from home and my second family."
Senior,5,This university is a one of a kind. They truly care for each student's well-being. The faculty and staff take time to get to know you and care for you. We are a tight nit community that looks out for one another. The academics make you feel prepared for your future.
Niche User,5,"Not only is the campus beautiful, but all of the staff have been extremely helpful any time I have a question. All staff have replied to me within 48 hours at the most!"
Freshman,5,"As a freshman at ACU, they try to make the conversion from teenager to adult as smooth as possible. Wildcat Week is the start of this with putting you in a group that also happen to make up one of your required freshman classes. They also have an activities fair to get you more involved on campus as well as off, The week ends with a major block party on Cypress Street in old Abilene. Food and fun as well as churches with their college ministries so you can meet people and find a church home. It ends with a movie at the historic Paramount Theatre, something no one will want to miss! Parent's Weekend is also great because of Freshman Follies. Abilene Christian is an amazing university for anyone who comes. From the academics to social life, they have something for everyone. Without this school, I would have no idea where I would have ended up. I would never change from where I am right now."
Niche User,5,When I visited campus I wasn‚Äôt so sure if i was going to like it. I fell in love with the campus and felt right at home!
Freshman,5,"My experience at Abilene Christian University has been incredible, our campus is on the small side but that makes it easy to get to classes on time, easy to meet new people or connect with friends in between classes.  ACU has hundreds of clubs to get involved in, providing opportunities for everyone to find what they are interested in. The class sizes are smaller which makes for better connections between students and professors, my professors all know me by name and its not intimidating to walk up to them and ask questions to receive help. There are also tons of ways to get involved and grow in your faith if that is something you are looking for!"
Niche User,5,"I only went for a visit because I was still deciding where I wanted to attend. It really felt like home when I was there, and it is so beautiful."
Junior,5,ACU is an amazing college that allows you to get a quality education while also making lifelong connections. I am a special education major and the educators in the education department are absolutely amazing. They allow us to gain real world experience by working in schools with children. It is the best possible way to learn how to teach. The friendships I‚Äôve made are lifelong. The professors care about you personally and want what is best for you and your walk with Christ.
Niche User,5,The campus is very peaceful. I loved my visit to Abilene and everyone made it feel very hospitable. I also can't wait to be up there in 2020
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love this school and the people that attend it. The small size gives it a very home feeling and I have met some of the best people ever here. I never saw myself at a private Christian institution other than Baylor, but now being here I cannot see myself anywhere else."
Junior,5,"I have loved ACU!! At first I didnt want to go to a small school, but after coming here I couldn't imagine it any other way. The friends you make here you will have forever and the ACU community is just simply amazing."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Abilene Christian University, so far, has been amazing! I have met so many people who have become life long friends. Abilene Christian University definitely has an environment that you win't find anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"This school is the perfect combination of faith and education! My classes are small, and it is very easy to get to know your professors."
Niche User,5,Great faculty and staff. Friendly atmosphere.  Safe environment. Many opportunities for community and spiritual growth.
Freshman,5,"of course, its all in what you're looking for in a school.  This is a Church of Christ Christian school, so you have mandatory chapels to be at, and of course, the party scene is pretty much nonexistant.  There are parties, but not many go to them, as illegal substance is highly discouraged.  This is a great school for medical programs, business programs, and biblical studies.  Its definitely in a small town and there isnt much to do, however, the people here are absolute sweethearts, and helps with focus.  The campus is beautiful, small with a tight knit community, but again, it depends on what youre looking for.  Professors will know your name and want a relationship with you."
Freshman,5,Abilene has literally been so amazing. Not once have I ever been treated rude by the faculty. I loved the environment as well it's an outstanding school.
Sophomore,5,"ACU is an amazing university that is very welcoming the moment you step foot on campus. The faculty provides multiple opportunities and support to help each and every one of their students to be the best that they can be. I have made many friends here at ACU, and we continuously help each other through tough times wether it be academic or personal situations. ACU is my second home and I hope it becomes yours too!"
Niche User,5,ACU was a great environment for learning and building long term relationships. I love the diversity on campus and how helpful students and professors were. I was recommend this amazing school.
Niche User,5,"I am going to be attending the school for cross country and track for the next four years and was so pleased with my visit to the campus. The counselors were genuinely involved to help you succeed in the major of your choice. The Diversity was lacking, but my soon to be team was so open to me and welcomed me in that I cannot wait to call Abilene home."
Niche User,5,I am so exited to attend ACU. When touring the campus I realized this was the perfect college for my future. Student - Professor  relationships are great and professors care about their students an strive to lead them in their education and in their faith.
Freshman,5,I am going into my freshman year and so far everyone I have met was very sweet. The campus is beautiful! My family and I  love it!
Freshman,5,"The campus at Abilene Christian very nice, with people who are very in touch with their Christian values. From chapel in Moody Coliseum to the athletic events, ACU always provides an easy way to get plugged into a social group. The athletic teams have become very prominent in their conferences in recent years since moving to division 1 status. The dorm situation for freshman is hit or miss, some individuals have been blessed with outstanding roommates and living situations. On the other hand however there are individuals who come to this university who are not the best of folks which is to be expected. If you want to have a relationship or be apart of a party scene this university is not for you at least as a freshman or sophomore."
Freshman,5,"Abilene Christian University is a great university helping young Godly kids continue on with their education, as well as helping them stay connected to God. As young kids finish high school they loose their faith and fall into the wrong crowds when going here youll get the education you need to get the degree you want as well as keep you in a safe non toxic enviorment keeping you connected to God as you go through you walk. Most young youth want to go out and party for those who want to continue to persue Christ and go to school and not have to worry about everyone around you telling you he doesnt exist or hes not real then this is the college for you."
Niche User,5,Abilene Christian University has such a welcoming environment from their staff to their students. Every time I  visit I have a great time and always make new friends. No one is rude or judgmental in any way and everyone is very helpful. Chapel is a great experience that everyone should experience in their life. It's a great time to connect with other students through faith.  Also The Bean (cafeteria) has amazing options for food and you can tell everything is fresh!
Niche User,5,"On my first visit to Abilene Christian University, i knew that this was the college for me. The campus is absolutely stunning and the students that you can find walking the sidewalks are super nice. This school seems to have everything you could ever want at a college. Everything from the Famous Bean cafeteria to the amazing gym that is open to the students. It is all there for the students use, that is somthing that you cant find at most colleges."
Freshman,5,"I love the environment the chapel really helps you grow closer to God. The class room size is kind of small so it helps you get a little one on one with your teachers. Everything on campus is pretty close nothing is really to far. The campus activities really give you a chance to connect and meet new people all the time. There are many avenues to help you be successful such as the tutors, the writers workshop if you are working on an essay and your professors themselves."
Freshman,5,"I like the midnight worships that are held by the school. The location of the school is great, it's a short drive to all my favorite places. Parking is an issue. The school's cafeteria offers the same food over and over again. The minimum chapel requirements are a bit excessive."
Sophomore,5,"There is no other school like ACU. The traditions run deep and the connections are lasting. The community at ACU is encouraging and Chirst-centered. The professors work to develop deep relationships with students and are quick to open up their homes as well as pray over students. The faculty want their students to succeed and are open to working with students to achieve their goals. There are many opportunities to get as invested in the school as you desire. With an array of organizations to choose from, Student Life is wiling to create new organizations as well. With the encouragement of student and staff, I have found myself taking initiative in things I never saw myself ever doing and have felt challenged to grow in my walk with Christ. ACU is a welcoming university that I cannot find a flaw in."
Niche User,5,"Abilene Christian University is a great and efficient University for students that are looking to further their career and get closer to God. Campus and student life have a very positive feeling and the professors and advisers are very present and helpful. Walking around campus, there are constant reminders that God is with you, which for me is very important and uplifting."
Niche User,5,I liked the campus a lot. The campus was clean and tidy there was no dirty area. I felt very comfortable being there on the campus as if I was at home so when I go to college I don¬¥t believe I will be home sick or miss home as much.
Niche User,5,I saw the students and was impresses by the way they are to each other. People treat each other like family and I loved to see that.
Niche User,5,"The environment there is one in a million. The professors, and students really do care about you. From the moment I moved in I knew that I was at home. Wildcat week made me feel as I was surrounded by people just like me, allowing us to connect deeply."
Senior,4,"ACU is a great school for someone who is looking for a small, Christian environment while still getting a little name recognition (in Texas, at least) and better academics than other smaller or comparably sized Christian universities in Texas."
Junior,4,Professors made online classes easy and accessible. Except for one professor who gave us double the assignments.
Senior,4,"professors generally were accommodating. Some were not,and had trouble adjusting our courses to the online format."
Sophomore,4,Online classes are a beautiful way during the summer to fill or advance a little with your degree plan during your attendance. Professors make it relatively easy to do classes with any confusion going on. Everything straight foward and to the T.
Senior,4,"So far it has been a good experience at Abilene Christian University. I came from a high school where the total enrollment was over 7,000 and now I am at an institution where my graduation class is 500. Granted it was a bit of a shock going to a smaller school in comparison to high school, but I never realized how much I appreciate, and have learn to appreciate, the smaller size."
Senior,4,"Luckily enough for me, all my professors were really good on communicating on a weekly basis on what we had on the 'agenda' for that weeks worth of class. Transitioning into online learning was not easy for me, much like many of my peers. However, my professors always made sure that there was no question left unanswered."
Sophomore,4,Overall great campus and people love being here you do learn a lot not only academically but a lot about yourself it is ways to get to know people and become close with them very fun on campus. But the surrounding area not so much very boring town.
Sophomore,4,Overall great campus and people love being here you do learn a lot not only academically but a lot about yourself it is ways to get to know people and become close with them very fun on campus. But the surrounding area not so much very boring town.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at ACU. Coming to college and moving away from everything familiar was difficult but ACU made it easier. ACU has many different was to get plugged in, and faculty and staff that truly care for you and your education."
Junior,4,One of the things I like about Abilene Christian was the atmosphere. People are friendly and nice and you can tell that the professors definitely care about you. I enjoyed going to Chapel every morning for worship.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy their willingness to help in the application process, but I would like to see them offer more aid in the financial aspect of the process. Since ACU is a private college,  a financial adviser should be present in the application process from the beginning."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful; not too big but not small either. There are always student activities and organizations that can be joined. There are some courses that have large class sizes, mostly the university requirement courses, but courses for a major are generally small making it easier for professors to meet each student's needs, if any. The professors are great at making sure their students have everything they need to be successful in their course and are available to any students that have questions or are not fully comprehending the material. There are dorms that are in excellent condition and the Resident Advisors in each dorm are very caring of each of their residents."
Sophomore,4,"The Campus is very small, safe and beautiful. The professors and staff are all welcoming and will help with anything you need. It's very rare that I ever feel homesick here. As far as the food, everything is top of the line and you can eat as much as you want. As far as sports go, the teams are very prestigious in what they do. The coaching staff is just as welcoming as the rest of the staff. On this campus, there are multiple ways that you will be able to grow in faith and learn everything you've learned growing up, yet you will be educated about them in ways you never expected. With this you'll have much better knowledge of the bible and Christianity than you ever have!"
Senior,4,"The experience has been great I like the christian atmosphere. The community is not too complex. The community seems safe and everything is not far from each other. Getting things done and going from place to place is not a struggle. Though I wish at ACU there would be better ways for financial assistance, rather than always searching for loans."
Freshman,4,"Abilene Christian University has a very friendly, and clean environment. All staff and employees are very helpful and kind. The school offers many different clubs and activities for students to have fun and get to know other people. It has valuable resources designed to help students achieve such as having a learning center and a writing center. We have a very diverse campus with people coming from different countries like South Africa, Guatemala, and Asia."
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see this campus be more involved with their minority students. But other than that, the campus is great."
Sophomore,4,"At ACU you will find a very close community of students,you begin to get to know a lot of people you may not even have classes with and I find that very special. it feels more like a family"
Sophomore,4,"There is a comradery among students. As a faith-based institution, the student body establishes a wonderful sense of tradition and community. The academics are phenomenal. The professors encourage discussion and participation in class. Their assignments and coursework are extremely useful and are a wonderful representation of the course itself. The professors are enthusiastic and passionate about teaching. They are passionate about teaching at Abilene Christian University specifically. Overall, the school has been a wonderful experience with many encouraging people and situations."
Freshman,4,"ACU is more than a Christian college but a family that heavily relies on lifting each others spirits and treating each other like brothers and sisters in Christ as Wildcats. Understandably, the ""C"" scares people because believe that students wear white, speak in tongues, and carry a bible in hand or in a backpack when in all honesty, the comparisons are incorrect and what we do here isn't as excruciating people think it is! As an incoming freshman, I can already feel the love of Christ and the staff here that I feel safer here and that I thank my Lord and Savior for helping me pick the right college. For any Christians, other students seeking to get know Jesus in college, or is interested in ministry, then I believe whole-heartedly that ACU is the right place to spend your four-years at!"
Senior,4,"Over all, ACU is a great school. I've had a lot of fantastic professors and met lifelong friends. There are a lot of opportunities on campus to get involved and professors actually care about you. Most of my classes have been well-structured and the campus is generally attractive and taken care of.

That being said, there have also been downsides. I've had some bad professors. Counselor oversights have led to difficulty with completing both my major and minor requirements. They don't have enough parking. Some of the buildings need an update badly. 

My biggest complaint was chapel. You need 55 chapel credits, which is insane. They got rid of the app we used for tracking them, so for most of the semester we have no idea how many we actually need. They also made it harder to get exemptions, so many people just resent chapel as a whole.

Despite all this, I would recommend ACU to most people. It's expensive, but I have no regrets and have loved my college experience."
Freshman,4,Abilene Christian is a very caring and friendly atmosphere. It is very easy to get involved and grow your faith in Christ. The classes are taught by passionate and intelligent professors. My largest complaint is the massive amount of money this school has you pay for housing and food that is much lower quality than what you're paying for.
Niche User,4,I really like how small and untied ACU is and it really feels like home away from home. The faith is amazing and it makes me want to become a better version of me
Junior,4,"The faculty are amazing and there were a number of classes that I enjoyed, but I did not connect well with other students and there were some classes that were not enjoyable or helpful."
Graduate Student,4,I am in pursuing my Ed.D of Organizational Leadership. It's a online doctoral program. I really enjoy the curriculum and the interest that the admissions and advising staff has in their students. The professors have been great. Mine have been great at responding to emails and phone calls.
Junior,4,"ACU is big on community and encouraging students to learn about God and finding their purpose; it is a very small school so class sizes are small, which I've enjoyed."
Junior,4,The campus is run down and our tuition is too high. Other than that it is a great place to study. I am a 5th generation and there is no place I would rather be.
Alum,4,"The overall environment at ACU was very welcoming and diverse. I enjoyed being a tutor for one of ACU's classes and was an employee for the on-campus tech support for the entire length of my time at ACU. My professors all really cared about me and my wellbeing. My greatest disappointment with ACU lies with its recently announced policy regarding LGBT student employees as its discriminating and distasteful rhetoric doesn't reflect the actual opinion of the campus population (my engagement with professors, staff, and students and observance of the collective outrage over the policy has confirmed as much for me). As an LGBT student who had an active role in multiple campus positions, it was greatly disappointing to learn the administration's recent decision. I hope that they will revoke this discriminating change, as the community here is really accepting and loving. Many allies rose up over the past semester to challenge the policy and were seen wearing pride pins to graduation."
Sophomore,4,The professors truly care about their students and want you to succeed. there are so many great professors that really do do everything they can to nurture and help you succeed.
Freshman,4,"ACU has a very strong community, both between students and between students and teachers. Teachers are very patient and are very approachable and helpful. It's a place filled with many different kind of students were anyone can find their place."
Sophomore,4,"Not only was my academic experience good, but so was my social life and my spiritual life as well. I met my very best friends in my dorm hall and inside the classroom. Professors are very understanding and will do anything and everything to work with you. The only problem I faced my freshman year was curfew at 12. It's reasonable, however, I had never had that kind of rule before college, therefore, it took some getting used to. Besides that, everything has been great. I love the environment, the food, study materials, financial aid, etc."
Freshman,4,"The University has a great close-knit atmosphere. With around 5,000 students, it is easy to meet and form close connections with so many people that you see every day. Class sizes are small which allows for lots of professor-student interactions on a daily basis. All of the Professors here that I have met have been genuinely concerned and involved in their student's success at this university and even help to facilitate success when a student expresses the desire to leave ACU to continue their education elsewhere."
Niche User,4,"Abilene Christian is beautiful private college that is located in Abilene, TX. I went there on a visit for football and i absolutely loved it. The campus is kinda old school but very nice. They also just renovated a new football stadium which i also got to play my last high school football game at."
Graduate Student,4,"Although it does not have the sense of awe that some state schools possess, ACU does a fantastic job at preparing its students for a life of purpose and success. The facilities have recently been renovated and the campus as never looked as good. Unlike other schools, the class sizes are manageable which gives you a chance to develop actual relationships with your professors. The connections that the university has are just as good as the most well-known schools. Companies and graduate schools across the country recruit for internships and jobs year round so for the ambitious there are opportunities out there. Like anything, you get out what you put in and ACU has a lot to offer."
Alum,4,"I think that this school was very good academic wise, but not so much culture wise. The classes I took were difficult, but they helped prepare me for physician assistant school. The teachers were excellent because they were always open to help. The only negative with the school is how they enforce their beliefs in the school. I understand this is a christian school, but some people did not pick this school based on religious reasons. Some people picked this school for the education and scholarships they would received. I think it is unfair to not allow LGBT students to not be able to work on campus to help pay for their education. I also don't think it is fair to tell students where they cannot work outside of campus."
Alum,4,"Definitely the friendliest campus I have ever been on. The student body is easy to get to know, as well as your professors since the class sizes are small. It can be a pain living on campus for the first couple years, but you get to know fellow residents really well."
Freshman,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here at ACU. As a freshman, I was terrified of starting my life away from home, but the students and staff at ACU helped me feel welcomed and included. Though I feel there are limited things for freshman to get involved in, this has allowed the transition from high school to college go smoother."
Niche User,4,"Since ACU is in a nice suburban town, I feel very nice and people are really nice. Plus, they have a great program for military children."
Freshman,4,The school is very small. It‚Äôs so small that you‚Äôll see the same group of people at LEAST 3 times a day. The school feels like a community.
Sophomore,4,"I love that the professors care about you individually, and they don't just see you as a number. The campus is beautiful, and the students are also friendly. I feel that this environment is welcoming of faith, which is refreshing to find."
Sophomore,4,I love the small atmosphere and community. Majority of people both students and staff know one another. The academics are excellent. The university does a very good job at connecting you with professionals in your desired field and shadow and or intern positions.
Sophomore,4,"I love the strong communication and compassion from professors; however, I wish that fraternities and sororities did not depict whether students have a social life or not."
Senior,4,"Abilene Christian University is a very unique school in that it is an NCAA Division 1 school, however has the feel of a small, personal-level school. It offers the big athletics and academics while providing a safe, christian-enriched environment. The professors commonly know the students by name and the students feel very taken care of."
Sophomore,4,"I love attending Abilene Christian University. During my time there, I have found the faculty and staff helpful and kind; the people at ACU truly care about each student and work to make their college experience the best it can be. The professors are engaging and often seek to include interesting discussions into class time. Like at any school, however, there can always be improvements made for the betterment of the student body. I believe one big change that can be made at ACU involves resident life. Both the resident assistants and individual resident directors need to do a better job of immediately assisting with any issues students have within the dorms."
Junior,4,"I enjoy Abilene Christian University so much! There are lot of friendly people that you will meet on campus, the professors are great and they want to know you personally, we have a beautiful campus, and a  great wellness center that is well established. The only problem is that because Abilene is a small city, do not expect big attractions like Austin or Dallas has. But it is beautiful and fun here in Abilene!"
Freshman,4,I like the overall atmosphere and my classes. They need to work on their conflict resolution training for their residence advisors.
Junior,4,"I love the small atmosphere at Abilene Christian University. Growing up in a small town, Abilene Christian feels just like home to me. However I would change the amount of money they invest. They are building a huge football stadium. I believe the is not fair because they should invest that money into scholarships to help students finance the rest of college."
Junior,4,Abilene Christian University is a great college with many great opportunities. They really make sure that students are involved with events going on and help them have fun while still going to school.
Freshman,4,"Abilene Christian University is an amazing college to build a relationship with Christ, friends and even professors. There is a very strong sense of community on campus. It is so easy to find a friendly face. Aside from social settings, the academic quality is very well worth the price. Education is my number one priority and I feel that everything I have learned has real world application as well as a correlation with a Christian faith."
Sophomore,4,ACU is a great place to grow and challenge yourself in academics and in faith. The cafeteria is terrible.
Junior,4,"My experience at Abilene Christian University has been life changing. I have learned so much academically, but also about myself as a person. The professors are amazing and always are willing to help their students. One thing I would like to see change at ACU is the school spirit. However, we are building a new stadium in hopes that more students will attend games. Overall, ACU is an amazing school and I love it!"
Senior,4,"ACU is a great school for someone who likes a sense of community and a relatively small school. The professors are excellent and take a genuine interest in their students. In addition, there are many free resources available on campus e.g. writing center, speaking center, tutoring, etc.

The campus is beautiful and safe and the food is constantly improving. There are a number of social clubs and different groups you can join on campus and it's pretty diverse. Most of your experiences will be largely based on your personality and the groups of friends you choose.

A downside is that ACU is too expensive. Although the quality of education is great, you begin to truly wonder if it is really worth it. Helps a bit that they offer tons of financial aid, and they are cooperative and helpful to students. 

All in all, I would say for me personally, ACU has been a great place to grow and learn."
Freshman,4,"As an international student, I was very afraid to begin college in a whole new environment. But Abilene Christian University didn't make me feel that way. It was so welcoming and I quickly adjusted to everything around me. The first couple of weeks were hard but the people at Abilene Christian University were very helpful and welcoming. You could tell that they wanted you to be there and that if you needed help to just ask them and they would help you as much as they could. The campus isn't that big so everything was walking distance and it is a very nice campus. It is kept clean and managed very well. It is safe and I wouldn't trade going to any other place than Abilene Christian University. It has been a great experience."
Freshman,4,There is really no night life. The toutoring is great and really helpful. The  president needs to be more active and come up with more activities that involve culture.
Niche User,4,"Abilene Christian is a great university, their sports and academics are exceptional but the one thing I'm not a huge fan of is the location."
Freshman,4,"ACU has been a great environment for me to start my college career.  It has offered me the type of Christian environment that I wanted to be in for my degree.  The overall campus and student life has been amazing, and I especially enjoy the opportunity to praise God each afternoon at Chapel.  The professors take an interest in you personally, and I am ready for my next step in Speech Pathology."
Freshman,4,Amazing faith-based university with professors that care and want to see you succeed. Some more than others. Challenging yet worth it!
Freshman,4,"So far I am a college freshman, so not much has happened except the whole moving thing. I love how well their professors and academics are accurate with their description. I was they had more activities for freshman to get involved in and to get to know more people at the university. "
College Freshman,4,I love living in Gardner Hall. My RA is the best. Im friends with most of the girls in my hall.
College Freshman,4,"We don't have have Greek houses because the school doesn't want to encourage big parties but there is a couple of house that sisters plan to live in. At ACU you can't pledge until Sophomore year because they want to focus on settling in which I really like because I wouldn't want the pressure of trying to fit into a club, make friends, and learn how college works the first year. Everyone knows when pledging starts at ACU because the people pledging have to wear a uniform according to the club, they have to sing their song, and stand by their statue around campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is seen as a safe zone and there is very little crime. Most of which is stealing items left in study spots, library, etc."
Junior,2,"When coronavirus broke out after spring break, we switched to an online learning platform for the rest of the semester. I was very disappointed in the results. Although the teachers had a week specifically set aside to rework their courses and to get instruction on how best to rework their courses, every course I had struggled to teach effectively the material we would have gotten if we were in class. For one class, I even had to do a group project with one of the members living in Australia. The difficulty of scheduling time to work together was tremendous, and probably affected our overall grade. Most classes chose to do simple assignments once a week, which was nice for workload, but did not make me feel like I was actually learning the information. The online classes have been better so far this year, but I am still very disappointed in their handling of online classes last spring semester."
Junior,2,"The drug culture here is insane, People will post fluffy religious quotes on social media and bash the LGBT, but regularly do cocaine,MDMA etc.

Professors are nice and far more open minded than the student body.

Half of the students are married by age 20 or 21. The stereotypes are completely true. Most people here are white, privileged and extremely conservative."
Alum,2,"While the education at Abilene Christian is undeniably strong, there were few things I truly appreciated about the university. I was able to make life long friends, however, there were several instances of blatant racism that I do not believe were handled properly."
Sophomore,2,"I had a very rough year at ACU, mainly because I felt as though most of the professors didn't care about my wellbeing as they advertised to me before I enrolled. I went to ACU excited and ready, but after arriving it was downhill from there. I was in the band and the directors were rude and showed favoritism toward the music majors and those that had extraordinary musical talent, rather than showing interest in the students who were struggling. ACU was advertised as a loving, Christian environment, but what myself and other friends experienced was the opposite."
Freshman,2,"The campus is very beautiful and clean. However, I do not get a feel for the Liberal Arts side of the college. I feel it is very one sided in the beliefs and there is no room to explore."
Niche User,2,Would get rid of the Bridge Scholars Program until it can be administered in a better manner. I decided to transfer out because it was going to leave me behind my intended graduation date. Now I am still behind at the university I am going to attend in the fall.
College Freshman,2,"I did not have a good experience with the dorms. The community bathrooms are gross and girls leave unsanitary things in the showers. They are also inconsiderate of their hall mates when they are running up and down the halls screaming. The rules were also too strict, I think we should be allowed to have members of the opposite sex in our dorms more often and we should not have a curfew. However, it is close to classes and it was a fair price."
College Freshman,2,No one seems to care about the athletics at ACU. The school spirit is subpar and the university as a whole does not do a good job of encouraging the student body to attend games.
College Sophomore,2,"Dorm rooms themselves are not bad. The older you get, the better they get. However, residence life is extremely non-accommodating. You better hope you like your roommate or it could be a very long year, as they are not inclined to make switches."
College Sophomore,2,Not into partying so can't really comment on this.
College Sophomore,2,"There are social clubs, but the pledging process is pretty ridiculous and expensive."
College Sophomore,2,The bean is pretty much awful.  Out of about every 10 meals there is one edible one.  They should also get more on campus food options or make bean bucks available off campus.
College Freshman,2,Not many good parties are put together. Poor attendance and participation.
College Freshman,2,The campus is very strict due to the fact that it is a private christian university.
College Freshman,2,The dining hall is way to small for the amount of students on a meal plan. The menus are hard to find. We do have a nice variety but most of the time the food is gross. I have stopped eating in the Bean completely. Nothing seems fresh and most of it feels like left overs from the days before. The best places are the places that aren't the bean.
College Freshman,2,Freshman attempt to be enthusiastic about athletics but are disappointed with low attendance and lack of enthusiasm from other students and faculty families.
College Junior,2,Too much money going places that no one knows. If you have to pay for schooling the cost of this school is not enough for the lack of free/cheap things that come with it.
College Junior,2,Not a lot of partying during the week and the ones on the weekend everyone drives to so its easy to spot out where it is. Too many fake people and rich kids to give a crap about partying
College Junior,2,Lots of parking restrictions and only one night a week that the opposite sex can be in your dorm. I feel if someone got pregnant at school they would get kicked out.
College Sophomore,2,They have social club which are not real fraternities.
College Sophomore,2,Food is not healthy and gives people diarrhea
College Freshman,2,"Not enough student insolvement, and no tradition."
College Sophomore,2,"There are really not many good restaurants in Abilene. Everything closes early and it's all the same- BBQ, burgers, fries, etc. The few good places are too expensive for a college student."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few places to eat out at off-campus. The town does have a couple of unique places, but when the night rolls around there are virtually no places to eat at."
College Freshman,2,"The football games here are terrible. No one cares enough to go and even the people who do come, are distracted the entire game. Yes, the football team is definitely improving but no one is showing their support of that."
College Freshman,2,"Although ACU is a smaller school, the off-campus housing is still quite disappointing. Basically the only options that are even relatively close to campus are houses and finding roommates to split that kind of bill can always be a pain."
College Freshman,2,"The closest fast food place is more than a mile away and the closest actual restaurant is more than 3 miles away. With distance like this, it is not common to go out to eat. Also, for being in such a college central location, the amount of student discounts offered are slim to none."
College Sophomore,2,"Theres no where to eat thats not a chain. I love small towns because of the unique spots, but not here in abilene its average food and not much better than that."
College Junior,2,"Abilene lacks in nightlife, especially for a college town. There are very few places to go out, and those few get old fast."
College Sophomore,2,Nothing to do in Abilene off of campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Abilene Christian University is 36% minorities and the reminding percentage white. A large majority of the students are white, Christian, conservative, and republican."
College Sophomore,2,Everything in Abilene comes at 10pm. The only place open after 10 is Whataburger down the road. All the restaurants  are across town so a 10 to 15 minute drive. Mostly chain restaurants with a few local places downtown like Abi Haus and Monks.
College Sophomore,2,Abilene Christian University does offer everyone a scholarship when they received admission into the university. The hard part is applying for scholarships after that and keeping your scholarships. Financial aid is really your problem to deal with since the office really isn't that helpful.
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife at ACU is what you would expect from a private very Christian university. If you are looking for parties, just walk down a street during homecoming season or expect a text from some one hosting it. Other than parties there is a local two stepping club called Guitars or ""Geets"" that has college nights on Thursday or if you are looking for something sweet and quaint there is a dance hall called Oplin in Oplin, Texas nearby."
College Junior,2,"We don't really have transportation here except for the city bus, which barely any students use. Most students have cars or ride a bike."
College Sophomore,2,There is literally nothing to do in Abilene at night other than party. Most people go get drunk and even drive drunk.
College Student,2,Inconvenient because you have to drive everywhere
College Freshman,2,"As far as age appropriate activities, there are two coffee shops. That's about it."
Recent Alumnus,2,most drug/alcohol topics are taboo
Recent Alumnus,2,"Lot of rich kids and black ppl who're ""entitled"""
Recent Alumnus,2,"ACU has issues w/ ice, wind, dust, & various bugs"
College Freshman,2,Everything is within walking distance if you live on campus but there is no public transportation
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you have a Mac, you have to work extra hard to keep up with classroom needs."
College Freshman,2,The visitation in the dorms is one of the worst parts of the school.  The dorms are either all male or all female dorms which makes it hard to see girls outside of class and on top of that they won't let you have girls in your room unless it's specific times on a Thursday and the door has to be open.
College Freshman,2,There are only a couple of good restaurants but they are mostly fast food.
College Freshman,2,"As far as learning, it's okay and rather enjoyable, bible learning even for a christian college seems overly stretched, and as for making friends, I've fallen out of the loop, making any good experience random, lonely, and craved for. There is no connection for me with anyone. "
College Junior,2,We just moved to Division I. Games are often attended by students. The sports teams however are very great.
College Freshman,2,"ACU gives a scholarship of some type to almost every student. However, because the tuition is so high, even with these scholarships it is still not really affordable. The financial aid office is not very helpful either."
College Freshman,2,"If you want a small-school atmosphere and to be surrounded by hundreds of people that are all the same, ACU is a good fit. If you're interested in trying new things, stepping out of your comfort zone, meeting new types of people, and having a college experience, don't come here."
College Freshman,2,"The facilities that exist are very nice and are kept in top condition. However, just because something looks nice, does not make it fun. The rec center, however, is probably my favorite place on campus. It is extremely nice and there are a lot of things you can do. It closes at midnight though, and the pool is hardly ever open. Also, you have to have a one-piece swimsuit for the pool, which makes you feel like you're in kindergarten. There is no student center really, just a small area connected to the cafeteria. The grass is green and nice-looking, but students really don't ever sit outside. There are few campus traditions, but the ones that are in existence are a big deal to most people. Most students go home or with friends to their hometowns for the weekends, which can be fun, but definitely not what I was expecting in college. It's kind of lame, because you should want to stay in your college town and have fun on the weekend."
College Freshman,2,"While Abilene may be good for children in elementary school, it's really not good for anything else. There are parks, a zoo, and a skating rink. However, even with three colleges here, there is nothing to do. The people at the millions of churches are very friendly though."
College Freshman,2,"There is hardly any diversity at ACU. There is a good number of international students, but that's about it. Most students are from the upper class and white. They wear the same type of clothing, eat the same types of food, have the same religious beliefs, etc. There really is no diversity."
College Freshman,2,"I have not been happy here, and  am transferring next year. The small campus size is nice as far as proximity to classes (I never woke up before 7:40 for my 8 am), and the professors are easy to talk to and willing to help. Other than that, however, there's not many benefits of going here. The tuition is extremely high, the majority of people are hypocritical Christians and extremely judgmental, and there are so many rules. No girls allowed in guys' rooms, or vice versa. Curfew for freshman is at midnight every week night, and that is not fun at all. The library closes at midnight, is overcrowded, and there is not even a designated quiet floor so I find it impossible to study. If you talk about parties and drinking a huge majority of people will look down upon you. The campus is so small and there's really never anything going on. Abilene is boring as well... a few dancing places, a bowling alley, and movie theatre, but that's about it; and you have to drive all the way across town to get anywhere. Students really don't go to athletic events at all; there is a lack of school spirit except for a few people who go to every game, but that's only because there is absolutely nothing else to do. There's no Greek life, only ""social clubs"" that are kind of a joke. I honestly feel like I am in high school all over again. If you want a true college experience, do not come to ACU."
College Sophomore,2,Not many regularly attend the games. Most that go just go for a social event.
College Sophomore,2,There aren't too many places to choose from and all the fast food places close early
College Sophomore,2,Very boring. You have to make your own fun or go to another city like Dallas to have fun
College Freshman,2,"The restaurants surrounding campus are mostly fast foods places and relatively cheap. However, these places are often unhealthy and the aren't many healthy options near by."
College Sophomore,2,"I hear boys and girls can only be in each other's rooms at certain times and EVERYBODY'S door must be open. I understand they don't want people sleeping around at a religious school but college is a time to be treated as though you are responsible so that you may learn to be responsible.  Drugs and alcohol are prohibited on campus, which is nice for someone who's not into that. Also, LGBT students are allowed to at least openly say their orientation, which is refreshing for a Christian school."
College Freshman,2,"We all come together when it comes to praising our Lord but its like it's like your a freshman in high school all over again. Trying to get yourself out there and making new friends is harder to do when living off campus then it is living on campus. You meet almost everyone in your dorms and your only friend at the moment is roommate until you meet everyone but outside the dorms, its like most of the people your round come off as stuck up and have higher standards to talking to someone when they should be acting like Christian's, not hypocrites. But on the other hand most of everyone here, almost everyone, are the sweetest people you'll ever meet, especially the professors and some of them have that southern hospitality. You defiantly have to try to put yourself out there to make the right friends."
College Sophomore,2,"Midnight curfew for Freshman and all those rushing for the ""social clubs"". Guys are girls can only visit each other in their dorm rooms on Thursday 7-11. "
Niche User,1,"The application experience with the admission was terrible! Low efficient counselor, rude staff and mangled system.
ACU seems great with its ranking, however,  during the application process,  counselors blamed the wrong amount of scholarship on the system. Plus, after the Honors college application deadline, the school required people who had already send the recommendation letters to resend it cuz of a system issue. After all this, I totally regret applying for it so I ask for enrollment deposit refund, which is $350 .The admission counselor never replied email for until April 29th, which is almost a month late after I sent the email for deposit refund. They never give the deposit back and there is no way counselor can be in touch with."
Senior,1,"After attending ACU for 4 years now, it has ruined my life. First, it can be difficult to get connected, and if you have troubles getting connected and want to transfer, it‚Äôs been set up so that it‚Äôs nearly impossible to transfer unless you want to lose many hours. When you couple this with an administration that does not care about the students or their interests, wants, and needs. In addition to this the Christian aspect of this school is borderline overbearing, between being forced to go to chapel every day and mandatory bible classes, it is easy for one to get burnt out on religion. Though we have one of the better business colleges in the state, they do a poor job of preparing students for the real world, I have been taught, ""When you get out there in the real world it's not like ACU, people will curse on the phone, and it can be hard mentally for you, but you have to keep your faith. You have to preach to the lost."". It‚Äôs not worth your money."
College Sophomore,1,"Parties are off campus, since campus is dry. I don't party, so I can't really give input on this. It is a Christian school though so if you get caught, expect consequences."
College Freshman,1,"I am simply put in the wrong place.  It is an excellent school for people with a strong Christian background/beliefs, and I am not a christian."
College Sophomore,1,They are very strict based off of tradition. And they need to adapt their policies.
College Sophomore,1,"They take their sweet time, it's a pain in the ass..."
College Freshman,1,"Greek like here BLOWS. The pledging is ridiculous and they aren't even technically srats or frats, they're ""social clubs""."
College Freshman,1,"The strictness at ACU is RIDICULOUS!!!! Even being 21, you still are not allowed to be intoxicated on or near campus grounds. The rules enforced here slightly take away the fun of being in college. If I still wanted to live with my parents or be treated like I was in high school, I would've stayed home."
College Sophomore,1,"nothing to do, and very boring town"
College Sophomore,1,"Theres absolutely nothing to do.

People that do go out to parties are looked down on, and judged and then the parties suck."
Recent Alumnus,1,campus could use a parking garage very soon
College Junior,1,If you live off-campus it is very difficult to find a student parking spot. Faculty and staff have more parking than they need.
College Junior,1,"The ""social clubs"" aren't greek affiliated. You pay too much for only grub, sing-song, formal, and pledging activities."
College Freshman,1,There is no nightlife in Abilene unless your idea of a fun weekend night in college is playing board games with your friends in the dorm.
College Sophomore,1,The bus stops running early and the only party scenes are only at homes
College Freshman,1,there are maybe one or two things to do off campus besides the usual movies and mall(which really isnt that good anyways)
College Freshman,1,our school offers no kind of transportation. we have to rely on fellow students or walk to our destination.
College Junior,1,"We have no transportation that the school offers. Abilene Christian University's campus is small compared to bigger universities so there is no need for transportation. However the public transportation around the school isn't very good either. It comes around maybe every couple hours, if that."
College Freshman,1,"very strict policies, if you break the rules, it takes a little longer than it should for a response, but when the police do arrive, they come in full force. The rules are leinient but still hold firm. Its got to be pretty serious to get the cops involved, like a supposed DUI but more than the written rules is the fear of the unspoken rules that guide most behavior at this school. Alcohol is allowed off campus, but you are not to be seen on campus with any alcohol related items. Visitation is one day a week, for inside the dorms. My advice to any student is that you should be able to respect and conform to the rules, before you even apply"
College Freshman,1,ACU has increased in diversity over the years but is still predominantly white.

Freshman,5,My online experience with Liberty University online college has been really challenging at first because it has been awhile since I have went to school but once I got the hang of everything it became very interesting and educational.
Freshman,5,What I liked about attending Liberty University is that everybody is very understanding and very helpful.
Junior,5,"Everything about the online platform is easy to use. The student dashboard contains links to Blackboard, student email, student financial information, and contains important school notices and updates."
Junior,5,"Overall experience has been very pleasant. The course work is challenging, but appropriately so. Staff and professors have all been quick to respond to questions."
Freshman,5,Liberty University is an amazing school. It not only has great education but incorporated the Bible into its classes. They use different learning styles to help you understand the subject as best as possible. The professors are amazing and are very involved. I would highly recommend considering this school. I have visited the campus and it is beautiful. I attend the school online and hope to be an on-campus resident in the future.
Freshman,5,"I am currently taking online classes. The professors make it enjoyable by using interactive study guides and videos. The professors also are very connected with their online students, often sending encouraging notes and are always available to help. They are very understanding when it comes to technical difficulties when they occur, which is not often, you contact the school and they help fix the problem right away."
Sophomore,5,Excellent university no matter how you contact them they are able to answer and help you or guide through the process. It could be from the chat room that they will guide you step by step how to enroll.
Sophomore,5,"It is an awesome experience, I am taking online courses and everything is very easy. Everything is in the course and easy to find all resources"
Senior,5,Liberty Univerity has an amazing online program that has actually inspired the state delegates to encourage state schools to create more efficient programs like Liberty.
Senior,5,"The online classes at Liberty are good and have some great information on the class subject. Also, online classes have great professors that respond quickly to students emails about the class. The work load for online classes is for the most part average."
Senior,5,My experience at Liberty University has been great. The community on campus is good and there are many hall events to go to and meet new people. The professors at Liberty are great and have a lot of knowledge on the subjects they teach.
Sophomore,5,"I took all of my classes online and it was great. I felt like I was in the classroom learning most of the time and I always felt involved even though I wasn't on campus. If you're looking for a great online program, I 100% recommend Liberty University!"

Niche User,5,Liberty University has a great friendly atmosphere. Every person that I have ad interactions with have a I will help in anyway I can attitude.  I would like the school to offer more scholarship that all their students an apply.

Junior,5,Liberty University has been great and is very military friendly. I always get a quick response and have had no issues with any of the faculty.
Junior,5,"All of my classes have been online, but the faculty have been great at responding which minimizes the feeling of being separated."
Niche User,5,"I think is a good university with great values, and also  the campus is really wonderful and security.  My sibling is a good student. Liberty University is 
growing very fast in quality and hope for this country."
Niche User,5,Someone in my family studied in Liberty University. I know all this things across testimony and also I am witness about her integrity and she is so smart
Junior,5,I took classes online through Liberty. The classes are 8 weeks and are frequently easier than the in person equivalent of the class. It was very easy to do the classes online and I enjoyed the flexibility of it.
Senior,5,Every instructor I have had so far has been  amazing. They seem to genuinely care about their students and are accessible for help when needed.
Senior,5,I have enjoyed my online learning experience to date. The instructors are very supportive and course content is just right.
Niche User,5,The customer service is insane!  Everyone is so well trained and they truly are invested in helping you not getting you off the phone.  I recently took a tour at their campus and it was shocking...pictures do not do it justice. It is cleaner than Disneyworld.   You can tell the students are champions for Christ no doubt.  I want my son to attend there and I myself am looking at going back online to finish a masters degree.
Niche User,5,I am researching everything online and looking into residential admissions for my son and online for myself as a parent.  This school is over the top in every area.  I believe God is moving at this campus and anyone would be honored to attend there.
Junior,5,"I participated as a residential student.  I took a few simple courses online, but those were mainly LU specific classes.  I transferred as a sophomore into Liberty university after doing one year at Northern Virginia Community College to save money.  The classes I took online were ones that residential freshman are supposed to take.  They were classes that helped you locate various facilities around campus as well as teach you how to study, live campus life and get involved in various activities such as clubs, athletics, student work and anything similar.  Being a college student for a year as well as having an older sibling at the university, I took these online to save myself the toil."
Junior,5,"The community, the family aspect and the overwhelming amount of resources and support that Liberty offers is incredible.  They have outstanding faculty and University operations such as housing, student accounts, finances and others that are similar.  Anyone that you talk to who is employed by the University is knowledgeable about their position and can point you in any direction you need."
Sophomore,5,"I take all classes online, and it is wonderful for freedom of my schedule. I am able to get my degree on my own time."
Sophomore,5,"The school is a wonderful chance to earn your degree online in a safe 
Christian environment. The teachers are helpful, kind, and excellent at their jobs!"
Freshman,5,I have had a easy time accessing all my information for my classes and submitting my work. The textbooks are provided online as well as ordering a looseleaf or hardback copy of the book if needed.
Freshman,5,This has been a great experience. The professors and students have been so helpful and supportive. The professors are always willing to help if you are not understanding the material. As well as the students in discussion boards and other forums.
Freshman,5,Onlime experience is great! They make you feel like your on campus! The professors help you any way they can! They are amazing!
Freshman,5,They are very helpful! They know how to help students and accommodate students as needed! They helped me figure out the plan I needed to succeed! I highly recommend.
Sophomore,5,"All classes that I have take at Liberty have been very informative and educational. The professors are helpful, compassionate, and always show concern for your success.  The staff continually demonstrate the love of Jesus Christ. They show how Christ is the answer and the rescue, redemption, and restoration that he has to offer to humanity."
Sophomore,5,"I like the compassionate professors and there understanding that the student has a personal life aside from their academic pursuits. The knowledge that you learn about Jesus Christ being the way, the truth, and the life is made evident by how the curriculum integrates Christian principles into the course work that shows that Jesus truly is the answer. There is nothing that I dislike about Liberty University because again from my personal academic pursuits at the university someone always makes time to help you, listen to you, and pray for you when you need it. Liberty University is a family."
Graduate Student,5,"This has been by far the best experience of my life. If I ever go back to school for further higher education, it will be with Liberty. They have challenged me both academically and spiritually."
Graduate Student,5,"This has been by far the best experience of my life. If I ever go back to school for further higher education, it will be with Liberty. They have challenged me both academically and spiritually."
Sophomore,5,Liberty University is a great school! They really care about their students and their success. I am thankful for my experience here.
Junior,5,Liberty equips students to enter into their desired career field with passion and competence. I have found positive individual growth while getting my education at Liberty and would not choose to attend any other school.
Freshman,5,Im a Christian and they treat you so much better than the average college . I was nervous but I truly feel this school is meant for me. I hope to get a great career after I get my associates.
Freshman,5,Im a online student and I do love this school so far. They help all of us students and all have so much patience. This school is definitely recommended for those who want to succeed in life and feel good while at it. Even have a chance to get stronger with God.
Senior,5,"Most professors offer swift responses and also offer prayer if you are going through personal situations. Online platform is easy to use. Textbooks are not purchased separately, it is included in tuition and all electronic (can purchase physical copy if you'd like)!"
Senior,5,"Excellent teachers, staff, and curriculum. For those who are Christian, the content is also tied to the Bible. I go completely online and enjoy it."
Senior,5,"Liberty has an awesome online program. My professors have been excellent, helpful, and professional. The curriculum includes a biblical worldview, and the assignments are very worthwhile. Liberty's programs are affordable and academically rewarding."

Sophomore,5,"I took classes online and enjoyed every minute of it. The professors are amazing. They pray for their students and are always willing to help. You can call them and send them emails. No matter where you live around the country, they are always their for you. You never feel alone and they walk through each week of classes with you. They are very encouraging and they love when their students talk about Jesus Christ. I enjoy going to school at Liberty and cannot wait to finish up my degree with them!"
Sophomore,5,Liberty University is an amazing college. They stand behind their Christian values. The professors are nice and easy to talk to. They are always willing to help in anyway they can. The students that I have come to know are always polite and ready to help! I enjoy Liberty University.
Alum,5,"Online classes were laid out really well. Initially, it was a bit of a learning curve, but I think that's always the case when starting something new. The professors were very helpful, easy to contact by email, and very understanding and supportive."
Alum,5,"I love that I was able to transfer so many credits. They were always helpful when I called and were proficient at helping me find any information I needed. The professors were very helpful, easy to contact by email, and very understanding and supportive."
Niche User,5,I have not started but have met some incredible people on the phone.  They are all customer service oriented.
Graduate Student,5,"The online program is awesome. The instructors give helpful information and provide email access for any questions that need answering. Most of the time, they will have the school work graded in a timely manner with plenty of comments to help you improve on the next assignment."
Senior,5,Responsive and helpful professors. Curriculum that accurately pertains to your desired field of study and is never too confusing.
Senior,5,It employs professors who are effective instructors who also imparts the heart of God in their academic instructions and performance to their students.
Senior,5,"I had a very rewarding experience with each of my online instructors. I have studied with Liberty University for a few years and have learned a lot over those years. The professors were very efficient and i,parted a spirit of excellence in their communication with the students."
Freshman,5,"Definitely the school for Christians, those who are passionate about service and Christ. I'm so happy to be here and couldn't imagine going anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"At Liberty, most of us living on campus are doing residential. There are hybrid and online options if so chosen."
Graduate Student,5,Excellent school and Professors. Really enjoy the online setup which make it convient for me to balance my worklife and as well in pursuing my educational endeavours.
Graduate Student,5,Excellent school and Professors. Really enjoy the online setup which make it convient for me to balance my worklife and as well in pursuing my educational endeavours.
Senior,5,One of the best in the nation. The teachers answer questions in a timely manner and grade everything very effectively. When I started I was nervous but as a recent graduate I can say it’s well worth it.
Senior,5,The college is great for military students. I was a student who came from another school after joining the military. They greeted me with open arms and gave me the best experience.
Freshman,5,I am a new student and everyone I have been in contact with have been wonderful. Its like a one stop shop for an online student.
Niche User,4,The online classes were taught very well. If you are someone who is self-motivated you will not have a hard time getting through the semsters. The classes required a good amount of online textbook readings and lectures. You are also required to do weekly discussion boards which help you interact with your professor and classmates.
Freshman,4,"I have, with Liberty University, all the advantages of integrated programs for online learning, though I choose to take a paper-work approach to my education, rather than utilize the integration."
Junior,4,"The school as a whole is great. The professor care so much about each student and there success. The campus as a whole is beautiful and the missions statement of this school is portrayed in all of its actions. The only negative thing is the school is very political, or at least was with the former president of the school. Because of this a lot of negative backlash has been placed on the school. Regardless of this aspect the school still makes sure that that feedback doesn’t portray the students at liberty. Most if not all of the students and staff at liberty are all so welcoming and desire to encourage each other. The atmosphere is very good for a college student."
Junior,4,The online classes are my favorite. The professors are still personal and the material provided in each course is just as helpful as if you were in an actual class setting.
Junior,4,"Administration has been rough the past year or so and has lost sight of the purpose and mission of the university. However, the atmosphere of the campus is good and there is always something fun to do."
Sophomore,4,"The online classes I took freshman year were great. I could do the work on my own time, but it was also easy to get behind in them."
Sophomore,4,"I first experienced online learning experience at Liberty through the Pandemic. Liberty handled that so well, and the experience of online school was great and smooth."
Junior,4,The online learning experience with Liberty has been mostly positive for me. There are a few areas that could benefit with some improvement but the online professors really make sure to be available to students and assist them with any difficulties they run into.
Alum,4,"Liberty's online classes vary quite a bit.  I've had online courses that I felt were very rigorous and well done, and I've had others that felt like they were just herding the cattle through.  Research your major thoroughly before deciding. This makes a huge difference!"
Alum,4,"The faculty at Liberty are amazing people.  Liberty truly does recruit the best.  The administration is ATROCIOUS, but I am hoping that Falwell's recent departure will trigger some deep and meaningful reflection within the remaining administration and lead to positive changes."
Niche User,4,"Have not started yet. Therefore, I am not able to rate the actual learning experience.  The service I have received with enrolling is top of the line."
Freshman,4,"I am taking one online class right now, the course is Univ 101.  As of right now the course is going along well.  Liberty University is currently using Canvas to give out homework assignments and exams."
Freshman,4,"As of right now my overall experience is going really well.  The campus is very nice, the classes are as expected, the professors are very understanding to the problems of students, especially COVID-19."
Graduate Student,4,The teachers a re very helpful and the campus is beautiful. The other students are open to helping with anything they can as well.
Senior,4,"Online learning is something that everyone, regardless of how well you normally do in school, will have to make an adjustment. Luckily, Liberty provides countless resources to make studying easy. Self-discipline is very much required in order to succeed at any online school. Liberty has professors that are always available if you have any questions at all, and they make it feel like a real college experience"
Freshman,4,The program and the people are very nice. I am excited to start school with them! They gave me a lot of financial aid this year which helps my family and I a lot.
Freshman,4,"Due to covid, a lot of information happened through the internet. Liberty was very organized and I felt very welcomed even though I was not physically there."
Alum,4,"The Social Work department was helpful and knowledgable. They were willing to assist anytime there were questions or issues. I did not always agree with the administrative views of the president, but the professors were always top-notch."
Junior,4,"I'm not someone who handles online learning well, but Liberty made it very easy to learn during the COVID shutdown."
Junior,4,I love almost everything about Liberty! The only thing I would change would be having more common areas in dorms to hang out with friends of a different gender.
Freshman,4,I have not yet to start my new journey with Liberty University. My start date for the fall semester has been scheduled for 08/24/2020.
Freshman,4,"I have not yet to start my new journey with Liberty University. My start date for the fall semester has been scheduled for 08/24/2020. So far, the customer service I have received however, has been very pleasant."
Freshman,4,"Liberty university is a great place to go to school, the only reason I give it a 4 is the very frustrating financial aid process. It took them almost 3 months to give me an award letter."
Junior,4,"This is a great school to attend! Aside from the many many rules, I love it here! This school surpasses my expectations and especially through academic s"
Freshman,4,I’ve enjoyed the staff that I’ve come into contact with over the phone. They’ve been very helpful in making sure I’m getting all required paperwork filled out before the deadlines.

Graduate Student,4,Liberty University is a fantastic place for higher education for those who want to learn more about their passions from a Christ-centered perspective and lens.
Sophomore,4,"So far a lovely experience with something for everyone (going into sophomore year). Always looking forward to return to campus, even on breaks."
Sophomore,4,"Made a swift transition to online learning, no doubt in part due to their superb online university. It was easy to follow and pick up with minimal trouble and maximum support."
Senior,4,"I have had a wonderful experience at Liberty University. The professors here are challenging, but they are willing to help students succeed in any way possible. They are understanding and helpful in many ways."
Senior,4,"I will start classes online in the Fall, so I can't fully evaluate the online learning experience yet. I'm looking forward to getting started!"
Senior,4,I decided to return to school to finish my BA and chose Liberty because they provide a generous tuition discount to military spouses. I was happy that they accepted all of my credits too. Everyone I have talked to has been friendly and helpful.
Junior,4,"i went back to college after 20 years ad this is one of the best decisions I've made.  I haven't begun classes yet, but the staff is very helpful and willing to go that extra mile. I have friends and family who either live near the campus or ha visited the area and all agree that it's beauiful"
Graduate Student,4,I am about to embark on the online learnign experience. It is too early to say. Professor-student relationship is unbeknownst to me. But it should be positive.
Graduate Student,4,"What I like about Liberty University is their customer service. The poeple are genuinely interested in you, are knowledge and efficient with convenient hours. I would like to see extended hours, but alas they are on the east coast, so is the time zone"
Graduate Student,4,"I loved my online experience. It allowed me to work full time and still receive a quality education. I was able to connect with other students, my professors and advisors as needed. The material was also very applicable to my work."
Niche User,4,Personally I have never taken an online class at Liberty University but i have heard great things about the classes and professors.
Niche User,4,"Liberty University is a very respectable place that has a gorgeous campus and very kind staff. Liberty students, and even residents of the surrounding communities have many opportunities of entertainment through the University."
Junior,4,"I mostly love the school due to everyone you meet pointing you to God and being able to grow your faith as well as your education, but President Falwell does not have the school's best interest in mind when he posts on social media and the speakers that are invited to Convocation are very one-sided that has caused students like myself to question their schooling. Other issues include an unreasonable increase in housing, nonstop construction, lack of food options for those with special diets (like pescatarian and vegan), and some professors lack of correct knowledge."
Freshman,4,"I have not started my online classes yet, but I am excited for them. I have heard great things about Liberty University's online classes."
Freshman,4,I haven't started as a student but as of now it has been very helpful and they work with you and your needs.
Senior,4,"I took online classes and I truly enjoyed them. The professors were very helpful and they always offered their assistance with the courses. There is an option for free online textbooks which helps with the cost of school supplies, etc. There is also options for online tutoring if needed."
Senior,4,"Liberty's professors are generally good at communicating with their online students. I have taken at least 8 courses online with Liberty, and they have a good learning culture. With any online class, you have to be more self-motivated to learn. You're only going to get out of a course what effort you put in."
Junior,4,An environment that is unlike all other colleges I've visited and have heard about. The people are amazing and push you to be better. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved on campus. A great place to learn more about the Christian faith.
Junior,4,Quizlet is a great tool and has helped me a lot in terms of my online education. The Liberty Online program is good. I am able to take online classes instead of residential which helps me better manage my time.
Graduate Student,4,I loved the flexibility offered through Liberty Universities online program. The coursework was relevant and the professors were responsive. I especially loved learning through interactions with other online students and their perspectives/experiences.
Sophomore,4,"I liked that despite how different the student body is in terms of backgrounds and different upbringings, all if not most students have similar set morals that are surrounded by diverse opinions and ways of thinking."
Freshman,4,"Great facilities and all the resources that a student could ever need! The scenery is also beautiful and the campus is great for exercising too as one walks to either class, dorm, or the cafeteria."
Senior,4,"Some professors at Liberty do a great job leveraging online platforms to increase sharing of work and student engagement, while others are average. I feel the value of my education is good and the online classes have really been what I needed to finally complete my degree, but there is always some room for improvement."
Sophomore,4,"Liberty University offers so much flexibility with course schedules, terms, sub terms, online classes, traditional campus classes, and is very good at communication and over communicating deadline dates to register for classes for subterms. I love that I can complete 2 or 3 full classes in a semester as an online student, with only one class at a time, because I split them up over the sub terms. However, it is expensive. But you get what you pay for and the education is awesome. Instructors are very responsive. Financial aid office is also very responsive. I do not like, however, that they advertise books are included and it is exclusively virtual textbooks. If you like to hold a book in your hands, you have to buy it. So actually, books aren't included with tuition. That was misleading."
Graduate Student,4,This is a great school. The administration is very efficient. I do not agree with their politics. But I did receive a great education.
Junior,4,"Wonderful University! Staff is excellent, and are an awesome support system. Classes are interesting and course work is appropriate."
Freshman,4,I'm a new online student and haven't been in school in over 25 years. The ease on enrolling in the degree program I wanted was a relief. The fact that Liberty is faith based learning was also what drew me to the school.
Sophomore,4,I finished up my freshman year . Because of COVID 19 it was completely different then I imagined. But University allowed me stay on campus and I am thankful and safe for that. Also finished on Deans list for my first year.
Sophomore,4,Lot of our classes were moved to online with virus and school was able to handle that seamlessly. With Liberty already having close to 100k students online they were well prepared to move on campus students to online keep them safe .
Junior,4,"Online classes are generally straight forward and well taught, though they do tend to be easier than residential classes."
Freshman,4,"Liberty online classes are done very well. Because of covid-19, all of my classes were moved online. I am a music major, so some of the classes were difficult to do online. However, the professors worked hard to make sure the classes were still effective and made it possible for everyone to succeed, regardless of where they were."
Senior,4,"Liberty University is an excellent school. It has great programs, wonderful professors, and the online portion is easy to follow. The only issue I have had was with their online chat portal. A couple of the employees on live chat were a little distant and not contributing much to the conversation. Other than that, I have had a great experience!"
Graduate Student,4,Great school with an extremely professional and dedicated staff. The course load was just a bit too religious for me.
Freshman,4,The staff in all departments have been extremely helpful and knowledgeable which has made a big difference.  Liberty offers online classes without requirements of having at least one on-site visit which is so convenient. They have made everything so much easier and put my mind to ease when all of this can be very nerve-wracking.
Niche User,2,"It's now a PYOPB school. So for all your ""pool cleaning needs"" make sure you bring along that  expert when you move onto campus."
Sophomore,2,Super easy but hard to get a response back from teachers. Would love if there was more teaching ways for online .
Freshman,2,"I am currently in a Global Studies class to explore the field. The prof is super sweet; however, all we do (5 weeks in) is talk about the Bible verses that tell us to evangelize. We have learned nothing about other cultures and we are already through Asia. I get this is an entrance into the field but it's given me nothing about actual Global Studies. Most people here are friendly. If you disagree on a topic then you can get slammed. Personally, I have found people that I don't agree with and they accept me. It is NOT a diverse campus politically & Liberty plays it off like being a republican is the truth (as if it is part of the Bible). They do not disassociate politics and their religion. If you are a conservative Christian then cool, maybe you will like it here but you will hear terrible arguments for your political beliefs so don't use any of the ones Liberty gives you and be aware you are not getting all sides of ANY argument."
Sophomore,2,"Liberty is perfect for people pleasers and those who care about popularity. Not to mention the constant political agenda of the administration. I absolutely love the programs and education but the constant push of politics and cookie-cutter “christian” girls who care only about how their instagrams look and don’t actually reach out to people different than themselves is killing me. Unless you have a complete understanding of who you are and who you wanna be before college, you’ll turn into a basic person."
Junior,2,"I love the faculty and staff. They are super kind and caring despite their terrible pay. I do not like their obvious political affiliation. As a liberal arts school they should push for more open ideas, such that their students can make more informed political decisions"
Alum,2,"Liberty University seems to be all about money.  The required books are usually texts written by the staff and electronically published by the bookstore at the price of hardcopy books.  The curriculum is watered down, I think in order to keep students from dropping or flunking out."
Sophomore,2,"It's a typical Christian school; rich, conservative, and religious. Liberty does not allow and believe the students should engage in drugs, sex before marriage, or stay out late. There is not a lot of diversity, although we have students from all 50 states and around the world, majority of the student body is white. It's awkward if you come from a diverse/city like place and then get thrown into small country in the middle of nowhere literally. Even though we have the #1 dining hall, just no. The campus is small but the facility and the gym is amazing. The teachers care and are great, but a lot of the students are either home schooled or private schooled, getting placed in another bubble. Some of them never even seen an Asian before and some are racist. There's a lot of pretty girls and handsome guys. Seriously, what 20 year old has a curfew on Wednesdays to be back in the dorms by 10. Oh yeah, you get fined if you don't do chores like taking out the trash every MON,WED,FRI."
Freshman,2,"Other than the beautiful campus, this school is horrible. Lynchburg is old and run down, without any city life. This school does not cater to minorities, or acknowledge them in any sense. There are way too many rules."
Senior,2,"My experience with Liberty has had its ups and downs. In terms of positive experiences, I can say gratefully say that I met my now husband at the university, I had some of the best professors ever, and my faith was definitely supported. However, there are numerous negative aspects that I associate with Liberty, as I could only attend residentially for 2 years before I had to switch to their online program due to financial reasons. I received absolutely no financial help from the school even though I am one of eight children with a dad who is on disability and cannot work. I also found the people there to be quite lukewarm and even fake in their faith, and I did not sustain a single true, lasting friendship there. I have also found there to be many rules which inconvenience the students more than benefit them."
Sophomore,2,"Liberty is very suppressing on your abilities. They can be very harassing academically and on an administrative level. Never trust anything they tell you, because they will likely change their stance after they say something. Professors are not here to educate. Most professors in my experience don't care if you comprehend the material but rather you get decent grades."
College Junior,2,not much besides campus events
Recent Alumnus,2,"While the individual housing options are relatively new, resident life is not as enjoyable as it could be.  The RA's are basically your new mother, checking to see if you're in bed on time, doing your chores, and are personally invasive because they're forced into it. (It doesn't feel like they really care.)

The housing is pretty convenient to classes and the rest of campus, especially with the bus system, but the housing process is awful because they don't have enough room for the number of students."
College Sophomore,2,at my school we do not have a greek life because it is a Christian university.
College Senior,2,I am not sure about any health and safety services on campus.
College Student,2,"Nightlife at Liberty University sucks. It is a christian institution, therefore, certain things like partying and going to a club are prohibited."
College Student,2,"There is absolutely no party scenes on campus. Liberty University is a christian institution, therefore, there are no such thing as parties on campus."
College Freshman,2,Every time Jerry Falwell opens his mouth he devalues our degrees
College Freshman,2,"Not really much help, if your trying to get a job on campus for work study then you most likely won't get one unless you have experience working for the particular job positions that are open. And if you want an intership, then your going to be stuck with doing a missions or a summer camp because that's mainly what they offer. I suggest looking outside of the school."
College Freshman,2,Had a lot of trouble with the advising Department.  But now I have a new advisor in which I  care about.
College Freshman,2,Who cares?  I am an adult learner.
College Junior,2,I was never told of any Greek life on our campus so I don't know what that is.
College Senior,2,If your not hardcore religious don't even think about coming here. Staff is awful and unhelpful
College Sophomore,2,"Being a christian college, its very difficult to find an actual party."
College Sophomore,2,the hassle of not knowing all that you need to do. they getting back to you in a timely fashion. sucks so bad
College Sophomore,2,Parties are not at my school unless they are off campus.
College Freshman,2,There are many rules and regulations to live by. Most of them are for the good of the students however some are unnecessary. At that age students need to be making their own decisions.
College Freshman,2,There are limited options/ Unfortunately with it being a private school there aren't many loans.
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many parties at Liberty University due to its stand as a Christian school. Most parties can be found off-campus for those persons that are interested in the ""party scene."""
College Sophomore,2,"The mini-rot has been served hot dogs for the past week, most of which are still uncooked internally. As well as the tater tots. It's just gross. The Rot has no variety other than the same food everyday."
College Senior,2,"Talking to the financial aid office is a headache, and there's usually a line."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no parties on campus. There may be some around town, but none on campus."
College Sophomore,2,They barely offer any scholarships or aid to students. Many students are stuck paying out of pocket or with loans.
College Sophomore,2,We have many rules at Liberty which in a way hurt the college experience because we don't get to make many choices for ourselves. Although the rules are of course there for a reason and to keep us safe its hard to learn to make your own decisions when you don't have much room to decide.
College Freshman,2,Make sure you file as EARLY as possible! Its long.
College Sophomore,2,I really enjoy the fact that there are very few parties at Liberty. This makes the community safer and students are impacted positively.
College Junior,2,"Hahahahaaa. Seriously, you can get banned from school for drinking or sex or drugs. So yeah, no real parties."
College Freshman,2,I am in the Military and accustomed to structure and order.  Things were not organized at all in the Admissions department.  The school uses the Work Study students to man the telephone line and it's all about who you get on the phone. So you never know when you are going to get that chital eye looking over you paperwork or not.  Being in the Military I have mastered the art of working with others to get what I want so I have literally call constantly to verify information to almost stay ahead of them with my information or I will be the one suffering the consequences.
College Junior,2,"Food tax in Lynchburg is ridiculous. Above 11% in Lynchburg, just outside the city limits the food tax is lower."
College Junior,2,Previous students and school decisions have left a bad taste in the local's mouths about students from Liberty University. Students do community service in an attempt to reconcile lost relationships with locals from Lynchburg who have been in the area since the school began in 1971. Relationships are improving in some areas and worsening in others.
College Junior,2,"There are no parties on campus, but if you know the right people you can find the best parties off campus"
College Sophomore,2,I've never gotten a scholarship.
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid was a hassle. My student loans were dropped at one point through no fault of mine and scholarships that I should have received were denied. The only ""good"" thing is that they were good with extending deadlines -- which wouldn't have needed to be extended if they had not mishandled the situation."
College Freshman,2,there is absolutely nothing spectacular about Lynchburg
College Junior,2,"General feel is that they aren't very accepting, esp of the LBGT community and liberals."
College Senior,2,"Lynchburg is awful. There is not much to do or see. Maybe if I had a car, there would be more. The school campus tries to make it exciting, and they do a pretty good job, but I wasn't interested in anything nearby. The train station is close, and it isn't that far to other places like Annapolis."
College Sophomore,2,"In my case, getting a dorm on campus sucks because of my financial aid. Lately, I have been struggling to do the Financial Check-In on time before the deadline because of inconvenience with my parents' IRS Tax Return Transcript, and additional documents that is needed in order to get my financial aid package. I was recently told that if I don't do my financial aid by July 1st, my housing option will be dropped, and my classes as well, and I might have to go back to living at the same dorm place that I was in my freshman year, which I hated."
College Senior,2,My worst complaint about Liberty dining is that offers terrible menus and everything closes way too early. No late night options at all.
College Sophomore,2,the food that they serve us is horrible and there is not too much to choose from
College Sophomore,2,there isn't many African American people that attend liberty
College Sophomore,2,The school can get a little boring at times. the same activities that we are already used to are available leaving us to wonder what else is there to do.
College Sophomore,2,Personally it has been filled with rules that are annoying to deal with in a college environment and at times it feels as though I am back in middle school with all the rules and guidelines to follow.
College Sophomore,2,"The availability for off campus fills up fast, and it can be very difficult to try to move off campus because Liberty University wants you to live on campus all for years of your education. Many of the apartment secretaries do not answer their phones and at times are not good at answering question and willing to help you out when you are in a time of need. The convenience to reliable but however could be much better, the buses are sometime late and sometimes too early it can be hard to plan your schedule around the buses because it becomes hard for me not on time for class and knowing I can not afford a car can be very frustrating."
College Sophomore,2,"It is very expensive to buy a parking pass, when trying to find a place to park it can be very difficult and can also make students late for class. Many people are angry that they buy a parking permit for a certain are to park on campus and there is not enough room for them. When you try to park in the area you are assigned to by your parking permit many times you will get towed but the school does inform students on where they can park to the point where they will not get towed. It is quite frustrating and also confusing all together."
College Sophomore,2,"There are so many students that spots are always filled and if you park somewhere illegally, your car WILL get towed and/or ticketed."
College Sophomore,2,I still need help.. I dont know what else to do
College Student,2,There should not be a need for a curfew
College Sophomore,2,The local weather is very back and forth. Also it rains a lot in this area
College Freshman,2,Network needs updating for the amount of people using it.
College Sophomore,2,There's not much to do at night.
College Freshman,2,There aren't many healthy or vegetarian options.
Freshman,1,"Terrible!  Do not waste your time coming to this school!  They are a fraud! They will keep your money and they lied to you over the phone just to get you into the school but once you're in there, they treat you like a slave and a dog!"
Freshman,1,"This is an awful school and disgrace to the body of Christ!  They are crooked, uncaring, liars and will keep your money, won't let you get your financial aid and pell grants and all around a fraud!  They should be investigated and closed down!  They have already been exposed, now the whole school need be exposed.  Do not spend your money and come to this school.  Enroll in a better school! Terrible Terrible Terrible!!"
Niche User,1,Do not!!! And I repeat do not apply to the school unless you know for sure that you want to attend the school. This school will hold onto your funds i.e your pell grants and your financial aid loans not allowing the school that you currently attend to use the funds in order to pay for your classes. You will complete an entire term at another school and they will still not update the Board of Education even if you have never attended a single class at their school. Do not and I repeat do not apply to the school unless you know for a fact that you will attend.

Alum,1,I was going here online to finish my master's degree. They made me start off with math even though I stated I was nervous and they made me repeat the math class 2-3 times in a row even though I would have found it better to do something different so as to get off the failing streak. The professors were horrible at responding to emails and they were rude when I would ask them for help.
Alum,1,"Jerry Jr. is a spoiled brat and should have never taken the helm of LU. Why is it that the Holy Spirit tells parents that they will inherit the family business (sorry I mean Ministry) like John Hagee gives it to his son. Billy Graham gives it to his son Franklin who is not smart enough to keep his mouth shut, oh and Franklins Son Will Graham ( who I went to school with at LU) is on the board of Liberty and the Billy Graham association as well.  Seems like a conflict of interest to me Oh and Charles Stanley wanted his son Andy .... who went to Dallas Seminary to take over his ministry (I like Charlie) 

Nobody has ever been able to explain why God works this way seems like keeping an empire in the family oh and then there is Copoeland and his family!

Discusting!

D"
Graduate Student,1,"After experiencing a severe injury, my grades slacked and I was academically suspended. I provided the proper paperwork, was readmitted, the financial aid questioned my award after all my loans were paid. I feel that they required more than God Himself. 
How can a Christian institution not celebrate an individual's healing and return to normal life. 
I decided to complete my degree at another Christian University."
Graduate Student,1,"BEWARE of the ""positive"" reviews.... there are thousands of negative reviews that will never make it to these sites based on students simply wanting their experiences at Liberty to just be over and done with. Online doctoral program is a joke. No one cares to help. You are a number to them with a dollar sign over your head, that is all. No one, administration or instructors, are held accountable for the way the treat students so horribly. You can beg for help and they will tell you that they will pray for you. Please, stay away from this school. You will only regret it."
Junior,1,"I HATE this school. I was part of the online program as a military student, and they are the least helpful people when it comes to submitting financial aid via Tuition Assistance and receiving Pell Grant money from the Federal Gov. If you're military and an online student, do NOT apply to this joke of a school. They claim to prioritize military, they do not. Go to American Military University if you want to be respected and treated like you matter."
Graduate Student,1,"Do not believe any positive reviews. This school is literally a group of soliciting, telemarketing hypocrites. You will waste your time and money if you do not heed this advice."
Graduate Student,1,I am a survivor of human trafficking. I was abducted and raped when I was 19 years old and was sold into the sex trade. I came to Liberty University in 2013 and graduated in 2015 with my bachelors degree. I was bullied very severely at this university and was re traumatized by the way I was treated. People bullied me frequently. I was called derogatory names and sexually harassed. I tried to report the abuse but no one did anything to protect me.  I hate this school. Had a terrible experience.
Alum,1,They are not willing to work with students with disabilities.  They have documentation and still will tell you that it does not matter if you have a legitimate reason for not attending or not.
Freshman,1,One of the worst experience of my life. Everyone is fake and the whole school is just broken. PLEASE DO NOT GO
Freshman,1,"Said that anyone could attend & that one's personal beliefs would not affect their grades.  Lies!  The registration dept will do & say anything to get people to register!  I was told that I wouldn't need books for certain classes because they're available online through LUO & a week before that class is due to start I receive an email from the prof telling us that we need to make sure we have our books.  Registration was horrible.  The lady was so rude with me about my financial situation.  I was brought to tears & she mocked me for being upset.  Their instructions are extremely poor.  Assignments make no sense.  Their instructions contradict themselves.  They grade rough drafts.  Their online system is horrible.  It's constantly having issues.  They said to download Firefox because it worked best with their site but then another class told me I had to have Google Chrome.  How can you not create a site that works entirely with at least one browser?  MBS Direct, LLC, is a scam."
Graduate Student,1,Horrible. The people are so fake down here. Worst decision of my life. I should have known that but it is too late into my program to switch out.
College Sophomore,1,The only parties are off campus and even then it is very low key.
College Sophomore,1,There is no nightlife. There is also a curfew for dorms.
College Sophomore,1,There's no Greek life because Jerry thinks it's a sin for brothers and sisters to come together to give back to the community and empower one another and that if we do that well all go to hell
College Junior,1,Doesn't Apply we don't have that at our school
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely no Greek life!!
College Student,1,Liberty University has a no tolerance for drugs and alcohol on campus. In fact if caught with drugs or alcohol on campus there is a high chance of one getting expelled from the university. The Liberty Way prohibits the use of alcohol on campus and violating the Liberty Way has huge consequences.
College Sophomore,1,"It does not exist on our campus, but most students appreciate that."
College Freshman,1,There is absolutely no drugs or alcohol allowed on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Considering Liberty University does not have Sororities or a Greek Life, it would be hard to rate this section of the survey."
College Freshman,1,We do not even have a Greek-Life. There isn't any Greek-Life here at Liberty and I think our school is better for it. I didn't want to go to a school that promoted partying and drinking. That was my entire high school career.
College Sophomore,1,"Well, LU doesn't have Greek life. LU isn't missing much though, I was in the process of joining a sorority at my old college."
College Junior,1,"Liberty University does not have any fraternities, sororities, or Greek life."
College Freshman,1,Lived at the annex which was the worst mistake of my life. The food was awful and the bus system suck since we didn't even live on the campus. And some of the people were rude and just plain weird.
College Freshman,1,"SOME of the people are nice but if you don't fit within the ""liberty bubble"" then they treat you like your not welcomed. Teachers will judge you and not grade you for your work but the way you look. Even though it's a christian school some people still do ""secular things"" i.e. premarital sex, party, take drugs, etc. even though they'd go to church that sunday and praise God. The school is a standing advertisement and they use the students money for all this unneccessary construction instead of giving students more financial aid instead of something else to pay for.The only things I like about this school was the friends I made. I think the only time I will EVER step foot on Liberty campus again is to visit my friends."
College Sophomore,1,"Our school doesn't believe in Greek life, not does it participate in it."
College Freshman,1,There are no fraternities here at this school.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,"There is very little partying at Liberty, as it is a conservative Christian school."
College Freshman,1,"There are some parties I hear about, but honestly I am not here to drink my brains out. I have a great time with friends playing sports and just hanging out."
College Freshman,1,"Liberty's party scene really is the worst, and they are proud of that fact. As for me, I love the no-party atmosphere-- it feels a lot more wholesome, studious, and fun."
College Freshman,1,Parties only really happen off-campus so not many students participate regularly.
College Sophomore,1,"I live off campus, and I don't party anyway.  I'm assuming that there is limited partying because it is a Christian private university."
College Freshman,1,"People can have fun, small parties at Liberty but drinking, drugs, sex etc is not allowed.  If people are going to party like that they go off campus."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life? What's that? 

Newsflash: Liberty doesn't do Greek Life. Or parties."
College Freshman,1,THERE IS NO PARTY SCENE. Has anyone mentioned that even DANCING is FORBIDDEN? Good grief!
College Sophomore,1,"Unless I  am doing something wrong I am not receiving hardly any financial aid. I am going to have to also pay for flight training, to make matters worse, and I have know idea where the money will come from."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life
College Junior,1,We have no Greek life here
College Freshman,1,"Going to a school named ""Liberty University"" is the most contradictory statement as we go to a school with no liberty guaranteed to it's students. We have curfew every night. 12:30 on weekends, and girl R.A.s watch you like hawks. No parties for Liberty students."
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life at Liberty University.
College Freshman,1,I'm not sure if Liberty University has Greek Life on campus?
College Freshman,1,SO STRICT DONT GO HERE UNLESS YOU CAN FOLLOW ALL THE RULES WITH NO PROBLEM
College Freshman,1,very hard to find scholarships
College Junior,1,There is no off campus housing explicitly related to the school.
College Senior,1,"The Penalty for drinking is fines of over $100, and possible expulsion from the school.  Curfew is enforced at 12 a.m.   The party scene is terrible."
College Senior,1,There is no Greek Life at this University.
College Senior,1,"I hate the administration of this university and the ridiculous rules.  Students get fined for the most minor of offenses.  The RAs are stricter than most parents.  It is a strict private, uptight school that does not allow students to voice their opinions.  The first amendment can't be exercised much as this school."
College Freshman,1,"Im in my third week of school, and they still want $1,000. My finical covered most of it, but I don't have that kind of money."
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life or fraternities at our school.
College Senior,1,There is not Greek life at Liberty.
College Sophomore,1,"The local area is friendly toward students but, is painfully uneventful with very little to do."
College Sophomore,1,"There are hardly any parties available also if you do happen to find one and go to it you could run into issues with the schools strict rules regarding drinking, dancing, and curfew."
College Junior,1,All this money they are putting into the school you'd think they would have cheaper parking and more lots.
College Sophomore,1,The wind in Lynchburg is ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,There is no drug or alcohol scene at this university as they don't allow it

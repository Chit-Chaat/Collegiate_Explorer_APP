Sophomore,5,"Interaction with many different cultural societies.  As a new student, I questioned my decision to leave my home and the safety of my homeland.  As I entered this strange new world, I remained very distant from everyone.  But, within the first week of being alone in this new environment.  I was welcomed and accepted by everyone I met.  This new location, turned into a new home.  The campus, people and standards of living were very positive.  I was no longer a stranger, in foreign land. 
There are many different Indigenous cultures in this little community.  We are different, but all the same.  My knowledge gained from different people, was that we have many similar background history and society values.  These are valued as treasured in the knowledge I have gained in one year.  I respectfully encourage my younger generation to seek education and knowledge of the many amazing people in our world, locally and international.  My world has changed to a happy and positive outlook on life."
Sophomore,5,"I’m not the average college student. Before discovering IAIA, I was twenty years old waiting tables at Pizza Hut. I was barely making any money during that time. I came to a point where I was tired of going home and smelling like pizza. I wanted more. Music has always been my passion, and to be able to do music full time, I decided that I needed to further my education. After resigning from Pizza Hut, I went to speak with the director of the education department in my Pueblo. I had asked if there were any art schools near me where I could be able to get the education I wanted. That’s when I was told about the Institute of American Indian Arts. 
I’m attending school here to gain my bachelor’s degree in Cinematic Arts and Technology. Media is a powerful tool and it’s also influential, especially in the time we are living."
Junior,5,Institute of American Indian Arts is a wonderful university for creative people who want to make a cultural difference within the world or their communities. I have not been accepted yet but I will be.
Junior,5,"IAIA is the cheapest film school to attend. However, the instructors and the hands on activities are very well put together. Santa Fe is the perfect place for to shoot film, as the environment is beautiful. The people at IAIA are awesome."
Freshman,5,It's a great atmosphere to be around. So ma y people are supportive of your dreams and it's more like a family rather than just another school.
Niche User,5,"I really liked the tour they gave me, it was very open and welcoming. The campus was bigger than I thought and met my expectations."
Freshman,5,"The Institute of American Indian Arts is a prestigious art college in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It has so much to offer and has so many amazing opportunities. I am able to be surrounded by talented, one of a kind students and faculty. The atmosphere here is like no other. Being able to live in one of the best art towns in the country really makes the whole experience so much more valuable. There are artists of all types; from sculptors, to painters, to stunning jewelry makers. There is such a rich environment here. I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else."
Graduate Student,5,Very good experience at the college. The teacher to student ratio is excellent. I would recommend the MFA Creative Writing Program to all my colleleages
Freshman,5,"It was a very well driven experience. Even though I am still a freshman of this school, I think it's insanely outstanding academic wise. If you're an artist, you will feel at home. Here at the Institute of American Indian Arts residential building, we try to make everyone feel welcomed and included with our activities. Everyone is open-minded and amazing people. They will forever bring a smile to your face. You do not have to like everyone, but you must respect one-another."
Sophomore,5,I had a great personal growth and development experience. Learned so much about my heritage and culture.
College Junior,5,Our administration does a lot to help students and put students in mind when making decisions towards the school.
College Junior,5,"There are a lot of students who chose off-campus housing over dorm housing just because the city/town is very unique and interesting. The rent is reasonable and before school starts, advisers will help you look for a place off-campus."
College Junior,5,"My town has lots of different characteristics that make the city unique. The downtown area has many different interesting stores, restaurants and shops that are all in walking distance of each other. The institute I attend is a little ways out of town, but just enough to make quick trips if you ever run out of school or dorm supplies. The locals are very nice to students and also seem very open to meeting them. The atmosphere is different from where I originally come from but I like it and have adjusted to it a great deal."
College Sophomore,5,Dorm  life  at IAIA  is  good  alot  of  the  students  get  along. IAIA  is  a  Native  school  so  each  of  us  try  to  look  after  each  other
College Sophomore,5,"IAIA  has  a  wonderful  organic cafeteria, filled  with  a  variety  of  food  choices and  will also  accommodate  for  those who  can,t  eat  what  is  on  the  menu"
College Sophomore,5,IAIA  is  a  very  cultural  campus. IAIA  always  provides   traditional ceremonies  and  entertainment  to their  students.
College Junior,5,I enjoy the many choices it gives especially so close! It's nice to be able to go to a restaurant that isn't 30 miles away.
College Freshman,5,"The Dorm rooms at IAIA are perfect for college students. The first floor of the dorms are for boys and the second floor is the girls floor. There are specially key cards which allow only people that live on those floors to enter unless let in by someone on that floor. You can have a room mate or have a room to yourself and each room has a full bathroom with a shower bathtub. Each floor has a coomon room with a big screen, computers, and a full size kitchen. There is always a staff memeber around to help you and during the day always an RA around. If you have a family and can't live in the dorms there is family housing on campus. Family housing consists of 2 bedroom duplexs and is a very reasonable price to live with child care included."
College Sophomore,5,Stellar art college professors want to see students to succeed and go extra mile for you
College Freshman,5,There are two major study areas for students. The library and the SSC or Student Success Center. The library is usually for private study and reading. The SSC is occupied with tutors to help with any questions and help edit papers. Both of these places are state of the art and contain the most recent computer equipment and programs.
Senior,4,It a fairly small campus but it's great for one on one teaching. The smallest class they have is six while the largest is twenty. They are open to all race but focus on the Native American and other indigenous tribes throughout the world!
Sophomore,4,"I love the people I have met and the opportunities offered. Professors 
I have had are willing to work and help out to their best abilities. 
It is a small community and very nice to be a part of. I enjoy the indigenous foundation that the school has."
Sophomore,4,"Very diverse group of students. Strong LGBTQS+ community. Lovely library. Great art studios. Great staff. TITLE 9 Response team is strong and efficient. 
I wish the school responded better to on campus residents when the Covid19 pandemic struck schools."
Freshman,4,"Great school, affordable and economical. I transferred to IAIA and the admissions process was easy and they helped me, however it is a very small school with around 500 students so campus life is what you make it. Academically all of the classes are 3 credit hours, however being an art school the work load amounts to a 4 credit class. The campus is accommodating for a student body of 500, especially the classrooms as most if not all classes are at 15 or below enrollment. Being a student that lives in the residence center offers a perspective to the school as you are right along with your peers. The dorms are small with one widow, however each does offer your own private bathroom and central air system which is a plus in New Mexico heat. The student body is very diverse, being a tribal college, a majority of the student population is Native American. However IAIA does offer enrollment to non-natives and even has a few international students from Japan, Germany and Peru."
Sophomore,4,I like that  Institute of American Indian arts  Because it’s diversesty . Also how it is affordable for low income native students . The atmosphere of the campus and the indigenous students will humble you.
Freshman,4,"If you want to dive into Native American cultural diversity you well get your fill and then some! A number of tribes are represented here and you could not believe the art that is made here as well as the art that is stored at IAIA. It is a growing school and many new buildings have been built since I attended along with new guidelines for different majors and minors. Overall, I highly recommend this school for those interested in a carer in Art as well as those Native high school graduates who do not know where they should go. Also, even if you like the school or not, I fully believe you will make lifelong friends, like I have."
Freshman,4,The community is very welcoming. The only things that I feel that needed to be addressed about the school is the bigger dormitories and wider selection of food. Other than that the school is fantastic. Great to have an experience with the Native American Community as well.
College Junior,4,Everyone comes from different backgrounds and they are very accepting of each other.
College Junior,4,I had a pretty easy time getting into my program. The transition from my old college went smoothly too.
College Junior,4,Everyone is decently attired and they are pretty friendly too.
College Junior,4,I enjoy going to this school. The teachers are great and I'm always learning something new and different.
College Freshman,4,"Admission in pretty straight forward. Their is a non-refundable application fee. Background checks to live in housing, transcripts, and eligibility for funding. I never came across anything abnormal in my application. For me the only difficulty was timing. I had about 1 month to apply and submit all of my forms to the school before the deadline. I was planning on waiting a little longer to start college, because of funding, but I decided that waiting was not an option for me."
College Freshman,4,"I absolutely love being on our Studio Arts program. Once all of the introductory courses, and major requirements have been taken the student is free to choses his or her classes. There is a lot of freedom at our school. Experimenting with different materials is always fun. Faculty and staff are always on hand to answer any question regarding Studio Arts. Most our faculty went to our school, so everyone seems to know everyone, it's a very small community. There are also a lot of student worker jobs here on campus. I'm currently working at facilities. I have learnt a lot worker here; how to take care of the buildings, moving offices around, and delivering packages."
College Freshman,4,"Our cafeteria supports local farmers, and all produce is locally grown. We have 4 alternating chiefs and one is from France. There is a lot of variety; salad bar, coffee, juices, hot food, and soups."
College Freshman,4,                            Security is laid-back.
College Freshman,4,"   I am happy with it all. Great school, good teachers, facilities okay."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is nice, I still have my privacy yet I'm still surrounded by community. "
College Senior,4,"The housing is nice, the rooms are down halls with a common area in the middle. The rooms have there own restrooms. The common area has a kitchenette so the students can use it."
College Senior,4,"The School has many subject in ""art"" to offer, and other subject as well."
College Senior,4,Most of the Guys and Girls here have lived on Reservations while some have not. Great people from all over the US and other places outside the US.
College Senior,4,"Great school for Native American Students. Classes are small, anywhere from 5 to 20 students at a time in one class. Campus is growing to match the interest in the school."
College Freshman,4,"The school offers a wide variety of courses that spark creativity. It's hard to choose a specific area of study when you are opened up to a lot of new choices. Each comes with its own unique experiences and adventures. The saying I heard most is, ""Be fearless and try new things."" That's what the school does! It gives you options to try something thats out of your study. Be fearless as an artist."
College Junior,4,"Admission to the Creative Writing program requires submission of a portfolio, a personal essay, and a critical essay."
College Freshman,4,The professors really care about the students and really wants us to succeed!
College Freshman,4,The computers are workable. Some are a little slow but none of us students take them for granted.
College Freshman,4,The academics are quite swell here at IAIA. Just a bit of tweaking and it'll go great!
College Freshman,4,The residence hall at the Institute of American Indian Arts is well kept. Only a few minor touchups and it will be even more better! So keep up the great work! :D
College Freshman,4,IAIA is extremely diverse compared to most college campuses. The campus consists mostly of Native Americans. We take pride in this on our campus. However even though the campus focuses on the Native side of things we have a handful of other races on campus including students from other countries.
College Freshman,4,"The majors are set up in a way to feed off of one another and help one another. The teachers are amazing and are there to help you in and outside of class. The classes are small sizes with 8-15 students in the classes on average, which is very nice. THe courses are layed out s for the majors so you know what classes you need to take to stay on track and the advisors are on a name basis with their students and help them stay on track."
College Junior,4,"Allot of art galleries to inspire you. Allot of shows to attend and meet other artists. Many restaurants to taste the South west Mexican cuisine. Many gift shops, many craft and art events. Flea markets nearby."
College Junior,4,Everyone is pretty much nice and funny. Allot of shy people till they get to know you.
College Junior,4,Dorms easily accessible to campus within walking distance. Dorms have nice views and quiet. Something always happening socially. Amenities are near by. Cost is great! Ease of housing process is pretty easy.
College Freshman,4,"I live in the dorms and there never a dull moment. The commons is always fill with students watching movies, playing video games, and exciting things. The campus is wonderful and compact so getting to class in a hurry isn't a problem. The library is state of the art with many great reads."
College Freshman,4,"Almost everything about IAIA is unique. The student population, the programs IAIA offers, and the teachers. It is one of the largest land grant institutes and the campus is refreshing. The gym is state of the art and allows the student body to exercise daily till ten p.m. Also the commons room is complete with kitchen and big screen t.v. which we all enjoy!"
College Junior,4,"The weather is great during the summe, beginning of the fall and end of the spring. The winter season is just the worst. I personally dislike the winter season but over all is great."
College Junior,4,Parking is never a problem on campus due to the small number od students. The only time parking is a problem is during graduation at the end of the spring semester or when there is a huge art show going on.
College Junior,4,"If you dont have a car then it is quite time consuming to get to campus, but living in your own space is more comfortable and relaxing. Santa fe has a theme to the landscape which is very natrual and traditioal to the natives from the area."
College Junior,4,"Depending on the activities the night life is more fun for 21 and older kids, but house parties are more fun and excitin. There are interesting things to do for underaged kids too like movie, bowling, star gazing, and more."
College Freshman,4,I had a very helpful experience despite the retirement of the previous financial aid adviser. The new financial aid adviser is doing a wonderful job and addressing all concerns from each student.
College Sophomore,4,the academics offered at this school vary greatly from a degree in art to film to even getting a lawyer's degree.
Sophomore,2,"I am a non-native student. My experience at this school is poor because I have to bring my financial tuition down to 200$ in order to register for classes for the next semester. I am a poor student, having a difficult time paying off my tution."
College Junior,2,It's extremely difficult to get a hold of the financial aid staff here.
College Freshman,2, Very bottom of the barrel. Almost non-existent.
College Freshman,2,      Don't really know...
College Junior,2,Santa Fe is an expensive tourist trap destination city known for its museums.
College Junior,2,My program of study is new and there's not much financial aid or advice available to us yet.
College Freshman,2,"I attend a small Native American arts school.  I feel it is diverse in that there are people of various tribes from across the United States along with a few international students as well.  The people who go here are mostly from middle class, working economic backgrounds and many come from the reservations, too.   There are people of various sexual orientations.  The religion of many is the tribal beliefs of whatever culture that person may come from but some people follow Catholocism as well.  Everyone is open to the beliefs and knowledge others have to offer though, as learning about other cultures is expected and accepted here at IAIA (Institute of American Indian Arts)."
College Junior,2,finding a place to study at night is hard. Only time study area in the evening are availble is durring midterm and finals. it would be good if the libirary was open later and tutor alway availble in the evening. It also sometime hard to find rides . What be helpful too if there was a late nite snack shop.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have athletics at the school except a class for Cross Country and clubs by students who want to take on the challenge.
College Senior,1,IAIA treats it's alumni very poorly.
College Senior,1,It's expensive to live off campus and not ideal for full-time students who are parents.
College Freshman,1,"The weather here in New Mexico is pretty mild compared to my home state, Wisconsin.  There is not a lot of snow during winter and even when it does snow, it's really not a lot.  It doesn't rain too much either.  It's sunny almost every single day and it's pretty much just hot in the summer and warm/windy the other parts of the year.  The mild weather of New Mexico has no affect over the continuation of classes and schooling here."

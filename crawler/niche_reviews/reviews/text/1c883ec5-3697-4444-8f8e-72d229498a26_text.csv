Sophomore,5,Classes shifted online with the COVID19 Pandemic. We were given an additional week of spring break to prepare for online instruction. Professors were accommodating and so online classes were alright.
Sophomore,5,"It’s been an extraordinary year, and St Olaf has been a thrill. Academics and financial aid are almost unparalleled. Religious affiliation is not a hassle, rather self knowledge is encouraged."
Freshman,5,"Overall, it is a great place for learning. You can grow in different ways if you know your opportunities."
Freshman,5,"For a lot of prospective students, the religious affiliation of this school puts them off, and I can say that I was skeptical about it myself, however, while the school is affiliated with the Lutheran Church it isn't overtly religious or forced onto you. The college is quite liberal and welcoming of students from different backgrounds and identities including LGBTQ+ students and other religions. Another thing that I have been pleasantly surprised with is downtown Northfield. To outsiders, it seems way too small and dreary when actually it's quite the contrary. There are the most wonderful quaint cafes and shops downtown that make for a nice break from academics or Saturday brunch with friends- my favorite cafe is ""Goodbye Blue Monday"". Being a vibrant college town, the social and party scene isn't limited or boring EVER because Carleton College is just across the river and the students from the two colleges get along well and have joint events."
Freshman,5,Really great school with awesome resources available to help each and every student. A nice community that really feels like home. Um yah yah!
Freshman,5,"Being a student at St. Olaf has been stressful, relaxing, fun, musical, awe-inspiring, and an impactful learning experience. Classes are rigorous, but being challenged is part of learning. Its been relaxing because every place offers resources to stress-relieve students during finals week. Our residence hall had snacks every night during finals week, and cookies & hot chocolate/tea all day. Stav Hall even opens at night and serves breakfast because everyone's staying up late to study. Places like the Taylor center, CAAS, etc, all host events meant to be relaxing. The pause crossroads even brought puppies for students to play with as a means to coax us into stepping away from all the studying, and to relax for a bit. People go sledding down the hill behind Old Main at night because they can."
Niche User,5,The campus was amazing and the people were so nice. I got a tour around the school and got information about how the school system works.
Freshman,5,"St. Olaf College is an extremely competitive college to get into being one of the best institutions in Minnesota as well as nationally. St Olaf has a top notch Music Department and program that parallels prestigious conservatories with internationally touring Choirs, Bands and Orchestras. While the college is religiously affiliated , the school is liberal and accepting. The cafeteria is easily one of the best in the country and the campus is stunning and modern. Academic rigor is at a very high level and demands the very best of students. St Olaf College has been the right choice for me."
Sophomore,5,"Will definitely push you academically, but most professors care and want you too succeed. Everyone there is super helpful. Food is very good but can get a bit repetitive. Parties aren't everywhere but you can find them if you want too. Small town, but lots of activities on campus during the weekends."
Sophomore,5,I just finished my first year at Olaf and it has been amazing! There are so many diverse opportunities and wonderful profs!!
Alum,5,I had an excellent experience at St. Olaf.  I was academically challenged and felt prepared for life after college.  I made lifelong friends.  I would recommend St. Olaf to others.
Sophomore,5,"I love St. Olaf college because it provides a very close nit type of community and I have met so many different and interesting people that I will keep in my life forever. The community aspect is extremely important and made me feel at home the second I stepped onto campus. I think the liberal arts education is extremely valuable because I have seen how many of my classes have overlapped and how skills that I have learned transfer from class to class. One aspect about St. Olaf that is very nice and crucial to the campus is, the fact that there is only one dining hall. I personally love this because I get to see everyone daily and sit down and have a meal with my peers everyday in the same place. Overall, I am extremely happy with my decision to attend St. Olaf college and I would encourage any prospective student to look into a smaller liberal arts college, it my surprise them."
Freshman,5,"Although this school comes off as not being very diverse, I still meet people of all kinds here. The tight-knit size of the college really helps students from being distracted and all the professors are actually concerned with your success and want you to do well. There is a very good support system."
Niche User,5,"They are excellent in communicating with potential college applicants!  I am a senior high school student applying to several colleges.  I live in Wisconsin and St. Olaf College is well known here in Madison WI!  I love the look of the campus and the location is fantastic as well, close to the Mall of America!"
Senior,5,"I love St. Olaf College. The campus is gorgeous; the food is great; but more importantly, it has provided me with a quality education and useful professional contacts."
Freshman,5,St.Olaf is a prestigious liberal arts institution that really gives their students a sense of purpose in exploring their soon to be attributes and goals in their perspective careers and in life. This also accounts for its phenomenal environment of academia and opportunity.
Junior,5,St. Olaf is a great liberal arts institutions where students are guaranteed one-on-one professor interactions and the opportunity to excel in their fields. The campus is beautiful and the musical experiences exist in many different forms. You truly get to become familiar with the other students here.
Sophomore,5,Community based college where students are accepting and friendly! Professors are super easy to talk to and invite students into their office hours all the time and are very helpful.
Alum,5,St. Olaf feels like home. All students live on campus so you form life-long friends. I was challenged academically and feel prepared as I enter medical school.
Alum,5,"St. Olaf was an excellent institution in terms of education and preparing students for the real world.  Although you are up on the hill and separate from the real world, faculty and staff do an amazing job of challenging students' ideas and encouraging them to rise to the occasion."
Senior,5,St. Olaf offers a very close-knit community with plenty of things to do on the Hill. The cities are easily accessible and the classes and professors are phenomenal.
Freshman,5,"The best part about St. Olaf is the people. Students here are very friendly. Whenever I pass by someone, I guarantee you that if you smile at them, they'll smile back 9 out of 10 times. Student body seems small but it is actually a perfect size for you to see people you know a couple of times each day but still have the potential to meet new people for four years. All my professors know my name and they are very eager to help you if you visit office hours."
Sophomore,5,"I love going to school here! Academics and music are great, the food is awesome and the campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"St. Olaf has a great community and is an amazing overall school. Brand new academic buildings, nationally ranked proffesors, and amazing food."
Freshman,5,"St. Olaf is such an inclusive campus and it has a place for everyone. It seems as though students, faculty, and staff here are very nice all the time (to me,  this is a major factor) and they are also very welcoming of new students as well. There is always someone to help you with literally anything. The food is amazing. The facility on campus is modern and up-to-date. It is also a very diverse campus to live in. 
Overall, it is a great place to spend your small, liberal arts college experience."
Freshman,5,"St. Olaf is a small liberal arts college in rural Minnesota, about 40 minutes away from Minneapolis. It is a fantastic school if you're looking for a well-rounded, liberal arts education and a community-oriented environment. The music program is fantastic and very in-depth, and the school is known for its choirs. You can double major and choose concentrations that will end up on your degree, allowing you to study a wide variety of things. The campus is beautiful when it snows and in the fall, and there are several historic buildings."
Freshman,5,"St. Olaf College is the perfect fit for anyone in any field of interest who also wants an amazing liberal arts education. With a small, family-like campus, it seems everyone here loves St. Olaf with a passion! The food is ranked among the best in the US, and that barely compares to the college's superior quality of education. The faculty and professors are all extremely qualified in their fields and are all very helpful in making sure everyone has a successful education."
College Freshman,5,If you want it you can get it if you don't want it no one cares all is cool.
Sophomore,5,"St. Olaf College is the best fit for me! I love the emphasis on community, which is a core value for me. I have been heavily involved with student council and have loved seeing that the college actually listens to the input of their students. My favorite thing about St. Olaf is how much the professors want to see the students succeed and truly learn the material. St. Olaf is very residential and so the college puts a lot of money and time into making the dorms amazing. St. Olaf is ranked for the quality of food as well. The food service has a bunch of options and so one never feels like they get tired of the food."
College Junior,5,I love going to a college where nearly everyone lives on campus; it builds a tight community and makes it easy to get together with people for studying or fun.
College Junior,5,"It's a great school, especially for those involved in the humanities. Community outreach and studying abroad are both extremely important, and there are many many programs available for that."
College Sophomore,5,"I love being on the Hill. The people are great, and the profs that we have are super knowledgeable. The community is great, and while we do have issues, the students are working towards creating a better, safer, more engaging campus."
College Freshman,5,"We are a D3 school, so it's obviously not a Big 10 experience. Things like hockey and rugby are more popular than football."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love it. Nothing bad to say.
College Senior,5,"I feel safe at St. Olaf 100% of the time. The campus is small enough that I feel safe walking home after a late night in the library. There is no other campus that students leave their backpacks anywhere and can come back in an hour with everything the way that they left it. In terms of personal safety and mental health, there are many resources on campus that assist students dealing with depression, anxiety, or any other mental illnesses. Some such as the Wellness center can redirect students to other resources available on campus. It is a great source for people who have friends dealing with these illnesses to go and figure out how they can best help their friend. We also have Boe House which is a counseling center that is free for student use. Students schedule an appointment ahead of time, however there are slots available for emergency appointments. The pastors are another great resource as well as most faculty and staff."
College Senior,5,"There is something to be said for the ""Ole connection"". Ole graduates are so willing to provide insight and assistance to current Oles. St. Olaf organizes events such as Ole Med, Biz, and Public Health where they bring in 20+ professionals in different fields and allow students to network with them. We also have resources such as the Piper Center which is our career center that offers services such as counselors to look over your resume, career coaches that help with mock interviews and talking through internship and job opportunities. There are MANY resources at St. Olaf that help so many of their grads get a great job or internship during summers or post graduation."
College Senior,5,"St. Olaf is one of the most unique places I have ever been. Never before have I been surrounded by so many students and professors working together to understand and gain better knowledge of subjects. What sets St. Olaf apart from other schools is the amount of student-faculty interaction. Professors have office hours for a few hours each week set aside specifically for students from their courses to come in and chat. It can be about course material, but what I have enjoyed most is getting to know professors and hearing their life stories. Professors at St. Olaf want to get to know you and see you succeed. I have one official academic adviser, but multiple professors know who I am, what kinds of experiences I have had and where I want to go in the future. To me, that is a unique aspect to this school are part of what makes it stand out compared to all others. The professors want to get to know you and to see you succeed."
College Freshman,5,"This is my dream school, and it's brought me so much joy. I'm not very social, but people have always been kind to me here. Music is treated here like sports are treated everywhere else, and that's good for me, since I'm a music major. And the food is outstanding."
College Freshman,5,Safety is a huge aspect I can't expect to get at any other campus.
College Freshman,5,"The housing processes is very easy and the dorms are amazing. Each dorm has at least 1 computer lab, 2 kitchenettes, and lovely hang out and study space. Most dorms, such as Hoyme, are bright and open with very clean bathrooms and living space. Not to mention that the JC'S are absolutely amazing and are truly the backbone of the living community."
College Sophomore,5,The campus police are active and health services is very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,The classes are intimate and the teachers really care about the students' growth.
College Freshman,5,It is the best college for what I am going for. It's music department is absolutely amazing and offers so many beautiful opportunities for all people.It's perfect!
College Freshman,5,I really love St. Olaf. Being here is amazing and I would never choose any other college over this one.
College Freshman,5,"I have been very impressed with St. Olaf College. It is a great place to live, has tremendous opportunities, and has very involved and excellent professors."
College Sophomore,5,"St. Olaf is a dream come true. I feel so at home there, each department is amazing and encouraging, and everyone is friendly and interesting."
College Sophomore,5,"Even though it's a small school, I definitely got lucky and found my niche when it came to friends, dating, professors/classes and extracurricular activities. Being an ambitious student means it's easy to make your own opportunities simply by asking here- I just started a two-year independent research project."
College Student,5,"School thinks thoroughly for students' future, it even has a great plan for pre-med students and tons of internships. IS and IR courses are great too, there are many topics you can choose. Couldn't be better"
College Student,5,I am so happy that I have chose St. Olaf and I believe that it's a great school for students who are looking for getting admiited by med schools.
College Student,5,"Students are nice here, and Olaf is small and safe, sexual assult is really serious and I think it doesn't happen or rarely happens/"
College Student,5,I enjoy my P.E. classes and we win Carleton everytime!
College Student,5,Don't really understand what's Greek life...
College Student,5,Northfield is a small town. It's quite and safe enough for students.
College Student,5,"Carleton is nearby, so there are some restaurants between two schools. I am satisfied."
College Student,5,"I don't know that much, maybe I am just a nerd hhh. Heard that it's good"
College Student,5,They gave me enough financial aid and I really appreciate it. None of the other schools can give that much
College Student,5,"Food is extreamly good, can't believe it's only ranked by 15"
College Freshman,5,"All of the professors are incredibly intelligent, and most are very friendly and willing to meet outside of class and help in any way they can. A lot of the classes are interesting and fresh, a nice change up to the typical seminars. It's nice to have an intimate class; the biggest classes get here are around 100, only in lectures. The typical class is comfortable, intimate, discussion based, and open to many ideas."
College Freshman,5,"Our campus is simply gorgeous. There are tons of spaces both to be social and to get that much-needed alone/study time. You're hard put to not be able to find a niche you love. The green space is comfortable and well kept in the spring and autumn. The library is spacious and accommodating. Campus events are great, and there are always places to meet up with people."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone here is so attractive. I don't know how it happens but it's true. Typically, a St. Olaf student dresses well, balances a social and intellectual life, and is friendly and fun."
Freshman,4,"All of my professors worked very hard to make the online learning experience as positive as possible.  I found the workload very heavy under the circumstances, but professors were understanding and supportive."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the community at St. Olaf, and the music department has been excellent thus far.  I look forward to returning to campus."
Freshman,4,"Great community, great professors and interesting classes. Not great sports atmosphere. Beautiful campus and great views. Most dorms are in good shape and everyone is very nice."
Alum,4,"I would like to see St. Olaf become more physically accessible. There were several challenges posed to me specifically due to my physical disability. However, my social work education, general education, and study abroad experience were all valuable and helped me achieve my larger goal of becoming a licensed social worker."
Junior,4,St. Olaf College is a lively liberal arts school that has a little bit of everything. Classes are meaningful and there are plenty of opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"Almost everyone, student or professor, is very nice. Most professors are knowledgeable in their fields and teach solid classes. Academics is about the right difficulty for me, though some students are not very smart."
Alum,4,"Graduated here. Best Financial aid package you will ever find. Best Professors ever. The professors are always available to talk and provide you with the assistance you need I came there as a transfer. Wish I had come eralier. Outside the classroom, they have a lot of support services that help you in your career and academics. They helped me gain a number of reputable programs and internships. I would highly recommend."
Sophomore,4,The academics at this school are top notch.  All of my professors so far have been extremely intelligent and helpful.
Junior,4,Overall I've really liked my time at St. Olaf. I've met a lot of great people and I've grown a lot as a person while I've studied here.
Freshman,4,"Great admissions process!  I felt that they actually reviewed my application and tried to get to know me. When I was having trouble deciding, the counselor wrote me a long letter quoting from my admissions essay the things that would allow me to grow at St. Olaf. I can’t wait to start in the fall."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, a really good college. Most things you'd expect from a liberal arts college are here, to a greater or a lesser degree. It's cold from November through April here, so avoid this college if you want to go somewhere warm. I'm a psychology and computer science double-major, and have so far been pretty satisfied with what I've learned and experienced ar the college."
Freshman,4,"I love the food, the facilities are all amazing. When I was first applying there the track team was so nice to me. They welcomed me into their family and hung out with me the day I visited. I also liked the way that the financial aid office was kind to me, however they didn't give me the amount of money I wanted."
Freshman,4,I like how much-personalized learning there is. The one thing that I would change is that it seems to be a little cliquey in the fact that everyone just hangs out with their own group of friends. It is also very expensive.
Freshman,4,"Great school with great people. Can be challenging, but that's college! The professors really care about their students and most of them have amazing educations themselves so they're well versed on many topics. Small class sizes make it so it's easier to connect with teachers and peers."
Freshman,4,"Pretty campus, food is great, professors are typically very helpful and friendly (with a few exceptions), local area is good if you like cute small towns, and house parties pretty much every weekend that sometimes have live bands (usually fun but sometimes iffy depending on the weekend). Only a couple of sports teams are known to be good, like ultimate frisbee and cross country and soccer but some others like basketball are starting to get better. Definitely has issues with diversity but there is an active group of student leaders/protesters pushing for change."
Freshman,4,St. Olaf is a wonderful school with a lot of great people. The people are generally nice and helpful and the school has some great teachers. The advisors as well as faculty and administrators are always there for you when you need it. The students are very different as they come from a lot of places in the United States as well as international students. It also has a very good musical program.
Sophomore,4,"I am really enjoying my time at St Olaf. Although there is not much to do outside of schoolwork, but there is always a possibility to go to Minneapolis/St Paul."
Freshman,4,St. Olaf College provides students with an environment that bolsters a sense of community and drive to learn. If you are looking for a school that will be a phenomenal education experience this college will not disappoint. The social atmosphere of the campus is very hit or miss depending on your idea of fun.
Freshman,4,"Attending St. Olaf was the best decision of my life. At first I thought the size and remoteness of St. Olaf was something to be wary about but, I came to realize that they made Olaf special. I met some of the best teachers in my life and was able to interact with them on a personal level."
Sophomore,4,"As a St. Olaf student, I feel like there are so many opportunities I have access to. Whether it's research or internships or pursuits fo further education, proactive St. Olaf students have many resources they can take advantage of. The curriculum is tough no matter what department you take courses in. Professors have extremely high expectations for their students, however they do everything in their power to build your way to those high expectations. It can be difficult to find a study/social life balance. If you cannot develop strong study habits, classes will be a struggle. There are a ton of resources available to students who haven't established study habits and professors are happy to work with students. The open-door policy is an awesome thing to take advantage of. There can be a sense of a competitive atmosphere, but usually there is a stronger sense of community and camaraderie between students because everyone is facing many of the same challenges in an academic sense."
Freshman,4,"The environment here is great: nice clean sidewalks, fresh air, beautiful green scenery, prairies and forest paths, etc. The professors here are in general pretty welcoming and friendly. There is a pretty strong sense of community because you will not feel awkward when asking anyone for help on anything, and people are willing and want to help. The only downside is that the food really isn't as great as I expected."
Senior,4,St. Olaf boasts rigorous academics and truly excellent professors who are invested in their students and teaching.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed my first year at st. olaf, though it didn't come without challenges.  I am a student athlete there, competing in football and rugby, that alone comes with challenges but here at st. olaf the student body and administration seem to be against all athletes and are always looking for wasy to single us out and make us look bad while all we do is go out and represent the school on a larger stage to the best out our ability."
Freshman,4,"St. Olaf has a great campus location. It is surrounded by plenty of trees, plenty of fields to play soccer and football, and a huge windmill. The professors are friendly and accessible. However, they don't really speak on diversity issues and current politics unless the student government body brings a speaker to speak on behalf of those issues. Overall, the students and professors are friendly, and the college is beautiful."
Freshman,4,"My experience at St. Olaf college as a first year has been fantastic. I knew from the first tour I took of the school my junior year of high school that I could accomplish great things here. The supportive community, outstanding resources, and overall generosity of students has demonstrated how amazing this institution is."
College Freshman,4,The campus is pretty safe no one's stuff gets stolen and you can walk around at night. On the weekends Pub Safety drives around making sure everyone is okay.
College Freshman,4,Student involvement is pretty large. Team performance varies. Fans are very supportive regardless. School spirit is pretty wide and apparent. The athletic facility can be used by anyone.
College Freshman,4,The school really cares about providing you with a future.
College Freshman,4,A lot of the professors are great! The courses are hard but manageable.
College Freshman,4,There are public safety officers always on duty and driving around.
College Freshman,4,"It's only a division 3 school so sports don't take on that big of a role. But that isn't to say that St Olaf doesn't care about sports. The facilities are great, the teams always do well, etc."
College Freshman,4,There is a great range of classes and the professors come to the school to teach students therefore they really care about the students.
College Sophomore,4,Great school and great people!
College Senior,4,"St. Olaf isn't without issues, but it is a good school for those who are proactive, career focused, and driven. Would recommend to anyone."
College Senior,4,"St. Olaf does an excellent job insuring all graduates find employment. For those who truly succeed and are driven, you can go very far on a St. Olaf education."
College Junior,4,St. Olaf administration is always keeping us students up-to-date on any and all internship and career opportunities.  The alumni network is very strong.  Graduates of St. Olaf have a very high chance of finding a job with competitive employers.
College Junior,4,"While I had some monotonous professors in introductory classes, I've also had some truly outstanding professors who are passionate and very knowledgeable.  I have loved a good number of my classes.  Smaller class sizes make for more engaging discussions and individual relationships with your professors."
College Junior,4,I feel very comfortable on campus.  Crime is very minimal due to the strength of our community.  Our public safety team offers safe rides in the near vicinity.
College Junior,4,"As a varsity athlete, participation in my sport has been very beneficial to me.  It keeps my physically and mentally healthy.  I like the atmosphere of DIII; you can be as competitive as you want, but pressure is low.  I love my teammates and my coach."
College Junior,4,"I love going to school in a community full of students like me: driven to find success in areas we are passionate about.  The liberal arts approach has been very beneficial to me, allowing me to take classes out of my majors that broaden my worldview and balance my course load.  I have had amazing professors in both of my majors; they go above and beyond to provide a challenging yet enjoyable experience."
College Junior,4,I really have enjoyed myself so far; the friends are great and I've been able to utilize many of St. Olaf's facilities.
College Junior,4,"The buildings are really wonderful and old-looking (in a good way), but a lot of people struggle to get in a dorm they want since over 95% of people are required to live on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"There really isn't a typical greek life on Campus. All of the frats/sororities are honor organizations that are really only there to do service projects, and help students find connections."
College Freshman,4,"There seems to be very little campus crime, we leave our backpacks out at the caf during every meal. I have never not felt safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"I love the feeling of community St. Olaf has. I feel like whenever I need help with anything, someone is always there ready to give me advice. The classes are hard, but I think they will do a good job of preparing me for the future. The campus is gorgeous and so are the people."
College Senior,4,"There are a variety of courses offered at St. Olaf. One unique aspect of this college is the liberal arts education it provides. It allows students a chance to explore areas of study they would normally not be able to or would shy away from. With this being said, sometimes it can be frustrating having to take so many courses that you feel do not apply to what you want to do in the future if it is preventing you from taking courses that would. Class sizes are usually around 20 for discussion based classes and as large as 50, 70, or even 150 for different lecture based courses. But in comparison with most other colleges, it is much smaller in class size."
College Senior,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed the fact that most people live on campus all four years of college. I think that it allowed me to interact with more of my classmates than I would have been able to otherwise. Hoyme and Ellingson are by far the nicest freshman dorms to live in because they are the most up to date. Hillkit is a treck and it is inconveniently put right by a massive wind tunnel. I personally feel like Melby and Thorson, while beautiful on the outside, are dark and dungeon-y feeling on the inside. The best part about living in the dorms is that, St. Olaf being a small campus, it is close to everything! It is nice that so many people live in the dorms because it makes it easier to hang out with others and meet new people in your hall as well. There are also nice study spaces in each resident hall as well."
College Junior,4,"St. Olaf offers frequent networking events with alumni, such as Ole Med, Ole Law, and the new Ole Arts event. As I am still a junior, I don't know a lot about employers coming to recruit on campus, but the career center sends frequent emails to the whole student body with information regarding jobs and internships."
College Junior,4,"Most often, professors are extremely knowledgeable in the subjects they teach and are passionate about them. This can be encouraging if it is a class you are taking for your major/concentration, because the student likely has a similar interest. However, this is difficult when it comes to general education requirements. In my experience, sometimes professors have gotten so caught up in the course material that they forget some students are only there for the GEs, and they are not able to follow the lecture/discussion as efficiently as other students."
College Junior,4,"Overall, the St. Olaf community is very welcoming and friendly. I've had the opportunity to take classes in subjects that I never had the chance to in high school, which has been very helpful to decide my major. There are a variety of clubs and organizations to choose from, which was also something I never had the chance to do in high school. The course work is rigorous, but most of the time I feel like I'm getting the education I should be from a school like St. Olaf."
College Freshman,4,It feels really safe walking around on campus.
College Freshman,4,There is a very close knit community
College Sophomore,4,"There are definitely initiatives to stop sexual assault, including programs, emails, and events."
College Sophomore,4,"Although I'm uncertain what I want to do following graduation, I'm certain St. Olaf will do everything in its power to help me find a job."
College Sophomore,4,"I came here for a small liberal arts college education, and that's what I'm receiving. Classes stay generally small and personal. Professors seem to actually care about me as a person. Overall, I enjoy it here."
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the academic atmosphere that surrounds the hill. It may be difficult sometimes, but ultimately I think it's worthwhile. I'm learning a lot; hopefully what I'm learning will help me in the future."
College Sophomore,4,"I personally feel safe on campus but I've heard several cases of others not feeling safe, and cases of sexual assault. However I feel that it's significantly less prevalent here than it may be at other schools, like large universities."
College Sophomore,4,"It's very interesting to live on a campus where almost all students live in the dorms all four years. It does create the sense of community that this school boasts. Its very easy to get around campus from your dorm because the campus is so small. There are a few good options should you decided dorm life isn't for you, which is nice. The social atmosphere is great because you'll be able to find a group of people with the same values as you and you won't be bothered by anyone else."
College Freshman,4,"Because I'm a music major, St. Olaf is a great choice and a fantastic school. The facilities are wonderful, and the financial aid is the best I was offered. The professors and faculty are approachable and, for the most part, as fair as college professors are. If you are not here on a grant/scholarship and aren't involved in music, you could be wondering why you chose the school in the first place."
College Freshman,4,"People usually complain about dorm living at other Colleges and Universities, but the quality of the resident halls at St. Olaf are fantastic. This may be in part to the large number of students who live on campus."
Sophomore,2,"St Olaf College is great if you are super liberal. Neoliberals and anyone that is moderately conservative is shunned. They preach 'tolerance', but the hypocrisy runs deep. Only socialists can voice their opinions. Otherwise, you are RaCiSt and BiGoTeD. We love the supression of free speech. 10/10 would not recommend this liberal bubble full of people so out of touch with reality, they probably think Obama is still president."
Niche User,2,"I feel my daughter received a great education here, but during her four years, lost her faith in God and learned how to drink.  I was very sad about this.  She also had an extremely bad experience with a track coach who clearly didn't like her and treated her very badly."
College Freshman,2,"I will not even say there is diversity. It is sprinkled here and there. As a minority I can say that it sucks. Many students will be sweet but others do discriminate. However, that is normal everywhere I go anyways. I do not feel unsafe or threatened by it."
College Freshman,2,"I live in Kitt so that's self explanatory, two closets for three people sucks"
College Freshman,2,People often say that hazing for the football team just entails wearing your jersey in public.
College Freshman,2,"Coming from a high school of approximately the same size as St. Olaf, the lack of school spirit and support for athletics was more than disheartening. Sporting events and campus facilities can leave a lot of people thinking, ""this is it?"". No pep-rallies or any other traditions usual of a college campus."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of snotty students. Way too many parties with making bad decisions. Not for me socially. Academically it's good. There are better schools out there, but it's still a top notch school. That being said it's way to expensive. Sure, laundry doesn't require coins and the food is above average, but it's way too much, and this is coming from someone who had a fair amount of financial aid. Back to students. A lot of them are preppy and privileged, and don't seem to get how the real world works."
College Senior,2,"It's hard to get anywhere off campus, and once you do the options are quite limited.  Tokyo grill is really good though!"
College Freshman,2,"Sadly, the school is not very diverse. St. Olaf is trying to be inclusive and invite students from everywhere, but generally we are a very homogenous school. The main diversity you'll find is from international students from abroad, rather than ethnic heterogeneity from the United States. However, there are many International nights that celebrate difference cultures, and the cafeteria often has options from different cultures in an effort to include them."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty much no one lives off campus. It's just inconvenient and with how cold the winters get, unless you have a car you're pretty much guaranteed the coldest walks of your life. There is very little selection in Northfield."
College Freshman,2,"Our only DI sport is Ultimate Frisbee. Our athletic center is pretty good, but the sports events are rarely hyped. The one that is hyped is the Cereal Bowl, where we play our rival, Carleton. Malt'O'Meal provides food, hence the name!"
College Sophomore,2,"Blond hair, blue eyes is about 3/4ths of the student population, and there are no Jewish people. Even the Jewish House, built by Jewish St. Olaf students, had no Jewish people living in it last year.  The elitist mentality of this school is also hard to get around if you are anything but rich."
College Sophomore,2,"Most people live on campus, unless you are on a sports team, or in a club. These houses usually are the ones that students go to on weekends to party after getting sufficiently drunk in their dorm rooms."
College Sophomore,2,"Even though it is a dry campus, school policies toward drug use and alcohol abuse are very easy to get around. The RA's usually don't care if you are drinking, and drug use is very prevalent in the school. Basically, if you aren't stupid about it, they won't even notice. I knew people who smoked drugs in their room with a vaporizer that never got caught and a couple people even used a hookah inside, and never got caught. You will find that Friday and Saturday are days where every single person you see at night in the lobby is drunk. Also, the school hosts dances (nightclub type) on some weekends, where every person who walks in the door is pretty drunk. The school basically looks at each case of drinking  differently, based on various things. I knew someone who got caught and was given a level three (meaning you get kicked out) but because his daddy was a rich Norwegian, he was allowed to stay."
College Sophomore,2,"The off campus dining is pretty nonexistent. There are only fast food restaurants and a couple downtown bars, but students usually don't go off campus for food too often."
College Junior,2,"Northfield is a quiet small town, there are some bars, like Froggy's and the Cow that are popular, but options are very limited."
College Junior,2,"There are few houses available off-campus that are worth the hassle, because most of them are about the same price as on-campus living, significantly far away from campus, and are difficult to secure."
College Sophomore,2,St. Olaf is in a small Minnesota town. We have a few bars and maybe one club. The highlight of our nightlife is a Pause dance or a crowded house party on Ole Ave. Don't expect to find any ragers or amazing clubs here.
College Freshman,2,It's deathly cold and windy and spring is a myth until late May. But the buildings are heated and close together and it's not the end of the world if you like winter and can handle a little bit of -40 windchill.
College Freshman,2,There's usually a party going on in an honor house and the dances can be kinda fun sometimes but it's not a huge part of campus life
College Freshman,2,It's Minnesota. It reflects that. Lots of Norwegians and Lutherans. But it's also a very nice campus and has a strong ideal of acceptance. Even if someone is in the minority of any sort it probably just means an interesting conversation. Never witnessed any type of discrimination.
College Senior,2,Night life is not the most exciting at St. Olaf. There are few parties and they get old fast. 
College Senior,2,"There are very few options in Northfield, Minnesota and most places are closed by 11:00 P.M.. There are some good local restaurants, but after a month you have exhausted all options."
College Senior,2,"I have used the school's transportation a few times and it is decent. You end up waiting several hours at the airport coming back to St. Olaf, but it is cheap and somewhat accessible."
College Senior,2,"The drinking policy at St. Olaf creates a culture of students binge drinking hard alcohol quickly. It is easier for students to sneak a bottle of vodka into their dorm rooms than it is a case of beer. Most students are forced to drink in their rooms and drink a lot, quickly to then go to a party. RA's and public safety are looking to write students up, not to ensure they are safe. I have been written up twice for alcohol in my time at St. Olaf and that is well below average. Alcohol poisoning is very common because of the ""hard liquor culture."" St. Olaf's policies make little sense. If a student were to have a beer bong in their room, but have no alcohol they would receive a level three punishment (a very serious punishment that usually results in getting kicked out of the dorm). However, if a student has 100 beers in their room, but no beer bong, they will most likely receive a level one or two violation. If you want to be continually frustrated by administrative policy for four years, then St. Olaf is your place. "
College Senior,2,"St. Olaf has given me a decent education. Most professors are nice and fair, but there are a few that are horrible. The drinking policy is only a crack in the door. The strictness of drinking on campus and the enforcement of rules is over the top at St. Olaf. There is a focus on administration over students. Most of my friends would not ever send their children here, nor would they donate any money here. Carleton College offers a better education, better professors, and better administration in the same town. Dorms are below average, President Anderson is never seen on campus, nor does he seem to do much of anything. I would not advise any incoming freshman to go here. I applied early decision and thought that St. Olaf was the perfect place for me, but after 4 years here it has only become a nightmare. I will be happy to graduate from St. Olaf College, but I will not be proud to say I am a St. Olaf graduate. "
College Senior,2,St. Olaf Parking is a nightmare. It is difficult to deal with the staff in the parking office and public safety will ticket you after 15 minutes of parking in a spot that you technically do not have a pass for. The time of day does not matter
College Freshman,2,"I do not take part in the party scene, but it is very noticeable and often talked about.  Everyone knows when someone got alcohol poisoning or when something serious happens, and I hate that.  I hate the amount of drinking that happens here because it seems that since I don't drink I am not like everyone else."
College Sophomore,2,"Regarding race, St. Olaf is greatly lacking in the diversity department. It's a mostly white school, and those who aren't white are generally international. St. Olaf also tends to attract a certain ""type"" of student (not necessarily a bad thing): hard-worker, liberal, hipster attire, strong leaders, and intelligent. If a diverse school is a priority or if you wouldn't feel comfortable at a mostly white school, I wouldn't suggest coming here."
College Junior,2,"St. Olaf is a small school and so all students with cars park in the athletic facility parking lot. This is really terrible in the winter because you have to walk downhill towards the wind turbine and the natural lands, which is the iciest, windiest part of campus because the natural lands are an almost completely flat prairie. It's possible to keep your car at St. Olaf, though, and thankfully you only need it to go off campus because nearly everyone lives on campus. For those who do live off-campus, as my friend might this coming year, it is a pain to park down by the gym and walk uphill to your classes."
College Freshman,2,"They say, this is a $50,000+ a year institution but most students really only pay around like $24,000 a year. Well that's all well and great but my family is far from well off, my dad has to work 90 hours a week on an assembly line for Chrysler to afford to pay for me, then I will pay them back, rather than student loans at their absurd interest rates. And for people who get stuck with the full tuition it's miserable."
College Sophomore,2,"St.Olaf is not very racially or religiously diverse, however I believe it is one of the most accepting campuses and people are very open and it is a comfortable place to be different and express yourself"
College Freshman,2,"There are few places to eat here that satisfy college students. The food that is usually discounted for college students is un-healthy choices such as Domino's Pizza or McDonald's, Arby's, etc.  Hogan Brothers is a very familiar resturaunt to most students, and is very good, along with the Reub. There are other locals, but not very affordable to college students."
Recent Alumnus,2,Nothing special really. A few chain fast food places and independent restaurants that are expensive for the little amount of food you get on your plate. Hardly anything is open after 8:00pm too so the hours are inconvenient.
College Sophomore,2,"Super Strict – Remember, its a dry campus. Also I was told once to walk on the sidewalk by public safety...really? Theres barely any traffic and I was walking towards oncoming traffic. Sesh"
College Freshman,2,"Never Enough – I flew from many states away, so parking is not an issue for me.  However, for those who have cars on campus, it's a chronic source of frustration.  That said, you can get lots of places by shuttle, public bus, bicycle, and even walking.  The campus is very proud of its green focus, so in a way, not facilitating the use of private cars is perhaps a good thing."
College Junior,2,"There aren't very many places to live off campus and still experience the college to its fullest extent.  I have friends who live off campus, in duplexes or honor houses but the rent is pretty high.  I think around the $400-500 per month range.  A very large percentage of students, even upper-class students live on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Not the College Experience – Allow the people are great and the classes are challenging and fun, this is not the place to be if you want the college experience."
College Sophomore,2,"Great Team Spirt – As an Ole you always feel a great pride for your team, and we do fairly well athletically"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Hogan Brothers – Small town with very few options. However, Hogan Brothers has the best sandwiches in the world."
College Senior,1,"There is no Greek life at St. Olaf. I personally have enjoyed that aspect of it. There are still honor houses and off campus houses that groups of people can apply for, however there is no rushing or fraternity/sorority parties at this campus. There are honor societies usually revolving around academics that allow students to graduate with honors. But I think having a lack of a Greek system facilitates better campus community because then there is no disconnect between the Greeks and non-Greeks. You get to know a greater variety of people than you would just Greeks if one chose to be part of Greek life."
College Sophomore,1,"It doesn't exist. Well, there may be one on campus, but it's not a big part at all. So don't come here for greek life."
College Freshman,1,"The dorm are pretty well updated unless you live in Kildahl. Also, if you have a roommate from the Twin Cities area or Rochester, expect to have a single as a freshman. They will go home every weekend"
College Senior,1,"There seems to be some diversity on this campus, ie. people coming from different parts of the world, but everyone is pushed to fit the mold once they arrive, if they don't already."
College Senior,1,"Northfield is way too small and hard to get to from campus due to the weather, so usually it's not worth it to even go."
College Senior,1,"Why did this site only ask me to rate guys?  I'm bisexual.  Anyway, in general, people care a lot more about work than their social or dating life, and people don't seem to care about having fun.  I'm not just talking about drinking or partying, I'm talking about artistic things too like being creative and just joking around in general.  Everyone is so concerned with being nice and politically correct, that they lose their senses of humor and willingness to have a good time.  If all you're concerned about is looks, the population is reasonably attractive, but good luck finding someone genuinely interesting who isn't looking to transfer."
College Senior,1,"My friend needed gauze and disinfectant ointment when she returned to the hospital after getting stitches.  They did't have disinfectant and they made her pay for the gauze though she was told before it was going to be free.  The nurses as St. Olaf don't know what they're doing, it's better to go directly to the E.R."
College Senior,1,"I already wrote all I have to say.  If you're looking for a homogeneous conservative traditional Lutheran environment, and you love working hard and being politically correct for fun, this might be the right place for you, and I don't fault you for that.  But if you're looking for anything else, going to this school is a huge mistake!!"
College Senior,1,Oops I already wrote this in the last section...
College Senior,1,"Overall most of my professors were good, but everything else about the college was horrible.  I thought I could just go to a college if the teaching was good, regardless of the quality of life but I was wrong.  St. Olaf hides behind a facade of looking so well-kempt and professional, but if you look closer, most of this is an illusion.  For example, there are posters all over the place for events that don't actually take place, or of they do, no one is there.  Also, all the computers appear to be macs but have windows operating systems.  St. Olaf does everything they can to make extra money off its students:  they start shamelessly asking for alum donations before we even graduate, and there is a fine for basically everything, even dropping a class, which gives wealthy students a huge advantage.  The narrow-minded culture and lack of diversity, the general ignorance and intolerance of anything not mainstream, and the snobbish entitled population made living at St. Olaf a nightmare. The only thing that proved to me that I wasn't going insane was when I went on study abroad an finally encountered normal people again, which was like a breath of fresh air. Do not go to this school if you value your sanity, you can find good teaching at other schools, it's not worth it."
College Senior,1,"Where do I even begin?  One friend of mine got penalized for violating the honor code with no proof, another got accused of sexual assault with no proof.  My friends tried to start an honor house with a great pitch but our house got taken by kids whose parents were big donors.  I was told I could graduate early, and a semester later they told me they made a mistake, but at that point it was too late to transfer.  The reason for the retention rate is because 1)  it is EXTREMELY hard to transfer, and 2)  there is so much propaganda about how great the school is once you start going there that it's easy to buy into, with nothing to compare it to.  This school should tell prospective students what it is:  an old fashioned conservative lutheran school with a vapid vanilla closed-minded upper middle-class population.  I don't know why they pretend otherwise.  Pub safe wouldn't do anything about a dying kitten me and my friend were trying to get out of a tree.  I came to the school having been told that the art dept. hosted weekly figure drawing sessions, which was a lie.  When I tried to get figure drawing started again, I was accused of being a threat to the club's ""existence"" lol.  There are over a hundred clubs listed on the website a good half of them don't actually exist.  My friends and I started a club, which is now one of the most interesting clubs on campus:  this is super sad because all we do is watch music videos.  When we tried to start a more interesting club, one that networked with other clubs and sponsored free workshops, apparently that was too edgy for the administration.  The administration does absolutely nothing about unfair grading or unfair treatment of students on the part of the staff.  I was fired from my job for a completely invalid reason, after working there as a reliable employee for two years, and the administration did nothing about it.  Being at this school makes you feel physically and emotionally trapped and helpless."
College Senior,1,"Normally I love to party but the party scene sucks, people compensate for the fact that it's a dry campus by getting sh*t faced whenever they get their hands on alcohol.  People always going to the hospital.  And if you don't have a car, don't even think about leaving campus with the weather."
College Sophomore,1,"This school is an elitist school. The amount of people I knew that thought that everyone at the school was getting their tuition paid by their parents was overwhelming. You would think that with all these fancy buildings, and amazing technology, they would have enough money to look over their students, but that is not the truth at all. They may say they will help you out, but get a year done, and have no money left over to put into your education, and they will change. I am not able to return to this school because of their very poor financial aid office. I did not want to take out $30,000 in loans for just one year, and then have the same problem the next year because even the aid office thinks that every person has money. Once you get in and get a year out of the way, things change in terms of financial aid. They don't increase the amount you get every year, they decrease it, thinking that you will want to stay because it is a hassle to have to transfer."
College Junior,1,Pub Safe is ticket happy. Permits are pricy. Parking is off the hill and a haul from most dorms. Though you really don't need a car on campus.
College Senior,1,Public Safety serves little purpose
College Senior,1,Off-campus housing is discouraged by President Anderson. Landlords are difficult to work with and off-campus housing is poor.
College Senior,1,"Public Safety is there to bust parties and give out parking tickets. They do very little to work with students and help them. A lot of them were recently replaced and the new ones are just as bad. There is no crime in Northfield, and public safety is always looking to bust a party or give out parking tickets. I have never seen more booted vehicles or cars with parking tickets anywhere else. The Northfield police are better about not giving parking tickets than St. Olaf's public safety. You often see Public Safety officers sitting in their cars doing nothing but eating McDonalds. "
College Senior,1,"Campus housing is small, out dated, and many people try to apply to get off campus. "
College Senior,1,St. Olaf is very Scandinavian and very white.
College Senior,1,Minnesota weather is horrible. -50 degree wind chills and the only consistent weather is the cold. 
College Senior,1,"St. Olaf is very expensive, and they don't give out very many scholarships.  It is definitely worth a shot to apply for all of them, though. The Buntrock and presidential scholarships (the 2 highest academic scholarships) are decent, although they still only cover about 1/4 of your tuition. Cross your fingers and hope for good financial aid. Many of the students have parents that can afford to pay for St. Olaf's tuition."
College Junior,1,"St Olaf likes to act like it's an Ivy League school, but it really isn't. You get a subpar education with profs who are clearly only here because they got rejected from their first choice.  None of the classes are appropriately challenging - you either get piss easy or extremely hard because my teacher likes making people miserable type classes. If St Olaf is on your list of potential schools, do the biggest favor of your life to yourself and skip it!"
College Freshman,1,There is literally almost no support at all. We're in Minnesota and they don't even care about hockey. The opponents fans cheer louder than ours at our own home games. It's a joke. They don't support the athletes here at all.
College Freshman,1,"If you can even get off campus, there really isn't much. Hogan bro's is good but that's about it besides fast food... Couple of the local places aren't too bad."
College Freshman,1,"You can go to the only two decent bars in town if you're over 21, besides that you're pretty out of luck. There are a few house parties on the weekends, but they aren't every weekend. The few times there are parties they become so overcrowded that the cops always end up busting them, which happens very often. Every now and then you get lucky and there is a good house party at one of the sports houses but that's about it. No free alcohol for girls, which a lot of them are upset about. Dorm parties usually get busted because it's a dry campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There isn't much convenient student parking on campus. If you have a car, the permit cost is a little excessive and you have to park in a huge lot that's a bit of a hike from, well, most of campus. ON campus, a car isn't necessary (it's a 10 minute walk from Thorson to Hill-Kitt) but it's nice to have to go into town (about a 25 minute walk) or to go into the Cities on the weekend."
College Senior,1,"You can only get a parking pass if you live more than 200 miles away or have an off-campus job/house, and the passes are expensive. You'll get ticketed if you park overnight anywhere except Skoglund parking lot (15 minutes away from most buildings). Aggghhhhh parking."
College Junior,1,"Well the dorms all look nice and are equipped with modern amenities. The computers are all pretty new as well, although the IT people often take a good while before fixing problems with the computers or the printers. The science building looks super nice, but all the other academic buildings (aside from the art building) don't seem to have updated since the 1970s. 
The social atmosphere sucks, to be quite frank. People here are very fake nice and they all travel in small to semi-large groups so it's like being in high school all over again. You see a couple loners here and there and those guys must be miserable because nobody here will go out of their way to include someone who doesn't have a group. Also, if you're a vertically challenged guy or gal, best find a different school. Everyone here is super tall and they tend to treat the shorties (especially the guys) very badly. I've seen it happen."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The dorms are spaced pretty evenly and things are not too far from each other. Each dorm has its ups and downs depending on which one, but they're generally bad. St. Olaf has a lot of bugs and the school doesn't do anything about it. By the time my semester was over my legs were covered in flea bites and even though I had made numerous complaints the flea problem in the dorm was never taken care of. Most students that attend are very unfriendly and have a big clique mentality. If you don't find a clique to stick to the first few weeks, expect your chances of making any friends at St. Olaf the following years to be extremely low. Most students tend to be from the upper Midwest and have grown up in plastic bubbles or something, because they have a highly naive and simplistic worldview. Many are very discriminatory and elitist as well as provide a bad vibe in general. Everything closes way too early around campus and the nightlife is nonexistent, save for drunk students running through the dorms and shouting the whole night. The only thing going for the campus life is the nice looking scenery - and I mean the only thing."
College Sophomore,1,Not Thrilled – It took me a long time to get my Financial Aid and the Financial Aid department is not good at communicating deadlines and the such to its students.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Shows Scandinavian Heritage – Most people at Olaf are Minnesotan with Scandinavian heritage.  There's nothing wrong with that; it actually creates an interesting Norwegian feel to the campus.  But, we are severely lacking in anyone from different cultures. Despite this, there is a largely tolerant attitude on campus. There's not much discrimination based on politics, religion, or sexual orientation."
College Freshman,1,"Very few students are allowed to keep their cars on campus. They have to either: Live more than 800 miles away, work off campus more than 40 hours per week, or have medical need to frequently see a doctor."
College Senior,1,"Not So Hot – Most student parking is borderline off-campus, down by the athletic center at the bottom of the hill.  Walking the hill gets really old really fast - especially in January."
College Freshman,1,"There is hardly any diversity at St. Olaf.  Most everyone is a blond hair, blue-eyed Norwegian.  Most people are a little unordinary, some are really strange.  At St. Olaf there are a lot of over-achievers. Although St. Olaf is a Lutheran based college, religion is not very prominent.  As a student you only have to take two semesters of religion, which isn't bad.  
Most of the students are rich, democratic Lutherans. 
St. Olaf has a nice mix of students with different sexual orientations."
College Junior,1,"Almost Non-Existent – The only real parties are in off campus houses, but with most of the student body living in dorms, the options are limited. The saying is that the only safe place to have alcohol on campus is in your bloodstream because the administration is so strict about the dry campus policy. This causes many students to feel the need to binge drink. Pause dances are fun, but there's not much else to do. Every once in a while the one bar in town will have a concert, which is a blast, but they usually only happen in the early fall and late spring/summer."
College Junior,1,"Rich and White – For the most part the student body is rich and white.  There are of course exceptions, but I think the college just accepts minorities for either their athletic prowess, or simply for appearances.  The college is so notoriously white lutheran and conservative that they feel obliged to include minorities and international students in order to attract a wider audience.  Sometimes the rich kids get annoying and pretentious...no a lot of the time."
College Freshman,1,"One of the few downsides of the school. There's a local bus that runs a couple nights per week and is free and goes to the Target and a few other spots in-town but otherwise transportation is difficult (nonexistent) unless you have a car. Permits are hard to get and you have to live a certain number of miles away from school to get one, and the location of the parking lots is really far away. There is a ten-dollar (each way) bus that goes to the twin cities a couple times per week tho."
College Sophomore,1,Great Food but Not a Lot of Time – The food is great but at times can get very boring. It is also only open for dinner from 4:30-7 which is rediculous becasue then it is really crowded from like 5:15-7 and can't find a seat. They need to fix this. But they do have lots of options in the cafe. There is also a certain amount of mooney you get to the cage which is like a little cafe where you can get what you want. I wish all the dining was like this.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Living on campus means that most students do not have a car. Those who are allowed one must pay a particularly annoying permit fee, especially because there is usually plenty of parking space. The Public Safety Officers are really strict about enforcing the no-student-parking zones. With more annoying fines."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking here is terrible. If you're within 250 miles, you're not allowed a car; apparently if you live within this radius, your parents are expected to be available to come get you whenever you want to go home, which I find ridiculous. Permits are expensive too."

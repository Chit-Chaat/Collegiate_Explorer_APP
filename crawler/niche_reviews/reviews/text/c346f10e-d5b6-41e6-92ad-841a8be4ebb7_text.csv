Niche User,5,"Although the majority of my Bryan College classes were in-person, I submitted all of my papers and assignments online. The Bryan College website was very easy to use, and I really appreciated being able to submit my assignments online so I didn't have to worry about losing them."
Niche User,5,"My experience with Bryan College was great! The college website was very easy to navigate and my professor was absolutely amazing. I took several dual enrollment classes with Bryan College, and I really enjoyed working with them. Overall, I had a great experience and would recommend this college to anyone looking for a college home or simply a place to take dual enrollment classes."
Senior,5,I am enrolled in Bryan's online program and have loved it! The ability to take classes that fit my schedule has helped so immensely. The professors have also been very accommodating and patient with all of the craziness of COVID-19.
Freshman,5,I love the people at Bryan. The professor really care about you and the campus is very beautiful. I also feel very safe there.
Junior,5,"Awesome staff that will help you out in any situation you need help with. Very affordable, especially for online degrees and professors are very helpful and ready to jump in. I wouldn't choose anywhere else!"
Freshman,5,"A very great close knit Christian community. The faculty actually has time for their students. There are great work study opportunities. Life on campus is amazing, and makes a huge difference in one’s life."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Bryan College! The people here are my favorite - everyone is so welcoming and sweet, and the professors go out of the way to prove they truly care about their students. The quality of the education is great, and I am so grateful to be taught from a Christian standpoint - it makes a huge difference. The campus is safe, well-kept, and absolutely beautiful. It is NOT a party scene by any means, which is a blessing for me. Bryan inspires me to become a better Christian daily, and my relationship with God has definitely grown here."
Alum,5,I love this school.  It is a Christian college with exceptional character and standards.  I am proud to be a graduate of Bryan College.
Freshman,5,"Bryan College has given me the unique environment I sought after in my post-secondary education. The professors are caring and enjoy questions, my Chirstian faith is deepened daily, fellow students are encouraging and helpful, and the size allows for more personal classes."
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe on campus. Our assault rate is extremely low so that I don't feel like I am threatened at all.
College Senior,5,"It's an incredibly safe school, and the community is amazing. There's ""the wrong crowd"" that does ""the wrong things"" but those aren't dangerous things - they just party a little bit. They may do stupid things, but they never hurt each other. Obviously some people will cause trouble, but the community and the campus leaders deal with things well."
College Senior,5,"It's not always explicitly spelled out, but there's a solid network of people in the area who know and love the school and value its graduates for new hires. I don't know of any recent graduates who have had problems finding well paying jobs in their fields."
College Freshman,5,We have law enforcement on campus all day and we have rules set in place to make campus as safe as possible.
Recent Alumnus,5,I was there for a few years and it was one of the safest environments I've ever been in. Even the surrounding areas feel really really safe.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I adored my professors and found them accessible, knowledgeable, and personable. Many of them like to be invested in their students' lives."
College Freshman,5,"Bryan College has one of the most unique atmospheres I have ever experienced. With a small student population, it's not uncommon to see two or three familiar faces or even close friends on the way to class; because of this, students can find themselves easily welcomed into the family of Bryan."
Recent Alumnus,5,Respected school. I love that my degree is from Bryan college
Recent Alumnus,5,So happy with my decision to get my degree at Bryan college. Reputable school. Great advisors. A school with integrity.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are extremely nice and helpful and will work with you. The classes are challenging but you will learn.
College Sophomore,5,No alcohol or drugs are permitted on campus and students have no problem upholding to that rule.
Senior,4,The classes that I've taken through Bryan are all online based. The program used for online classes is easy to use and expectations are clear and fair. I've loved it!
Sophomore,4,"In my personal experience, Bryan College is a very welcoming environment. Everyone wants to see you succeed. My only complaint is some of the rules may be a little too strict."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes were very good. The transition from classroom to online were seamless, and I feel I learned as much as I did online as in the classroom."
Sophomore,4,"I took several years of school for Bryan online throughout high school. I joined as a Freshmen and had a blast. The professors and the material was amazing. I made a few mistakes with friendships and what not, so I don’t foresee myself coming back, but the school itself is great."
Sophomore,4,The school is amazing. The food is good quality regardless of what people tell you. The housing is just fine for young adults.
Graduate Student,4,Liked the community aspect of the school but could be more transparent on how the school uses funding.
Sophomore,4,"The community created here is very good. It is definitely a small school environment. All of your professors know you and want to know you and see you succeed. The RD, Resident Directors, care for you more than you would ever think and again want nothing but for you to succeed. 
This type of small school environment can either be very good for you or not so good for you, it all depends on your personality so you have to truly know yourself. 
The school's motto is ""Christ Above All"" and it is taken seriously here. Everywhere you look you see his presence. From chapel to church to mentoring programs to being able to sit down at pretty much any table in the cafeteria and have a good, accepting conversation with someone you can see this motto."
Sophomore,4,"Bryan College is great when it comes to athletics, academics and safety. However, the dorms really need updating. Dayton Tennessee is a small town so there isn’t much to do off campus but Chattanooga is a 40 minute drive and there is plenty to do there. It is not a party school. If you are looking for a small private college that is strong in academics and has many opportunities for athletes then this is a great choice."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere at Bryan College; everyone is so friendly and welcoming. I love the Christian background it provides. My bad experience with Bryan College has been with the staff and administration. Several instances the staff has turned their back on me. The most prominent example would be when my dorm room was infested with mold. None of the staff helped me or even believed me. I had no reimbursement for my damaged items, no medical reimbursement, no apology, no help moving out, and no discount on my room and board, even though I had to live in mold for half a year."
Freshman,4,"Bryan has been so far a good experience for me. The campus is not very big but has a good atmosphere. I feel like it is easy to make good friends and that is one of my favorite parts. Athletic facilities aren't great for the most part but athletics is one of my activities to attend at Bryan. The athletic teams are competitive for the most part and Bryan also offers lots of intermuals for everyone. Campus food is honestly is inconsistent. The grille is good most of the time and the Starbucks is nice. Academics is pretty good. Most of my professors are excellent. Of course there are some that aren't the greatest but most my professors are great teachers and are very approachable. All the staff is very approachable and are willing to have a conversation with you about anything. Some complaints would school financial mangament, specifically with building the Stophel Welcome Center instead of improving dorms and athletic facilities. Outside of that few complaints about the school overall."
Freshman,4,"I have been at Bryan College for almost a year now! Although being a first-time college student can be quite a difficult change and transition, Bryan College does a fantastic job of making the students feel at home and at ease! The faculty and staff are such wonderful and caring people who love their job and love the people! This college upon the hill has breathtaking views and is a great getaway from the stresses of life. The small campus life making being a student here comfortable and belonged. I have loved being here so far! :)"
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are on the small side so that I feel like the professors are really good about getting to know the students in the class individually. They are really friendly and want you to come to their offices after hours. The variety of the classes is really nice. You can explore many different subjects.
College Sophomore,4,The career services is extremely helpful. There are also many work study jobs on campus that are really nice for low income students like myself. The campus almost works on it own people.
College Sophomore,4,The housing is very close to class which is a huge plus. They are very clean and the rules are easy to follow. Many of the RA's and RD's are very good at their jobs!
College Sophomore,4,My school is small so the atmosphere is very friendly. There are so many great people there and usually most people say hello to each other as they walk to class.
College Senior,4,"The academic aspect of the school is solid, but has room for improvement. However, administration does not seem to be focused on the issues currently facing the school, and they aspire to make the school something that it's not."
College Freshman,4,"With the people being so close knit, and in such a small town, there is not much of a safety concern. There is a good police presenc2 that puts everyone at ease, and the school is always trying to keep the students as safe as possible."
College Freshman,4,I am very close to my professors and they are very helpful to me inside and outside of the classroom.
College Freshman,4,The buildings are old but then again the entire campus is old so you get the classic feel. I love living on campus and am very close to my hall.
College Freshman,4,I am very involved on campus already as a freshmen. It is really like a family here and teachers genuinely care about you.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I know many people with a variety of degrees who are working for reputable companies throughout Tennessee, Georgia, and internationally."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I absolutely loved living in the dormitories. I lived in Huston (which I recommend, if they ever open up again), Arnold, and the Townhouses. The Townhouses were great for phasing out of Bryan, Huston was the best for community, and Arnold had... a smell."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is definitely a great deal of school spirit, particularly when it comes to soccer and basketball. Many intramural sports are attended and participated in by the faculty and staff."
Recent Alumnus,4,"While there are some social divides, it's not difficult to see how many opportunities there are for community building. There are students from diverse academic backgrounds, and many unite for the purpose of Christian education. While there are some grievances against administration, I am so honored to know the faculty and staff and so amazed that I was able to learn under some of the most servanthearted people I have ever met."
Recent Alumnus,4,I had a great experience with most of my professors.
College Sophomore,4,Bryan college has an interesting atmosphere.  One of the greatest attributes it possesses is the ability for the students to simply find a professor who is willing to sit down with the student and discuss any topic.
College Freshman,4,This is a great school. I am not the best student and that is what makes me wish that I was at a scool that catered more to people like me
College Senior,4,I really like the family atmosphere on campus.  The school is small enough to get to know students and faculty as friends
College Junior,4,"I definitely would not go back and do things differently and choose another school. My school is the right size for to learn, get to know my teachers, and also know all of my classmates. Getting go know my teachers really makes me feel like I'm being taught by a friend instead of ""one of my teachers."" My college experience is definitely the best someone could ever ask for."
College Freshman,4,They did great. I just start looking in time for all of the funds I needed.
College Freshman,4,I don't have to cook plus most of the time it's pretty good so nothing to complain about
College Freshman,4,"Dorm life is fun, I'm still getting use to it though."
College Student,4,The people are extremely nice and helpful.
College Senior,4,I love being able to take the BA accelerated online degree program.  The registration process is not easy though.  Financial aid and business office communications are often confusing and not very helpful.
College Senior,4,I love the accelerated online option for a degree.
College Freshman,4,I'm really happy with my department so far.
College Freshman,4,Campus facilities are nice. They are always clean and they stay up to date. Outdoor spaces are wonderful on campus.
College Freshman,4,People on campus are really nice. Dating relationships are good relationships and many people end up finding there future spouse at Bryan.
College Freshman,4,Dining near campus is good. We don't really have a lot of chains but we do have a lot of local restaurants which are really good! They are also pretty cheap!
College Freshman,4,"We are in a small town but we are really close (30mins) to Chattanooga which has tons of stuff to do wether its shopping, dining, going to local attractions, or just hanging out downtown. In Dayton where the school is the cost of living is pretty cheap and restaurants are really affordable. There is a tone of outdoor stuff to do at Bryan. We have many hiking trails nearby with spectacular views of the mountains."
College Freshman,4,"My major, exercise and health science, is one of the popular majors on campus. The advisers in EHS are awesome. The program is great and is easily adaptable for what ever career you are pursuing. I want to be a Physical Therapist and this program is great for that."
College Freshman,4,Academics at Bryan is really great. All the professors are wonderful about making sure the students do there best. Class sizes are not huge which is great.
College Freshman,4,"Even though we are a small college, athletics are very big on campus and school spirit is high. Soccer is pretty big on campus. Our cross country team is one of the best NAIA teams in the nation. There is a gym and weight room open to everyone at Bryan which is nice."
College Freshman,4,Since we are in the mountains summer is warm and low in humidity and is not super hot. Fall is wonderful with the cool days and changing leaves in the mountains. Winter is cold and rainy rarely do we get snow.
College Freshman,4,At Bryan they do a good job of keeping things nice and updated. All the buildings look nice and are well maintained. The athletics building could use some renovations and additions but its not bad at all. The library is a very nice place to study with many resources and has a great view of the mountains. The green spaces on campus are beautiful. They do a great job of planting flowers seasonally and manicuring the lawns. Bryan is also a certified arboretum and we have lots of beautiful trees.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus at all times. I haven't heard of any crimes that have happened since I have been there. All dorms require key card access and the rooms lock also. At Bryan we have night watch people who make sure nothing goes wrong and we are also on top of a hill with a stately entrance that wards of any danger. 
College Sophomore,4,Exercise and Health Science is a great major to choose. The professors love their job and will help you love it too.
College Sophomore,4,If you want to live off campus then it is pretty easy to find a place and some say that it is even cheaper than living on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The people are very nice and helpful. However, there needs to be more financial aid options."
College Sophomore,4,Most students do not do drugs or drink. There are penalties for having or participating in these on campus so many do not do it. however it is still done.
College Sophomore,4,I feel fairly safe. The resident directors and assistants help make sure each student is feeling safe and if not then they take care of it.
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are extremely important and one of the biggest reasons students come to campus. Students highly enjoy going to games and it is a great way to interact.
College Sophomore,4,Internet is available everywhere on campus practically but there r a few deadzones.
College Sophomore,4,"I never have to worry about being in danger campus is well protected and as far health we are well cared for in that department too.
"
College Junior,4,"The community here is great. Some of the buildings are a bit old, but the cleaners to a great job keeping things neat."
College Junior,4,The people here are really sweet and friendly.
College Junior,4,Campus crime is really low. There are some instances of theft.
College Junior,4,The education program here is really great!
College Junior,4,My college is pretty good about promoting sports and games usually have a fair amount of fans come out to support the players. 
College Junior,4,"My college is great about dealing with the weather and has a very detailed inclement weather plan, which is important because of our two tornado seasons and mountain location which causes fog and other weather issues."
College Freshman,2,On camus we have no shortage of available computer labs. There are computer labs and printers in every residence hall and the library and education buildings. There is wi-fi everywhere on campus but it can be terribly slow during peak hours mainly at night. Streaming Netflix at these times is awful. But other than peak times it is great and very fast. Just during the peak times.
College Sophomore,2,I recieved just enough aid to help with my education a little more would have been helpful. 
College Sophomore,2,There is not much more then a few  fast food places locally we have walmart which is nice but not many options.
College Sophomore,2,"One dining hall. Has options but lacks in fresh fruit, and variety."
College Sophomore,2,"Dayton is a very small town with not a whole lot of events or attractions, but Chattanooga is about half an hour away and there is plenty to do there. If you like outdoor activities Dayton is in the perfect part of Tennessee for you. Pocket Wilderness area in Dayton is a great place to go!"
College Freshman,2,"Dayton is a small city that would barely show up on a map of the state. Other than local food and Wallmart, they have pocket. An old mining place that was turned into a recreational park, though the place is beautiful to go swimming or take a walk, the weather is only good for so long during school."
College Freshman,2,"The computers at Bryan College are somewhat outdated, and very slow. Though they do have a Mac lab, it is only for those who are in film or any other form of computer tech programs. There is only one lab that is open to the public that receives good wireless connection, yet the computers are still slow due to age and use."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Very Hard to Find, but Good If You Can Get It – Students aren't even allowed to live off-campus before the age of 22 (unless you can convince them you have an allergy) and the housing near campus fills up pretty quick with seniors and married couples. Fairly cheap if you can find something, though, and while you'll end up in a poorer neighborhood, it is relatively safe since Dayton is such a small town. I never had any problems."
College Freshman,2,"Permits are not too expensive, costing $50 or $100 depending on which permit you get. However, if you park in the wrong lot you will get ticketed even if there are many open spots and usually there are. Also, there is not a lot of parking around the dorms, and most people are forced to park in a gravel parking lot or down the hill that is a pain to walk up."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of White Students – The majority of students on the campus is white; however, they are different ethnic groups and everyone is accepted. There are also a lot of Christians here, but it is a Christian college. From what I have observed, the students here who were formerly home-schooled seem to enjoy it more and the other students are just here for athletics."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a Lot of Variety – There are some fast food places in the area (McDonald's, Arby's, Wendy's, Subway), and some pretty good non-chain restaurants. Peking House is probably the best. Bimbo's is open 24/7, so some students pull all-nighters there during finals. But there's just not very much variety. If you want really good food, you have to go to Chattanooga."
College Sophomore,2,"Mostly Christians and Whites – Being at such a small Christian school, we don't attract people from different religious backgrounds. We have many international students, but not many different races."
Sophomore,1,Online classes are much worse than in-person learning. And that says a lot because of how garbage the in-person learning is.
Sophomore,1,"I've been at Bryan since 2018, and it is a terrible school. Professors really don't care unless you put 200% effort, and even then it's a 50/50 chance of you building a relationship. The dorms are cesspools in terms of quality, along with the local town. Anything of relevance in terms of stuff to do is 45 minutes away. The academics are a joke, on average, you only have to devote maybe one hour for homework per class a week. Most of the students at this school are athletes, and the majority of these athlete-students are lazy and discouraging to have as peers. Along with this, teachers tend to go off on tangents and don't actually teach. I won't be finishing my degree at this dumpster fire of a school."
College Junior,1,"There are pretty much no transportation options at my school. The only way I can get transportation is if I can find someone to ride with, which is difficult, or if I can get my family to drive 11 hours to get me."
College Senior,1,We are on our own for transportation unless we are on an athletic team going to a game. If students don't have  access to a vehicle we walk to town.
College Junior,1,"You are not allowed to live off campus unless you are over 22, are living with family, or are allergic to the school. So it really does not matter the convenience or cost."
College Freshman,1,"This grade is a result of bad character at school. The idea of Christ above all, will affect your class work with even your conduct outside of class. Things such as drinking, sex, our tobacco use will cause letter grades to decrease. It is under many students opinions that what is done outside of class should not affect the work and effort put in to the class itself."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Very Conservative Policies – It's a Christian school, so just be prepared to deal with the conservative nature of the religion. Drinking of any sort is forbidden - regardless of age or whether or not you're on campus. You do anything illegal, you'll be asked to leave. You get caught even making out in public and you'll be warned a couple of times, eventually leading up to suspension. God forbid you get pregnant. Make sure to attend chapel on time. I didn't have too many issues until my last semester, so its definitely something you can live with, but make sure you know what you're getting into."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Small Town – There's not a lot to do in terms of normal college activities, but we can find things to do.  Dayton can get really boring sometimes, but there are plenty of parks, and Chattanooga's not that far away if you want to go shopping or to the movies or whatever.  Everything in Dayton kind of shuts down after 9 Pm, though.  Everyone in the town is really friendly and receptive to us, though.  I'm not really surprised.  I think we keep half the fast food places in town running."

Freshman,5,"What I like about Hampden Sydney College in specific is how close everybody is put together on campus. Most of the freshmen are in the same general area, and it allowed us to get to know each other. The professors and staff are very invested in each student's learning path and helping them along the way."
Alum,5,"My Hampden-Sydney experience was phenomenal.  I received a stellar education in an environment that helped me truly develop as a leader and as a man. The brotherhood and alumni network are second to none, and have remained with me after graduation. My four years on ""the Hill"" were a perfect balance of working hard academically, being involved in a variety of activities, having a ton of fun socially, and developing into the best version of myself.  I can't imagine attending any other school--Hampden-Sydney is unlike any other college in the country and I could not be more proud of my degree."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my time at Hampden-Sydney. The small classroom sizes and the relationships that are built with professors truly makes for a unique college experience. All of my professors know my name and hold me accountable for being diligent with my work and with any help I need on any topic. With Hampden-Sydney having about 1,100 students, the atmosphere on campus is incredible. Everyone says hello to one another, even if you may not know him or her. Hampden-Sydney has truly been a wonderful experience and I would not want to go to school anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"Hampden-Sydney is a college unlike any other. Being that it is one of the two left male-only colleges in the united States, the tradition and emphasis on brotherhood run deep. We take great pride in tradition and working hard in school while also having a ton of fun. Fraternity circle is the life of the weekend at Hampden-Sydney. If you want to go to Hampden-Sydney, you will have to work very hard in the classroom. However, the benefit of working hard is being able to experience the consistent fun all around campus after."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Hampden-Sydney. With the help of H-SC, I got into my top choice graduate program. I also had two job offers from H-SC alum, which speaks to the strength of the network."
Alum,5,Fantastic. So little colleges carry the value that Sydney does. Hampden Sydney College is not only a blessing in my life but a easily a home away from home
Niche User,5,"My older brother is a senior at HSC, and I have been on campus often for four years now. I plan to go there. HSC is unlike no other and I highly recommend, however, like all colleges it has its downfalls."
Freshman,5,"Hampden-Sydney is a small liberal arts college with an amazing alumni network that offers countless opportunities in virtually any discipline. As a freshman, I'm amazed at all of the different programs available to me. There are plenty of things to get involved in, and plenty of ways to stand out in a success-driven environment like HSC."
Alum,5,The single sex education kept me from getting distracted and helped me graduate in 4 years. I also learned leadership skills that helped me lead my fraternity.
Niche User,5,"HS-C is a great place to learn and have fun, HS-C is a great place to learn and have fun, HS-C is a great place to learn and have fun, HS-C is a great place to learn and have fun, HS-C is a great place to learn and have fun"
Freshman,5,"I greatly enjoy studying and living at Hampden-Sydney.  It is like one, big connected family of students and staff.  It is a peaceful place."
Junior,5,"Stellar school, it's fairly conservative but even a liberal, bisexual mixed kid like me can find a home at good ol' Sydney"
Freshman,5,"Hampden Sydney, as I have been exposed to it, provides a small classroom setting and Socrati-type structure to its curriculum. The resources available to students and the assistance provided by the faculty and staff was like that of no other."
Alum,5,"Hampden-Sydney College is near and dear to my heart. During my time there, I was pushed harder than I could have ever imagined, not to simply memorize the material and regurgitate, but to apply, think critically, analyze, and grow as an individual. I made friends I'll never forget, collaborated with world-class professors, learned to write and communicate effectively, and developed a powerful network that has played a key role in my professional success. I hope to one day give back to the college that has given me so much."
Sophomore,5,This school is the true meaning of brotherhood.  Hampden-Sydney College is great with small classes and professors that care.  I really like for all of our football games from freshman to all the alumni that come and support the team. This school makes going away to college an amazing experience.
Freshman,5,"This is as you know it is a all male college. This college has very good professors. The professors are easy to talk to and ask for help! HSC has a very good reputation within the state of Vrigina. Everyone is nice and welcoming. The pledge you sign is awesome. I can leave my stuff around with out it getting stolen. The buidlings are awesome, and they provide us students with plenty of study spaces. The staff are very willing to help you no matter what. The dorms are C rated altough. Overall, this college is great!"
Niche User,5,Hampden Sydney is an excellent school with great academics and sports. Hampden Sydney does not just prepare a student for getting a job or being accepted to graduate school; it prepares him for life.
Sophomore,5,Hampden-Sydney is an amazing College.  The College has high expectations and all are expected to do well.  When I was looking at Colleges I was set on Emory and Henry and then I had my visit at Hampden-Sydney and I know that this was the school for me.
Freshman,5,"Incredible School. Great Environment. Classes are very interesting, primarily taught in the Socratic method. Professors greatly emphasize critical thinking. The Honors Program, Wilson Leadership Center, Center for Entrepreneurship and Political Economy, and the many clubs (that you get to lead) always give you something fun to do during the week. Weekends provide a great opportunity to relax and party or go do something fun with one of the campus groups. I'm loving it!"
Junior,5,"Hampden Sydney has been a life changing experience for me as a scholar, gentleman and person. I have found one of the greatest treasures in the south. Hampden Sydney is a small liberal arts school in central Virginia with a long and proud history. I was accepted into several bigger schools like JMU but felt at home in a smaller school. I like being able to talk with my professors on a personal level outside of the classroom. Im more that just student 247. Im a genuine human being. The campus is absolutely beautiful. All the buildings are a classic federal design with Georgian touches.  I have found friends and my spot in the community here. There is honestly nowhere else I would rather be. "
Sophomore,5,There's truly no place like Hampden-Sydney College. The brotherhood makes this place special; everyone knows everyone. Students and professors are able to have discussions both inside and outside the classroom. The professors here teach students how to think for themselves! The tradition of honor here really distinguishes the college because it creates a great sense of trust among the students. There are numerous clubs and organizations in which a person can get involved.  I could go on and on about the college.  I have nothing bad to say about Hampden-Sydney College.
Junior,5,"My feeling about this school is that it is the best place on Earth. Coming from Richmond, Virginia allows me to be close to home if I ever choose to head that way, but that is a very rare occurrence. Whether you are considering attending or a current student, everyone is welcome here. Honestly, I understand how the thought of a small, all male, liberal arts school in rural Farmville, Virginia could make many people stay away. But, once on campus, you will realize how great this truly is. We have ladies visit on the weekends, everything a student will need is within a short walk from his room, and a liberal arts education really allows for a student to develop a knowledge of all majors before deciding on one. I highly recommend my home, my school, Hampden-Sydney, to everyone I meet because I truly believe this was the best decision I ever made."
College Freshman,5,"Hampden-Sydney College is a unique place due its all-male status and its rhetoric program. I would choose my school every time due to its strong brotherhood. When I was searching for a college HSC stood out to me, and that is why it was my top choice and my only choice."
College Sophomore,5,I've made some great friends and Hampden-Sydney was definitely the best decision for me.
College Freshman,5,"Gorgeous campus with tons of cool people, nice facilities, beautiful architecture, and friendly people."
College Freshman,5,Absolutely love all of my professors. They really care about their students and are experts in their field.
College Freshman,5,"Love the fraternities on campus! Awesome parties most weekends; occasional dead weekends. Parties are always happening on football weekends, and Greek Life plays a huge role in the tailgates."
College Sophomore,5,One unique aspect is that in the government department students have not much workloads other than readings. Class discussions enlightens a in depth analysis of issues discussed in class. Many students find themselves with internships freshmen year. The networking is great. There is a connection in the learning aspects. The opportunities are endless.
College Sophomore,5,Hampden-Sydney College offers courses that provides concrete skills in careers. The courses would sometimes entail working on projects along with guidance from professors. The academics are very vigorous because professors are not very concerned about publications and research but educating students.
College Junior,5,The amount of personal attention is incredible
College Junior,5,Our course load is rigorous but fulfilling and exciting
College Student,5,"Extremely athletic student body. Most everyone plays a sport of some type, whether it is varsity or intramural. "
College Student,5,Extremely fraternity-oriented school. There no other social life available outside of the fraternity circle. The girls are at the fraternities. Fraternities run the tailgates. 
College Student,5,"The academics at this school are intense. You will learn a lot. You can't skip, and if you do, the professors notice because the class sizes are 5-20 people."
College Freshman,5,Campus life outside of the classroom is not very strict. But inside of class is extremely strict with attendance records and  an extremely strict honor code.
College Freshman,5,Classes are hard and there are many majors that you can choose from.
College Freshman,5,"There is a large library that everyone seems to convene to when they are studying, In addition to that all of the academic buildings are open 24/7 to anyone who would like to go study inside of them."
College Freshman,5,"I love this school, and if I was going to do it all over again I would still come here."
College Freshman,5,"Some of the buildings on campus are very only, like 1800's old, but that adds to the value of the college. On the outside the buildings look very old but on the inside the building have all of the bells and whistles that you see in modern buildings today."
College Freshman,5,This school is very good at finding internships for its students. I haven't done any yet but I definitely plan on doing one.
Sophomore,4,The online experience was ok. It depended completely on professor. Some had fine online courses while others were completely disorganized and the material was poorly explained.
Senior,4,"From the first visit to the College, I was hooked. The environment was relaxing and personal. I have enjoyed every minute of attending this school."
Alum,4,Great college with a lot of tradition and majority of courses are meat and potato classes not a lot of silly ones. If you go and graduate you will come out a much better person with a remarkable amount of learning.
Alum,4,"Hampden-Sydney College provided me the opportunity to receive a premier liberal arts education, meet and make life-long friends, share thought provoking discussions in the classroom, travel abroad, and develop a common sense leadership approach amongst peers in an evolving environment - with an emphasis on integrity, morals, and ethics. Having graduated from ""H-SC"" and now an Active Duty Army Officer, I am most thankful for the principles I gained from this historic institution."
Freshman,4,"Hampden-Sydney is a great school with professors who want you to succeed. However, there isn't much to do besides going to the Circle. If you come here be prepared to put in the work, because it requires a lot of time to get good grades here. The weekends are very fun and everyone here is very close to one another. Not a very diverse student population, mostly white conservatives but many are polite about their views. Athletics are taken pretty seriously and the facilities are very good for a Division III school. The food and housing isn't the best but the connections that you have after school are fantastic, alumni are always happy to help in whatever way possible and as long as you are looking you'll be able to find someone who has a connection for something you want."
College Freshman,4,"I really like our school for what it is. It provides a great location, a beautiful campus, and a tremendous education."
College Freshman,4,"The classes I'm taking are really interesting. I like the size of the school, and the people in the school. I'm worried about the post-graduation my school offers. The tuition is really expensive too, so I'm trying to find ways to pay it."
College Freshman,4,Everyone here is friendly and accepting to your hobbies so its wonderful
College Freshman,4,I hated it so much when i first got here because i wanted to transfer but now i love it here and intend to stay all 4 years.
College Freshman,4,Good ratio at most parties
College Freshman,4,Admissions and President have been working studiously in recent years to increase diversity on campus. Far more ethnically diverse and friendly than some would have you believe.
College Freshman,4,Scholarships are the foundation of being able to attend this school. Only two or three students here are actually paying the full tuition.
College Freshman,4,"Secure campus populated by brothers who care about each other, however campus is not closed and is open to townies at any time of day, and facilities are usually left unlocked. However, police presence and student activism to fight serious crime is enough to warrant a four-star rating."
College Freshman,4,"Usually good parties with good ratio of guys/girls. Most fraternities tend to run out of alcohol fairly quickly though, which can be discouraging to party-goers. Fraternity Circle is the only real place to go for parties though, unless you know people at Longwood or Sweet Briar. The Circle is usually vibrant on weekends, though dead weekends do happen on occasion."
College Freshman,4,"Farmville is a great town, though we do have to share it with Longwood kids, who are annoying, cargo-short wearing dickheads. We end up taking most of their females though, which is awesome."
College Sophomore,4,Facilities are great because of the tradition shared on campus.  Athletic centers are very impressive with great awards won by sports teams. Our library ranks number four in the nation. Library offers free copies and even renting laptops. There are many sources available in the library.
College Junior,4,Many different options. Great parties.
College Student,4,"Elite college. If you can sacrifice getting less girls, experiencing occasional dead weekends, and not seeing any girls during the week; then, you will be rewarded with elitist connections, a six figure salary upon graduating, and almost guaranteed financial stability for the rest of your lifetime. A degree from H-SC is prestigious and respectable. "
College Student,4,Good overall. Wifi is everywhere. Computer labs are everywhere. Our library has free printing. 
College Student,4,"I got many scholarships to this school. It is easy to receive a lot of aid. Originally this school is $50,000 per semester. I go here for half of that, and have to maintain over a 2.8 to keep my scholarships. They are lenient with the GPA requirement and understand mess-ups. If your an eagle scout, you get an extra 5 grand per semester. "
College Student,4,"Not much precipitation. Not too cold. A lot of sunny, clear days. Rarely snows. "
College Freshman,4,"The facilities on the campus for the most part are great. The athletic facilities are outstanding and hold much tradition. The academic facilities are good for the specific needs in a classroom. The dorms are average, but very livable. The library on campus is one of the best you will find. "
College Freshman,4,"This is a community who's goal is safety. In many cases, authority figures will focus on a student's safety long before they will even think of consequences."
College Freshman,4,"Greek students and non-Greek students intermingle in a positive way. There is no real conflict and serious hate for ""GDI's"". Most parties are not exclusive to fraternities and guest, and invite the entire campus."
College Freshman,4,"For a Division III school, athletic facilities offered at Hampden-Sydney are fantastic. While there are no 100,000 person capacity football stadiums, there is a theme that parallels that of the entire campus. The tradition of the school and its athletics is something that cannot be matched by many schools. "
College Freshman,4,"The environment instilled at Hampden-Sydney is one of respect and trust, and there is no tolerance for a breach in either. With one of the strictest honor codes in America, it is very rare to find any criminal or suspect activity among students. The campus is secluded, which limits non-students criminal activity, however it has proven to be an issue in years past. Campus security has cracked down recently to assure that this won't be a recurring issue. "
College Freshman,4,"The beauty of Hampden-Sydney nightlife is you don't have to be a brother at a fraternity to attend fraternity parties. 95% of events are open to everyone, and it creates a fun and inviting environment."
College Freshman,4,"Parking is available from freshman year on, which is very convenient. "
College Freshman,4,"This is an all guys school, but on the weekends you cant really tell, girls are here all the time from other colleges like Longwood, Sweetbriar, and Hollins"
College Freshman,4,I got many scholarships and grants that helped me pay for my college tuition
College Sophomore,4,"The nightlife at the college can be pretty interesting. You have to know where to go and the right people to hang out with. Anybody can get to almost all the parties but some parties are more exclusive than others. If you need help, the brothers are always there to assist you. You really have not partied until you have came during Greek Week."
College Sophomore,4,The food on campus is pretty decent. We eat at the Commons and they provide various types of food; some days they do different themes. If you do not like the food at the Commons you can go to the Tiger Inn and order food that is cook and a lounge-type scene. The food at the Tiger Inn is pretty good.
College Sophomore,4,"There are very few girl at the college, considering that it is a males' college and all. The only girls that attend are the ones that have parents that work at the college. The guys here are pretty cool. They are pretty much laid back until it is time for work."
College Freshman,4,"Luckily freshmen are allowed to have cars on campus. I don't have a car on campus this year but a lot of my friends do. Parking is fairly easy to find and the costs of permits are not that much. Seeing as everything is in walking distance, a car isn't that necessary unless you plan on leaving a lot on the weekends."
College Freshman,4,"HS-C has good food in the dining hall but the food gets kind of repetitive. The Tiger Inn is our late night dining option that has really good food but the prices are a little high. An unlimited dining pan is mandatory for all freshman, but its worth it."
College Freshman,4,"HS-C's security is the greatest. it is a collection of either off duty police or retired police. A great example of their awesomeness is that a few moths ago there was an armed robbery at a bank in Farmville, VA. Neither the Farmville police nor the Virginia state troopers could catch him, and yet our security rode out to assist them and ended up chasing him down and capturing him in the woods. As far as on campus drinking goes, they are really laid back about it as long as you are honest and you aren't making any kind of trouble. There have been a few thefts in dorm rooms but they were committed by non-students. Just do the smart thing and lock the doors and windows when you leave."
College Freshman,4,Biology is likely to be my attended major while I am attending Hampden-Sydney College. The school offers excellent programs to help students get involved in there field of study. Hampden-Sydney offers Pre-Health Societies and they also offers programs i which students can obtain internships and programs that allow students to shadow doctors. The curriculum can be manipulated so that after you take your basic classes then you then can focus on your major.
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy attending Hampden-Sydney College because the professors are one-on-one with the students and they provide time if the students need help with any problems they are having, whether they are academic or personal. The curriculum is pretty straight-forward and to the point and it allows the students to get a sense of direction in the field of study they are interested in. The workload is not extremely unbearable, you just have to do your work when it is given to you and not procrastinate. It is especially important to get study rooms with friends because that way you will have motivation to actually do your work instead procrastinating. The best places to study are Bortz Library and in one of the various classrooms that are open to students 24/7."
College Freshman,4,Off campus dining is good. There a lot of fast food joints and a couple mom and pop joints also. If you know what to order then you can have a good experience.
College Sophomore,4,"Brotherhood With Fun Girls – Hampden-Sydney College is an all boys college, but girls come from Longwood University, Sweet Briar College, Lynchburgh College, and many other institutions on a daily basis. Since HS-C is all male, we all are just like a big brotherhood. Of course every student differs; country, nerd, athlete, gothic, gay, etc; but we all still stick together and help each other out. Everyone likes one another and there are never any fights. At many schools I visit I get an awkward look when I say hi when I pass another person, but at HS-C no matter who you say hello to you are always bound to receive a hello and smile back. Whether it is a fellow student you don't even know, or a female visiting from another school. The girls who visit are always down to party and have a good time. In my experience at other colleges, some girls will be stubborn and rude if you even say hi to them, but at HS-C all the girls are friendly and want to talk to a guy. Think about it, a girl isn't going to visit an all male school to not have dealings with a male."
Freshman,2,"What I've experienced on campus has been mediocre at best. While there may be activities available to distinguish yourself from the rest of the student body, this is mainly because most of the students don't have any drive. Academics is the best experience on campus, but this can be found at most colleges. The reputation of the school is something to worry about here as outside of  schools with close connections to the campus, reputation as a ""Hampden-Sydney Man"" is that of alcoholism and ignorance. This is true as  you will encounter people that party frequently and engage in different types of drugs. As an active student with fine arts and on campus activities with minorities and student run organizations, I've found that most interactions with people mainly reflected around discussing alcohol and non-academic activities. RAs and professors will party and drink with freshman. I am currently looking to transfer and would strongly suggest reconsidering your decision to come here."
College Freshman,2,From what I can see off-campus housing is not the best option. Most people live on campus. Since people drink a lot here off campus housing is generally not the best idea.
College Freshman,2,"There is no variety. You're pretty much stuck with the Fishin' Pig, Shogun, Cook-Out, Bojangles, and a few Mexican places in town."
College Freshman,2,The housing here is pretty awful overall unless you can manage to get a really good dorm when you're an upperclassman. Freshman housing is pretty bad overall. It's very cramped generally.
College Freshman,2,"Science programs are hard as hell at this school, though the degree is by far worth more than most nowadays, as graduates from this school are so few and far between, with a large amount of people cracking and dropping out before they reach sophomore year. Honestly, it seems like it gets far easier after freshman year."
College Sophomore,2,School could do better on food. Lacks any real options that are healthy or really excellent food.
College Student,2,"Bad food. Our cafeteria is known as ""The Moans"". Whatever though, we are dudes, so we don't really care. There is always a salad bar, sandwich bar, cereal bar, and pizza. It's whatever."
College Student,2,"Old Virginia, cow fields, in the middle of nowhere. Longwood is 5 minutes. UVA is 1 hour. Tech is 2 hours. VCU is 1.5 hour. JMU is 3 hours. "
College Sophomore,2,"The weather here is unpredictable; sometimes it rain, sometimes it is sunny. When it snows we still have classes. The school have not cancelled a class since the Civil war and I do not think that it is going to change anytime soon, but you get lucky once and a while if a professor cancels his or her class. The walk from the classes to the dorms is not that far so that is a plus."
College Freshman,2,"Outside of cigarettes, the only drug you really have to worry about is alcohol which is pretty prevalent on campus. I don't drink but I know a lot of the students do. If you tell people you don't drink they will leave you alone instead of forcing you to do it. Campus security I think does there job well when it comes to enforcement though there is always room for improvement."
College Freshman,1,"There have been cases of under cooked food being served. Earlier this year there was an outbreak of norovirus, which is food borne, that cause a third of the student body to get sick, and school had to close for three days."
College Student,1,"There is no diversity. The typical Hampden-Sydney student is white, preppy,  conservative, and southern. If you are that, it is nice. If you aren't any of those things, it is difficult here, but not impossible. Mostly wealthy kids, but if you aren't wealthy it isnot a big deal, only new money chatch's brag and talk about their money here. "
College Sophomore,1,"There is really not much transportation at the school.  The taxi service from in town has shut down and the shuttle buses do not run to campus location. The distance to town is not that far (4 to 5 miles) and in town you can find a bus station, shuttle buses, and other means of transportation for a reasonable price."
College Senior,1,"The only possible chance for an off campus housing assignment is if you are a senior with a really good GPA. Other than that, you would have to pay $6,000 on campus and whatever the rent is at the off campus house."

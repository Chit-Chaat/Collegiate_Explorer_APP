Niche User,5,I have not spent any time learning my classes online so I am unable to attest to how good the online education is.
Niche User,5,Super friendly and welcoming atmosphere. I greatly enjoyed my experience there at Crosswise and made many friends.
Freshman,5,Concordia University Irvine has a great Nursing Program. They offer an advance BSN program which is 15 months long. The instructors are great and the program focusing on the incorporation of faith into healing.
Freshman,5,The first two theology classes for the Advance BSN are completely online.  The classes were heavily focused on reading and writing with some discussion amongst students and instructors.
Alum,5,I took most of my classes in person and I loved all of my professors. I feel like they helped me gain the most from my undergrad experience in terms of education. The campus is also in a great location.
Senior,5,"I love that the class sizes are on the smaller side! This allows you to ask your professors for help more often, as well as make friends pretty quickly. It’s a nice campus in Southern California, with facilities such as practice rooms and a gym for students to use. I would say that one thing that the college could change is its method of signing students up for classes. It is a bit of a stressful situation signing up on your own, and I feel that the process could go faster if the advisors enrolled the students in their chosen classes during the allotted appointment times."
Junior,5,The online experience was great. I think it provided enough room to breathe but also provided a great learning opportunity. technical issues were fixed within the day (or by the next morning).
Freshman,5,"I wanted to find the best when it came to college. And given that I had already stayed a week at Concordia University Irvine the previous summer during the Higher Things conference, I knew this would be a good fit for me. My major is Psychology and I'll be participating in the Pre-Seminary program as well. The experience I've had with the staff and professors has been remarkable and I can't wait to attend."
Junior,5,"I enjoy the professors, sports, campus, and local area. There is a lot to be involved in outside of campus. The sports at Concordia are very competitive and I am a sports management major so I enjoy that. I would like to see living situations for students. I would also like to see the choices of food improve. Students want more options and also later hours so that we can eat at any time of the day and not only within a specific time range."
Freshman,5,"The culture here is amazing people are so kind, and helpful,making me feel at home. it was hard leaving home but with the love ad support at my school makes everything go much smoother.  I am excited for my future and I am trying and will continue to make my mom happy and proud. with that being said i cant leave her with such big payments and debt, she is a single mom and takes care of my sister and I and i would do anything i an to maintain my grades to receive scholarships or any kind of help."
Sophomore,5,"After spending my freshmen year on campus I loved this school. I'm excited to return and pick up my involvements in clubs and athletics. I am excited to hear how my professor's summers were and what they did. At this school, I feel like the staff and teachers care about me and want me to succeed. I've met some life long friends and great people. Stoked that I choose this school."
Graduate Student,5,I am a graduate student in an online program. It has been very conducive to my work schedule and the cohort of students I'm in are from all over the state. It's been great to network with different students and professors. Courses are 8 weeks long and we meet every other week in person through the computer. It's very doable.
Freshman,5,Best choice I could've made to attend this beautiful school. Helpful staff and safe environment. Everyone here seems to genuinely care about your success.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Concordia University Irvine, has been amazing. I got into a JumpStart program that helped me know the campus better and was over the summer, for free. The professors are very caring and try to help as much as possible as well as the staff and everyone else. Students are very friendly and create an amiable hemisphere throughout the campus. There is so much we can do in such a small campus."
Alum,5,Small school feel with plenty of academic rigor. Have had plenty of opportunities since graduating. All my best friends are still from this place. It used to be called Christ College because he’s there!
Niche User,5,"Excellent school that personalizes instruction, cares about the students and gets you out in 4 years. The academics are challenging and meaningful. The instruction and knowledge applies to the real world and encourages leadership and gives the student the background they need to get employment in changing fields and a changing world.
Concordia offers competitive academic scholarships and can help a student earn their degree in four years because the classes are small and the counselors know what they are doing. Counselors and teachers work with you one on one to make sure you are on track and growing as a learner.
Concordia is also a very beautiful, safe campus and the dorms are some of the best in so cal."
Senior,5,The campus is amazing and big. If it also has very good student resources for the students to get help from the teachers.
Junior,5,amazingly supportive faculty. Professors are incredibly knowledgeable and care beyond their normal role. Nursing experience is fantastic and highly recommend for an accelerated BSN. Great food. Great academics. Super safe. Veteran friendly. Mom friendly.
Niche User,5,I loved the campus and the area around Concordia is beautiful I would definitely  recommend this school to people around the area.There are a lot of things to do around the area.The irvine spectrum is very close by or if you want to go on a hike it is also relatively close.
Senior,5,"I love the challenging, Christ-centered learning at Concordia. The small school provides opportunity for intimate relationships with fellow students and professors. I felt personally invested in every step of my education, and I am grateful to have been taught to be wise, not just educated."
Niche User,5,What I like about Concordia Irvine is that the campus is beautiful and the staff is very welcoming to incoming new students.
Junior,5,Concordia University is an excellent school but is definitely small. Professors engage with you much more personably and efficiently than at a public university because classes are smaller. The music program is excellent and I do not know much about athletics.
Graduate Student,5,The staff has been very kind and attentive to my needs. The information provided to me early helped me book travel and order books for courses well in advance.  I am also impressed by their live YouTube orientation session they held with Dr. John Townsend.  He answered our questions submitted via chat and had an upbeat and positive attitude about the whole thing.
Senior,5,I like it because you can still be you and express your self and show your faith to others in your college life
Niche User,5,Concordia gives you that individual attention you need to be successful. They want for their students to get that help when ever they need it and be themselves.
Senior,5,"Love the small classrooms. Professors truly care about your performance in class and help out as much as possible. Small classes allow us to have close relationships with each other and the professor. Excellent student success programs like WINGS and student tutoring. The ASCUI provide events for the students that are fun and enjoyable. The accommodate to commuters and residents. Overall, the community at Concordia is one of fellowship and positivity."
Niche User,5,The meals offered at Concordia are delicious (esp. the breakfast burritos).  The dorm rooms are really nice.  The professors really seem like they care about you and believe in you.
Freshman,5,I like how this college is beyond greater in teaching about the material and implementing our own way of thinking about the subject. It's great for me.
Graduate Student,5,"I am enjoying my experience of being a distant learner graduate student at CUI. I feel more connected to my cohort and professor, then when I attended undergraduate school at CSULB. Great professor and academic programs."
College Freshman,5,"I love this school because everyone so kind and friendly, whether they know who you are or not."
College Freshman,5,"i definitly feel safe when i am at concordia, there are always people around to make sure people are safe"
College Freshman,5,"coming to the school to play water polo and ending up playing volleyball really shows how great this school is. although i might not be the best, the coaches allowed me to participate on the team and doing what i love"
College Freshman,5,"i feel very safe on this campus. Usually girls are told to not go out and walk around campus at night and usually are told to hurry back to their dorm as quickly as possible, but i feel this is not the case here. i always feel very safe with this campus and the surrounding city of Irvine."
College Junior,5,My overall experience has been great! It has broaden my mind.
College Junior,5,It's in the 2nd safest city in America in a gated community. You're fine.
College Junior,5,"The professors here are caring and smart. Many have a personal investment in my success. Some people hate on the core classes, but I like that they make you think in new ways and explore unsual topics."
College Junior,5,"Although concordia wasn't my top pick, I am so glad I came here. It is my home! People are so friendly and often form long-lasting relationships. From Core to the academic showcase to the Honors program, there are a lot of ways to grow academically. Professors will have lunch with you, make tea for you, and tutor you in whatever you need help with. Although tutors and TA's are available, the professors themselves are very invested in helping you succeed. There are also many opportunities in the student leadership program. The only complaints I have would be the separation between athletes and the rest of the student population. Although the dorms are larger than many dorms at other colleges, at this point they are old and falling apart so really not that great."
College Freshman,5,"I love that the dorms open to the outside, the fresh air is super important to me."
College Sophomore,5,Concordia University provides many services to prevent sexual assaults to secure a safe campus.
College Freshman,5,As a student at Concordia Irvine I feel very safe always. Personally and emotionally.
College Freshman,5,"Going into college I was scared about taking college classes but Concordia really does have the perfect classes. Professor wise and class size wise. Taking classes at Concordia are great the Professor make sure to help you any way you need it and they actual try to build a great teacher student relationship with them, their there you. They actually put the effort in to make sure you succeed. Along with that the class sizes are pretty good. No too big or not to small. They smaller class sizes gives you that one on one experience with the teacher. The course offered are amazing and not too difficult either. It's a liberal arts school so the first two years you are required to take core course which are not that bad either. The academics at Concordia University Irvine is just the right fit for people looking for a smooth transition from high school."
College Freshman,5,"Sports at Concordia University Irvine is one of the things that's brings us all together. Its amazing how involved everyone is and how we all come togrther to support each other. Weather it be in the gym, on the field or even on the track you see so much joy within everyone. Their is so mucg team spirit all around! You can hear the screamimg eagles from miles away. The athletics facilities are also great the school really tries to gives us the best! As an athlete you are given some many opportunites to shine with your teammates."
College Freshman,5,"Concordia University Irvine is the school for me. It's great the professors, the campus and the students. I feel as if everyone is one great big family. The campus is a beautiful campus in one of the safest cities right around the corner from some of the most gorgeous beaches. The whole school is like one big community, it's amazing coming together for sporting events or even just Friday chapel services. So far Concordia has given me the perfect college experience."
College Freshman,5,We are a gated community in the safest city in the US. Campus safety is great and will come out to drive you at night if you feel threatened. They are always walking and driving around and make you feel safe.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school: the professors, students, and campus all are amazing. One thing: if you don't want to work hard and think a lot, do not come here. Our Core program (now Enduring Questions and Ideas) challenges you to think between disciplines and enter into the Great Conversation. If that appeals to you, apply here. I love my core classes, and much prefer them to normal general education courses."
College Freshman,5,"Concordia University of Irvine has been the great experience because everyone here knows how to make you feel that you will accomplish these four years of college and they are very helpful. Especially, because I'm in the Wings Program for the first generation family and it has taught me a lot."
College Sophomore,5,"I am currently a Sophomore at Concordia University Irvine. The atmosphere on campus is so lively and positive. The relationships you build with professors, students, and staff are life changing. Just within my first year here I obtained an off campus internship at Hoag Hospital. I have gained so much knowledge about my religion and topics I never discussed in High School. If I were a Senior again in high school, I would definitely choose Concordia again. The school offers so many extracurricular activities, chances to be in leadership, athletics, and top academics. The dorms are the best I have seen in comparison to every college tour I went to in California. Attending Concordia University Irvine is the best decision for any college student to make."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love my school. It is the perfect environment and the only school that instantly felt like home for me. I think it's great that most of the classes follow almost a Socratic style, where we deeply discuss questions and topics instead of being given direct answers.  It may be frustrating, but I find that it helps us grow a lot as individuals very quickly.  There are so many different events on campus to get involved in.  The small community ensures that you will see a few dozen familiar smiling faces throughout the day.  I love all the people I've met, the classes I'm taking, and the future ahead of me."
Recent Alumnus,5,"My experience at Concordia has been great. I always feel like my teachers an coach are pushing me to be my best and want me to succeed far beyond college. I also like that Concordia is a relatively small school because the relationships you create are closer and more intimate. I always feel like I know the people around me instead of feeling like I'm surrounded by strangers. Lastly, Concordia's location is great. It is in a very safe area, close to many attractions such as disneyland and the beach, and the overall demographics are of high quality."
College Senior,5,i had a great experience
College Junior,5,"Concordia offers an education unlike any other. It's personable professors are able to connect with their students and get to know them individually, all while being able to share the gospel message of Jesus Christ."
College Junior,5,My experience at Concordia has been amazing. The professors truly care about the success of their students and definitely have helped me every step of the way. It is so easy to get involved at Concordia and everyone at the school is so nice!
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Concordia. The smaller classes sizes allow me to better excel in class. I love being able to recognize people on campus and the feeling of a tight knit family. Our athletic teams are very successful and make going to watch very entertaining!
College Sophomore,5,It was the best choice I could have made.
College Sophomore,5,"Again, this is the perfect program for a professional coach seeking to increase knowledge while maintaining current employment."
College Sophomore,5,Great program and professors.  Perfect focus of study for my coaching philosophy.
College Sophomore,5,"This program is perfect for a professional coach who wants to continue education, yet remain in current coaching position."
College Sophomore,5,The online classes and discussion boards are very convenient and informative.
College Sophomore,5,The online program and the faculty have been excellent.
College Junior,5,"Living on campus is great. It is easy to get to classes, make new friends, and visit the library."
Senior,4,"Met some of the greatest people, and fantastic professor's. Some of the politics of the school can be messy and you have to have an iron fist when it comes to dealing with the administration especially if you want anything to get done."
Alum,4,"I attended Concordia while obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Mass Communications. I absolutely loved my classes, professors and class sizes. I truly enjoyed my time there."
Senior,4,"The content we used online was mainly due to the switch from in-person following the Coronavirus outbreak. There was not a lot of given time for professors to completely change their classes to fit the needs of the curriculum, so it was a bit rushed towards the very end of the semester. However, there were video lectures as well as PDF homework assignments and online modules that helped enforce learning."
Junior,4,"Overall, the experience is great. The students are the heart of the campus; they are beyond welcoming they are a family. The campus is not huge which makes it nice to go from the dorms to classes to the cafeteria. The parking structure is okay, but they do fill up very fast. It is a great community to be around with lots of activities to keep you occupied. 
The teaching faculty is amazing, they show their interest in the students and really want to teach us. Yes, there are some professors who do give busy work. 
The academic counselors can use work. It seems as if they just want to keep you there for as long as possible. Want to transfer? You most likely can't unless you transfer to a Concordia school. It has its great perks and its downfalls just like any other school."
Freshman,4,"I am very content with the services at Concordia University and would this to anyone who is looking forward to attend university. The Teaching Staff and the administration team are always available to answer any given questions i have.
I  also do feel that the fees are quite high in regard to the Scholarship they give on admission."
Alum,4,"CUI is a small, Christian school in Irvine, California. It is of Lutheran affiliation. Depending on your major, the faculty is kind and expects a lot of their students, but are accessible to help in any way they can. It is easy to get involved on campus and is a great way to meet people. I highly recommend living on campus if you can, but many students commute. Because it is a tight-knit community, you will feel surrounded by friends and colleagues all the time."
Alum,4,"I did not take any undergraduate classes online, but I am now a graduate student and all of the classes are online."
Graduate Student,4,I like that the masters program is online. This allows me to work and go to school at the same time.
Graduate Student,4,The professors seem to be well informed and relatable. They are understanding and helpful. They have balanced the classes so that online meetings are not burdensome.
Senior,4,"Concordia University Irvine is a very safe and welcoming campus. You have the opportunity to form personal relationships with the staff, professors, and many students due to it being a small campus. There is not much of a party scene, but you will feel at home, everyone is kind and genuinely cares about your education. You are in driving distance of many great attractions such as LA, San Diego, Huntington, Laguna, and Newport Beach, Disneyland, hikes, and much more. It may not be a fancy university, but it is continually improving and focuses significantly on its students rather than having elegant buildings. It is a beautiful campus with much greenery. Improvements are being made; we just added new recording studios and two new buildings for the music and theology departments. You will not be disappointed in the welcoming environment demonstrated by those of Concordia. You will make meaningful relationships if you choose to be active in the Concordia community."
Alum,4,"Concordia University Irvine is a great school. It is in a very safe location and Irvine is a great city to attend a college. It has great teachers and students, and I greatly enjoyed earning my degree here"
Junior,4,Concordia is a beautiful school with many wise professors and a friendly community. There could be more growth in the flexibility of certain departments and class availability.
Senior,4,I love how it is a small campus. The professors are wonderful and are really flexible with office hours. The one thing that could improve is the food.
Sophomore,4,"I like that Concordia is a small school, it almost feels like its own small town. The class sizes are typically no more than 25 students, which allows you to know your professor. Concordia's location is also very convenient being next to UCI and the beach. One thing I would like to see from Concordia is more eateries other than the cafeteria and Eagle's Landing."
Freshman,4,"What I like about Concordia is the small ratio classes so it's easy to connect with different professors, friendly and outgoing people you will meet on campus, and spacious dorms. Some changes that I would like to see is more investment in the science department, ways that allow students to freely express their creativity on campus, more varieties concerning with the meal plan, and better building structures."
Niche User,4,"CUI has a beautiful campus, the students are very friendly! The caf has good food and the sense of community is very strong. The dorms are quite roomy and I have zero complaints!"
Senior,4,The professors are the highlight of the school. It is expensive and the food and dorm life is very restrictive but the academics are great.
Alum,4,"Concordia University Irvine is a very wholesome school. Although incredibly expensive I believe that money was well spent on the education I received at Concordia. However there isn't much campus life activities which is why I feel like although Concordia is a dry campus many students end up partying in the dorms. I had a good run at Concordia and I wouldn't take it back, but if I could do it over I would probably pick a bigger school that is more diverse and not so close minded."
Niche User,4,"This school is wonderful! I plan to commit in the next week, and I am so excited! The small, safe, campus is full of friendly students, good food, and excellent, faith-based academics."
Junior,4,"I would recommend to be financially stable or at least have enough financial aid to avoid any stress about paying tuition. Other than that, they offer good dorms and good, fresh cafeteria food that always has a salad bar or grill if you crave burgers or fries. There's a decent amount of clubs but not many parties so it's pretty quiet around here."
Junior,4,"The professors, classes, and student activities are amazing! Professors are very available to talk to and most genuinely care about how you are doing and are willing to help you outside of class, even with projects unrelated to their specific class in some cases.The material is engaging and forces you to think in new ways and see how the different academic disciplines can connect together. However, the administrative side of Concordia (academic advising, financial aid...) is not very well organized and could use some improvement. Great education department and many study abroad options, with opportunities to meet students from all across the world. Students are very friendly and there is always an interesting event going on somewhere on campus. If you are looking to engage in learning and thinking in new ways, put in hard work, and still meet diverse individuals who are goal-oriented but still love to have a good time, then look no further than CUI."
Alum,4,I received my Master's in educational administration from Concordia with a CA admin credential as well.  All of my classes were online and the program was easy.  1.5 years total.  Affordable and very manageable program.
Sophomore,4,Great school focused on faith and the personal growth of students. I have met really amazing people at this school and most professors are dedicated to what they do.
Niche User,4,"Concordia University is a University with a large diversity. Students feel very comfortable. They are able to contact their professors and they interact well. The campus offers a good way of silence and quietness. Not only does Concordia University help students grow academically to become future leaders, but they also develop a personal connection with Jesus Christ. Students at Concordia University are well involved at their community and in their studies. They strive for the best, thanks to the help provided by the University."
Freshman,4,The school atmosphere is great. It is very difficult to transfer in or out of this school because of the hyper-specific general ed classes. Most professors are easy to work with. Almost all professors are religiously affiliated with the Lutheran church.
College Freshman,4,So far I like all of my professors. Some are better than other but none are awful.
College Freshman,4,I know I have a direct internship that I can be a part of over summer and I know I will have a lot of connections once I graduate.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe walking from the theater to my dorm at 11 at night
College Freshman,4,The dorms are great and the halls are beautiful. They are dorms so they are small but they aren't too small.
College Freshman,4,"Almost all of the students on campus are athletes so the school revolves around them a little bit,  but it is not necessarily a bad thing."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, it has been a great experience. The class sizes are small. There is only one big lecture hall. The arts program is very good. The sports program is also very good."
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of connections if you search for them and go to events/ join clubs. There is an online website to help with finding a job. Internships are a bit difficult to find.
College Sophomore,4,The rooms are very spacious. The cleanliness depends on the people living in the rooms. The RDs work hard to find the best RAs for the job.
College Sophomore,4,"Many students are involved in athletics, both varsity sports and intramurals. The performance has been good enough that they are now NCAA division 2. The is a lot of school spirit for sports. The facilities are great for some and good for others."
College Sophomore,4,Most of the professors really care for the students success and well-being. The campus is in a beautiful setting. The people are overall welcoming and caring.
College Freshman,4,We have security guards at the entrances of the campus. There are always guards or workers patrolling the campus grounds.
College Freshman,4,"The courses are easy enough to manage, and the advisors are there to help you with anything. Most of the professors I have gotten were pretty good at the subject, and they're all super friendly."
College Freshman,4,"Students could always find a job on campus, and they offer internships. The interviews are easy and straightforward, and advisors will find time for the students to work."
College Freshman,4,"Most people are happy with their roommates, and the campus is full of friendly people you can talk to"
College Freshman,4,Every student is welcomed to every sports event. Advisors work with athletes to work out their class schedules to best fit with their practice. I love Midnight Madness! It's a super exciting way to start the basketball season with free chic-fil-a and light show and basketball dunking contest.
College Freshman,4,It's a small school where everyone is super friendly
College Freshman,4,i love the school and campus. everybody is very friendly and loving and really make you feel like you have a home.
College Freshman,4,rooms are big and great and clean.
College Freshman,4,"From the second i stepped on the campus, i made a ton of friends. This year at concordia has been one of the best years of my life, i love the students and the fact that you can talk to your proffessors outside of class and on a personal level. You can definitly tell that the school wants everybody to succeed."
College Freshman,4,Excellent Wellness Center and support .
College Freshman,4,I am very happy of my choice !!
College Freshman,4,Very professional in the Business Department !!
College Freshman,4,Wish there was a pool on campus !
College Freshman,4,Love the location and professors !
College Freshman,4,"i have only been here one year so i am hoping my love for this school only continues to grow. However, i love my school. i am going to college because i find it necessary, but i do not love to learn and go to school. But having Concordia as my home makes it much easier."
College Freshman,4,"Campus housing is nice because you get your own space. You do not necessarily have to share everything with your roommate. Also, it is nice to have a personal bathroom, rather than a communal one. It is always clean outside and i have never had a problem with maintenance."
College Freshman,4,"So far, i love my school. i like how their general education is different than most, making it challenging, yet intriguing. It is unique because of its programs for core, as well as its Lutheran affiliation. I would definitely chose this school again."
College Junior,4,"Concordia's sports team is a great way to express one's personality or to channel that inner energy. Sports is also when faculty, students, family, and friends come together to celebrate and support the athletes."
College Sophomore,4,We have a lot of local diversity as well as international diversity with our many foreign exchange students.
College Sophomore,4,"Our campus is a dry campus, meaning no alcohol anywhere on campus.  Yes, that even goes for the 21 year old seniors living in the dorms... no alcohol."
College Junior,4,"I love living on campus because it's close to class and work and I get to see my friend's a lot more than commuters. They're relatively spacious and landscaped well, however, they hired the worst contractors to build it. So many things are crooked or shabby, the light sockets are upside-down, but on only half the room to make it confusing, pretty much all the hot and cold water is backwards. These are minor complaints that add up to a lot of annoyance."
College Freshman,4,"Nothing special, but some professors are unbelievably terrific."
College Freshman,4,"It's a gated community, and as a guy, I've never felt unsafe on campus."
College Sophomore,4,I love my campus. It has provided me with a lot of opportunities. Professors are always available and classes are not too large so you will have the attention you need.
College Sophomore,4,The people at this university are very friendly and it is very easy to make friends.
Niche User,2,"awesome environment & id like to see more of it and meet new people. great school to attend , heard administrators are cool & they are understanding and helpful !"
Junior,2,"Some professors are very helpful, but others unfortunately in my major are unresponsive to questions or additional help needed.  The school does not keep pace financially with aid awarded in ratio to the amount that they increase tuition and other school expenses, making each year more difficult to attend.  And they are very heavy handed about collecting fees from students!
The campus and food are good.  
In hindsight this might to have been the best choice."
Freshman,2,"The friends I made were the only good part. The school and the education they are giving is a joke. Go there if you will be majoring in Christ College, anything else isn't worth your time."
Sophomore,2,"The location of CUI is one of its best features. Some of the professors are amazing. However, the campus is small, dorms are okay but over capacity, food choices are limited and mediocre, they nickel and dime you for everything, tuition rates increase every year, their Academic Advising department is not helpful, their office staff have very rude workers, they are cutting programs, and  not fully developing programs they have promised they would. Most ""student life"" happens off campus."
College Freshman,2,"I heard it's hard to get into a sorority or fraternity. I never hear about parties either and I don't even know if they exist in the school, but I don't really like parties so I'm okay with it."
College Junior,2,It's like going to prison.
College Freshman,2,Most of the time the cafe is bad but sometimes it is really good and that happens to be mostly on weekends.
College Freshman,2,"There are some restriction at school. You can not drink alcohol on the campus, and you can not have someone stays in our dorm room without permissions."
Recent Alumnus,2,it's very expensive and hard to get
College Freshman,2,Our school is not diverse at all.
College Freshman,2,Does not help at all find off campus housing. They want all students to live on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Don't come here if you want to experience ethnic, sexual, or religious diversity."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Off campus housing is close and near. On Campus living is limited, and cost too much."
Recent Alumnus,2,We don't have a Greek life.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I keep running into problems with financial, and my accounts keep having holds to the point I can't view anything, because I have a payment plan set up."
College Junior,2,They donot seem to be there when you need them
College Freshman,2,The parking can be difficult because of lackof spots and it sucks that freshmen cant have cars..
College Sophomore,2,No one is ever out of their dorms.
College Junior,2,"I think that since most of the facilites close early it is hard to really hang out there.  They are open during the day which is great for in between classes and commuters.  But if you are living on campus, don't expect the cafeteria to be open past 7.  You have to work around their schedule..not yours."
College Junior,2,"Most everyone at concordia is white and christian.  There is some diversity however it is rarely seen on campus.  Over the years, there has been some improvement but yet again full of religious white people."
Junior,1,"Since this is a private school class sizes are smaller but that also limits the amount of professors teaching each class. Although every professor I have had as of recently has been very caring and understanding I feel like there should be at least two professors teaching a subject we are paying upward of $40,000 per year so we should be getting an option of a professor vs getting told we only have one option. As of diversity there is hardly a diverse group of students, I previously went to a CSU and they have everyone and everything in between, there are veterans, older in life students, moms and grandmas. There isn’t much racial diversity here and I know It’s hard considering the area but at times I myself who comes from an ethnic household and It is hard for me to fit in or feel comfortable."
Junior,1,"Hands down the worst university to exist. Two legitimate title IX cases took place during the first two months of school and the Dean, Gilbert Fugitt, refused to kick out the horrible male students that took advantage of women on campus. Instead the school shamed the victims, as the men play sports for the school. Many students dropped out after this incident, while the school is trying to hide the situation to protect their “perfect image.” 

On top of that, advising is awful as they try to extend grad plans, meal plans are expensive with limited cafeteria hours, core classes (religious classes) are required and take place of actual degree specific classes, and AC not allowed on dorms. Therapy shames the victims and the school is expensive in general. High school educations, with no protection for victims or women."
Freshman,1,"if you have a different lifestyle  than the majority of athletes and Lutheran people at this school then do not bother coming to this dark place where you will loose all sense of hope due to biast staff members and RA’s. After a semester of going to this “university” I realized that schoolwork is a joke meaning it is beyond easy, staff members are extremely rude and biast against anyone not an athlete or religious, we live in a sensitive society and Concordia is the catalyst for “cultivating” young people to be a part of our sensitive society which is a parasite growing that stops us from seeing the real world. Concordia must change their conservative ways if if they want to really succeed as a university. I have hope for this school as I see potential in it but loose hope when I see how long they have been open and they are still not willing to change their ways for the greater good."
Junior,1,"Concordia University Irvine is one of the most backwards, bureaucratic, obstinate, letter of the law institutions that I have ever had the misfortune of interacting with, and mind you that I once spent an entire Friday being run in circles at the DMV. They will do send you on never ending wild goose chases to fetch proper forms to add/drop classes that end with you being unable to drop the classes due to them being 'core' classes. The real kicker is that if you complain about these core classes in any way you will bruise the sensitive feelings of the white male school administrators , because you know it's their academic career who is being ruined by their backwards, stringent, and esoteric rules and not mine. 
Anywho I'd give it a 0/10 but their lunch lady sure knows how to grill a cheese sandwich like nobodies business."
Senior,1,"I am about to graduate from Concordia Irvine in about 6 months. Let me tell you I pay this school A LOT of money every month for tuition and no one on the staff seems to be in any rush to help me with my registration process. They don't care. No one ever emails me back. The admissions office is so slow. The woman I had always dealt with in advising is no longer there because she had a baby. She was so helpful. Now, I email to ask about my grad plan and and told by the director of advising that she is ""unable"" to email me back until late December... 2 weeks before school starts! 
The bursar is really in no way shape or form willing to help you. He is rude and only wants your money. 
The professors are great. But the staff in the background are terrible! I'm so upset that I pay so much money and the purpose of these people's jobs is to help students succeed."
Recent Alumnus,1,The campus can get very dark and there are very few people out at night especially security. There is no help for victims of sexual abuse and no support
Recent Alumnus,1,There are almost no sororities or fraternities on campus
College Sophomore,1,Only academic Greek life which I belive should not be the case. Fun social Greek life is not allowed
College Sophomore,1,The parking regulations are beyond bad. There's to many faculty parking in student areas !
College Freshman,1,There are no fraternities other than medical ones.
College Freshman,1,Sometimes I feel like I'm at a Boarding School.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus can be a nightmare, especially closer to the dorms. There is definitely not as much parking as there should be when you have as many students who have their cars on campus and those who commute. It takes at least 15 minutes if not more to find parking."
Recent Alumnus,1,There is little to no variety in terms of people's looks and style. People are very into the Christian style of dressing.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The parking is horrible at Concordia. It was extremely hard to find and people race around to try and find a spot, most times almost leading to accidents. As a woman, it is extremely hard to walk from the parking lot at night to the dorm rooms or the classrooms."
College Senior,1,The major problem is the lack of available spaces.  Take advantage of open spaces and be aware if you drive somewhere it may not be available when you get back.
College Sophomore,1,Bus hours are hours and hours apart. You need a car or a friend with a car. In Irvine everything is spaced out and it takes a long time to get place without a car.
College Sophomore,1,"Biased opinions and unfair punishments. When someone gets into trouble on campus they get written up, fined up to $200 and on top of that if it includes alcohol have to go to an AA class if underage and complete community service, write an essay and the remainder of the year on probation.  As a Christian University there are still going to be Christians going out and drinking, it is college and the freedom a lot of kids have witnessed makes them want to run wild.  But just because you mess up once or twice doesn't mean that you need to find a new group of friends or that you have strayed from the path of God.  When going into meetings after getting in trouble, Friends of mine have been told to get new friends, that they are not good people and good Christians.  When is reality, that is not true at all.  The faculty say that want us to be able to come and talk to them, they are our safe havens when all we, the students, feel like is that if we go and talk to them they judge us and make us feel guilty.  

We already pay $35,000.00 to attend this school and with athletic scholarships being cut down many of the students aren't receiving as much money so when a student is guilty of a write-up they have to pay even more.  What does the school get out of this? Money.  What do we get out of it? $250.00 out of our pockets and a small lesson learned.  If the school wants to punish kids for their ""bad"" behavior, don't do it through money. Do it through community service or an essay.  Mandy college students don't have that kind of money laying around to pay off ridiculous charges."
College Freshman,1,Extremely limited parking. The only spots open are teacher only spots. You could end up driving around for a good 15min trying to find a spot.
College Freshman,1,"Most of the scholarship money is given to athletes. Also they during the time period when we needed to send forms in, they were very unorganized and sent us last years forms."

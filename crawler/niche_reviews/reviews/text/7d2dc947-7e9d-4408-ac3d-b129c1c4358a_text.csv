Freshman,5,"Everyone at Pomona College is nice and welcoming. Even though we are currently virtual, the administrators and student leaders make sure that we are well informed of all the resources available for our academic, social, and mental success."
Freshman,5,"Pomona classes are small in the first place. Therefore, virtual zoom classes are  intimate, which allows for easy access to professors and mentors. Sometimes, I am the only student present for office hours so it turns into a one on one call with my professor!"
Sophomore,5,Pomona is the most amazing community of students and professors I could ask for. The kindness and support showed by everyone there is amazing. You can take classes in anything and everything and learn how to learn.
Sophomore,5,"I took my remainder of the spring semester online due to corona. Comp Sci went pretty well, but my politics seminar classes were a bit challenging. It is hard to have a group discussion on zoom."
Sophomore,5,"Pomona College is a great school with so many interesting people from all over the world!  It's a very diverse group of students, and because there are 4 other colleges there, we have access to a wide range of classes, locations and experiences across the ""5C's.""  I play softball for Pomona Pitzer, and the team spirit keeps me sane, while the support from other student-athletes from football and baseball, etc. is really cool.  It's a small school, but big on ideas and things to do in and around LA area.  Claremont is a cool little village we walk to from campus and its only a short drive to beach or mountains."
Freshman,5,It is a good place and number one college in LA. It is also because they teach many things so you could learn.For example my friend says that she learned a lot about physical science ðŸ§ª and learned more math and got a 100./.
Freshman,5,"Pomona students are so accomplished, but they are always so willing to help. The professors also really go out of their way to ensure that students feel supported. Graduate schools really know Pomona and the seniors are doing so many great things. The best part is that these seniors keep first years in the loop and are willing to share so much about their work. The atmosphere is intense in terms of academics, but the competition is against yourself!"
Alum,5,The best! Loved my time at the Claremont Collegesâ€” Top notch academics and resources at 5 contiguous stunning campuses all in an awesome college town....need I say more?
Sophomore,5,"Pomona is really a unique place. Everyone says that the people are the best thing about Pomona, and it is true. The people I have met are some of the most unique, passionate, and sincere human beings I have ever met. The students are not only intelligent, but also collaborative and willing to help their peers. So many resources available to the students, great professors, amazing food, and an endless number of deep, intellectual conversations wherever you go. The social life is something different, something to get used to, but it isn't exclusive and everyone goes to everything and thats what I really like about it. You can find people to have fun with no matter what it is you want to do."
Alum,5,"I had a great time at Pomona. The class sizes were small so I was able to build close relationships with my professors. Professors were generally available and happy to talk to students during office hours about the lectures as well as life in general. I also loved being surrounded by brilliant peers who inspired and pushed me during my time at Pomona. Since the school is so small, I interacted with people from all backgrounds and majors, so I was able to learn a lot from those around me. The student body is pretty active and continually demands the administration to be better at addressing students' needs and issues of equality. I recognize that the school is not perfect, but change is always happening and I am hopeful about where it's heading."
Alum,5,"I can't express how much I loved Pomona - it gave me the biggest and most supportive communities I could've asked for four years, and the best friends for the rest of my life. Campus culture is very collaborative, but the workload is definitely one of the most intense in the country."
Freshman,5,"Incredible opportunities even for freshmen including summer researches, close relationships with professors, fun kids, the weather, great career center.... Just about everything"
Freshman,5,"Pomona College was not my dream school, but it has become that for me. It's a top ranked liberal arts college that exemplifies the best of the best in college education. I feel well rounded, supported and excited to learn every day. It's amazing to be surrounded by people who are as passionate as me. Every one is incredibly talented and our professors genuinely care about helping us, especially since it is an undergraduate only college. It's a diverse and welcoming place that I strongly encourage all students to look into. It also provides amazing financial aid. There are problems with the administration just like at every college but the students here are determined to fix those problems and build a better institution."
Freshman,5,"I may only be a first-year student here at Pomona College, but so far my experience has been nothing but exceptional. Pomona College provides its students with unparalleled academic resources, an extremely supportive student body, and limitless research and service opportunities. The academics at Pomona will significantly challenge you, but so far all of my professors have been very available to answer questions and Pomona College invests significant resources into their free mentoring for students."
Sophomore,5,Pomona College has so many resources and activities constantly available to students. I love that I can be so involved on campus with the students.
Niche User,5,"The people there are always willing to help you find your way and say hello with smiles.  The campus has easy shortcuts and has a beautiful ""quad"" like area where you can relax in the sun!"
Sophomore,5,"Overall, it's a fantastic college. It's almost like a bubble of an ideal community. The professors are the best thing about Pomona. They are super nice and willing to help. The academic is not easy but also not competitive - which could be either a positive or a negative thing. There are a lot of opportunities and it would feel like everyone is doing, and excelling, at so many things. In that aspect, it is pressuring."
Sophomore,5,"I think that while Pomona is amazing academically (seriously, love the Professors), it's the people that really make Pomona into such an enriching place."
Junior,5,"The friends that I have made at Pomona are the most incredible people that I have ever met in my life. Easy to find professors who, on top of being top class instructors, are invested in your personal development. Only downsides are that sometimes the administration feels disconnected from student body (bloated, bureaucratic, not always sensitive to current campus pulse), and that the diversity of students who are all ridiculously intelligent/confident/articulate creates social/intellectual tensions (these have flared up in recent years @ protests, @ student demands, @ exclusionary events). 

*NOT* a party school, but easy enough to get your fix of hedonism at the other schools in the consortium. The Claremont Consortium is also great because each school has such a different ethos, meaning that if you feel suffocated at Pomona (which will happen), a 3 minute walk takes you to another college and freshens things up. 

Incredibly grateful to be here."
Freshman,5,Pomona and the Claremont consortium provided the resources of a big university in a small college environment.
Freshman,5,"Pomona College is so inclusive and the learning environment itself is incomparable. Small class sizes make all the difference. As a student, it's so easy to get to know professor and this opens doors that are quite honestly impossible at bigger universities."
Sophomore,5,"Pomona has a really nurturing atmosphere, the students and professors are really kind, caring, and look out for each other. Administration can be a little scattered sometimes, but it's such a small community that you won't get lost in the mix."
Sophomore,5,"I'm only a sophomore, but I've gotten involved with research for all four semesters, received internship funding, had expenses for two conferences paid for, was actively involved in an award winning Mock Trial without any experience, and learned how to play the violin through free private music lessons. I've also been able to go to Los Angeles often for endless entertainment, natural beauty, and incredible eats. This place may be tiny, but it is bustling with opportunity. The academic experience is robust, with professors who love to teach and peers who love to learn. The Claremont Colleges add so much depth, and each is distinctive enough to venture out to and seek out new perspective. I had my choice of attending a world-renowned university over here, but I could see the difference in how the undergraduates were valued. The only thing I wish were different was the lack of name brand- Pomona is so unknown by most! Still, if you are willing to work hard, you can go anywhere from here."
Freshman,5,"I love the academic rigor offered there as well as the diverse make up of the college. Not only that, there seem to be an abundance of resources there that can help anyone succeed with a pleasant college experience."
Sophomore,5,"I love Pomona College! The student body is amazing, classes are small and well-taught, professors are dedicated to students, there is so much to do on-campus, we have the resources of all 5Cs"
Freshman,5,"I cannot imagine myself anywhere else. The people are so unique and talented, but so laid back and kind. It's truly a place you want to be and spend 4 years."
Niche User,5,"I visited the 5 Claremont colleges on September 21, 2017. Overall, I really enjoyed looking and exploring all of these schools however, I felt that Pomona was the best fit for me. I love the overall atmosphere at Pomona and the way everything is there is just really wonderful."
Junior,5,"Great time here so far. My first year here had a very steep academic learning curve, but I think that as time went by, I was able to better adjust and succeed."
Alum,5,"Pomona is amazing.  The student body is  diverse, talented, intellectually engaged  &  brilliant. 

 The professors are even better.  After Pomona  I studied at Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley  earning a PhD  and two  Masters degrees along the way.  Still, my classes at Pomona blew all the other ones through the roof. 

 Beautiful campus, great weather, fun and philosophizing -- at the library, the dorms or the keg party. 

 And I haven't even gotten to Ski-Beach Day yet!"
Alum,5,"Pomona has a close-knit community of fun and interesting students. Classes are small (typically around 20 students) and professors are hired and reviewed on teaching ability above research, meaning that professors actually care about teaching you."
Junior,5,"Pomona's largest assets are not its $2b endowment, its buildings, or its location, but rather its people. Here, some of the world's most inquisitive, interesting, and downright intelligent students come together in the pursuit of knowledge and with the intention of changing the world. Professors care deeply about students and are some of the most well-regarded in their fields, a rare combination that allows for students to do meaningful work and learn from people who love to teach, never a teacher's assistant. The admitted class of 2021 is made up of 56.7% domestic students of color, plus 11.4% international students, making Pomona's the most diverse campus in the country."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Pomona.  Friendly, beautiful campus.  It's small but there are 4 other campuses nearby so you never get bored. Adorable college town. You will love it.  Ps not for hard partiers or those who envision big football games ala ole miss."
Junior,5,"Pomona has been an incredible experience. The people here are the best part, in my experience. The students are so diverse and interesting that you'll always be learning from them throughout your time. There's this ""cool nerd"" vibe where you can tell people are very intelligent and invested in their academics, but they hide that on the surface. The intellectual community fostered by the professors and the various events that happen is dynamic and engaging. I've not encountered any faculty member who wasn't extremely invested in their students or incredibly knowledgeable in their field. LA is accessible for a ton of opportunities, and the school offers trips, paid funding for internships, and more to take advantage of it fully. I feel so fortunate to attend a place like this."
Alum,5,"I loved being a part of an academic environment where intellectual challenges by professors and other students are commonplace. As an alumnus that has taken on several start-up ventures, everyday lessons from Pomona have served me well: keep an enquiring mind and have the confidence to challenge (and also accept) other people's opinions."
Alum,5,"No place is perfect, of course, but Pomona may come as close to it as any college experience could realistically could. Unlike many top universities, which struggle with providing superb professor accessibility and individual attention, and unlike many top liberal arts colleges, which may be limited with the depth of their resources and opportunities, Pomona finds a way to seamlessly blend the benefits of both systems. The academic experience is distinguished and deeply personal: brilliant and collaborative professors and peers contribute to a robust intellectual climate which values exploration, growth, and meaningful encounter. The average student is fiercely intelligent but also humble, interesting, charitable, and compassionate: a rare dynamism of traits which illustrates the special nature of this place. I am deeply thankful that this place has enabled me to become a more articulate, understanding, and connected individual."
Junior,5,"Pomona is such an amazing place and I'm so grateful to be able to spend four years here! Consider yourself lucky if you get in, and don't pass up the opportunity to go here (even if you get into Harvardâ€”honestly, save it for graduate school and go here for undergrad, and you'll have a better experience for it)."
College Junior,5,"The alumni network is smaller than the network from a larger school, but it's also much tighter and includes some pretty big names. A Pomona degree will get you places."
College Junior,5,"The classes tend to be very small, which is an incredible plusâ€”it makes the learning so much more engaging than a giant lecture. The professors range in quality as they would at any school, but on the whole they are extremely smart, passionate, and competent."
College Junior,5,Pomona is two thirds singles. That's basically unheard of anywhere else and is super nice. The quality of the dorms ranges from fine to outstanding.
College Junior,5,Don't be deceived by the lack of name recognitionâ€”Pomona has a strong claim to offering the best undergraduate education of anywhere in the world.
College Junior,5,The dorms are huge! As a freshman you have the option to have your own room! The school does a great job in making sure there is enough beds on campus for every student who wants it. The dorms are beautiful and spacious and most of the time you live by your friends!
College Freshman,5,"If you like a small liberal arts college, it is the best one on the West Coast! Just check the ratings! Forbes and US News and World Report."
College Freshman,5,"It is not well known by its name, but those who need to know- know all about Ponoma College. Grad schools and employers love Pomona grads."
College Freshman,5,"Very safe campus. You still have to lock your bike or shut your door or things can go missing, mostly I think from non students who wonder on campus. People refer to it as the Claremont bubble."
College Freshman,5,"Big rooms. Sponsor groups for all freshman, so you have an instant family of 18 students, 2 who are sophomores and can help with the transition and answer questions about everything. Many become friends for life. The dorms are great, some have air conditioning, those that do not can get hot, bring a fan."
College Freshman,5,"The students are highly intelligent, curious, friendly, and passionate. Besides doing well in their classes, the students are involved in many activities including community service. They are making a difference wherever they go. I visited my older brother four times a year and fell in love with this school. I applied ED1. I like that I can also take classes at the other 4 Claremont colleges. Classes are small and engaging and the professors are available and interested in all of their students. The weather is great too."
College Sophomore,5,"Incredible academics with small class sizes with some of the friendliest and most approachable professors I've ever encountered. Students here are motivated, incredibly intelligent, creative, and most come from fascinating backgrounds."
Recent Alumnus,5,i have loved every professor I have had.
Recent Alumnus,5,I have gotten awesome internships and a post-grad job through campus resources.
Recent Alumnus,5,Awesome food choices every day.
Recent Alumnus,5,The friendly and smart students make my school unique.
College Freshman,5,Th school takes huge measures to keep us safe.
College Freshman,5,"Academics are tough, but a good challenge. The good part about the small school is that professors have time to help you! It's really nice being able to sit down and talk with your teachers one on one when things get tough."
College Freshman,5,"I don't have much experience with finding jobs, but I know that the Career Development Office has been helpful thus far."
College Freshman,5,"I love it at Pomona. I've only been here a semester, but everyone is very talented and has something special about them. Despite all the talent, very few people are conceited or obnoxious and everyone is really cool."
College Freshman,5,"Pomona College really makes an effort to make sure that all students feel safe on campus. For example, all new students are required to go through several rounds of sexual assault and drug/alcohol safety training before and while on campus."
College Freshman,5,"I really lucked out this year and got what I think is one of the best dorms on campus. The only problem is that some dorms don't have AC. Other than that, the dorms are great!"
College Freshman,5,"Pomona College is everything I ever hoped it would be! Really! It's a fantastic liberal arts school with fantastic people. The professors are incredibly knowledgeable and the classes are fantastic, but any elite school might have that. Here's what Pomona has that other schools don't:

1) The people aren't like the people who go to other elite schools. Pomona students are incredibly talented, but humble about their achievements and not incredibly competitive. They work really hard, but they also know how to relax and simply enjoy themselves.

2) Beautiful southern California lends itself to a good feeling on campus. There is a big difference between waking up most days and seeing a cold, rainy/snowy day versus a warm and sunny day with palm trees everywhere. The beautiful campus and awesome weather can't help but put a smile on your face."
College Junior,5,"Pomona College is extremely special. It's honestly the people here that make the school, but the good weather doesn't hurt. :) A large majority of the students here are open-minded, extremely intelligent, fun, laid-back, and passionate. There are tons of opportunities to get active on campus and it's really hard to be bored here. One of my favorite parts about Pomona is that there's pretty much a community for everyone here.. and if there isn't, you can start one. When I say ""community"" I mean the various mentor groups on campus, sports groups, music groups, art groups... and its really easy to be fluid in them, too. The food is pretty good too. And the dorms are huge. I'm going into my junior year and I have yet to have a roommate. :)"
College Sophomore,5,I've loved my time at Pomona so far. I've met some of the best people in the world. I couldn't be happier with the college I go to. I can't wait to get back.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Sports is not the primary reason students attend Pomona.  Yet, Pomona has great school spirit and the sports facilities are in top shape."
College Freshman,4,I have heard amazing things about our CDO.
College Freshman,4,"Though the school isn't as relaxed about freshman consuming alcohol on South Campus, Pomona is overall pretty good about substances, especially alcohol. The college provides alcohol for some on campus events (don't worry it's not paid for using tuition) so that they make sure students are safe."
College Freshman,4,Part scene at Pomona is really low key which I personally like. You can always find parties on the weekends and usually during the week. The school sponsors a bunch of things and a lot is going on on campus (which is what they're trying to do). There isn't a frat scene to run the party scene also which is nice.
College Freshman,4,"Pomona has the ability to get people from all over the place, and the result is a class that is incredibly diverse. The one thing is that the school is pretty uniformly liberal... There is a little bit of political diversity, but not much..."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are participated in for fun more than anything else. We are a D3 school and while we have some very talented athletes, we aren't an athletic school. However, I personally think that the athletics seen being based around fun is better than having a sports central school. The school isn't run by the athletics department basically."
College Sophomore,4,"I've met the most caring, smart and weird individuals at Pomona and I wouldn't change that for anything. Everyone finds their group of people and it works out perfectly."
College Sophomore,4,"People all dress their own way and nobody really cares what you wear. Some people go to class barefoot or in their pajamas, some people dress up pretty nicely for day-to-day affairs. Some people have very unique styles and we're incredible diverse in terms of dress. Looks-wise, objectively speaking, we're okay.

But as for personality: everybody at Pomona is either incredibly, incredibly smart, or incredibly, incredibly interesting - and I'd even say most people are both, and everybody seems to have their own unique story. People are generally very friendly and pretty outgoing. There is a hint of quirkiness and awkwardness about us, but to be honest we're probably surprisingly ""normal"" compared to many other top liberal arts colleges. The majority of people I've met are very laidback and non-judgemental. Many people are driven yet there's no hyper-competitiveness you find at other top schools, it's all collaborative. Very, very liberal student attitude. Incredibly diverse range of personalities and interests. Only downside is that there's a lot of wealthy, sheltered kids here."
College Sophomore,4,"Party scene is quite diverse and inconsistent - with weekends ranging from incredible to pretty sh***y. The good news is that there's an enormous variety of different types of people on campus - ranging from raging frat wannabes, to radical counter-culture kids, to chill individuals who just wanna kickback with a couple beers with friends. Parties usually consist of pre-gaming in rooms with friends or small dorm parties, and then migrating out to a big consortium-wide dance party on any of the five campuses, which often but not always has a theme. These dance parties are hosted by the administration, which has their ups and downs. This means parties are very safe, kept exclusively for college kids, free beer, and gets rid of any social hierarchy required for party entry.  Downsides are a lack of spontaneity in party culture and also inconsistency: even though security is pretty damn lenient, if things get too chaotic or rowdy things get shut down quick. Some weekends, mostly first semester, are incredible - with huge, generously-attended parties (several hundreds of people sometimes) three or four nights in a row. Other weekends are complete busts, with nothing but some kickbacks with no more than a few dozen people Thursday and Friday with a lower-key party on Saturday. But even though the party scene isn't as good as some other schools, the fact that I'm surrounded with so many incredibly interesting and fun people makes the lower-key party scene worthwhile."
College Sophomore,4,"The Village is about three minutes walking distance from freshmen housing and filled with lots of cute places to eat with a variety of different foods. Food is always incredible there. Only problem is that it's more on the expensive side, and also there's no late-night places to eat within walking distance."
College Junior,4,"A Pomona degree is highly sought out and will open any door you want for graduate schools, fellowships, and professional schools. It is a coveted name brand in elite circles and will only continue to become more prestigious. Pomona alumni are in all sorts of elite fields, and the average salary of the graduates just keeps rising. The only reason it's not perfect is because Pomona is quite unknown to the general public. But it really won't matter- the quality of an education you get from here will serve you well in any context."
College Junior,4,"Pomona's FA office can be awful at times, but they're a lot better than the horror stories of other FA officers I've heard at our peer schools. My advice is to not be afraid of appealing your financial aid package. They start off a bit stingy and wait for students to appeal to get more financial aid; once you do, you'll find Pomona to be among your cheapest options. It's a fight to get above the minimum, but it'll be worth it."
College Junior,4,"I'm away from campus and can now really appreciate how good the dining halls are at the Claremont Colleges. It's not the best food I've ever had, but the food options are fresh, well-made, and bountiful in variety. Having access to 6 dining halls (no, Oldenborg doesn't count) is a great asset. But the other colleges, especially Mudd and Scripps, have better food on the whole than do those at Pomona, hence the 4 rating instead of a 5."
College Freshman,4,"The Village is within walking distance and has a ton of restaurants, and a lot more are within a short drive (might even still be considered walking distance)"
College Freshman,4,"You make of it what you want, there are students who like the small scene and others who like the idea of big frat parties, and you can find both easily if that's what you want"
College Freshman,4,"Dorms are spacious, but a few first-year dorms don't have AC"
College Junior,4,"The Molecular Biology major is an interdisciplinary biology and chemistry program offered at Pomona. The facilities for the department and the professors are exceptional, and the major is unique in that it requires an experimental research thesis from all of the majors. In addition, there's an opportunity to study abroad at the University College of London and conduct research there, which I'm fairly sure is unique among any other institution that sends graduates to UCL. MoBio students have done exceedingly well in receiving distinctions such as Goldwaters and Churchill scholarships. The only problem is that the department is rather large, constituting around 8% of the student body, so classes may not be as small as they would be at another school."
College Junior,4,"Internships are easy to find through Pomona's PCIP and SIP programs; over 200 students benefit from these programs each year. The Los Angeles Metropolitan is home to 18 million people and opportunities in just about every discipline and business, so identifying an internship site is pretty easy. Your own initiative really matters, however- don't expect Pomona to find these opportunities for you. The only problem is that traffic can be a nightmare to deal with and can take up more time than one would like."
College Freshman,4,"Academic honesty, especially in the Computer Science department, is taken VERY seriously."
College Freshman,4,"Many people at Pomona would find it offensive that this prompt is heteronormative and refers only to appearances as opposed to personality. That said, there are plenty of physically attractive people on campus. Regarding relationships, there is a dominant hook-up scene, but some long-term couples do exist."
College Freshman,4,"Pomona is close enough to L.A. to take advantage of many of its resources: trips to museums, sports games, and landmarks occur on a regular basis. However, it's not so close that these resources detract from the internal social scene.

Within Claremont, there are plenty of small shops within the Village, but nothing too major. Walmart and other superstores are out of walking distance, but easily accessible with a bike, car, and sometimes public transit.

There are lots of wonderful hiking opportunities: 10,000 ft. Mt. Baldy is only a few miles away, and Joshua Tree National Park is around two hours away by car. Sequoia, Yosemite, and others being more like a five hour drive; students frequently go there over breaks."
College Freshman,4,"The are lots of off-campus dining options in the Claremont Village, which is adjacent to campus. Many restaurants don't cater strongly to college students: with so many good on-campus dining options, there's not a huge market. However, some (such as the frozen yogurt stores) are very popular."
College Junior,4,"Pomona is very diverse as a whole, but we definitely struggle with political diversity."
College Junior,4,"Pomona's administration cares about its students and wants to do all that it can to make this a supportive and nurturing environment, but some policies can be misguided and rather strict, punishing the entire student body for the actions of a few."
College Junior,4,"This is a tough one because Pomona is in a very suburban town- one that really doesn't offer much in the way of nightlife and cultural attractions, but it's also no more than an hour's drive of the entire SoCal basin. It's very easy to take advantage of museums. concerts, shopping areas, and more- it's just the immediate area doesn't offer much for students besides a safe, East coast town vibe and a good assortment of food options."
College Junior,4,"The Claremont Village has a lot of great restaurants. Unfortunately, few are open late night, and they aren't very cheap."
Recent Alumnus,4,The school has a very large endowment and makes very generous offers because they can afford it.
Recent Alumnus,4,They really try to give you opportunities
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's great, if you have a car. Your options become limited if you are trying to go far without one."
Recent Alumnus,4,The administration is very very lenient
Recent Alumnus,4,"There was so much flexibility in how I could shape my educational experience; however, the high level of rigor and academic difficulty was always expected"
Recent Alumnus,4,"To be honest, I found Pomona College to be very progressive in its views about diversity in hindsight. The administration was extremely supportive and encouraged students to bring up concerns, hold educational awareness events, and engage in social justice oriented activities. That being said, there would be both protect that the administration was not progressive enough while simultaneously, there would be the occasional backlash against the perceived excessive political correctness of the administration. But that is the beauty of Pomona College -- students were fully engaged in the well-being of their campus and the college more than allowed them to speak up and advocate for their views. They want their students to feel empowered. This is not the typical trait of a college administration. Once you enter the ""real world"", the relative intolerance, level of ignorance, and dismissal of opinions of youth is shocking even to the most conservative Pomona College student. There is always room for improvement for all forms of diversity, but Pomona College definitely did a fabulous job upholding very high standards."
College Freshman,4,"Claremont is cute, but pretty expensive. Mostly older people and people starting families. Most stuff off campus is closes early and is pretty expensive on a college budget."
College Freshman,4,"If you want a single you can get single freshman year. Some of the freshman dorms are a little small, but they have air conditioning which is great. The larger freshman dorms are tad bit nice but don't have air conditioning which means the first month of school is pretty miserable when your dorm room is 90 degrees or whatever."
College Freshman,4,"I didn't apply for financial aid, but from everybody I have talked to they had pretty good experiences. Pomona is technically need blind so how much money you need is not taken into account. Also getting jobs on campus is fairly easy, and not just limited to those who receive financial aid, which is really nice. Having open work study is nice because even if you do not qualify for financial aid it is likely that tuition isn't simply a drop in the bucket. "
College Freshman,4,Almost every single party is on one of the 5c campuses or within 2 miles of campus. All the parties pretty much revolve around campus so there is almost no need to go off campus to clubs and bars. The on campus parties will keep you plenty entertained for a while.
College Freshman,4,"Sports aren't huge, but they get support"
College Freshman,4,I've heard counseling is hard to get sometimes
College Sophomore,4,"Multiple options, such as the metro and zip cars"
College Sophomore,4,"Haha, why are the girls a B+ and the guys an A+? I'm sure a lot of Pomona students would accuse this of being heteronormative ;)

It's pretty hard to generalize the student body at Pomona. You'll find people representing all sorts of personalities here."
College Junior,2,"Don't come here for the athletics. The facilities are adequate, but it's just not the focus of campus life."
College Freshman,2,Only 1 co-ed fraternity on campus and its not a focus.
College Freshman,2,Athletic programs are treated like a joke.
College Freshman,2,"They are lenient when it comes to parties, but in my experience going to them with a legitimate issue, they are very condescending."
College Freshman,2,"Almost everyone lives on campus, since the on-campus housing is better and cheaper than anything off campus. It also makes it a lot easier to get involved with campus events."
College Junior,2,"Pomona was meant to be an on-campus residential community. Only 2% of the school lives off-campus, and in designated areas for Claremont College students, such as the College Park apartments in Upland. Off-campus housing is expensive and beyond these designated areas- not readily accessible. Because so much happens on campus, it's really not worth the hassle to travel back and forth."
Recent Alumnus,2,It's just a group of people looking for an excuse to drink.
Recent Alumnus,2,It's too much of a bubble on campus. There are very little options
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a fraternity, no sorority at Pomona College"
College Junior,2,"Guys & Girls â€“ Wow, is this really important to you? College is for studying--not for relationships. I guess our looks are average, but we're all very smart and will have great jobs right after we graduate because of the school we attend."
College Junior,2,"I really have no experience, even second-hand, but I'm sure our policies are fair and justly enforced. Especially since we're one of like, a very small number of schools in the nation that has a ruling committee that contains mostly students. On the other hand, the smoking and drinking policy is way too lax for my taste. Supposedly, no smoking is allowed on campus, but after parties such as Pub or Table Manners, no one even tries to enforce it, and my asthmatic lungs are very disappointed at the administration's lack of enforcement."
College Senior,2,Basically Non-Existent â€“ There is two frats and one fraternity. Mostly just football guys and girls who like to be naked.
College Sophomore,2,"Recent Crackdown â€“ There are stark differences between the written policy and how it is enforced by RAs. In the past, RAs have been much more lenient or reasonable when it comes to policy violations. However, recently there have been more incidents of people getting caught and written up/fined. Usually discretion is all that is required but the RAs have been getting more strict. The punishments are relatively innocuous ranging from a formal warning to actual fines. However, multiple offenders do risk getting kicked out of on campus housing."
College Junior,2,"Don't Expect Much â€“ Don't expect to come to this school expecting to have a typical, blackout-filled college experience.  While there are some groups of students who wish they went to a more fratty college, and act like it, this school has a pretty subdued nightlife.  The upside is that there are a lot  of non-party events, so its a guarantee that you will find your niche.  Parties are out there, but it is not a frat row scene."
College Sophomore,2,"I think Pomona has two frats (and they may be shared with the other Claremont schools), and I didn't even realize they were there until second half of second semester. Evidently, they throw parties from time to time, I just didn't realize they were the hosts. I don't think there are any sororities."
College Junior,1,"We are a Division III school, so our sports aren't very good. Our most talented competitive organization is the Claremont Colleges Ballroom Dance Company, and our most talented sport is men's water polo. Pomona is a college of brainiacs rather than jocks, though, and I don't think many people actually care about our sports teams."

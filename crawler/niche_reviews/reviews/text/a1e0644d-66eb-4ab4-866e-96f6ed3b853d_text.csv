Freshman,5,I've only been here for a week and I love it! The professors are great and every student I meet is so nice.
Senior,5,COVID based online learning has been very good. Professors have been understanding of technological difficulties.
Senior,5,"As a biomedical engineering major and premed at WashU, I will say the school is not easy. However, I would fail to come up with an institution that rivals WashU's commitment to holistic and collaborative education. Research opportunities are absolutely incredible to say the least, and you are quite literally, living in a massive mile-wide castle."
Senior,5,It is a great school with the most amazing campus. Courses are rigorous but extremely interesting. It is a great school.
Sophomore,5,"WashU is home to me. I've met the most supportive and amazing people in my life here. I highly recommend for incoming freshman to bond with people on their floor early on - it can be a great community if you try to make it one. The people are down to earth, friendly, and you'll learn a lot simply from the people around you. And though the academics are demanding, the culture is truly collaborative and welcoming. However, it is quite pre-professional focused which I both appreciate and want to change. Try to hang out with a myriad of different people to grow as a person on all fronts."
Sophomore,5,WashU is an excellent school and immediately felt like home to me. The academics can definitely be challenging but are manageable. The campus is stunning and there are many different things to get involved in during the semester.
Alum,5,"As a recent graduate of WashU, I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience! From meeting some of the best people to interacting with some of the most intelligent professors, I learned something new each day. I am proud to be an alum of such an incredible university and have WashU to thank for helping me land my dream job."
Junior,5,"My WashU experience has been incredible! The campus became home within minutes of arriving. Academics are #1 always, which can be tough, but there are plenty of extracurricular activities and sports to diversify your lifestyle."
Alum,5,I had a great experience at Washington University in St. Louis. There was a ton of student activities and clubs as well as Greek life to be involved in. Sports wasn't a huge focus of the school and it was a very academic focused school. There was no sense of competition between students and everyone was very supportive.
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful and the community is also great. Their academic performance is also great as it is one of the top schools in America. The environment is wonderful It's right by Forest park which is one of the best places to bike, run or walk, and it's close to the loop where there is a large variety of restaurants to choose from."
Senior,5,I liked the classes as well as the professors. The advising needs to be better from my experience they did not really help me.
Niche User,5,"Wonderful school that supports all students.
Great dorms, good food and lots of smart students!!!
There is a wide variety in the courses you can take..Study abroad
programs are amazing.  Teachers take a personal interest in all students
and there is extra help...if you need it. This school has a close community and the campus is diverse.  Highly recommend it."
Sophomore,5,"A WashU education may seem impossible to attain, but the people here are willing and happy to work with you to make it possible for you. I have found such great community through student groups, faith organizations, and academic departments. There is so much support if you are willing to become invested."
Graduate Student,5,"My experience with Washington University has been nothing less than impressive.  The faculty and support staff have been supportive, professional, positive, and extremely encouraging in every aspect.  Classwork is rigorous and demanding, but the returns are great.  The student body forms a diverse campus community and lends itself to an ongoing open dialog.  I am so proud to be affiliated with this institution and I am uncertain how I could enhance or make any recommendations to enhance the existing programs."
Niche User,5,Wash U is a great school. I got accepted into the class of '24 and I'm extremely excited about it. I went to visit the campus in February '19. The campus is absolutely amazing. When I went on a tour of the school my tour guide did a great job of reeling me in. I loved everything about the school. One thing that really stood out to me was the tutoring program they had available for all students. I think this a great thing to have.
Freshman,5,Washu is a superb institution. The facilities and campus are beautiful and top of the line. The dorm rooms are spacious and designed well. Freshmen have the choice of a modern or traditional dorm (one with or without a personal bathroom) which is a very nice option. The food is also amazing as we are ranked at the top of many best college food lists. I especially love the tator tots!
Freshman,5,"Excellent university. Beautiful campus and accessible professors - most the professors and administrators are supportive. The students are great, they come from all over the world, they are academically very strong, but the class environment is collaborative and not cut throat. You do not need to work hard though - you will be pushed by some of the classes. Grading is not easy, some classes do curve the grades. However, there are many support services and as mentioned the class environment is generally collaborative and students are very open.  Finally the dorm life for frosh and sophomore on campus is excellent. For upperclassmen there is plenty of university owned housing available right next to campus. The university is very safe it is in a great part of St Louis. You can/should go into the city - it is very interesting and there are ways to get involved if you are so inclined."
Junior,5,"Washington University is full of wonderful, smart, and fun people -- professors and students, alike. The campus is incredible and resources are unparalleled."
Freshman,5,"Washington University in St.Louis is an excellent environment that is conducive for active learning. The faculty here are supportive of their students regardless of their background and help those who are minority, low-income, and first-generation. There are a lot of opportunities to grow academically and personally."
Freshman,5,WashU is amazing! They have stellar academics in addition to committed and friendly students who truly care about the fields that they're going into. I can't wait to see this school continue to earn its reputation.
Sophomore,5,"It's a great school. The atmosphere's always positive, students and faculty alike are always super willing to help and support, and the professors are all sociable, capable in their fields, and clear in lecture and on paper. Clubs here, as abundant and as diverse as they are, find ways to, when possible, work together to at times set up and hold mutiple cross-cultural and cross-disciplined events on campus. Research opportunities, as well as employment for undergraduates both on and off campus, are offered generously and, almost always, will be provided and made available to those who seek to get involved. The food here is great as well; menus both on and off campus are diverse and palatable enough to keep the appetite up and busy year round."
Niche User,5,"As soon as I walked on campus, I fell in love! WashU has the best layout of a college campus: everything is close to each other and there are no streets interrupting. WashU is also #2 in dorms, and #1 in food.  WashU is perfect: the only thing I would change about it is the cost. Tuition, rooming, and food make it cost around $70,000 a year."
Senior,5,It is a great learning environment that has interesting students committed to academic collaboration and makes it possible to pursue multiple academic interests at once.
Freshman,5,"People at WashU are some of the most caring individuals you’ll ever meet. For the most part, if you ask a student about their opinion of/experience at the school, they can tell you that the amazing, down-to-earth people and welcoming, collaborative environment make it so worthwhile. Students love the school And are always looking out for one another."
Graduate Student,5,"I'm currently enrolled in the Masters of Legal Studies Program. I'm thoroughly enjoying this program. WashU offers a number of classes in various legal fields. I've taken courses in tort law, contracts, intellectual property law, legal negotiations, legal writing & legal procedures & court hearings. The Masters program is 100% online. The virtual experience is phenomenal. It's like being in an actual class, but at home. This program is very diverse. Through this program, I've connected with different students from Asia, Europe, Africa and the various parts of the United States. The professors are knowledgeable and professionally accomplished in the legal field. The program is fast paced, intriguing  and fun. You can complete this program in one to two years.  I started in January 2019 and I'm graduating in May 2020. CHOOSE WASHU! The investment is well worth it and WashU is one of the best law schools in the world."
Freshman,5,"The people here are so incredibly friendly and there are so many academic and personal resources. Amazing facilities as well. Overall just a very happy, peaceful place to be."
Freshman,5,An excellent school with a great student body and highly educated faculty. They treat you like family here.
Freshman,5,The University is very welcoming to incoming freshman and help to make the transition to college life less stressful.  The campus is beautiful and there are endless opportunities to get involved with many organizations and the community.
Junior,5,"WashU is the best school I could have possibly gone to. The way the professors and administration care about the students, the campus life, and every aspect of the school is unlike anything I ever could have imagined in the world of higher education. While college can sometimes feel like a competitive mess, WashU feels exactly like home to me, and I wouldn't want it any other way."
Niche User,5,"WashU is great place for anyone. WashU has the particular aspects of feeling like a college, but it also has the large connections and facilities similar to large state university. There's nothing I would change about WashU after visiting in the summer of 2019."
Sophomore,5,Just an elite academic setting in every respect. World-class students; most have perfect or near perfect SAT/ACT; maybe grades are a bit lower than Harvard.
Freshman,5,"WashU is an amazing school full of kind people and staff that truly want you to succeed. There are so many resources to help students in any area, and campus has a friendly atmosphere rather than a competitive one. Campus is so beautiful and dorms are some of the best in the country. South 40 really does feel like a small town!"
Junior,5,Great place to go to school. The campus is full of serious students who aren’t afraid of having fun.
Niche User,5,Their tours are great and coaches are VERY nice and devoted. There is an excess of school spirit that you can feel as you walk through campus. Their academics are rigorous but prepare you very well.
Senior,5,"I wouldn't trade my past four years here for the world. For starters, WashU students are phenomenal. It's a competitive atmosphere, but not at all in a ""cut-throat"" way. For the most part, everyone is pretty well-rounded and it's not hard to find a balance between studying and having a social life. The campus is stunning (especially in the spring), the food is pretty decent, and there is plenty to do around St. Louis. My chief complaint would be the price tag, but in this case I think you're getting what you pay for."
Freshman,5,"My Freshman year at washU was awesome! Definitely try to be in the business school if you can lol. Greek life was the best decision, WashU greeklife is a lot better than it's made out to be"
Niche User,5,"This school defines that you can not put a price on the education you receive. Every student is driven, focused, and goal oriented, so the competitive environment pushes you just as hard as the professors! The campus is extremely safe and beautiful and the research opportunities you receive are unlike any other!"
Freshman,5,"Washington University has an atmosphere unparalleled to any other University i've visited. Located in a city, WashU has an amazing student atmosphere with support opportunities viewed as ubiquitous by students."
Freshman,5,"Despite not yet being well renowned internationally, WashU is a top academic institution which continues to grow and make itself known through remarkable research and overall presence in academia. The campus is amazing, and food and dorms are exceptional."
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the food was amazing! Excellent programs for STEM and a very focused and efficient pre-med track.
Freshman,5,"amazing school. of course some things could be better (tuition is ridiculously high, low socioeconomic diversity, administration isn’t the best) but for the most part washu is incredible. the people here are so fun, passionate, and kind. there is always something to do. the dorms and the food are amazing. i couldn’t have chosen a better school!"
Freshman,5,WashU has exceeded expectation. You can always get the support you need and everyone is truly hoping for your success.
Graduate Student,5,I love the challenging curriculum and the emphasis on in-depth preparation.  The support systems in place are designed to propel students to achieve their highest potential.
Freshman,5,"This is a gem of a university. Beautiful campus (with some of the best dorms in the country!), dynamic student body, smart and interesting profs. The surrounding area offers rich cultural experiences and a vibrant night life. I can't say enough about how much my time here has meant to me."
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent academic rigor, notable professors, beautiful campus.  The university needs to embrace both sides of political spectrum, not just one. But I love WU."
Sophomore,5,"WashU is an academically challenging school, but also fosters an incredibly supportive environment. Students are driven, motivated, diverse, and friendly. I love the layout of the campus and the professors are very invested in their students."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the atmosphere at Washington University, I wanted to find an academically challenging school but without the competitiveness that is common at other schools. Additionally at WashU it is very easy to change majors or even schools within the university which is great for those who are undecided and it allows for easy addition of second majors or minors."
Graduate Student,5,The school has a good learning environment. Faculty are knowledgeable and help students build up professional skills to meet their future career requirements. The school also provides ample scholarship to every student.
Niche User,5,"WashU has a beautiful campus. Not far from the school, there is the Delmar Loop which is a great place filled with food and stores."
Junior,5,"Smart and extremely friendly students. Great (and challenging) academics, and a surprisingly satisfying social scene. Amazing campus."
Niche User,5,"On my campus tour, I had an absolute blast. The students were very welcoming, the dorms were huge, and the campus is absolutely beautiful!"
Sophomore,5,"I love WashU. It is the perfect balance of academic rigor and student/campus life and involvement. Though school gets tough, it's easy to find a niche of people who will constantly support you no matter the issue."
Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed being a student at Washington University in St. Louis. I think that the community on campus is really amazing and I've found it easy to get involved and meet people. Classes are rigorous but the atmosphere doesn't feel too competitive and professors are really willing to work with students outside of class.
Alum,5,"Washington University is one of the nation's top schools  because its focus is on academics.  It has one of the most beautiful campuses in the nation, but the school is not centered on sports, Greek life or partying.  It offers a top notch education which many believe should be the center of what is admittedly an expensive experience.  Some have referenced Washington U. as an island but that is only because it has everything to be a self-sustaining experience, nothing prevents students from seeing the larger world around the campus and its economically and culture diverse reality."
Alum,5,"WashU was an amazing place for an undergraduate.  They do an amazing job to create a great experience especially for freshman.  There are not many local students and almost no commuters since freshman are required to live on campus without cars.  This does so much to encourage friendships and community in the dorms.

Academics are challenging, but that's what I was looking for and for the first time I felt at home among peers rather than feeling like an outcast for being a high performer.  Many students are dual or triple majors or doing a combined bachelors/masters program like I did.  It was great to get my BS/MS in 4.5 years when some of my co-workers I know took 5 yrs just to get the BS.

Financial aid is very generous, I came from a low income family and 85% of my costs were covered in grants, only 15% in loans.  Of course 15% was still more than $40k when I graduated, but I have been continuously employed my entire career so far."
Freshman,5,WashU is an amazing school with incredible academics and student life. When I visited for the first time I was amazed by how kind all of the people here are. For anyone considering WashU I would highly recommend visiting to get a feel for the beautiful campus and students here.
Junior,5,"I think Washington University is an excellent place to attend undergrad. There's a lot of attention paid to their students, and the undergraduate experience is deemed vitally important by administration. There are a lot of students from the coasts, but overall, WashU is a school that prides itself on community involvement and diversity."
Graduate Student,5,I am an online student at Washington University. The online program for MLS is great. I am able to go to school and have a job in a different state. I have classmates from all over the world litteraly.
Sophomore,5,"I love it there! I would not change anything about the school. The academics are perfectly rigorous, the food and dorms are amazing, and the people there are all very unique and interesting. I truly feel that the university takes a personalized interest in each and every student and wants to see all of them succeed."
Sophomore,5,"Words cannot express how amazing of a school WashU is and will continue to be in the future. Everything about the student experience here is amazing: academics, social life, THE FOOD, HOUSING... etc."
Freshman,4,Online classes have been pretty good so far. Professors have had to make adjustments to the curriculum but many of my classes are just as enriching over Zoom.
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience at WashU has been good. I will say that the support from staff and professors has been overall exceptional."
Sophomore,4,"Very academically rigorous school. Good for premeds: challenging without being competitive and toxic. However, school culture is sort of what you make of it; very low focus on sports and partying due to high WUPD (police) presence. Lots of cool clubs/extracirriculars to make up for it."
Junior,4,I think the school has strong academics and fun social life. Students are very motivated and passionate about their studies. There is not economic or racial diversity and think this is something that needs improvement.
Junior,4,"Though online learning was not ideal, my classes were still engaging over zoom. I think the school is doing an okay job at handling the situation."
Alum,4,"Having spent the last half of this SP20 semester online, I must say that WashU did a great job adapting to the change in instruction. The small class sizes were definitely helpful in maintaining the discussion-based feel of classes, and professors were willing to meet outside of class (just like on campus) to help go through content."
Junior,4,"While the classes are difficult, and sometimes made moreso by the professors, they are very doable. With hard work and being willing to ask for help/take advantage of all of the available resources, student success is the number one priority"
Alum,4,"Washington University in St. Louis offers a very well-rounded academic experience for students.  The campus is beautiful, but it is very separated from the surrounding city, and it is easy to end up living a university ""bubble.""  I would highly recommend WashU to students studying certain fields, such as medicine or public health, but I would not recommend it to students who are undecided or majoring in fields for which WashU is not specifically renowned."
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Washington University in St. Louis. I found my home there, and I found my family in the amazing community of people on campus. I had amazing professors, the campus is beautiful, and the courses were challenging but rewarding in the end. There is a lot of work that still needs to be done to improve socioeconomic diversity, divesting from fossil fuels, and supporting graduate student workers."
Senior,4,"WashU has a top-notch academic program with excellent professors.  The school has amazing undergraduate classes.  In particular, the Olin business school is outstanding.   The business school allows for a lot of flexibility in humanities electives while providing a solid business foundation.  The business school is a very collaborative environment which is unlike the cut-throat culture in other elite universities. 
However, there are some downsides to WashU.  There is no party scene at WashU anymore.  The university continues to crack down on all social fraternities and sororities, and the administration has a goal of fully eliminating greek life.  The campus food is trash. I have no idea how WashU is highly ranked for campus food.  Also, there is an extreme lack of diversity at WashU.  WashU is ranked #2 in the nation for the least diverse universities in terms of socio-economic status. The quality of life for students is pretty low because the administration hates fun."
Graduate Student,4,Washington University in St Louis has offered me new perspectives and great academics to pursue my career goal. I would love to see the university improving in funding graduate students projects to offer more events to our students and building up experience.
Freshman,4,Wash U is amazing! I came to school here having never visited and am so glad I did. The campus and quality of student life is especially good.
Alum,4,"Washington University in St. Louis has great opportunities for academic research, supportive professors, and a beautiful campus. My one challenge was the culture--low income students and students of color had to work very hard to find community and feel accepted."
Freshman,4,"The professors are amazing, you have the opportunity for small class sizes, the campus is beautiful, and the dorms are super nice."
Sophomore,4,"Washington University in St. Louis is an amazing resourceful school. Between the Student Union and Student organizations running events for students, every student is able to explore their unique interests in different industries and activities."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are tough, a lot of your general freshman classes will be a rude awakening from high school. Too many students obsess over keeping their high school GPA, just let that go. The dorms are rather cheaply done and the food isn't very healthy. I wish there was more to do around campus for non Greeks. Most students don't even venture off campus into the city."
Sophomore,4,"Good, academically strong school with many resources for postgrad employment. Financial aid can be a bit rough, but students here are relatively cognizant of how privileged they are and do not exclude others based on socioeconomic status."
Sophomore,4,There are many academic resources available to students. Professors are great for getting in touch with others for research opportunities.
Alum,4,"Great academics and teachers. Overall very nice students. Lacks in school spirit, athletics, and the administration is tyrannical about shutting down any and all fun"
Niche User,4,"I graduated from Wash. U. and loved it. It was such a great experience when I was there.  At the time, the only slight issue was the housing/dorms, which where poorly constructed and generic. They have seen been upgraded substantially. The City of Saint Louis was a bit disconnected from Wash. U., even though it was not far. The teachers were great, though.

Sophomore,4,"Washington University provides students with a great education and has very knowledgable teachers on staff. On the downside, the students are very privileged and are technically diverse racially, but not socioeconomically."
Freshman,4,It's a pretty good school but sometimes it is hard to be here because Wash U has a lot of students who are kids of the top 1%. In other words the school is not very economically diverse.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the college experience at WashU. It fits all my needs and helps me attain my goals. It pushes me daily to be better and although the rigor of academics is tough, it helps me be ready for my future endeavors."
Freshman,4,"Great so far, really academically oriented. Being a small school, I found it really easy to get opportunities for research, internships, or anything that a university could provide for students."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I've had a very good experience. There are many activities and opportunities for students (perhaps even too many haha). Someone is always willing to help you succeed at WashU."
Junior,4,"WashU is a very diverse, safe, and fun campus. I am involved with the swim and dive team, so I see and meet a lot of people not only on the team, but in other sports as well. The academics are great and most of the professors are good. Two things that really stand out are the dorms and the campus food. Dorms are very modern and clean. The campus food offers a variety of dishes ranging from your traditional burgers to Asian, Indian, and Hispanic food. In terms of students, many students are involved with something by the end of their sophomore year. There is always something to do at WashU."
Niche User,4,Obviously a dream school for anyone that can get admitted. My tour was very welcoming and I saw lots of diversity. St Louis was a little concerning overall.
Junior,4,"Incredible undergraduate experience. Lovely facilities and staff, great accommodations, and overall beautiful campus. However, could be way more diverse and lacking when it comes to sexual assault preventative measures and education."
Junior,4,"There have been a lot of administrative issues/scandals lately, but overall the student body is full of great people."
Freshman,4,"The campus is a little bit out of the city- getting to local businesses/restaurants is slightly time-consuming. Forest Park's great though. Academically, it's pretty tough, but most of my professors did a good job to make classes and work as workable as possible for students. The stir-fry in the dining hall's pretty sweet."
Freshman,4,My experience here at WashU has been life changing. The campus is gorgeous and the professors are awesome
Niche User,4,"It is an amazing environment, and it was an amazing experience to be there. I met a lot of important people there who really pushed me in the right academic direction. The staff and students were really humble in every way, and I will always remember the experience."
Sophomore,4,Nice work if you can get it......Expensive. Elitist. Traditional. Competitive. Rigorous. Superficial.
Junior,4,Washington University in St. Louis is a great place to get an education. There's no doubt about that. But the lack of racial and socioeconomic diversity is killer. It sucks so much going to a school where no one else understands whatit means to work for money.
Niche User,4,WUSTL is a great university for academics. The campus is clean and safe. There's a respectable level of diversity. Greek Life has a big influence around campus and there's a growing push back on this antiquated tradition.
Freshman,4,"WashU is a great school for engineering and premed, but could get some improvement in the writing department and such. The science courses I've taken thus far, including Gen Chem, have proven to be pretty challenging, especially without an AP background from high school."
Freshman,4,"If you're serious about getting your work done and you don't mind having a lot of it, come here. It's a friendly community of like-minded individuals who understand the value of hard work. The comfort of nice architecture is a bonus."
Freshman,4,"All of the faculty at Washu are extremely nice, and the food is pretty great too. I would like to see more economic diversity at the school, but in recent years they have taken several steps towards rectifying that problem."
Freshman,4,I loved it. This is a great school everyone should go to. The people are very nice and greek life is amazing
Sophomore,4,"WashU does a very good job in creating a community of students. The school is decent sized (10,000+), but it feels like a home. The food and housing is outstanding, and the professors care. A big negative right now is the massive construction project on campus, but that will be gone in a couple of years. Because of that, parking is sometimes really difficult but still manageable if you can afford the expensive parking permit."
Niche User,4,"Washington University is a beautiful school in St. Louis that is academically rigorous. The students here are definitely focused on their studies. The school is within walking distance to the Delmar Loop, an extremely popular street filled with restaurants and various activities. Washington University is very liberal. The students are friendly if you approach them, but they are not necessarily welcoming. There is not a huge emphasis on athletics."
College Sophomore,4,The campus itself feels very safe. There is WashU police that you see walking around a lot and you can always call them if there is a problem.
College Freshman,4,The school itself is very safe even though the surrounding areas can be dangerous. We have a police department on campus and a student-run emergency medical service group on campus. There are also many support services accessible for victims of sexual assault.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life does not have a huge effect on campus. The majority of students do not decide to rush, so there is not a lot of pressure to join one. If people do decide to rush, the process it not overly difficult. However, the sororities are much easier to get into than the fraternities."
College Sophomore,4,"The faculty places a large emphasis on campus safety, and all freshmen are mandated to attend an educational seminar on it during orientation, and must also complete a 3 part online course module. There are many resources available to victims of sexual assault and harassment, and campus security is very efficient. However, WashU's sexual assault rates still match with the nation's averages, and the surrounding area around campus is not necessarily the safest."
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are definitely difficult, as WashU is very academic-oriented. However, there is not the same competitiveness that you will find at other Ivy League-level schools, as students are very open to helping their peers. Professors are well-educated and willing to help students. Class sizes vary depending on the course, but only intro level classes are in large lecture halls. However, these classes also have additional recitation sections in smaller classes."
College Sophomore,4,"It is very easy to find research opportunities on campus if you just approach professors. WashU is a very research-heavy school, and encourages students to find internships and research opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,"If you live in a modern dorm, you are living the dream! Our worst dorms, or the traditional dorms, are still far better than dorms at most colleges, but they are still pretty average. The school has a high ranking for dorms because of the moderns, but don't expect that much if you're in a traditional."
College Freshman,4,"Some dorms are better than others, but all are at least decent."
College Freshman,4,They are a good way to find a community while doing service and having some fun.
College Freshman,4,"The teams are close and create good friendships, but teams value academics over sports."
College Junior,4,"The intro science courses like physics are definately pre-med oriented but the quality is still great.  The courses are challenging but there are plenty of resources to help. The professors, for the most part are also very approachable if you have any questions."
College Junior,4,The career center is very helpful.  They helped me put a resume together and directed me towards a summer internship program.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Since I've been attending, the classes are convenient times during the evening, I've gained a considerable amount of knowledge, my only issue is the cost. Wash U is very expensive and I believe there should be more opportunities for scholarships and pell grants for the students."
College Sophomore,4,Its a good school overall. It can be excellent depending on your field.
College Sophomore,4,Having the name of WashU behind you really helps when looking for a job. But jobs are still hard to come by.
College Sophomore,4,"If you get good housing, its AMAZING. Even if you don't the dorms are still better than a lot of housing at other schools."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is great if you're a part of it! Its a relatively small community. Students not on greek life don't pay much attention to it except for their parties.
College Junior,4,"If you're more interested in participating than watching, WashU is the move"
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I am pleased with the quality of the dorms, but I wouldn't say its worth the headache. It's A LOT cheaper to get an apartment in STL and you don't have to deal with annoying party rules."
Sophomore,2,"WashU is a decent school if the only thing you care about is academics and can't get into any other school of the same caliber.  The campus and food are nice but are overshadowed by the fact that as a research institution, teachers want to research and not teach for the most part and the school is very expensive.
If you have any interest in a party scene, WashU is not the school for you.  As a member of greek life on campus I can say the school is making it harder to have and go to parties than it was as a non greek-life freshman student.  I'm not sure why WashU has an A- rating on Niche for party scene, I honestly cannot think of a school with a worse party scene.  People I am familiar with at small liberal arts colleges have a much larger party scene than WashU, so if this is any factor in where you apply, don't come here as you will be very disappointed."
Sophomore,2,The social life is terrible and academics are demanding. Professors are great but the school does not help graduates very much and puts so much effort into being an ivy that it ends up making a horrible experience. This school is more work and less recognition than similar tier schools.
Freshman,2,Why are the students here so pretentious? We aren't in an Ivy but everyone acts like students should prefer to come here over anywhere else. It was the right fit for me but I find the population very annoying. The classes are challenging but there is not much variety in available courses.
College Junior,2,"Fan support is almost non-existent- no one attends football games- but we have an extremely good women's track and field and women's soccer team.  The current athletics facility is definitely sub-par but there is a fitness center where the freshman/sophomore housing is.  Also the main facility is under construction so we will see how that turns out.  Clubs are even more popular, however.  We have a relatively competitive club Frisbee team but overall on campus acapella is by fat the most popular competative club.  Their concerts have the highest turn out of anything."
College Sophomore,2,Ugh. Its not at all diverse and being in MO doesn't help at all.
College Sophomore,2,Honestly no one cares about our sports teams.
College Sophomore,2,"One in five is the national standard, and that's something that needs to be worked on everywhere. I wouldn't say my campus is more or less safe, but it does need work."
College Senior,2,"Varsity Sports are intensive for athletes but unappreciated by the rest of the school. Intramural sports mostly cater to underclassmen. The facilities are adequate and are currently undergoing construction. When the main gym reopens in Fall 2016, it will likely be one of the best gyms in the country."
College Freshman,2,Nobody really cares about athletics
College Freshman,2,"meh, people do it but it's not a big thing here"
College Freshman,2,Not because of the players. There's just not a lot of student involvement/fan support/school spirit.
College Sophomore,2,Party scene is only good during Wild.
College Student,2,"Not many people care about the athletics- I mean, we are division 3. People (especially your freshman year) will go to support their athletic friends!"
College Senior,2,If you're looking for a school where the athletic games on the weekends are the place to be then Wash U is not the school for you. Students rarely attend football or basketball games but there is enough to do otherwise that most students don't feel like they're missing out on anything.
College Freshman,2,"If you want athletics do not come here. The students do not really care about them. The facilities are older, but a new large facility is opening in 2016. Many students are fit and do club sports, intramurals, or work out, but high level athletics are not a big deal here."
College Sophomore,2,I have only completed one year at WashU so far but during that year the weather pretty much dictates your life. It was blistering hot last summer and I found myself always trying to stay cool. The winter was freezing cold and always raining and did not end until May. Which means we never got a spring. I hope next year is better.
College Freshman,2,The teams themselves are great and intramurals are enjoyable.  Many are more about getting an opportunity to play the sport than playing competitively.  Attendance at sports events is small.
College Sophomore,2,experience all 4 seasons in a week. also allergies
College Freshman,2,NO snow days. Ever. Sun is out sometimes. Blinding
College Freshman,2,"The weather is sporadic. It can be nice. It can also be awful. It is like you wake up every morning and you roll the dice. The number you get corresponds to a weather condition. Its random so it doesnt matter what time of the year it is, you can roll any of the weather conditions."
College Freshman,2,"Its really hot in the summer and extremely cold in the winter. Fall was amazing, but it lasted for about a week."
College Freshman,2,"I've only gone off campus for one Target-run, a few celebratory dinners, and a ride to the top of the St. Louis Arch. There's not much to do off-campus that's interesting enough to leave campus. In addition, the city has a high crime rate and muggings aren't rare in and around campus. Wash U is known for having its small 'bubble' world for these very reasons."
College Senior,2,"Greek life on campus perpetuates the rape culture by giving only fraternities access to private houses. Sororities are only given one-room suites to hold meetings in. The frat parties are generally the only parties with alcohol that freshman and sophomores have access to, so there are a lot of individuals who have never had alcohol before being taken advantage of. And the university does a terrible job at monitoring what occurs in the frat houses so it is very easy for women to be brought up to the brother's rooms while they are drunk and unable to consent to sex."
College Senior,2,"Since there are renovations, there are not as many spots available at this time."
College Senior,2,I honestly do now know much about Greek Life at Brown School and Washington University. I have not even seen much information about the Greek system at all. I'm sure the Greek life is more geared towards undergraduates.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is viewed as being cliquey and is only known for the parties.
College Freshman,2,You could starve to death on this campus. The food places are well hidden.
College Freshman,2,"Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars and as I understand it, the permits are extremely expensive with not a lot of areas to park in."
College Junior,2,"Games are fun if you go, but so few people go and nobody really pays any attention to them. We're also great in a lot of D3 sports but the athletes never really make the spotlight."
College Sophomore,2,"get out while you can – Greek life is slowly being destroyed. If you care about this, do not come here. The school's goal is to make greek life irrelevant in the next few years. "
College Freshman,2,"Washington University is not the place to come for a high energy athletics program.  Although our school does have many different teams that compete nationally, the student body as a whole is neither well informed nor very supportive of their fellow student athletes.  Everyone is just too busy with their studies and research to pay much mind to sports."
College Freshman,2,"Reconsidering the Bio Major – Grading Procedures and Policies are very strict. No test make ups and a lot of tests are at night. Smaller classes also have a pretty strict attendance policy. Biology has a curve so that only a certain percent of people get A's, B's, etc... which is really frustrating since it compares what you know to what other people know and not how well you know the material...so even if you did really well on the test, it may change depending on how many people did better. At a school like this where so many people are so smart, curves like that suck."
College Freshman,2,At least in my dorm only 2 of the four computers in the lab ever work.  The wifi is a joke and videos take an hour to load
College Freshman,2,Virtually Non-Existant – If you are looking for diversity then you are sorely out of luck at WashU. There is no one here but suburban Jewish people and Asians. You will be lucky to see an African American person in your class and even luckier to see a Latino person in the school at all. The school tries to act like it is diverse but it is not at all.
College Sophomore,2,"Getting Worse – Drinking seems to be the only thing the school can be relaxed about. In terms of everything else though, the school comes down much harder than they should and much harder than most other schools would. Administration, as of late, is definitely giving the impression that they are becoming progressively more power-hungry and trying to control all facets of the student's lives."
College Sophomore,2,Everybody here is Pre-Med and wants to either do a Biology or Chemistry Major. It's very competitive.
College Freshman,2,"Biomedical Engineering – The workload is heavier than any other major here. The faculty is pretty sweet, but the BME class is ridiculous. The school has a weird sense of BMEs. If you really want to do BME, do it. Don't let the school or advisors tell you what to do."
College Junior,2,"Touch and Go – They really don't know what they're going to be strict about. We can drink alcohol, but not really have parties (depending on the RAs), and we can get away with smoking non-cigarettes (usually), but cigarettes will be banned in July. For the most part they're chill...just don't be stupid and obnoxious."
College Junior,2,"The girls really are unattractive as a whole. The school has gotten progressively less lenient with regard to achieving a ""college"" experience. My best experience was freshman year when administration was far less strict. My understanding is that it was even better prior to that."
College Freshman,2,"Freshmen cannot have cars on campus but you can use the WeCar program, which could be great but there aren't enough vehicles on campus for it to be truly successful. Public transportation isn't great nor safe except for the metrolink. Getting off campus can be very difficult besides walking down to the Loop but even that is hard during winter."
Freshman,1,"Bear-themed Disney Land that reminds you that the people in charge don't care about you, they just want your money. 

Anyway, student life. Students study hard, but aren't passionate about what they're learning. Not saying they aren't smart, but it's hard to tell one person from the next. If you want personality, this assembly line of a university isn't the right place for you.

Something I was looking forward to doing before I came here was something I heard multiple times during multiple WashU admissions presentations. WashU admissions people said that the St. Louis Zoo releases their penguins from their enclosure every year and lets visitors walk in the park with them. It's called the Penguin Parade, but last time it happened was in 2011. Even the admissions people don't like their jobs enough to go the extra mile to keep their information up to date. I'm not mad, just disappointed.

Good school, good academics, many people love it here, but no passion is a deal breaker for me."
College Senior,1,"The permit costs are outrageous ($500+ per year). Not only does Washington University fail to admit students who are from lower socioeconomic statuses, but also make going to school there very difficult for those who do get in because of the huge extra costs of attendance - such as mandating freshman to live on campus in dorms that cost $14,000+ per year."
College Junior,1,"There are plenty of parties on-campus and at nearby off-campus apartments.  However, if you're looking for a ""night out on the town"", St. Louis is not the right city for you.  Coming from Chicago, St. Louis feels like a small town rather than a ""city"".  If you are over 21 there are some decent bars, but forget about clubbing here.  All of the clubs are really trashy."
College Junior,1,Completely Unpredictable – The weather in St. Louis varies greatly day to day
College Freshman,1,Not Good – There are few parties and the only good parties are hosted by Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
College Freshman,1,"I Regret It – I came to WashU because it was a good school relatively close to my home and I regret it almost everyday. WashU has a terrible social scene and very sheltered students. The sports are lacking and its location is to be desired. That being said, the school offers an excellent educational experience and they will do anything to help you learn. That being said, that can be said about every school of WashU's caliber. If you want a true college experience and to learn well, look elsewhere."
College Freshman,1,There Aren't Any – We have a variety of sports teams but no one cares to go to or support them.
College Senior,1,"Not Very Safe – They do not provide a ""how to""manual on where and where not to go: students have absolutely NO CLUE as to where the safe locations and non safe locations are in St. Louis off campus"
College Senior,1,Most of the students are out of town and not given ANY directions
College Junior,1,Some people smoke weed pretty frequently but other drugs are less present. Most people feel comfortable with this.
College Freshman,1,"Lots of people like sports here, but nobody cares at all about our sports teams. Volleyball and basketball teams are good, but don't expect a state school experience."
College Junior,1,"Shocking Prices. There's actually plenty of parking on campus - you can usually find a space, though not necessarily near the right building. The problem is the cost. A parking permit costs about five hundred dollars and each type of permit only applies to a few sections of the parking lots."

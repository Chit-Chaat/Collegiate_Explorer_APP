Junior,5,"Due to Covid 19 I have had to apply and complete all paperwork for the upcoming semester on line. The staff has been great about sending me details, updates, and other information via email, mail, and phone calls."
Junior,5,"The University of Evansville has a great Criminal Justice program and I am so excited to continue my education  here. I feel confident that when I graduate I will not only land a great job, but will be ready for the workforce."
Sophomore,5,"I love the size of this university! If you want to get to know your professors and have one on one interactions often, this university if perfect for you! I honestly would not change anything about this university. I feel so included and welcomed here."
Sophomore,5,"With Covid-19 making all schools turn to online, I have had to take many online courses. The professors though understand and worked around everyone's schedule so well. They adjusted their syllabus to make the learning easier and even had zoom calls for students to just ask questions one on one with the professor. My professors always answered their emails in a timely fashion and worked around some internet connection issues since every student was on their own internet."
Freshman,5,"The staff is very friendly and always willing to help, they want to see you succeed. They’re also always ready to lend a listening ear."
Freshman,5,"They make sure to always have thorough instructions and Class work isn’t that hard, they make it easy and simple."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed the small classroom setting. All of my professors were so intelligent, attentive, and engaged. Very different than experience than my friends who attended large universities. 

There isn't a huge sense of comradery on campus, but you can make friends and meet new people if you try there. Everyone is friendly. You are in the middle of nowhere, so if attending school in somewhere urban and thriving is your jam then this isn't it."
Niche User,5,"I wonder what my father is doing now. I imagine him resting in Ohio, looking out over the brown yard, rain caressing the window pane. He is drifting into a dream of the virgin forests he grew up playing in, trees brushing the sky, broken logs thick as he was tall. He hears a whisper. He imagines it comes from a tall elm to his right. He begins to climb it. Twenty feet, thirty, forty feet in the air he finds himself sitting in a crotch, his ear pressed to the trunk. The voice is no longer a whisper."
Freshman,5,"One of the most notable things I've noticed about Evansville as an incoming freshman is their ability to communicate and assist me in all aspects of choosing, applying, and preparing for college. They are available at reasonable hours and respond to emails within a day at most. There facilities are clean and well kept and the food in the dining hall is remarkably tasteful."
Niche User,5,The teachers and the students there were so nice to the visitors. We have different kind of wonderful parties there
Niche User,5,"One of the things that I would change about the University of Evansville is that the dorm rooms are a little small and have a musty smell to them. However, one of the many things that I absolutely LOVE about University of Evansville is that the college is small and all of the faculty really care about each and every student. The campus is also small and walking distance between each side of campus is only about five minutes."
Freshman,5,"Even though I haven't been on campus very long I really enjoy being here. The friends I have made being here only for the past 3 months are ones a strongly feel will last me a lifetime. The classes are not as hard when you manage your time wisely and focus more on what you need to get done. The whole atmosphere surrounding me is truly positive and supportive and there is always a smiling face around the corner. There are a lot of great places on campus to study and lots of resources to find help in class you may be struggling in. I love the choice I made and I truly am grateful for the opportunities given to me at any time I am on campus. I see myself being happy here for the next 4-years. No matter how stressed I get about classes or how home-sick I will get at times, I have made a home here and I am so happy."
Junior,5,"Love UE but my major gripes are the lack of maintenance done in the dorms. I got allergies for two weeks due to mold on my dorm floor and the food is largely inconsistant. UE has quite an underrated party scene making school quite interesting. Be ready to work hard because you get what you put in. For any major, UE will help you to be successful in life."
Freshman,5,I feel really included in this school. I love the safety and security they offer on campus. There are many resources here to aid in academic work. The professors are helpful to students.
Freshman,5,The University of Evansville is great! I like how the campus is small and the professors are very attentive. Everyone is super nice and the atmosphere is wonderful!
Sophomore,5,"I love it. I have made so many friends by living on campus, and I think the campus is beautiful. I have loved most of the teachers that I have had so far, and I can't wait to be back in the fall. It helped me realize what I want to do in life and figure out what I am passionate about."
Alum,5,"My advisor and professors were great. At a small school like UE, you’re not a number but are cared about personally by the faculty who do their best to meet your needs and give you the education for which you’re paying. I studied at the school’s British campus, Harlaxton, for a semester, and I could not have had a more meaningful college experience."
Freshman,5,I love my campus. Everything is good. I am excited to continue my collegiate career here at the University of Evansville .
Sophomore,5,"When searching for a place to settle for the ""best years of my life,"" I knew I wanted something to remind me of home. The University of Evansville has given me this exact environment, and I am very grateful. All of the staff are genuine and you can build relationships that will last a lifetime. UE becomes one big family and everyone wants you to succeed. They have a variety of programs, clubs, and activities to match anyones need."
Niche User,5,"The University of Evansville is a very personal campus. It feels like a big family. The professor are great, the campus is great, and the area is awesome."
Sophomore,5,First semester on campus and I absolutely love UE! The professors are very accessible and want to reach you potential. Food could you a bit more variety but we do have a Chick-fil-A.
Junior,5,"UE offers such a close knit group college experience, the teachers know your name and class sizes allow for a more interactive education experience."
Junior,5,"I have loved my college experience here. The small class sizes, individualized courses, and professors who actually care about your success. While academics are very important, the campus offers a variety of activities to help get students involved. If we don't have a club or activity you want, the best part is you can create it! The overall look and feel of the campus is like a home away from home."
Graduate Student,5,It’s a great town to go to grad school! There’s not a lot of distractions but still things to do on your days off!
Freshman,5,"The University of Evansville is a small school. Therefore, there is a lot of instructor attention in the classroom. I like that and think that I learn better in a small classroom environment. The teachers are all very helpful and caring."
Sophomore,5,I love the campus and the atmosphere.  the professor's really want you succeed.  the environment is really great for learning.  as well as a great student environment.
Senior,5,I've enjoyed my experience so far. Small classes and community are the best of the experience. Professors know everyone.
Freshman,5,"University of Evansville provides a fulfilling education on a small campus with a big community feel!! You can get involved, learn, have fun and so much more!!!!"
Freshman,5,"Overall, my experience with the University of Evansville has been superb. I will not enter college until Fall 2017. However, on the day that my mother and I attended the indoctrination, there were potential employers for our degrees in attendance.My degree is in Computer Engineering. The college follows up on each student and treat every student with respect."
Niche User,5,I felt right at home from the minute I walked on campus. The campus is easy to navigate for those nervous college freshman.  My admission counselor and anybody on the receiving end of my phone calls have been helpful and super nice. Some of the ratings are based on facts from what I have read and some are based on my visit.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, my fall semester went by super fast. Not gonna lie, party scene at the beginning was insane and everywhere, but then some girl got intoxicated and an ambulance had to be called, so now fraternities only host lane closed parties, but trust me, it's at the baseball house where it's at. Lots of great professors, most of them actually are amazing and willing to help, except don't take American politics your freshman year, and if you really don't need it, just don't take it, he won't hesitate to fail you for no reason. The food is great, everything you could ever think of is in the dining hall. Athletics are improving, got a great women's tennis team this year, already showing results, especially the freshmen. Mens and women's soccer are really fun to watch and of course free to students. Campus isn't that big, isn't that small, but you can get to any class by walking in no more than five minutes, which is great. So far, I'm in love with the university and the city."
College Freshman,5,"As a member of Phi Mu, the second oldest sorority, I think Greek life is amazing. Not only do you have this amazing support system but you also gain many more friends. These people become you family. On our campus only the fraternities have houses but every other weekends they do throw large parties where everyone on campus is welcome. The men and women in the Greek community stick together."
College Sophomore,5,The school offers plethra of opportunities not only to strengthen your resume but also to provide the chance to meet possible future employers. The people that are part of the career center are super friendly and want to help you the best way they can to help you get a job when your graduate. Graduating with a degree from the University of Evansville shows that you are defiantly experienced in your major of study and are willing to learn and adapt to the real world environment.
College Sophomore,5,The courses and professors that I have had the privilege on taking are in my opinion excellent. There are a variety of courses that are offered in each major that will peak your interest. The professors really care about their students and want them to succeed in which ever subject they are teaching.
College Sophomore,5,The greek life at the University of Evansville is very involved with the community and on campus. Everyone in greek life is also involved with other organizations that the school provides.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone here is committed to their studies and is very involved on campus. I personally have had the time of my life here at the Univeristy of Evansville and have no doubt that it has and will prepare me for my future endeavors after I graduate.
College Senior,5,"Career services is great, as are internship and employment opportunities."
College Senior,5,"I love my professors and the courses I am in.  Every professor I've ever had knows me by name and cares about my education and me as a person.  Our avg. class size is 18, and student:faculty ratio is 13:1.  That's awesome.  We are a tight knit community on campus."
College Senior,5,i personally dont worry about any of these things!
College Senior,5,"I love being at UE. We are a friendly campus, and you are never just a number."
College Sophomore,5,"I joined Phi Mu sorority earlier this year and the other greek orginazationson campus welcomed me and the others in my pledge class very readily. I am still close to my friends that are nongreeks, and no one treats me any differently for being in a sorority. All of greek life on campus is greatly involved in campus life and the various philanthropies that they support."
College Freshman,5,The professors are always helpful and willing to work with you in anyway they possibly can.
College Sophomore,5,The University of Evansville is the best school I have been to. The professors are focused on each student as an individual not a number. The professors car about each students success.
College Freshman,5,"Campus is super safe, we do not have any crime that I have heard about. Safety and Security has an emergency and non-emergency number that we can call at any time. They also have safety poles around campus that they can get to within a minute, though they have been tested, they have never been used. They also have escort services that a student can use if they ever feel unsafe. I feel 100% safe on campus."
College Freshman,5,The career center does their best to find everyone a job and an internship. I know that many programs require an intership in order to graduate and everyone is able to find an internship that would suit them. Everyone is also able to find a job in about  a year after they graduate.
College Freshman,5,This campus is small and so are the class sizes. The professors care about you as a person and not as just a number. Everyone is kind and does their best to welcome all kinds of students. This school makes being away from home easier.
College Freshman,5,"I like living on campus because there are so many things that go on, that if you live off campus you miss out. I made most of my friends because we live in the same residence hall. I just love my building because it is close to everything I need and everyone is so kind and understanding."
College Freshman,5,My school is supportive of all actives on campus. Nearly 80% of campus does intramural sports. Everyone supports each other and we are all proud to be a purple Ace.
College Freshman,5,My school has wonderful professors. They care if you are in class and if you miss a class they send you an email to make sure that you are okay. They also do a lot to help you; it could be office hours or helping you schedule your classes in order to do everything that you want to do. I would choose my school again because the music therapy program here is advanced and I feel that my professors care about me. Plus it is easy to become involved around campus.
College Freshman,5,I love this school so much. I have never felt so at home in my life. I would always choose the university of Evansville if I had a chance to choose again.
College Senior,5,"The environment at UE is so open and welcoming. The faculty truly cares about the students and administration is constantly seeking ways to make the experience even better for students. The university puts on events all the time that range from philanthropy events, talent shows, trivia night, comedy nights, concerts, and more. Knowing what I know now, I would choose this school a million times over."
College Freshman,5,The friendliness and willingness of the staff is one of the major reasons I came here.
College Freshman,5,I wouldn't have been able to come here without financial aid.
College Freshman,5,I go off campus to eat often and there is always a good variety and you can order cheap if you know what you are doing.
Recent Alumnus,5,The staff is very accommodating.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is very safe. I can walk down the street at night for dinner and not have to worry about my safety. The health department is very helpful and have very knowledgeable and able staff.
College Sophomore,5,It was very well organized. They have many options for financial aid.
College Sophomore,5,"The party scene is at the fraternity houses and being a small school pretty much the same people co,e over but with that every weekend is unique."
College Sophomore,5,Being in Archaeology is fun most of the time. we do alot of research which is interesting. My school sponcers digs and expeditions to get field work experiance and a highly competive internships
College Sophomore,5,All I i did was declare Archaeology as a major then at orientation you met with your professors of the dept. not hard at all.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Evansville is a solid school with some of the best programs available to students. It has an abundance of clubs and degree choices, including being one of the only schools in the midwest to offer an architecture degree. It struggles on the financial side, admittedly being in debt and charging a lot of hidden fees not previously expected, but they do work with you to get the easiest payment options when applicable."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed the small classroom setting. All of my professors were so intelligent, attentive, and engaged. Very different than experience than my friends who attended large universities. 

There isn't a huge sense of comradery on campus, but you can make friends and meet new people if you try there. Everyone is friendly. You are in the middle of nowhere, so if attending school in somewhere urban and thriving is your jam then this isn't it."
Sophomore,4,Online courses were easily accessible and implemented the curriculum well. The professors try very hard to support your learning while online to provide a pleasant yet rigorous learning experience.
Sophomore,4,A small and quaint four-year university with the most welcoming staff and faculty. The campus is small and only takes you ten minutes to get to class! It feels like home.
Graduate Student,4,"Evansville is in a small city of about 110,000 in southwestern Indiana. This makes it nice because it is not a large city with a ton of distractions, but big enough to have fun when you need to. The class sizes never exceed 60 or 70 which is rare in the first place. Most classes are 20-25 students which make it easy to get 1 on 1 time with your professor. Overall, a very solid university."
Sophomore,4,"I love the people at the University of Evansville, my teachers are great and invested in my success. The campus is small which makes it easy to make friends and get involved. All that being said, there are things that could be improved. Such as, the quality of the dorms, and the food."
Alum,4,The University of Evansville has a great community feel and professors who want their students to be successful.
Freshman,4,"The chemistry department is top notch, and nearly every professor you have has a doctorate. Everyone is brilliantly smart, but if you do not pace yourself, you will get in over your head very quickly."
Alum,4,"Small, tight knit community. Administration is running the school poorly. School is in significant debt. There is good Greek life. Students do not attend sporting events. Sports teams under perform consistently although they do compete at a Division 1 level."
Sophomore,4,Easy to get help from the teachers and easy to find offices. Little to no “college life” and nit much happening in campus.
Sophomore,4,"UE is a private school so tuition isn't exactly that cheap. UE has a great small campus that is beautiful and easy to get around to. The classes stay pretty small besides the math and science courses where you will have 20 students usually. The professors are great and the classes are interesting. 
The food is pretty decent and there's a few restaurants on campus. There is always something to do on campus once clubs become active!"
Sophomore,4,"Some of the college cosmetics could be improved, but the staff really cares and there are a ton of support programs to get you through the hard classes. The Writing Center is a great place to make sure that your writing makes sense. The internship opportunities are constant and knowledge about them is easily accessible. I don't know much about the athletic divisions  but from what I've seen it's pretty lit. The food kind of varies in quality, but it's mostly ok. Students from a rich background tend to not like the food, but everyone else has varying levels of agreement or disagreement. I like it but it could be better. UE has a lot of international students and the international festivals are AMAZING! There's always something interesting on campus."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Evansville not only provides the top of academics, but good sports and the chance to become involved due to the smaller campus style. My overall experience there was totally fun and stressful, but well worth it. Im looking forward to going back this fall as a sophomore, and the only thing I would change is the eating area. The university is one of the smaller ones, and for that, the cafeteria is starting to become a crunch style eating area. As the University of Evansville expands its student entry, they should try and expand sitting areas in the cafeteria to make it comfortable for all students."
Freshman,4,It is a great campus and very pretty. The professors really look out for the students and want the best for them.
Sophomore,4,"The small size allows you to connect to professors and other people at a whole new level. Additionally, the opportunities provided and extremely rewarding. There is a ton of stuff to do on campus as hobbies or for professional development."
Niche User,4,"When I visited the University of Evansville, the one thing that stood out to me was the fact that I will be able to know my professors since this university is small; I will experience one-on -one time with my professors, and the staff promises to be there for the students."
Freshman,4,"The University of Evansville was very good about communicating with me about the school, the programs offered, and the beautiful campus life. After visiting campus a few time and talking with various different people about study abroad, athletics , and what majors options I had, I knew the best fit for me would be UE. There are exceptional staff all across campus and within each department! The student body is also very welcoming and inclusive!"
Senior,4,The best thing about the University of Evansville is the student to teacher ratio because it provides students the opportunity to meet and create a more personal relationship with the professor. There are multiple opportunities to get involved around campus and a number of different resources.
Junior,4,"UE is a very education-oriented school. The class sizes are small enough for students get the individual help they need to be successful. The professors are always willing to talk with students. The graduation rate is high. Evansville is a mid-size city with all of the perks of a major city (shopping, entertainment, employment opportunities, etc.)."
Freshman,4,More diversity would improve this college. I feel as if it is on the right path however nothing is perfect. I also love how involved the students are in the athletics. Also it is a great living environment seems pretty clean.
Junior,4,"The thing I like the most about the University of Evansville is that the staff actually takes the time to get to know you. The students are also pretty outgoing and helpful. If I could change something, I would promote more diversity within the institution."
Junior,4,"I love how any one can come get a scholarship because the school gets a lot of gifts from generous donors and alumni who love their alma matter. As an international student from Brazil, I think that Residence Life could improve on campus food though. They recently changed the food provider, but that did not enhance it that much. However, if you are looking for a college where you will be happy and learn so much in those 4 years... UE is definitely your choice. This is the best small liberal arts school in the Midwest, and it is very unusual to have such a diverse on campus on southern Indiana."
Freshman,4,"I have had a wonderfully fulfilling experience here at u of e. The food is delicious, my professors are highly qualified, and the campus is beautiful. I encourage anyone from any major to give u of e a shot."
Alum,4,University of Evansville prepared me for the goals I had in my future as a Music Therapist and potential graduate student. The professors are great and always willing to work with you and help you prepare for upcoming exams and such throughout the semester. I felt exceptionally prepared in my area of study after graduating from the university.
Junior,4,"University of Evansville is a great school. While challenging, the academics at this school are phenomenal and students are always pushed to succeed. Due to it being a small school, UE gives students the opportunity to work one on one with their professors and meet for office hours. Athletics are also a great asset to UE. Promoting the hard work of student athletes is something UE does a great job of. In addition, this school is VERY diverse giving students a chance to experience people fro other cultures."
Sophomore,4,This University has much to offer that helps students prepare for their future in all aspects. The small community feel has made this community feel like a home away from home for me. I know my professors care about me as a student and want me to succeed.
Niche User,4,"While I've never attended UE, I do live near it, and this is a beautiful area of Evansville to live in. The campus is well kept, and the people around are very nice. On top of that, it has a very safe environment."
Freshman,4,"It is an expensive school, however, you receive many of the resources you need. They provide a health center, free counselors, free tutors, free word, office, and excel programs, free gym membership and programs, free laundry, and much more. The teachers are alright, but some underclassman teachers aren't good at teaching while they are good people. The atmosphere is unusually quiet. No one is out during the mornings to early afternoons and it is like a ghost town on the weekends There should be a little more activities to get the students of Evansville engaged together and to meet more students. Commuters are left out of the loop a lot and it is hard for them to get engaged in the campus community. Making up about a third of the school, the sorority and fraternity kids get the most out of the campus and party life and they seem to be the better socializers."
Sophomore,4,So far great experience.    Not thrilled about the food but soon will be in house so can cook my own food.    Like the small campus atmosphere and how easy it is to get to class and get to know other students.
College Senior,4,Employers speak high of this university and its students.
College Senior,4,Happy with my experience here! It has a international flair that won't be seen at most private universities.
College Freshman,4,"In my dorm, we have this place on the ground floor called ""The Pit"" where we host lots of meetings and social events. In our office there are a plethora of movies and games to choose from, as well as cookware. The Residential Assisstants are welcoming and approachable which is very helpful you you're new or nervous. Since my dorm is all female, it is a bit cheaper than the three co-ed dorms on campus. The atmosphere here is very friendly."
College Freshman,4,A lot of people think we probably don't have as good of a turnout for sports because we don't have a football team but that isn't true. The attendence for all of our sports teams are somewhat equal. Our teams play to the best of their abilities and their fans are 100% supportive of them.
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of programs that the University provides that allows the students to feel safe on campus. Safety and security services patrol the campus 24 hours a day and provide a safe environment for students.
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus is very convenient and provides a great living environment for students.
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic department provides University of Evansville students with great amenities, but there is room for improvement as far as  updating the facility goes."
College Senior,4,I love UE!  It is my home now.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy being here at UE. One of my favorite things about UE is that the professors genuinely care about us and we students are not just a number.
College Freshman,4,"The student career prospects are good and so is the value of the degree. The only downside is that even with scholarships, the school costs a lot of money and thus many students graduate with big loans."
College Sophomore,4,The school and organizations are very welcoming.
College Freshman,4,There are many resources for academic assistance. The professors are friendly and will go out of their way to help you and often on their own time. The tight knit community of both students and faculty are what make UE unique. There are plenty of great student organizations fo get involved with on campus.
College Junior,4,"I rate the security on my campus as seen because I have never under any circumstances felt threatened. The security guards on campus are very friendly, and keep a very close eye on the students on campus, and many will warn you if anything is wrong, or ask you about your day if you feel upset. They would even be willing to walk you to your car in the parking lot off-campus if you asked and felt at all frightened. They are great people."
College Junior,4,"The great thing about my university is that it is still small enough that the professor will remember you by name. All of your professors are well-learned people. There are a handful of professors you will notice do not do all their homework before entering the class, but if you do it, and can prove them wrong but in a professional manner, then you show you are more prepared than the professor was expecting, which always is a surprise."
College Junior,4,"There are many of students from my university who walk away with internships or jobs already lining up for them, especially in my field. I believe it is the work you put into your degree that makes the amazing outcome."
College Junior,4,"For the most part, my current university is very exciting, and I enjoy their efforts to connect with students. The only thing keeping my rating from a five is the amount of construction that has occurred since joining the campus community. I feel like there is no rest and no effort to account for the students in relation to travel across campus, but the faculty is amazing, and the coursework is very exciting."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe with not getting mugged.
College Freshman,4,Great career center. Wonderful mock interviews
College Freshman,4,"interesting courses, good class sizes"
College Freshman,4,"best options: Powell and Shroeder

worst: Hughes"
Recent Alumnus,4,"I had a job lined up before I graduated, which was really nice.  My program has several internships through the school that were easily accessible throughout my time at Evansville.  The career center is incredibly helpful with mock interviews, putting together resumes/cover letter, networking, and many other things.  The Alumni Association is helpful as well."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Safety & Security (campus safety officers) do not take their job seriously.  They tend to be slow to act during some situation.  They do not care if you are walking through campus drunk or high.  RA's will bust you way more often than Safety & Security.  They are accommodating when you need into a building/classroom, but slow to do so.  Often they lock the doors when people are still inside, so that you have to prop the door open to come and go as needed.  They drive around on golf carts during nice weather because campus is so small.  If they bust a party, they do not enter rooms with closed doors, making it easy to avoid trouble."
College Freshman,4,"Internships are available and extremely encouraged, and jobs are always brought up to encourage us to think about our future."
College Freshman,4,It was an easy experience and I have enjoyed my room and my roommate.
College Freshman,4,They are always sure to offer open classes for non- athletic students as well as athletes on campus.
College Freshman,4,"University of Evansville was a huge transition for me, but everyone on campus was determined to make it as easy as possible."
College Sophomore,4,I lived on campus two years and loved it. The rooms were nice and the environment was even better.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life provides many activities to help the community.
College Sophomore,4,Our basketball team is phenomenal!
College Freshman,4,"It is a pretty decent living situation. Not really any ""perks"" but its clean."
College Freshman,4,"I am not part of Greek life but most of my friends are. They all love it and Greek life helps out the community a lot. Plus everyone is super friendly to each other, Greek life or not. Every Greek life organization is respectful towards everyone else and each other."
Sophomore,2,"UE struggled with the online transition. There were no plans and regulations, leading to many professors taking the online transition as an easy half semester early break. The quality of education suffered dearly, and there was absolutely no tuition reimbursement. They seem to have things better prepared for 2020-2021."
College Freshman,2,"Sodexo (the contracted catering company) is terrible. The food is almost always terrible and they don't have very much variety. Fusion, an option in cafe court, usually has the best options, but there isn't much variation. Flex is your best friend. You can use it to order pizza from Papa Johns."
College Sophomore,2,"The housing is extremely expensive and you are forced to have a meal plan which is wildly priced and the food is awful. There are not a lot of healthy options and my stomach is turned upside down anytime i eat there. they are about to ban all smoking on campus, which will make an average school day very difficult for smokers. Another awful thing about living on campus is the fact that it is a dry one. So if you are 21 you can't drink in your own room."
College Junior,2,"I'm not the biggest fan of Evansville, especially since the east side is predominantly concrete and no grass. I am not that impressed with the local population here, some people can be really rude."
College Freshman,2,"From my experience, games of any kind are not widely advertised or discussed. Therefore, not many students attend any. I wish there was more school spirit, honestly."
College Junior,2,"I attend the University but I have to pay for a parking permit after paying huge amounts of money for tuition. I boycott paying for the parking permit however it is to hard to find parking sometimes on the street or nearby areas that will not fine me. By the time I find parking and then walk to class, I am probably late because of the distance I have to walk from trying to find a parking spot. Honestly, I try to come up with the money to pay for a parking permit but I already drive 45 minutes from Princeton and back, and it is unnecessary to have to pay for a parking permit when I pay $300 in gas a month."
College Freshman,2,"Southern Indiana weather sucks, bring your parka.  But sometimes it can be really nice though!"
College Sophomore,2,Evansville the city does not have very many amenities for the younger generations. Most stores close on weekdays by 10 or 11. There are hardly any under 21 events to go to.
College Freshman,2,"There really is no transportation option except owning a car on campus, which can be annoying when one needs to go somewhere."
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing is close, and the town is not too enjoyable. "
College Sophomore,2,"Sometimes they're off schedule, and they don't go to all aspects of town easily. The school feels very far off from all the fun stuff. "
College Freshman,2,Rooms are very small and shared bathrooms.
College Sophomore,2,"The city of Evansville is apparently the meth capital of the country. I don't actually know how well this is transferred to campus because I don't hang out with the kinds of people who do that sort of thing. I know pot tends to circulate, and some people smoke, though it seems to be mostly the Middle Eastern guys for whatever reason. Drinking is common from what I hear."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Parties at the Frats – There are registered parties about every other weekend at the frats and theyre really the only places to party around campus unless you are an athlete or a theatre major.  There are constant theme parties, but drinking is not allowed on campus so security can end a party at an time.  Lambda Chi is the most welcoming frat along with Fiji, with Lambda throwing the better parties.  SAE throws some good parties but they do not let everyone into the house, even if they are UE students.  Sig Ep rarely let's anyone males in unless they are other Sig Eps, but when they do their parties aren't bad.  Besides parties, Greek life plays a small role on campus besides fueling intramurals"
College Senior,2,"There are limited amounts of parking spots in the different lots, and most of the time the lots are full.  Parking passes are average, but spots fill up fast.  Expect to have to park in lots up to a block away if plans including getting back on campus after 8 pm."
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of spaces and security gets crazy with parking tickets.
College Freshman,2,"The weather in Evansville is unpredictable.  When it's good, it's good.  But when it's bad, it's bad for a week straight.  You can wake up to snow on the ground, and by the afternoon it will be 60.  Evansville has two seasons- Antarctica and the Gobi desert."
College Senior,2,"We should move to division III instead of division I. Some of our sports teams are pretty decent (baseball, soccer, softball, volleyball, etc.), but as a student, I resent having to pay for our mediocre basketball team, for example."
College Sophomore,2,We only have one dining option on campus and the value of the food is nothing to rave about.  There is a decent variety within the food court but it gets old.  We don't have any restaurants which is disappointing but the meal plan options work for people! Flex dollars are good for coffee and breakfast at Jazzman's as well as Ace's Place for snacks!
College Freshman,2,"Not healthy and very processed food in the cafe makes it a bit unappealing, although there is a Subway and gas station across the street, a lot of students live off of microwave food."
Niche User,1,The professors are very difficult to contact and the work load is unreal. It is incredibly easy to fall behind.
Niche User,1,When I first came to UE I loved it but over the course of 3 semesters I hated it. It is extremely expensive and the kids are very clicky. If you aren't in Greek life or an athlete there is absolutely nothing to do. I would recommend going elsewhere.
Freshman,1,"I went here for one year. Everyone who goes here pretty much is from surrounding cities or the city of Evansville. I never had anything to do on the weekends since I lived in the dorms and did not have a car. As others have said, this school runs on Greek life. The food is so-so depending on the day. 

Only Positive thing, I met my best friend here!"
College Freshman,1,"I hate how huge greek life is on campus. If you can not afford to be in greek life people look down on you, and you can not get into any of the parties if you are not greek."
College Sophomore,1,I explained it in my living on campus response.
College Sophomore,1,"Basically, if you don't have a car or a friend with a car, you're stuck here."
College Junior,1,There isn't too much diversity at UE when it comes to races and there are a high number of Catholics at the university. But the school does try and bring in many different international students to the university.
College Junior,1,Evansville is in the top 10 most miserable cities in the United States. UE is basically in it's own bubble.
College Freshman,1,"If the fraternities aren't throwing a registered party, there is literally nothing to do. Downtown is dull if you aren't 21+ and on campus...there is nothing to do."
College Sophomore,1,"I got two tickets in two days because i had half of one tire on the white line. I ended up having to pay $20, they student even let me dispute the case."
College Freshman,1,"Everything on campus revolves around Greek life. If you are not a Greek member, you are looked down upon."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's Been Worse – Since they've opened Ridgeway the food has become much better, though I still wouldn't eat it if I had another choice. It also has terrible hours and is VERY crowded at lunch time."
College Senior,1,See One See Them All – There really isn't any variety here.  My advice?  Look somewhere else for a serious relationship.

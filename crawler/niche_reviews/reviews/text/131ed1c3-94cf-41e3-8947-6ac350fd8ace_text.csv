Freshman,5,"Im a freshman here at Adelphi, a 4 year undergraduate and my major is Nursing. I'm a commuter student. Although I cannot spend much time on campus due to the Covid epidemic, the time I do go for in house class, I LOVE it! The diverse athmosphere, the amazing welcoming environment from faculty and professors and from other students makes me feel comfortable and eager to be here! I wish all my classes were on campus, but right now half is online. I'm still receiving the same enriched education though. I highly recommend Adelphi! I received full scholarships to all 7 of my college choices and I comitted to Adelphi and their Nursing Program because of the excellent campus, curriculum, and how easy it is to commute if you choose not to dorm!"
Freshman,5,"I enrolled full time into the Nursing program, where originally all classes were supposed to be on campus. Then Covid happened, and half my courses/professors changed to online, so I now have half my classes on campus and half online. I still receive the BEST education regardless!"
Sophomore,5,"Adelphi is great. As a commuter, there are actually many ways to be involved, as the majority of Adelphi students are commuters."
Sophomore,5,"My online experience as an Adelphi student was great. Professors are understanding and thoughtful and understand that remote learning is an obstacle for us, yet the academics are mostly at the same level of rigor as they were before the switch."
Junior,5,I love Adelphi University. I think everyone is very welcoming and kind. I just think that we should get more printing credits because I learn best by printing my notes and it is difficult to when I dont have enough credits.
Junior,5,Online learning went surprisingly well last semester. I feel like we didnt skip a beat with learning.
Senior,5,I had learn a lots about adelphi college from my friend who had always genuinely been recommending this college because also of the online works are wonderful.
Senior,5,"I like that adelphi is best at liberal arts and professional training. I also like where the college is located which really make college to stands out.  In this college different races and culture people are united together and seems happy.  I also heard that in classes there are at least 20 students. So, I think this will really help me to understand things faster."
Niche User,5,"It is in a wonderful campus with parking, excellent, accommodating professors, and a great schedule!"
Niche User,5,The online class was very good. The professor was open for feedback and any questions we had and the course requirements and assignments were very clear.
Junior,5,"At first I was hesitant about how my college experience would be due to it's small campus, but I have come to love it! I think it is large enough to meet new people and small enough to actually connect with the professors. It is also such a beautiful campus, I really enjoy it!"
Sophomore,5,Adelphi has been a very great place to study for me thus far. I really appreciate my time here. It is a very beautiful and good school.
Senior,5,"Adelphi is definitely a great university, it is a place where I met my friends and had amazing mentors to guide me through my journey. I just wish the nursing program, in particular, was better at organizing the program and that we didn't have to pay for software that we only used once or twice for classes."
Freshman,5,"There is a very friendly environment, but it is difficult to meet people as a commuter without being in a club or sport. They do have an honors college, and there are benefits in being a part of that. Over all, the campus is beautiful and very safe."
Freshman,5,"Amazing, I've only visited and heard from admissions officers. I was there for the apprentice challenge. its where many business students from all over the long island come together and compete. They put you in random groups, and you have to create a marketing plan according to the prompt they give.  You have to step up and take lead your team to victory. From this challenge, I got to see how nice the campus is. I love the usage of their Initials,Au, as gold."
Alum,5,"I graduated in May '19 with my Bachelors in Nursing, & had the best 4 years possible. I loved living on campus, receiving a quality education from my professors, working on campus, having leadership positions in clubs, having decent food available, & having the best of both worlds (beaches & NYC). No school is perfect, but I saw tons of improvements over my 4 years. The food got better, many dorms were renovated, the library & University Center are being renovated, Nexus was a huge addition, Greek Life is expanding, & clubs & events for residents & commuters are growing. Adelphi truly is a hidden gem & is getting better every year! I can confidently say that students who get involved are the ones who like Adelphi the most. College isn't meant to be fun if you only go to class, eat, do homework, sleep, & repeat. There is so much Adelphi has to offer, so take advantage of every opportunity! Everyone has a place at Adelphi, but it's up to YOU to find it & make the best of it!"
Sophomore,5,"I love saying I am a student at Adelphi University! I've been given so many opportunities to become involved not only on campus but also to work in the field I am studying, and I'm only in my second year! Adelphi's small class size makes this all possible and with our location being so close to NYC the sky's the limit! I feel so at home and welcome every time I step on campus. Go panthers!"
Freshman,5,Adelphi University is expensive but worth it. Small classes which are great so every teacher knows your name. I am a nursing major and yes it is very hard but it is manageable. Adelphi has a lot of majors here to take so make sure you broaden your horizon by taking one of our Dance or Drama classes. I have met some of my best friends here at Adelphi University and I would not change a thing. Leaving a small town in Long island and coming to another small town was a great choice since I met so many nice people and professors I can count on.
Alum,5,"Excellent business program, I had a great experience. I learned a lot and gained professional opportunities. Highly recommended great ROI!!!"
Sophomore,5,"Adelphi is a great school that offers many opportunities for it's students. I believe that the professors want to help their students, but particularly the ones who are truly putting in an effort. There are no 'hand-outs,' meaning the professors won't just do anything for any student. Extra credit is hard to come by, but if you try your hardest in the class and show that you care, the professors will do all they can to try and help throughout the semester."
Sophomore,5,Being part of the Honors College makes it more worth coming here if you are on the premed track. The professors are great as they are available for help and try to make sure the topic is understood well.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy going to school here. the campus is really nice and the teachers are really interesting. they have a very diverse student body and are always including minority groups.
Freshman,5,I love the closeness with my school I believe that small classrooms incorporate and encourage my learning. I feel like professors are very supportive and are willing to make office appointments to discuss papers and homework. I enjoy Adelphi's campus and the nature of the collectiveness of my peers.
Graduate Student,5,As a new graduate student student I am eager to start my journey at Adelphi University. I have had such pleasant experiences working with the staff. They have been extremely accommodating and made this transition an easy one for me.
Freshman,5,"Adelphi is a beautiful school in Garden City, NY. The total student body size is about 8,000 students. This aspect of going to a small school is great. Each lecture is about 30-40 students, with smaller classes having about 20 students max, and about  25 students for labs. Being so small, creates a closer connection with you and your professors. All the professors have the same goal which is your success. When you are looking for a job on campus or off, you can go to the career counseling center, in which the help you apply for jobs and curate a resume. If you feel ill or under the weather, Adelphiâ€™s state of the art health center will be They for you 24/7. Adelphi has a wide range of opportunities for you to be independent. This campus is one of the kind, and the experience you get from here is unlike at any other university."
Sophomore,5,"Great school, great scholarships, many opportunities, many benefits, adelphi is an investment, you get back what you put in, your professors care about you, the classes are interesting, you are pushed to succeed and given the right guidance"
Junior,5,"I love that there are small classes. My biggest class has about 30 students in it. This allows the professors to have more personal relationships with the students. The nursing building has everything that we need and more. I love going into sim lab because it truly simulates what it is like to be in the hospital. So far, I haven't really noticed anything that I do not like other than maybe the way that financial aid is disbursed, but I'm not sure if that's a school thing or an outside thing."
Freshman,5,"Choosing Adelphi is one of the best decisions I have ever made! The only negative feedback I have for this school is that the food is bad, it is honestly better to bring your own lunch. And also some buildings need renovation but everything else is great! You have numerous selections of classes, the campus is beautiful, you are offered discounts at many local areas, teachers are understanding, the student involvement is skyrocketing, and overall the opportunities this school provides you both during and after your time here is exceptional."
Junior,5,"I love how everyone is very helpful and how professors always have their doors open. Also, Adelphi needs to change their food quality and their pricings for students that are in debt from college tuition."
Sophomore,5,Adelphi was so welcoming and everyone on campus is always willing to help. The university presents many opportunities to get involved on campus and in the community. The academics are challenging but the professors and Adelphi community is so supportive! I have loved my time so far at Adelphi!
Junior,5,"The campus is beautiful, and the academics portion is excellent. It is not as diverse as I expected it to be"
Sophomore,5,"There is an extensive amount of available help with studies and tools to help manage student life. The classes are a smaller setting and there is a personal experience when interacting with professors. There is an abundance of extracurricular activities to do around campus and the night life in Garden City provides an assortment of fun activities. The location also offers close access to New York City which is a hub for opportunity, and fun."
Freshman,5,I am very pleased with the school my experience went well. the tuition is alittle expensive struggling to pay for student loan
Sophomore,5,Everyone in Adelphi goes out of their way to be kind and helpful. The resources here are amazing for studying for exams and improving on papers. The campus is beautiful and welcoming. The only thing I would want improved is that Iâ€™d like a little more diversity. I do see people of color in the university and my year is the most diverse year yet but I know it can still be more diverse.
Freshman,5,"I'm an incoming freshman, the first though when I walked on campus was how gorgeous it was. The atmosphere was amazing, everyone looked like they were having so much fun and wanted to be there, not like other schools."
Freshman,5,I love how I am being welcomed for next year. Their nursing program seems state of the art. I can't wait to begin attending in the fall.
Freshman,5,"Adelphi University is located in Garden City, close to many restaurants, and activities. It is mostly a commuter school, but there is so many activities on campus and there is always something to do. As a commuter myself, I love how the Commuter Assistant Program does special events for us, and often give out free breakfast or lunches for us. The campus itself is very beautiful, big fields, trees and you might even see a bunny if you're lucky."
Junior,5,"All my Professors are great and want you to succeed, but that doesn't mean you don't have to work hard for those grades! Great school! I've met so many amazing people!"
Niche User,5,I went to the Open House at Adelphi University and this was one of the most amazing experience ever. One of the reasons that I like Adelphi University was because it is very quiet and peaceful. The students and members of the students are very caring and offers a lot of opportunities.
Freshman,5,"Adelphi University has become my favorite place to be. It has become my home and I recommend this school to anyone who has a major that they offer. The school has changed my life and made my path to a career so much easier, while I feel the support from staff, professors and my peers. I donâ€™t think anything could change to make this school better than it already is."
Freshman,5,"Adelphi offers amazing experiences for academic learning and opportunities for careers and internships, as well as offering many organizations to get involved with on campus. The campus is always bright, friendly, and inviting and it was a pleasurable experience to learn in the schoolâ€™s environment."
Junior,5,"Amazing college! Graduating next year, the journey is great and I recommend every other student to be part of this college. you will learn so much, you will have so many opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"Everything about Adelphi is great. However with the 2018(Fall) Semester, the biggest enrollment of freshman to the college, more than double the size of the previous class, there is no more parking. The library is filled to the brim. The campus cannot contain this many people. I hope next year they don't try to enroll even more students, because it would be beyond unpleasant. Security around campus should be enhanced with the light of events happening in the USA."
Sophomore,5,"I am absolutely in love with Adelphi and its campus. It is a sociable and comfortable environment, with very many pleasant and devoted professors.  The academics and programs are astounding, making learning entertaining. Adelphi is not a campus that I would consider a ""party school,"" which I actually prefer. Despite this, There are many events and little parties held on campus by clubs and organizations, which are very enjoyable."
Sophomore,5,I love Adelphi university. Although I have only finished my first year I think it is amazing. They have tons of clubs for everyone to be involved in. creating a club is also very simple incase people have other interest. It is a small school but such a close knit community. There are tons of amazing community service opportunities as well. The professors are amazing and really care for the students. The only down fall to Adelphi is the high cost and would love to see it go down but I love it regardless. Adelphi truly wants all its students to succeed and would highly recommend the school to others.
Junior,5,"Adelphi has given me the opportunity to start my journey to becoming a nurse, all the professors and faculty are welcoming and organized. the campus is clean, safe, and always having activities. there is much to choose from when it comes to events, clubs, studying and eating. its nearby other businesses as well and the commute is not bad at all.  Adelphi is modernized and is always communicating with students about what goes on each day. i would absolutely recommend this school."
Freshman,5,All the professors are willing to help and know your name and can see your potential before you can see it.
Alum,5,"The professors are amazing. Location is quiet and beautiful. I met some of the greatest people here, mostly faculty."
Sophomore,5,"I love the professionalism of this institution and the compassion it has for its students, the smaller class size really make you feel like your are actually learning and not teaching yourself."
Junior,5,"Adelphi has a diverse and vast amount of student activities from Karaoke to Stress Management sessions.  The university cares about the students and their input.  As programs go on, they will change if something is not working and create an outlet for student input.  Facilities are clean, faculty and staff care about the students.  The campus is a beautiful place with plenty of dining options and places to study.  Not far from the mall or food options and getting to and from campus without a car is not hard.  Parking is plentiful."
Freshman,5,"I really like everything about this school! It is so diverse, the campus is beautiful, the food is good, the professors really want to help you, and there are many campus events."
Niche User,5,I am a junior in high school and I recently took a trip to this college with my class. It was a great experience getting to know more about the campus and the different opportunities Adelphi has to offer everyone.
Freshman,5,"Adelphi has been amazing so far as I am only a freshman. Before starting college, I was very nervous to make the transition from high school, but Adelphi has made the transition very easy. From orientation to your actual first day of classes, they truly illustrate that they care about your future here. They have small class sizes where the most I have seen which is 50 due to the class being my lecture class. The professors show that they really care because they do not care about the amount of questions you ask them, and they have multiple office hours to go over material with you that you are confused about. They constantly have events going on to make sure that your stay at Adelphi is not just work. Right now, they have commuter student appreciation week. The campus is beautiful and you can see the workers try very hard to make it look this way. During the summer, the grass is a beautiful green color, and rabbits running around campus. I have really loved my experience here"
Niche User,5,"Adelphi University is still one my great choices. Despite getting rejected to the acting program , l learned how much this school can benefit others. The education is intellectually stimulating. Professors are tough but thatâ€™s needed in the acting department to build you for the career. The campus is beautiful and is in a beautiful part of Long Island. Athletics are good but no football  kinda disappointing but they still have lots of teams Iâ€™d play for and enjoy. Student life is such a great opportunity..there are ways for students to engage all over campus. I will be applying for Adelphi University next year again and i will be ready for the acting program. I will never give up hope. Adelphi University is one of the best schools in Long Island and you wonâ€™t regret attending this school"
Senior,5,Adelphi provides many opportunities for students both in the classroom and outside of it. There is something for everyone at Adelphi University.
Graduate Student,5,"Adelphi University is a very modern, diverse and welcoming to all the students. Doesn't matter you belong to which community if you are here, means that you belong here!"
Sophomore,5,"Adelphi is an amazing school the faculty and staff care about safety and making sure each and every student succeeds. The campus is clean and constantly improving. The one thing as a commuter I would change is the parking situation, it is extremely hard to find parking to where professors are late and it affects your schooling and is stressful to worry about. The student life is amazing once you get involved there are so many opportunities and is constantly improving. I recommend Adelphi to anyone looking for a small welcoming college."
Freshman,5,"My first semester at Adelphi was not what I expected. It was a little hard to adjust and make new friends at first. Then my classmates started to talk to me so I opened up little by little. All my professors were very nice and they knew what they were teaching. Later in the semester, I joined the fencing club and went to some of the school performances. It was fun doing them and I'm going to become morr involved next semester. I learned in Adelphi some things I didn't knkw about myself and it really opened my eyes to all the new skills I've developed throughout a short period of time. Overall, my experience here was great!"
Niche User,5,"It is diverse and offers a lot of opportunities to the students there. There is a program that perfectly matched me and that was the Levermore Global Scholars. I want to major in Human Rights so this was the perfect program for me. It allowed students like me to prepare for the future and the career we were interested in. I wished to learn more about global issues such as climate change, poverty, human trafficking, and etc in order to help out in the near future."
Senior,5,"Wonderful! Attentive faculty and staff, informative classes, many clubs, many internship opportunities."
Niche User,4,This college is very friendly to autistic people with their Bridges to Adelphi program. It isn't a very big college either and there is plenty of space to go around.
Niche User,4,"The university is very welcoming and there are many professors to the number of students, with small class sizes. It is also located in a fun suburban area that makes it stand out and it is very interesting.
Remote learning at the school is quite average, due to low upload speeds causing the meetings to freeze."
Senior,4,"Taking online classes can be a pain because if the professors don't get back to you you are screwed. However during this pandemic, a lot of professors were able to get back really quickly."
Sophomore,4,"The online learning portion of the semester was very easy to manage. I had no issue contacting my professors. The convenience of learning from home was great. But the downside my experience around my peers, getting to interact with friends was tough."
Sophomore,4,"Adelphi has been a great experience for me. From the environment being very minimal, which makes you value the small things that most don't think about when commiting to a school. From the people and professors you met, the large quantity of clubs and activities that are available to you is amazing."
Freshman,4,"Adelphi is a very good school, with good facilities and teachers but is very expensive. It's quite a small school, but offers degrees in most areas. It's got a beautiful campus and competitive athletics programs in D2, but has a dry campus in garden city with no parties, unless you go to nearby clubs"
Freshman,4,"Online has been tough, but they have tried to accommodate everyone. They did use lockdown browser for a few classes, which made it tough but other than that most professors tried to help their students"
Junior,4,Adelphi professors adjusted fast and still delivered a valuable experience! I think they did an amazing job at continuing the semester with minimal disruption to our learning experience.
Sophomore,4,Some professors were very understanding regarding the circumstances of being shifted over to online learning. From keeping touch with students and providing extended deadlines to shortening the assignments where they could. But not all professors were this understanding and piled on more work than some could handle. While I feel this situation could have been handled better considering the rush and chaos of the pandemic it was handled well. They even provided students with the opportunity to change letter grades to p/nc which is something that could help students who were overwhelmed with the switch to online.
Freshman,4,"Not only is Adelphi University a beautiful campus, a warm environment but the professors and faculty members truly care about their students. From the first day of classes you feel like a family. The students and their education come first.  Especially with the spread of the corona virus the school always puts the safety of their students first. I have always felt safe and love going to a school that has my best interest at heart."
Alum,4,"This is a small school so you get a lot of personalized attention if needed especially from your advisor and mentors in your major. I was an anthropology major and there is a professor for any area that a student could be interested in. They really help you find opportunities/internships that interest you and helped with cover letters, resumes, mock interviews etc."
Alum,4,"Although I had a terrible experience within the athletic department, the communication sciences and disorders program was the best part about my college experience. All of my professors were not only knowledgeable, but it was clear that they enjoy teaching all of their students what they need to know to prepare for their graduate studies."
Sophomore,4,"Going to Adelphi was one of the best choices I ever made. At Adelphi, it's small enough where you can run into your friends on campus all the time, but everyday still meet new people. I've been lucky enough to meet friends for a lifetime here. The location is amazing- beaches, the hempstead bar strip, the city, all right there for you. It was also less than 2 hours from home for me, which was nice because I could go back easily if I wanted to, but never felt the need to because of how much there is to do on campus. What you put in, you'll get back. I'm on a sports team and I'm also involved in Greek life. There was always either a mixer, party, game, or study sesh with friends that kept me busy and involved. The nursing program is also top notch  and you will not regret coming here!"
Alum,4,"Overall, my experience at Adelphi was a positive one. I am happy to be an alumnae. I felt supported during my time there."
Freshman,4,"Its a great, local school for Nassau County. The biggest majors are nursing, dance, and education. If you a school that is sports or performing arts oriented this is your school. The campus is always clean and everything is in great condition. Classes are relatively small and quiet. Some professors, however, seem like they are uninterested in teaching the class, and will go off on tangents about things that are not even subject related."
Junior,4,"Adelphi has been an amazing school to me. They have all the classes I want to take and have such great staff and students. The school is very diverse and has so many options of classes, clubs, inter murals, etc."
Junior,4,"It has been a good experience,  but disappointing in a few instances. Except you know a faculty personally or you have some type of connection no one is readily available to help you, especially as a new student. You're always told to go do things yourself.  It's almost like a script, because everyone tells you the same thing. Especially when it comes to financial aid and applying for loans, the assistance and answers are very superficial.  Besides the administrative side of the school, professors are very qualified. You might find someone who gives you a difficult time, but the department heads are always there to help resolve such issues. Student life is good, not very loud, but still present. Campus food isn't the best and there have been safety issues in terms of allergies. 
It has its perks and down side like every college."
Freshman,4,"My experiences in Adelphi was that I met wonderful , very friendly nice people. Everyone over there are so welcoming and kind even the students. Some of the professors I had were very entertaining, funny and great professors."
Sophomore,4,"The classes are knitted for teacher / student interaction with most classes having 25-30 seats. Speaking of teachers, most are very compassionate and  more than willing to assist with any problems or confusion that left the classroom door. In addition, the school scenery is beautiful as it perfectly embodies each of the four season creating a picturesque environment every time I leave my dorm."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at Adelphi University, my experience for the first semester was pretty good. I met a lot of great new people and there are a lot of events that you could get involved in. There is always something going on on campus. I joined many different clubs, and this gave me the opportunity to meet even more people. There are always opportunities to get free food and they are always giving away gifts and Adelphi merchandise. There are usually a lot of students on campus at certain times of the day and week because it's mainly a commuter school. I truly believe that college is what you make of it and if you want to have a good time and make a lot of friends, then you will make that happen for yourself. You make the experience that you want to have."
Sophomore,4,"Ofcourse the classes are stressful and hard, but it's one of the best experiences and I learned to enjoy studying."
Junior,4,"I have been going to Adelphi for about 3 years now as a commuter. It is not a party school but if you know people in greek life or are in greek life then it will be fun. All I can say is try to make friends since it will make your experience better. The school has residents but it is mostly commuters and predominantly white. But, I love the school so far since the professors are really there to help you and see you do well. I think if I didn't go to the school my GPA wouldn't be where it is right now so good luck hopefully you like it!"
Sophomore,4,"-My advisor genuinely cares for my well being
-I feel welcomed in my desired Major.
-I do not feel like an outcast
-This university caters to my needs.
-Many resources"
Sophomore,4,It is a very nice campus and everyone is so nice. They should offer people more money to stay in their school.
Junior,4,"Very beautiful campus with relatively huge amount of students. Very good facilities. Very pleasant professors. I wish we had more staff in Math and Computer Science department, since there is always shortage of professors."
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience at Adelphi University has been very well and exciting. I am happy that I have been offered so many opportunities and experiences and only within my first year at Adelphi. In total, the professors and staff have been very kind, helpful and are intelligent enough to teach me things and further my education and knowledge of my field."
Junior,4,"I love how small and intimate the campus is. It's in a beautiful neighborhood. The overall appearance and atmosphere is very lively. Everyone is very friendly. Due to the campus' small size, it is very easy to navigate. There are many programs of study. Adelphi has a very broad athletic center and is very keen on sports."
Sophomore,4,"They are currently doing renovations to expand and better the dining halls, including other things, so obviously utilizing our funds.  The dorms are quite spacious compared to other campus. Campus is a nice size, so you don't have to walk far to get to class."
Senior,4,"I had a great time here, I made many friends. I took off one star because some of the advisors are not helpful, but other than that great school."
Sophomore,4,"Adelphi's class sizes are small and intimate. They allow the professors to get to know the students which help them tremendously. The campus is also a beautiful, peaceful garden where you can relax on any kind of day"
Junior,4,"Adelphi's food range and quality needs to be updated and many buildings need to be renovated. Also, there needs to be more interesting opportunities for student involvement. Otherwise, Adelphi is great."
Freshman,4,"I am at adelphi for the dance program and absolutely love it, tons of opportunities to perform and tons of time to work on technique with amazing teachers. I am also a part of the schools honors college and love my professors in those classes as well. The only two complaints i have is that the school gives out number scholarships like 10k instead of percentile scholarships like 80% so when tuition goes up with every year you are paying more and more instead of the percent that you paid the first year. Also while giving out a lot of scholarships Adelphi does not offer cheap enough housing, so while your tuition costs will be low over 4 years room and board are incredibly expensive for communal bathrooms and below average overpriced food."
Sophomore,4,"Overall a very good school. Underrated. There are still areas that are lacking, including developing certain clubs and activities, registration, and dining."
Senior,4,"Pretty solid school. Nothing special, some professors are not that great but others are. Definitely get involved. Easy to have relationships with professors but have to go to office hours and join clubs and stuff to make your time here worth it"
Freshman,4,I enjoyed most of my classes and I have made friends that I couldn't think of parting with. I even have a work study job through the university that I adore. The only downside to the university is that it's expensive so I use all the money I have towards my tuition.
Junior,4,"Adelphi University offers various opportunities for students to get involved in campus activities. I am part of the Derner School of Psychology at the university and the professors are more than qualified to teach. They are also extremely helpful and dedicated to the students. The social life on campus is calm and quiet, but also very present and welcoming."
Junior,4,The small classroom setting has been the most beneficial aspect of my college experience. The connections I have been able to make with my professors has made me love school. I know that this school has definitely been the best choice for me
Junior,4,"What I like most about Adelphi is that their staff is very friendly. All of the professors are ready to help students in any way that they can. The campus is beautiful, it has a lot of art displayed all over."
Senior,4,"Speaking as an English/Communications major classes are usually small and professors are always open to help so as long as you are on their good side. Services at Adelphi are decent for the most part, as are the resources given for the classes (books, equipment, etc.). Campus is beautiful to walk around in, and has a decent size of around 8 different schools in total, though Adelphi's efforts are mostly focused on the medical sciences such as Nursing. Despite it's great amount of cliques, if you look around enough you'll find the right people, though since it is greatly a commuter school it'll take time to make some worthwhile friends here. Connections and the job opportunities Adelphi offers are also decent, even for students in it's lesser known Arts & Sciences school. Would recommend as a choice, but ONLY if they offer you an excellent scholarship and a great amount of financial aid."
Junior,4,"I really love Adelphi, and I really think this school fits me like a glove. I really excelled in academics, on campus involvement, and I really came out of my shell. I'm not a party person, but this school isn't known for its party scene (which I love). I have met so many different people, it's crazy. The campus is very safe, and the area surrounding it is beautiful. The food isn't the best, but you can't expect much from college food. Look into this college!"
Junior,4,"Adelphi University is a university that I'm glad to call my home. The small classroom sizes make it really easy for me to get the attention I want in a class in order to help me succeed. The campus is somewhat diverse and the student life there is very much alive because of all the organizations available on campus. Overall, Adelphi is wonderful."
Sophomore,4,"I am part of the LGS (Levermore global scholars programme) and it has made all the difference! my classes are fun yet challenging! I have learned so much and made lifelong bonds with amazing people I have met in college. 

The university is in a safe, comfortable city that is only 1 train ride away from the city! 
Beaches are close by too and there are sooo many restaurants close by to school!"
Sophomore,4,"A place where the resources are there to help you succeed, and the connections and one creates can stand the tests of the real world."
Graduate Student,4,"Choosing to go to Adelphi was the best decision I could have made as a high school senior. The personalized attention that you get from your professors can not be understated. The school gives decent scholarships too, which helps because it is very expensive."
Freshman,4,"The transition from high school to college is not easy, but Adelphi University has a pretty good academic environment."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I have quickly accepted Adelphi as my second home. I truly benefit from all of the opportunities the campus has to offer, and when thinking about the college selection process, I would pick Adelphi again in a heartbeat."
Niche User,4,"Every time I have visited, I have liked the school more and more. Every guide has been very friendly, personable, and informative, the clubs and student activities have been interesting, and the professors have been very approachable."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Adelphi has been good. Before starting my first semester at college they help to make the transformation very easily. There were different opportunities during and during the first semester to get involved and meet new people. There's always an event going on on campus. There's also a lot of clubs that do different events and help make campus life fun for all not just for people doing. They try to make everything available and equal for everyone. Adelphi is very welcoming and loves to give back.So far its been nothing but good despite some of the classes being hard, its part of college. The professor is also available to help students understand what they are learning so that we can succeed in our major and graduate on time. In addition, they are looking out for us to make sure all our questions get answered so we arent confuse and fail there class."
Niche User,4,"The campus tour was very nice, everyone is very friendly and welcoming. Campus is nice too! There are a lot of commuter students but also there are people who dorm."
Junior,4,It's a great small school with a community environment. The professors are knowledgeable and interested in their students. There are plenty of activities and clubs to be involved in. The campus is beautiful and has lovely pieces of art spread throughout.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Adelphi was pretty decent. Sometimes there are fun events. The food may not be the best but the environment is pretty friendly. Like any school, there are professors that are really good and some that arenâ€™t so great, but overall interacting with the professors at their office hours helps a lot. The campus isnâ€™t the biggest but that makes it easier to navigate. Getting involved in clubs makes the experience at Adelphi more enjoyable for me."
Senior,4,"The classes are small, and very comfortable. However, registration is a hassle because not enough classes are offered. Teachers are caring and kind, and know you by name!"
Sophomore,4,Adelphi is good if you want to focus on your future career path. When it comes to meet new people it can be a hit or miss but you make at least one new friend.
Freshman,4,"I think Adelphi University provides you with many things that is worth your money depending on what your major is. This university is very favorable for nursing majors so I highly suggest that if you're interested in nursing, this is the school for you. The campus has a very great aesthetic and people might not favor on how small it is but makes it very comfortable to walk around from class to class in the shortest amount of time. The only downside about Adelphi is that there isn't a wide range of clubs and organizations and it's hard to have a good student life if you're not involved on campus."
Junior,4,"Very expensive but very good school. The teach you a lot, including responsibility. The staff members are excellent, very helpful,  and collaborate with each other in teaching all the students. The goal at this school is success, and you can feel it where ever you go in this school."
Junior,4,The school has a very nice campus atmosphere. The most of the professor are very good. The nursing program is very good you learn a lot and develop critical thinking skills. I would like to see change is the ATI policy that was recently changed. The new ATI policy affects 10% of our final grade which has a huge impact due to ATI is a very difficult exam to pass.
Niche User,4,"Parent of prospective student. Observed a lot of motivated students studying, practicing for a performance, leaving a class excitedly debating about literature(!), and working on a group TV project. 
Good location, seemed safe, academic support especially strong, cafeterias great.
Ugly part: many neglected buildings. Dorm awful!! Library seriously outdated, small, and crowded. Offices cramped. Other schools blew this place out of the water with regard to facilities and equipment.
One of the best possible locations in metropolis with corporations, tourism, nature, history, jobs, etc.
Discrepancy between the kind of school it could be and the kind of place it is. Hints of a lack of leadership, fighting between factions,  pigeonholing, long-term complacency. Core values unclear.  
Our Uber driver was an alumnus, a banker driving on the weekends. He loved the school but hadnâ€™t been back since he graduated 10 years before, said he never got a call or an invitation."
Sophomore,4,"Adelphi has a safe campus, though I commute so I'm unsure if the dynamic changes at night. Most of the courses/professors I have had so far are very good. The food in the dining halls could be better. Overall, it's a commuter school so it's get the job done for regular daily life: class, part-time job, clubs, and then home."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is a beautiful garden and during the warmer months it's nearly impossible to not get caught off guard by it. 

The food could be a little bit better however it is currently the school's focus at the time to create wider options. 

The social life is meh at best...Really nothing to do unless you're in a frat or sorority. Sometimes the Athletes throw parties but nothing too exciting. If you're looking for a more alternative scene then forget about it. Not a basement show in sight. 

The classes are great. While nightlife and food is mediocre I have to say the educational experience is amazing. The professors really try and look out for you and they care an awful lot. I've never felt such a radiance of passion vibrating from teachers other than here. They truly love learning and it shows."
Freshman,4,"Very nice campus, small classes, has a community feel about it. It is quite expensive though. The food is pretty good and professors are very understanding ."
Junior,2,"My online experience with the school isn't a positive one. All the offices are hard to reach. When you do get in contact with them, they aren't very helpful; they provide blanket answers."
Junior,2,"Overall Adelphi is a good school with good professors, but I can be getting the same exact education elsewhere for a MUCH lower price. The school has made the decision to go back in August until November with some hybrid classes but they increased the tuition. How am I paying more for online classes? it makes absolutely no sense."
Alum,2,Below par business school. Finished with a degree in Finance with a 3.8 and feel I learned nothing at all. 0 technical skills taught.
Sophomore,2,"The reality of Adelphi is that if you aren't part of a program with a lot of funding, it isn't worth a huge amount of money.  Such programs include The Honors College, Nursing, Dance, and Psychology. The university likes to spend a ton of money trying to grow the school (through ads, admissions events, etc.) but never focuses on urgent problems that are affecting the students it already has. The dining services has been in need of improvement for a long time, the university is only trying to make changes AFTER students and parents have threatened to opt-out of meal plans. The way the school spends money is disappointing, and tuition is very high for a school that provides very little.
However, I would like to state that the honors college is a wonderful and intellectual program with great people and professors. If you have the opportunity to be a part of it I recommend it. The honors college is the only thing that I really love about Adelphi."
Freshman,2,"my first year at adelphi wasn't so good. This college brags about how good their diversity is, however it really isn't diverse at all. parking is terrible especially if you leave a decent amount of time before home to get to class. I've had terrible experiences in the parking lots, and watch out for aggressive drivers there, they're everywhere. Some people gave me the oddest looks as if I don't belong here and mean girls are a thing at this college. Acceptance is a thing they also brag about here but people don't accept EVERYONE who they really are. Commuter students have it the worst, only because most clubs and organizations are for residents students, and are late at night. the only thing i enjoy the most at this college is the campus, and the professors are so far decent and nice."
Freshman,2,"Adelphi is a scam! The team in financial aid are horrible, This school is very expensive overall, so i don't understand why the lack of help & information provided for financial aid for freshman students is so vague. The school is completely boring on the weekends. The food selection is horrible. The school is very clique, so if you did not attend HS in a neighboring town most likely you will feel out of place.  The obvious plus are the safety of the campus, the beautiful inviting campus, the modernized buildings, the school generally is a well respected school because its a school located in the heart of Long Island NY where you don't have to travel 3-4 hours away from NY to attend an Great University but overall, in my opinion is a great COMMUTERS SCHOOL!"
College Sophomore,2,In the medical field only one opportunity is available and it is taken as a class.
College Sophomore,2,"Its a very boring school with not much to do especially on the weekends and the people that attend the school are not very friendly, there are a lot of cliques it feels like im still in high school"
College Freshman,2,"I would not choose Adelphi again because although it is a good school, it was not the school for me at all. Because of the one semester I attended I owe a lot and would like to transfer but I have to pay all the money off and could possibly miss another. I feel I made the biggest mistake and I'm full of regret."
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid did cover some of the cost, but I felt I was more than qualified for a specific scholarship offered by Adelphi but I was not granted it. Because of the cost it forced me to take a semester off and try to figure out a way to pay the debt."
College Junior,2,"Be very careful, especially at Post. The food isnt always cooked fully, and many people have gotten sick."
College Freshman,2,"It's near impossible to find a place in the area, and they are very expensive."
College Freshman,2,I have had very bad experiences with our school transportation. I am a freshman so I have to park my car off campus due to a new building being built and parking space being limited. It is about a ten minute walk from campus which is not bad at all if it is not cold outside. Since it is now winter I want to take the shuttle to and from my car especially at night and the shuttle is never anywhere. Tracking down the shuttle for the Garden City Pool parking lot is the hardest thing ever. I have had to call public safety multiple times because I will wait for 20 minutes and it wont show up. It is super aggravating especially if I need to get somewhere like work. They finally made an app to track the shuttle and it does not work at all. I am thoroughly annoyed at the shuttle system here.
College Freshman,2,"The food here is terrible. It's only my second semester and sometimes I gag just thinking about how I have to go eat at the UC or Post. Post is the worst, but we also called the UC the Yuck. Lackman catering should not be a business. Sometimes the food is rotten or makes you sick. The quality is terrible and the people serving you food cannot even get that right. I'm 18 and I have worked at two different restaurants the fact that the man at the wrap station has no idea how to make a wrap is absurd. Honestly prepare to have extra money set aside for food because you will either be ordering out or finding someone with a car to take you to a restaurant off campus. For half a semester I lived on frozen food dinners because they were better than the food Lackman makes for us here."
College Freshman,2,"If there's one department that needs to get their brain's working, it's the financial department. Their mistakes have caused student's A LOT of money."
College Freshman,2,"Raw food? check. Bacteria? check. Food poisoning? check. There is variety, but most of the places are just disgusting. I feel safe bringing food."
College Freshman,2,"There's not too many parties on campus, the party scene is practically nonexistent. Most people go to the seedy bars in Hempstead/ off campus where you can find some parties."
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do aside from go to sleazy bars or go to Manhattan.
College Junior,2,They are shitty collage bars...That what to expect.
College Junior,2,There is no school spirit. People dont even know we have certain sports teams.
College Senior,2,Greek life is persistant and constantly harrassing people almost every day of the week outside of the UC.
College Freshman,2,"What's really bad is the amount of cigarette smokers on campus, and a lot of students go out frequently to drink until they can't spell their name. But some people smoke weed, and I don't think that's the main problem."
College Freshman,2,"I don't drive, but from what I see, the parking is pretty bad, it seems as if it's really difficult to get parking."
College Sophomore,2,Not much to choose from except the Hofstra bars in Hempstead.
College Freshman,2,On weekends it's empty because campus is usually dead on weekends but on weekdays there are no spots and cars circle around for a while. Even if you have somewhere to go you're afraid to take your car because there's not enough spots. They make freshmen and sophomores park off campus due to the insufficient amount of spots on-campus.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't use campus transportation personally, but often I'm needed to pick up my friends from the nearby train stations due to the shuttle leaving just as the train arrives, and only certain train times have corresponding shuttle buses."
College Freshman,2,The shuttle comes every half and hour or so and the taxis cost to much
College Freshman,2,It's really far and students have to wait in their cars until a shuttle comes
College Freshman,2,"I regret choosing this school and the only reason i am here is because of the dental program. other than that, things here are terrible. The people don't socialize, there's no school spirit, and there is nothing to do."
College Freshman,2,"The food sucks except for the Tuscan raps. Everything is ridiculously expensive, a slice of pizza cost 6 dollars. & You're basically f***ed if you have a meal plan or not because it costs more when you pay with cash but then they make you buy more things when you try to use a meal swipe. There's usually only one person working the line of 100 kids when there's 5 other open counters"
College Junior,2,Greeks are not mean  but the importance of their fraternity and sorority is apart of who they are and it embodies each of them. They all are friendly and dont treat non greeks any different.
College Junior,2,"My professors are very difficult I try to get the grades that I want by earning them of course, but my professors sees otherwise. My work quality is not up to the level of my professors and this hinders my grades. I still however remain in my major because of my interest in it but my professor do not all make it a happy experience. As for right now i have a 40 page paper to write and as much as I may go to him or resources available it never result in the grade I know learned."
College Junior,2,"My campus and parties are not anything students attend, Greek basically throw parties for Greeks and they make majority of night life their own."
College Junior,2,Students are happy to to join intramural sports. Its a good part of Adelphi University.
College Sophomore,2,Too much construction going on.
College Sophomore,2,"The parking on campus is horrible, especially now that one parking lot is closed in order to make a bigger one. You really need to arrive early in order to get spots."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm a communications major, but I'm changing soon. The curriculum is way too easy for college classes. I would rather have to work for my degree than get past with flying colors for doing hardly any work."
College Sophomore,2,"The school is basically thrown in a neighborhood of mansions, so if your looking for a campus where you can easily walk off and find something to do this school is not it. The LIRR trainstop is not too far of a walk, so access to NYC isnt that much of a hassle ."
College Senior,2,"Depending on the day of the week, parking can be a nightmare if you arrive at the same time as everyone else. There are certain days and times when parking is a breeze."
College Freshman,2,There are never many parking spots available on campus during the school day. Many are late to class because they could not find parking or had to park off campus.
College Freshman,2,"There are 5-year education and social work programs where you can get your BA and Masters for education or social work in 5 years. Our honors college allows students to buy expensive tickets to ballets and theatrical productions in NYC that would normally cost hundreds of dollars, for only a few dollars instead. The nursing program is supposed to be very good with advanced technological robots that allow students to practice as if they were actual patients. The campus life isn't very active, other than a few fundraising booths always in the University Center trying to raise money for an organization or their club. Other than that it seems to empty out after classes have finished, especially on weekends. There's a train station right next to the school that can take students into NYC in 35 minutes, and cars are allowed on campus for any year student. However there are a lot of commuters that make it difficult to fill the campus at night and on weekends. The social scene is usually limited to only Thursday nights at either Nachos, Dizzys, or another close bar (18+ to get in), but it gets expensive paying for taxis, cover charges, and drinks every single time. Some people go out to the bars again on Saturdays, but it's the exact same scene every week and tends to get old really fast, with lots of grimy/creepy guys and girls, and things like house parties only happen rarely, once a month at most. After some time here, although I've made some amazing friends and really nice people, you can't help but feel lonely and lacking in school spirit."
College Freshman,2,This school is very expensive and it makes me doubt I will be able to afford it if I continue my education here. I love this school but unfourtunatly the cost is a major issue to my family and I. I believe I deserve much more financial aid because my family is struggling to afford it and I would love to stay here for my next three years.
College Junior,2,it depends on what u eat for the most part its bad
College Junior,2,They offer scholarships but the scholarships never cover the cost of tuition so you end up still having to either take out further loans or paying partially out of pocket. The financial aide people are not very helpful and have given me an attitude before for not understanding the process.
College Sophomore,2,"On an average night, there is almost nothing going on unless you make a trip to the lounge in your resident hall. However, there are nearby clubs in which you can pay to get in with an ID stating the age 0f 18 or older. The most popular evening to go on is Thursday, but drinks are fairly expensive and it costs 15 to enter.
Occasionally there are parties the University holds, nothing too late, and none too exciting. It's a dry campus, and if you're caught with weed or alcohol you can ""get kicked off campus or even out"".
There of course is still smoking and drinking.
There are fraternity parties, still not often, pay entry price and drink what you like. It's been $5 for me each time so far. I haven't heard of any sorority parties, and I'm in a fraternity."
College Senior,2,"Division II Sports â€“ The students have almost no school spirit, and sports are not very popular on campus. You have to look online to see when sporting events are."
College Senior,2,"Not Very Good â€“ The food on campus is repetitive and disgusting. The school has tried to improve the quality of their food, but students still get food-borne illnesses."
College Senior,2,"The campus is 70% women, so if you're a female or gay male, it is slightly hard to meet a potential mate. The looks of the students are nothing special. I have made friends but have found it hard to relate to many people."
College Senior,2,"While the nightlife on campus is terrible, there are several off-campus bars and clubs that students flock to, even though they are overpriced."
College Senior,2,"Social Scene Lacking â€“ The campus is predominantly a commuter school, which I find funny because many of the extracurriculars are at night, therefore not making them commuter-friendly"
College Senior,2,Nothing Special â€“ I haven't seen anything special in terms of guys yet.
College Senior,2,Performing Arts â€“ The Dance program at Adelphi is not the best.  The teachers are biased toward white students.  The quality of the professors is under par.
College Senior,2,Not Enough Vegetables â€“ The Dining Hall provides an abundance of starches.  Not enough vegetables and variety of salads.  Too much of the same foods.
College Sophomore,2,"Not the Best â€“ There are four places for students to eat on campus. The most popular is the University Center cafe, followed by the buffet style Post Hall, Starbucks, and a snack booth by the gym. The food is often healthy, and they change it up, but it never looks fresh. You do get sick of the provider that the school uses, called Lackmann. The price is ridiculous for the type of food you are eating, especially because it never looks good, and doesn't taste that great."
College Sophomore,2,"Crowded and Slow â€“ I was a commuter last year, so in order to get any work done, I had to use the labs. They were often crowded, and a little loud sometimes. My school is a predominantly commuter school. so there should really be more space for labs. I also didn't realize that printing could get so expensive. The network can often be slow, especially when there are a lot of people using it. If you are a resident, a laptop is a must. If you commute, you do not need to bring a personal computer every day, but if you know you have a deadline and you need to get work done, you should bring a computer for that day."
College Junior,2,"Biology Major â€“ I personally think some of the science professors want you to fail,but some actually want you to succeed."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Kind of Boring â€“ The nightlife at Adelphi University is very quiet, there is barely anything to do. At a certain time the campus gets really quiet, kind of like a ghost town."
College Sophomore,2,It really depends on what type of situation you find yourself in. The public safety department definitely handles each situation with care.
College Sophomore,2,"The Guys â€“ I came to this school hoping that it would be full of good looking, even HUNKY college men. what i found were fairly intelligent men (none above average that I've noticed) with basic every day looks and no real sex appeal. the best looking thing on campus is the foliage that blooms in the spring. another let down was the lack of black and latino men on campus. maybe in the coming semesters beauty will find its way onto the paths od Adelphi."
College Freshman,2,Sports Are Ok â€“ Sports at Adelphi are ok. Its difficult to know when a game is happening unless you log onto the schools sports website.
Junior,1,"If you are a person of color, I would not consider coming to this university. The financial department is very unhelpful when it comes to the resources needed to pay for your tuition. The university atmosphere from the students as well as the administrators is very unwelcoming."
Senior,1,"Online was a mess, ended up doing exceedingly more work than if I was in person for most classes. I actually learned nothing from online classes."
Senior,1,"Adelphi was the biggest mistake of my life and the biggest waste of money. Their professors are incompetent at best, the school is only so expensive because of the area and not the equality of education. Very hard to make friends, thereâ€™s no diversity that they like to boast, and the food is goddamn awful, with incredibly little vegan/vegetarian options. Adelphi should be ashamed of their professors and their faculty, especially the financial aid department, which is probably the most unhelpful department Iâ€™ve encountered. My education at community college was more enriching than Adelphi, which is priced almost at Ivy League."
Alum,1,"The school consists of mainly commuters, so the campus isnâ€™t too active on weekends.  People here say faculty members give you a personalized approach to learning, which is not always true.  Multiple professors and other faculty members Iâ€™ve  met here were actually very unapproachable."
Sophomore,1,"Honestly this school is lame, I went there for a year and honestly I canâ€™t believe how not fun this school was. A lot of people go to school expecting to make friends but this school is impossible to make friends since everyone is a commuter. Greek life is a joke and it doesnâ€™t make the school any better. Parties were always shot and the presence of the people is no company. Food sucks I lost 30 lbs, do not go to this school if you want a real college experience. Iâ€™m so grateful I transferred out of adelphi it was a waste of money."
College Sophomore,1,A lot of money is put towards athletics at the main campus but at the Hudson Valley campus they won't even offer a gym membership to us even though we pay for these facilities for other students!
College Sophomore,1,no one goes to sports games and the gym is nice but too small in my opinion
College Freshman,1,There's not too many options (especially for a vegetarian like me) and the quality is subpar.
College Freshman,1,I commute to school so I don't know that well but from what I've seen; there is nothing.
College Junior,1,The food SUCKS. Lackman is horrible....Learn to love fast food.
College Junior,1,"Once you join greek life, you forget who your other friends are."
College Senior,1,its expensive to live off campus and close to the school
College Junior,1,"Every year we are given a survey on the food on campus every one complains about it but every year we still get the same thing. There is no variety we get the same thing every week but they switch up the days so it can look like something new. There are no real healthy, vegan, kosher options."
College Junior,1,The people at the financial aid office are not willing to help you find any scholarships and they take forever to administer you your package
College Junior,1,There are more girls than guys
College Freshman,1,The parking here is terrible. The lot gets filled by commuters by 12pm and you could be driving around for 30 minutes to find a spot. A parking lot got taken away because there is a new building being built there.
College Freshman,1,There is no reasonable off campus housing for residents which is another bad thing about the area. Everything is very expensive. It would be nice for students to get reasonable apartments but that is very unlikely.
College Sophomore,1,its a hassle. they do not work with you and give little money
College Freshman,1,I was denied a scholarship that clearly stated that I needed above a 3.0 to receive and I met that requirement but because they thought it wasn't in the right way they decided not to give it to me now I owe them $5000 and I might not be able to return back to school
College Junior,1,"Getting to Adelphi is expensive regardless if you dorm. I personally train from Brooklyn To Long island everyday. and the cost for me averages almost 30$ a day so 150$ a week not including weekends that I have to attend because of my involvement on campus. I rarely find someone to car  pool with or know anyone who would want to take me all the way to Brooklyn as a good deed so i am basically on my own Monday thru Friday 5 am- 10 pm or even later, I an extra 3 hours after my class time just to try and get as much work as i can done utilizing the resources at my school because i do not have a laptop. So I have long days and very short nights."
College Junior,1,It is a small campus so limited professor at random time so if you claim a double major even a minor they times are very often not to your benefit but to the professor of course and the class availability my campus has. 
College Sophomore,1,The housing situation at Adelphi is not suitable for anyone to live in. I'm a sophomore and I have had over 30 bees in my room in the last 10 days. Last year a girl on my floor had a room infested with bees and that wasn't even in the same building as I'm in now. They seem to be unable to handle the problem. Do not live here
College Senior,1,The school has strict policies about drinking on campus. It is best to go out if you want to drink.
College Freshman,1,"The layout of the campus is aesthetically pleasing, although the student center isn't in the center of campus, but rather on one edge of it. It has the main cafeteria, although it's usually impossible to find a place to sit during lunch hours, with a decent food selection that unfortunately gets repetitive very fast, at a very expensive price. There's an art gallery and occasional events like a photobooth in the small lobby, and a cafe downstairs; but other than to eat or do homework there's nothing else that's really often offered there to entertain students. The recreation building was newly renovated and offers free fitness classes for students. One dorm (Chapmin) houses the green community where they try saving water and electricity, and there's also a mentor program in another. Only the two new dorms and one old one have elevators, and most have AC on at least 1 floor of the building. The campus empties out on weekends and often at night as well. Although there are clubs and greek life, it doesn't often seem that there's really much going on on campus. It seems to be the same people involved in multiple activities, and with so many commuters that attend it seems to feel more like a commuter school that accommodates residents."
College Freshman,1,"Pretty strict on drug and alcohol policies, especially in the residence halls. Campus police are always patrolling, they patrol the residence hall every couple hours, and there are lots of cameras all around campus. Parties are not a possibility in dorms. They are also really strict in visitation. For overnight guests you have to fill out a form two days in advance, you can only get into your own residence hall and have to be signed in to any other one you want to visit."
College Freshman,1,"if you are from a urban setting such as queens, brooklyn, hartford, boston, this school will be not be a good look. the social scene at adelphi sucks, unless you are in a clique, keep in mind you wont be in a clique because most of the people here went to high school together. its mostly rich white kids, and mostly females a good look for the few guys. and its mostly commuters so theres nothing to do unless you go to one of those dirty bars, like nachos and dizzys. man, as a urban kid i hate those bars, im use to the clubs and vibrant social scene, adelphi was the biggest regret of my life. ima freshman second semester."
College Junior,1,there are no guys and lots of girls that are lesbians
College Sophomore,1,"I came in with a small scholarship under the area of study I chose. I immediately knew I would need more financial aid so I quickly went over the the financial aid office. Not only are the workers completely unreliable when it comes down to calling back a phone call, but they aren't exactly helpful when you talk to them in person either. Still, another year later I am in the same position. It seems that popular opinion of the schools' financial aid is that Adelphi is not very giving. If you really need the aid I would highly suggest consistently pushing for more financial aid and meeting in person."
College Sophomore,1,"the parking here is very bad, the commuters who drive, arrive at least an hour or 30mins before their class.. i would say get here first thing in the morning"
College Senior,1,Very Supervised â€“ Public safety and the administration treats students like they're kids. One major aspect is the dry campus atmosphere; the campus does not allow alcohol anywhere (even for 21+ students). Look elsewhere if you're looking for an environment where you can drink (at least if you're 21 or over).
College Senior,1,The parties on campus are boring.  I'd rather go to clubs off campus
College Sophomore,1,"the lots at adelphi are always packed since this is such a small campus and a small college. parking spaces are so tiny that you hae to come sideways out of your car most days because the next person has taken up every available inch of their space. this isannoying and lave potential for alot of dens and scrapes on your beautiful paint job. you better get a parking decal or you'll be charged a $25 fine for parking in the lot which sucks especially when you're a student who pays the $15,000 tuition each semester."
College Sophomore,1,"Where Is Public Safety? Marijuana usage is very big on our Adelphi Campus. They say that we are a dry and drug free campus, yet they provide transportation to clubs that provide alcohol. People have gone to hospitals because of over doses. So sad"
College Sophomore,1,"COMMUTER TAKE OVER â€“ 70% of the Adelphi campus are communters. 20% of the residents go home on the weekend, and the other 5% are sleeping in there dorm all weekend, needless to say there is no nightlife."
College Sophomore,1,"Garden City â€“ Cute town for family, horrible for college students. Have to travel at least 10 mins to get anywhere decent(bars), always by cab"
College Freshman,1,"Not Worth It â€“ the cost is alot (11,000) and more for the nicer dorms. the older dorms are full of new RA's who follow every rule to a T. campus is DEAD on weekends because everyone goes home. but the people who do live on campus are awesome and it's a great experience"
College Sophomore,1,"the financial aid people are so rude and not helpful at all, they messed up my financial aid this semester and I think it's probably because my mom always calls up and complains to them."
College Sophomore,1,It's a dry campus and they're serious about it. People get caught drinking in their room and they have to go to alcohol counseling if they continue to get caught they get kicked out of housing.
College Sophomore,1,"As with every college campus, parking is extremely limited. Especially since most of the people who live on campus have their own cars. So they usually get the best spots and the commuters are stuck fighting for spots. The spots are also very tiny and most people have trouble parking INSIDE the lines so if someone is even on top of the line it makes it very difficult to park in the spot next to them. Optimal time for getting a parking spot is after dark... when most classes are already over. OR before 9am."
College Freshman,1,the experience that i had with financial aid was a complete headache. you have to be very careful with what you are given because they like to take things away and then you have to pay out of pocket. its a hassle!

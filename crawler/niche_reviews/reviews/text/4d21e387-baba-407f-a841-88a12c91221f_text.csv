Alum,5,"Being a Wildlife Conservation and Management student at HSU was a wonderful experience for me. I graduated in 2016 so there may have been changes in the program since then, but I felt the program to in-depth and engaging! All of the faculty was amazing, classes were fun and challenging, the science community on campus was supportive and welcoming. I especially loved the lab portion of class and spending times in the beautiful natural landscapes Arcata and Humboldt County have to offer. I really like going to a smaller university and being able to form lasting connections with my professors and peers. Nothing beats being able to study what you are passionate about while being surrounded by gorgeous Redwood Forests and The Arcata Marsh. Smaller campus, small university and smaller town than many of the big UC's and other Cal State's but it makes for a cozy, charming town where you see someone you know around every corner."
Alum,5,"I didn't taken any courses online, but I have heard from friends that online learning works great for them."
Senior,5,Lots of work! Spent over 10 hours on the desk! I recommend doing part-time if anything. All classes in Spring including Fall semester will be online. I am taking Organic Chemistry part 2 and I am not looking forward to the amount of work transitioning into online.
Senior,5,"Love the area and weather. It is usually raining or cloudy! 
There are a lot of clubs and activities to join. The food isn't great in the J, I recommend eating at the smaller diner, but they do close early and are not open on the weekend. Price for meal points is pricy for the food we receive. Lots of walking even if you live on campus! If you live on the northern side of campus there is a nice trail in the back that winds around the campus and brings you to the south side. There is a creek called Jolly Giant! Overall I really loved the campus. For Chem and Bio they need an update on equipment!"
Senior,5,"A wonderful campus, great classes especially in the natural sciences, a beautiful area. I lived in the area for more than twenty years. The campusis set in the forest with lots of hiking trails and clean air and nearby ocean."
Senior,5,"I did my entire summer semester online and it was fairly easy to use Canvas and communicate with teachers. Taking biology and lab online was interesting and intense. Now that we have to do a lot of online learning, I felt the setup and schedule was great and very doable. I also took a number of classes many years ago when I lived in Arcata and enjoyed the campus but especially Center Arts and all the great artists that came to town to perform."
Niche User,5,"Living in southern california is like living in a sauna. Always hot and humid, when I first arrived to Humboldt I was in love. The cool breeze and chilly weather was what I craved all these years. Humboldt is definetly where I belong, the scenery is just so beautiful. Perfect for hiking and long walks with family. Now the campus, where housing lies is incredible, right outside your window is the beautiful trees and fog that gives you that cozy feeling many get around the holidays."
Junior,5,I love moving from the concrete jungle to the forest. I would like to see the idea that the town is strictly for stoners destigmatized.
Junior,5,During covid-19 I transitioned to online for the remainder of my classes; all my professors rose to the challenge and made it an easy transition in a hard time
Sophomore,5,"It was normal and helpful, my professors were really understanding during these times and they were not so harsh."
Sophomore,5,"Friendly and knowledgeable professors, wonderful scenic campus.  Where better to study nature than a University sandwiched between the redwoods and the ocean."
Alum,5,"I truly enjoyed my whole experience at HSU. I loved the campus and the surrounding community. The campus was supportive and inclusive. A considerable problem academically, I did not like some instructors teaching methods. I loved most of the instructors at HSU because they would present information with passion and would be incredibly supportive. 

A student should have more of a guarantee to do well when they put in the time and effort. For some classes, it would take hours of extra resources, including Youtube. Tutoring or lecture was not a huge help. That should never be allowed. Last that I have heard is the problems that I encountered were no longer present."
Alum,5,"Humboldt State University is a wonderful and culturally diverse campus that offers their students the opportunity to participate in research, develop lifelong connections with peers, and establish foundations towards professional careers."
Freshman,5,"This campus is beautiful, just like the surrounding area. Just as it said on the website, the classes are very personal and teaching styles are unique. There are more than enough on-campus support systems for students, including aid for Dream-Act students. Consistently, the atmosphere has been accepting. Other colleges I went to didn't have such a strong and close-knit community of people readily available. The only drawback is the huge amount of stairs but everything else far outweighs any of that."
Junior,5,Coming to HSU having interest in the arts I fell in love with the art program here. It is a small community that supports each other and creates great art!
Junior,5,"I was a student athlete at Humboldt State University. The athletic program was a great way to connect to people on campus. Humboldt offers classes that are really interesting and the teachers are not only fun and interesting, but they know what they are teaching and seem to really enjoy their jobs. I lived in the dorms on campus, I wasn't close to people in the dorms, but I enjoyed the 4 person suite that I lived in. The food was actually really good as well. As an athlete, I needed to eat a lot of healthy food and I had plenty of options with a salad and fruit bar."
Freshman,5,"Its an amazing school, it is a beautiful place to be at. It's great for people who like small towns and who are not a big fan of big cities. The outdoors are spectacular."
Niche User,5,"Very beautiful! One of the best schools I've been interested in, myself being a high school senior wanting to attend."
Alum,5,"Humboldt State provides quality education and truly caring professors among the backdrop of a beautiful campus and friendly community. Not only does HSU seek to provide a top-tier education, it also seeks to aid in the transition from adolescent to adult life for each of its students. This combination made for a beneficial and enjoyable investment of my time and money."
Sophomore,5,"I love Humboldt State. I have been going to school here for a year and some change and absolutely love it. I thoroughly enjoy having my largest class be only 80 people and my smallest class about 15 students. Knowing my professors names and them knowing mine has made me realize how imperative making connections is to the college experience. Being able to interact with my classmates and have group project assignments in class is essential. Also, Our campus is so tight that I can get to classes across campus in 10 minutes if i needed to. I have learned a lot and become very aware of issues on campus and in Humboldt county from getting involved in group gathering with friends I've made at HSU."
Sophomore,5,"I liked how the campus was big on diversity and there are multiple housing options that you can choose from. I  like that the campus is big and very green and clean. I like that the campus provides a verity of choices when it comes to food and the way you and you're not forced to eat a certain way, and they even have a no meet day for people that don't eat meat."
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere that being surrounded by the nature provides is very calming, a walk in the forest helps to de stress. Everyone is very kind and accepting, and there are many on campus resources that help out students a lot."
Freshman,5,There's a lovely community of students and teachers and they have great programs in music and life sciences. They also offer majors that can be hard to find such as Zoology and Wildlife. A small population surrounded by thousands of redwood trees and it's not too far from the coast.
Alum,5,"One of the most beautiful places in the world, Humboldt was the best place I could have ever gone. It is a wonderful place to come into your own person, make friends, and be immersed in California's unbeatable nature."
Alum,5,"Professors encouraged students to learn interactively and think outside the box.  Classes were creative, hands-on and philosophical.  I appreciate how this university refined my critical thinking skills."
Niche User,5,I love the scenery of the college. The people are very nice there. The programs that the college offers is absolutely amazing.
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere of the town and all the trees, there is a lot of stairs so you always are fit."
Junior,5,"I fell in love with Humboldt the minute I stepped on campus. Fairly isolated but still only 1.5 hours from Oregon and surrounded by beautiful forests and right by the ocean, there really is just so much to love about Humboldt. Arcata is easily the best area around there with the local businesses and people having such a great vibe about them (eureka, Mckinleyville and others arent too shabby as well). The perspective of the professors is completely unique to anything I’ve ever experienced- even their business programs revolve around environmental ethics and sustainability in order to build a better future in all areas of expertise! I highly recommend Humboldt State University to anyone that loves being outdoors, wants to see change in the world, and can go long periods of time without chain restaurants (Chilis, Chipotle, etc.) since we only have various, popular fast food but BETTER local restaurants!"
Alum,5,I completed the 3 year nursing program and have been successful in my nursing career. I had excellent instructors and mentors who steered me through the many options of nursing fields to fit my skill set and personality. The environment and other students were very supportive and open. The facilities are state of the art and the instructors are top-notch!
Sophomore,5,I love having professors who care as much about your success as you do. There's also a variety of resources that are very helpful in this stage of life.
Graduate Student,5,I enjoy being a graduate student and community member at and around Humboldt State. The natural surroundings are beautiful and lend to a unique learning environment. Humboldt State needs to make a better effort to promote diversity and connections between community and students.
Niche User,5,The thing that I like about this University is how big it is  and how beautiful it is. I really like this university because of how the campus is and mostly because they have good academics in this college. I would not change anything at all because everything looks perfect.
Junior,5,HSU is a very eco-friendly school and the steps that have been taken all around campus to help reduce the carbon footprint is really impressive. Being an Environmental Resources Engineering major I appreciate the environmentally aware culture at the school.
Sophomore,5,"I just completed my first year, and honestly it was the best year of my life. Everyone was so friendly, the campus is amazing, to truly see how wonderful it is you have to see it for yourself."
Sophomore,5,"The attitude the professors have at Humboldt State University is what I noticed first. Evey professor I had was always attentive, open to questions, friendly, and above all were open to helping students one on one. The class sizes as well are also great--usually about 20-40 people-- and that allows a better learning environment where questions are easier to ask. Lastly, the students and staff do their best to maintain a safe environment on campus for the students."
Sophomore,5,The school has a chill environment with great teachers. Most people have an open minded and friendly personality. It has a beautiful campus and it is in an area full of nature.
Sophomore,5,"Humboldt State University is an amazing school that is filled with new experiences to be had. It accepts everyone no matter their race, gender, and/or sexuality. It has amazing teachers that truly want their students to excel."
Freshman,5,"Humboldt is a great and cheap school! The school is on a big hill overlooking Humboldt Bay, surrounded by ancient redwoods and tons of wildlife. The area is beautiful and the tuition is the lowest of all the CSU's!"
Alum,5,"I transferred to Humboldt State as a Junior in the Psychology and Early Childhood Development departments. During my five semesters there I participated in clubs, on and off campus events, and later graduated with a bachelors in Psychology. Humboldt state offered amazing professors with unique experience in the field and within the local community. Class sizes are so small that professors know all their students' names. The University offers both on campus and online courses. Taking classes in-person means you get to stroll beside the redwood forest, whose trails often get students across campus quicker than hallways. Humboldt State's campus is a magical place to be at sunset on game day for Lumberjack Football games. What feels like the entire town fills the stadium and the sound of chainsaws fill the air. There is no University in California quite like Humboldt State. This tiny school nestled in the redwoods is a refreshing break from the big bustling cities down south."
Freshman,5,"Humboldt was my first option, the closest school to home, the natural environment, and the animal science program they have available."
Freshman,5,M experience so far at HSU has been excellent. I have nothing bad to say at all. The campus is beautiful and i love it here.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Humboldt state has been great. The teachers are very committed and passionate about the fields they teach. The campus is absolutely gorgeous, its surrounded by a luscious forest that has been the backdrop to various movies like Jurrasic Park and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. They offer various styles of dorm living for freshmen; the hill, cypress, and canyon. Best advice for incoming freshmen is to apply for cypress hits more of apartment style living. However the other dorms are suitable as well. If you like the coastal cloudy weather, Rain and a very eco conscious community Humboldt state would be good for you."
Freshman,5,"I love the area in which the college is located in! There is so much nature around us. It is almost a completely new world compared to my previous hometown. The people here are also amazing! A vast majority of the people here are really kind to one another. It is no surprise to me anymore when someone simply walking by smiles and says ""Hello!"" The educators and staff members are very involved in student's education. They care about them and help them succeed throughout their experience at Humboldt State. This is definitely a one of a kind college that I would recommend to anyone, especially those from Southern California!"
Freshman,5,"I have really grown to love this campus, it was something that I have always wanted, a small college town where I can really showcase who I am and be true to myself. My experience so far has been amazing, I made completely new friends that I love so much. My journalism classes are great and I am very excited to learn more about it. The professors that I have are so nice and really easy to talk to. I love everything about my environment, I think this is what I really needed if I am being honest, being surrounded by nature makes me feel better, I honestly feel so refreshed every time I walk outside. This is a wonderful college with a diverse community and excellent student life."
Niche User,5,"The outdoor life and communication of this university is unbelievable. There are many connections between the students. You are also very close to many great resources such and the ocean, which is helpful to students interested in a major toward marine life."
Junior,5,What I like about Humboldt State University is the opportunity given to me to complete my BA degree 100% online. So far I wouldn’t change anything.
Junior,5,"I've had a great experience so far. It's a bit odd but it's valuable to me. The teaching and curriculums are a bit lacking due to young staff, but if you work hard, it's a good education."
Junior,5,"This school offers a diverse array of courses in a stunningly scenic rural town that is unique from any other. With a focus on diversity, tolerance, environmental issues, and sustainability, Humboldt State is a hidden gem."
Niche User,5,Visited the campus and was welcomed by friendly faculty and crisp clean air. They have an outdoor program competition which involves students and gets them motivated to go explore the vast surroundings
Freshman,5,"I come from an urban city environment. So imagine the culture shock I experience with residents being so friendly. The teachers are very helpful. They only wish to learn new skills and put them to use. Humboldt State provides enough activities for a student to accomplish anything they desire. Also, it is a charming place to live in. This college really cares about their students."
Freshman,5,Great campus. Very beautiful. Loving everything about it so far. Food on campus is great and fairly priced.
Sophomore,5,Humboldt State University is a great school. The campus is beautiful and the weather is great (if you like colder weather). There are many things to do such as go to the beach or take a walk in the community forest. Humboldt is perfect for environmental science majors. Everyone seems friendly.
Freshman,5,I am currently enrolled as a freshman and when I went to visit I didn't really know what to expect because google doesn't have the best pictures but wow. The campus is incredibly green and beautiful and I am so excited to move ins next month
Alum,5,"Humboldt State is the place to go! I loved the experiences and people I met there. It is an open minded school with a student oriented atmosphere. Further, the school is locked between the beautiful ocean and vast, historical redwoods. I lived all over Arcata and was still only a 30 minute walk to campus. Fun facts: the town only has 4 bars, the center of town lacks electric stop lights, and on a summer night, one can literally lay in the streets and look up at the stars. This is a school to truly experience life at."
Junior,5,"Small student to teach ratio. Easy to get in contact and meet with professors or advisors. Lots of hands on experience for science majors including wildlife, biology, zoology, and more."
Freshman,5,"When someone says you see something new in Humboldt everyday, they are not joking. From the ever lasting redwoods to the fresh ocean smell, you will automatically feel happy while walking around campus. The communications department is truly family and have some of the best communications advisors that I willing to help you with personal or academic struggles. Once in Humboldt it feels as though a little part of you will always miss it."
Alum,5,My life was forever changed from going here. I am the person I am today because of this school. It is not for everybody and I HIGHLY recommend you visit before you commit to going. If you take initiative and get involved you will go places.
Junior,5,It's a beautiful campus with friendly people. The local community is small and everyone knows each other. There is nowhere else on earth like here.
Sophomore,5,"The area of Humboldt State University's campus is absolutely breathtaking. There are few places to take in the glory of Redwood Trees and HSU is planted right next to them. Not only are the sights wonderful, HSU also has a great student life that is greatly diverse and inclusive. They take the time to set up programs and talks towards people of every background. I'd also like to stay that the academics are very fruitful and allow students for a range of options, but also options that are unique to HSU."
Niche User,5,"My experience at Humboldt State was absolutely amazing. I loved the people, I got tours of the whole campus, and I loved the views of the redwood Forrest and the ocean. The location of the school is just absolutely perfect."
Alum,4,"I Liked all my classes and  professors. The dorms were nice and the campus is beautiful. If you like the rain, this is a school for you."
Alum,4,even though some of the class were big the professor were still attentive and helpful. when ever you need help they were willing to help you.
Alum,4,"I took one online class and two hybrid classes, both were well organized and professors were quick to respond to emails if clarification was needed. The university also uses canvas to post readings and assignments which in my opinion is very easy to navigate"
Alum,4,"I enjoyed that it is a small school with a small population and class sizes. It made it super easy to build connections with professors and peers. I feel that many of the students in my major and minor had multiple classes together which was a great way to make friends. I also felt there was a high quality of education especially  since most professors were available to one on one time when students needed it. There are also a number of clubs and events on campus to get involved in. The cons of going to school here is that it is located in a very small town which is a huge change coming from a big city. There are limited activities to do and it is not much of a ""party school"" but there is plenty of nature, forests, rivers, and hiking making the spring and summer AMAZING."
Niche User,4,Online courses are not the same as being there but it is still fun to be a part of. The teachers and staff are so helpful and kind.
Sophomore,4,"I will concede that HSU is a very specific taste of a university, I want to start by stating that I loved my first year at this university. It is in a great location, everything around here is beautiful, the people are also great. The biggest thing I have to say is that the professors are something special. Most classes are very small so you get to have more of a relationship with your professors and most will know you by name. These people are there for you, not because they are paid to, which is the general idea of most professors are larger colleges. HSU professors want to see you succeed and will go to far lengths to aid you in you achieving your goals."
Sophomore,4,"With this whole COVID thing that happened I was forced to take most of my second semester online. This was not as bad as I had expected as the professors were similar to how they were in person, they want you to do good and recognize that this is different and new as well as challenging so they did all they could to help me succeed."
Alum,4,"There are a decent number of online general ed courses to free up your day to day schedule, meaning your time can be better spent focusing on your major courses instead."
Alum,4,"Humboldt is one of the more affordable areas in California, meaning you can apply your time to studying instead of working. The professors tend to fit in with the local area, meaning they are unique and creative. If you want all of the better aspects of a small private liberal arts school at state school prices, Humboldt is the place."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the small class sizes at HSU and the support I received from faculty. I do wish that funding wasn't cut towards our football team and local radio station- both of these played a huge role in this rural community. Also, HSU is not as inclusive as they say they are."
Alum,4,"Caring faculty, wonderful setting, vivid community on and off campus. If you cherish the arts, the outdoors, and have a passion for environmental issues, this might be the place where you're perfectly supported to strive academically, too!"
Freshman,4,Humboldt State University is a beautiful and eco-friendly school. I personally loved Humboldt for the scenery as well as how small the classes can be ensuring that it is easier to focus and fell comfortable. The people who attend Humboldt are also very open and creative.
Junior,4,"There are some issues here with the school not being representative with their positions of power at the school, where administrative positions are given to tenure faculty as opposed to Native and Indigenous people, even though HSU is on their land."
Alum,4,"HSU is located in what I would consider one of the most beautiful places in the world. If you are outdoorsy then there will be plenty to do in the area between hiking in the forest, going to the beautiful beaches, driving an hour to the mountains and much more. If you like the city then this might not be the school for you. The academics side of it offer small class sizes where your professors know you on a first name basis for the most part. Most of the professors care about helping you succeed. The school is not very academically rigorous but if you put the effort in you can learn what you need. Because it is in a small town in the middle of nowhere, opportunities to work in well respected companies are slim while at school."
Freshman,4,Humboldt State is a very open-minded environment. I also like how close I am to the beaches and the Redwoods. There are many outdoor opportunities
Alum,4,I really enjoyed being able to have access to professors and work with folks in my community who were really about their passions. I wish the local community in Arcata (the small town where HSU is located) would be more welcoming and inviting to the college students. I also wish they would have more resources for students of color.
Freshman,4,"As a first year freshman Humboldt State is a gorgeous campus. From the tall, green, redwood trees, the beautiful beaches, and the local hiking trails. The campus is a really close tied community where students want to make a change in the community. So far the professors I've encountered have been great. They care about their students success and future. The campus is environmentally friendly. There is always something to do both on and off campus other than academics. One can join clubs, and do volunteering services."
Niche User,4,"Humboldt is a very great University and it gives a lot of scholarships to locals, which i think is very very great. I am an exchange student and I have seen the campus. I think it is not bad at all. Although they do not have a dorm, which i think might be a major problem for non-local students"
Junior,4,"A great school in a beautiful location! The teachers are invested in their student's success, but aren't afraid to push them with difficult classes."
Freshman,4,"Overall I love this campus. Although you will find stairs no matter where you look. The academics are okay, though I am a freshman and haven't experienced very much but the classes I have had are very good."
Freshman,4,"My campus is great, it's in a beautiful place surrounded by the redwoods. There's several amazing resources the campus has to offer. Coming from out of state I felt instantly welcomed, as the campus is very inclusive to all races, genders and sexuality. The classes are small and the teachers and staff care about the students. This semester is my first, and it's been a crazy one. There have been two power outages so far where most of our campus was closed and out of power, however due to our backup generators they were able to provide electricity to some of the resident halls, hold movie nights and other activities in a common area, and they had free food to all students.
HSU also offers a variety of clubs, some of the ones I'm involved in are the mycology club, rock climbing club, natural resources club and I also volunteer most Fridays at CCAT, an on campus technology and sustainability area, where I usually participate helping out in the garden, cleaning up, etc."
Senior,4,"I love the opportunity for working directly with plants and being hands-on with my studies, as well as having an intimate connection with nature. The community is focused on ecological remediation as well as creative, food centered ideals allowing students to grow into well-rounded individuals."
Sophomore,4,"Humboldt State has a beautiful campus, being surrounded by the outdoors and being in a small community really gets you to open up and explore yourself."
Junior,4,HSU has a good academic program with professors who are passionate about their areas of study. The on campus organizations are working hard to bring more diversity and justice to the campus.
Junior,4,My experience at humboldt state university has been great so far. Prior to coming to this school I was not planning on going to college and I am very glad I made the decision to come here.
Junior,4,"This school has the most gorgeous campus. It is a small school, so there is a great faculty to student ratio. The science programs are great and sought after. It is a great school and the only major issue is parking."
Sophomore,4,"it is an amazing experience. it is beautiful and calming. amazing staff and professors. however, we did lose a handful of students which was alarming..."
Niche User,4,Hiking and lots of outdoors sports and activities to do and everyone I've met is friendly. The people here are very friendly which is unlike the big city where people don't care about you. It's a great place to just find yourself and discover who you are as a person and student.
Sophomore,4,HSU is the place to be for all environmentalists! The program is amazing and you get so many hands-on opportunities. The forest is in our backyard too with tons of vegan/eco-friendly restaurants nearby.
Junior,4,"There's a lot to say about the naturistic, and scenic aspect of Humboldt State--it is covered with enormous trees, a diverse species of vivacious plants, and even animals such as deers and banana slugs. It almost feels as magical as taking the courses here at HSU. The campus is constantly transforming. Students and faculty would organize events and seminars during the weekend to raise awareness of the injustice of the world, learn to dismantle the systemic issues and how to take action to live in a compassionate, just-world. Additionally, one of the things I cherish and hold close to my heart is the relationship of the professors and students; they'll get to know you and guide you in any way that works for you. They'll also make the lectures engaging and very accessible. I've seen that visiting their office hours is very important but also worthwhile! It is a wonderful time to at least introduce yourself, learn more about your major and future trajectory."
Senior,4,"Humboldt State is located in a unique, rural area. The views around the area are absolutely breathtaking. Most of the instructors tend to have close relationships with students and make a point to know your name. The instructors here are also very understanding if you need help or an extension. Humboldt State provides many services available to students in need. However, as it is a white-dominated campus I would hope for a more diverse pool of student. Altogether, Humboldt is a great college for students who really want to focus on academics and stray from distractions."
Sophomore,4,"Humboldt is a small school in the town of Arcata. It is not a good fit for those who enjoy the city since the environment consists of the redwood forest and three small nearby towns. The classrooms are small so you get the opportunity to get to know your professors. Housing is an issue both on and off campus, though the student body is very open and welcoming."
Alum,4,"Good school for those interested in natural resources, biology, and wildlife. If you are more into extracurricular outdoor recreation this is also a great school for that!"
Graduate Student,4,"HSU is in a great location, between the redwoods and the ocean it does not get much better than that! The academics at HSU are also outstanding. One of the best schools you can attend."
Freshman,4,"Between the Redwood forests and the California coast, the natural environment in this area is truly stunning. Most of the professors I have had are fully dedicated to teaching their classes and supporting student success. They're pretty cool people. Student life is kind of non-existent and campus is dead on the weekends. Fortunately, there is so much to do off campus that it isn't much of an issue. A lot of interesting people up here, including stoners-- especially the freshman. Residence halls are not very pleasant to live in if you don't smoke or drink, but that's typical. I wouldn't recommend attending this school if you aren't either a science, theater arts,  or music major."
Freshman,4,"Great campus. Beach and forrest vibes. But this school isn't for everyone though, if you don't mind being in a small community in the middle of a forrest then go to it."
Freshman,4,"The campus itself is breathtakingly beautiful, and the classes tend to be on the smaller side so you have  a good relationship with the professor. Unfortunately the location is out of the way of everything so you feel extremely cut off."
Junior,4,I am an environmental studies major and I love my experience here. You have to be a self starter and you have to be independent.
Sophomore,4,Humboldt State has a great student to staff ratio and I always feel like they are actively interacting with me as an individual student. The food is a little sucky but they make up for it sometimes. The dorms can be bad at times
Freshman,4,"I love this school very much. The campus is great, there's lots to see. The program for marine biology and oceanography is very good and the environment is lovely. The professors are great. The food is fine. The biggest issue is dorming because only freshman get guaranteed housing."
Junior,4,I like how I was in a different area. The university was surrounded near trees with a bay near by. Made me get up and explore than stay in the house staring at a tv.
Niche User,4,"The website is easy to navigate. I could find all my queries and questions answered. The aesthetic coincides well with the theme of the college,, it has a very nice green hue that reminds my of the towering redwoods and sequoias that surround the campus. The icons to navigate the website are very bright and large so an individual can navigate without trouble. there are links to the costumer service email un case you have any questions the usual wait time for a response is about a day. the number is also posted in case you want to call."
Niche User,4,i visited the college a week ago and it was more than what i expected. The campus is very nice with many trees and very natural. the area and surrounding is very unique. The diversity is strong and they have a good environmental program for people interested in majoring in environment. The food is good and the professors are nice. the school is mid size which is a big plus.
Niche User,4,"Well I am not a student attending, however being a high school senior I felt obligated to go and see colleges. Immediately Humboldt seemed like a wise choice, many of the older friends attended. Also, it is a CSU. When visiting the college I was in complete awe. The temperature was perfect, the scenery was beautiful, and the college is a nice size. Honestly the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the town- Acadia. I is 1000% hippie town, and it has such a weird old fashion 70's vibe to it. But if you like that then GO HEAD!"
Senior,4,"It's a fine school, kind of out of the way in terms of location. Came in as a transfer student, and have so far had a fair experience."
Sophomore,4,"I've had some amazing professors here, but I've also had some truly terrible teachers and lecturers."
Sophomore,4,My experience was very good academic wise. The professors are there to help you and want you to succeed. I enjoyed the weather and nature it was very relaxing.
Senior,4,"From Humboldt State University, it has a great outdoors experience. Our school is known for its high recommendations for any science majors and math majors. I am a Zoology major and my best part of the university is the class where I go out of school with my class to field trip and identify different invertebrate animals near our shores. It was fun and a good leg work out too! Also, the local areas for food is quite amazing. When needing to eat besides campus food, there is a wide variety of different ethnic food here. What I like to see a change in Humboldt is to give a more housing chances for students that are from far away. More housing in the campus for everyone to be. It is tough to find an apartment or house near the school and have the housing costs to be low, for future students coming from different parts of California or an out of state transfer, they should have the opportunity to have a low-cost housing and a secure home to be in."
Senior,4,"The school and surround area is very open and welcoming to all students. The community and people are very friendly and willing to help.  I decided to live on campus and every time I had to go grocery shopping, people would offer to help carry my groceries. This was something new to me for where I came from, neighbors would not do this.  The staff and teacher as well  are willing to go beyond to help their students succeed. They are open and willing to meet outside their office hours to help students."
Junior,4,Humboldt State has small class sizes which means that the professors know all of their students and really try to help you in any way they can.
Freshman,4,It is a very nice environment with a lot of interesting people and weather. Everyone is very friendly and nothing is really bad.
Freshman,4,The experience is amazing there’s a lot of fun opportunities available for students to have and professors are dedicated to helping students there’s also a lot of available resources for students to access
Junior,4,"the atmosphere and small community are the best aspects of this school. There is only about 7k students, so the student:teacher ration is excellent!"
Freshman,4,Humboldt is an amazing school! You are surrounded by beautiful redwood trees and a beautiful coastline! The professors here from my own experience are very genuine and kind hearted individuals! It's considered a some what small university which benefitted me because with a smaller student population the number of students in a classroom is much smaller. Which benefited me because I was able to make a solid personal connection with most of my professors!
Freshman,4,I'm a freshmen here and so far the experience is great. I have so many great memories with my friends. The students I met are nice. I've met a lot of students that are from The Bay area and southern california. The professors I had are super great. They will want to know your name and they want to help you.
Sophomore,4,"Humboldt State University is one of the best schools for natural resources, environmental studies, and environmental issues. Out in the middle of nowhere, the college of hills and trees is remote but within walking distance of Arcata. The school does what it can to promote sustainability and environmental protection. Would recommend for natural sciences but not so much for other majors unless you are particularly interested in the nearby environment. Drug and alcohol use are high, but no more so than at other colleges. Parties are more private, off campus, while on campus there is more enforcement. Academically there is a variety with some professors being excellent while others work to push you to do better."
Freshman,4,"Humboldt State is so, so beautiful. The students and faculty members such as the professors/ instructors are so friendly, compassionate, and knowledgeable. Being here allowed me to understand more about the current social, political and environmental events. I am most definitely exposed to the world we live in."
Freshman,4,"I love the scene at this university it's a beautiful campus with lots of eager and helpful professors that make class enjoyable, what i think this campus could work on is the amount of diversity, but do believe its doing so this year seeing the amount of  new comers."
Niche User,4,"beautiful campus, and very connected to the environment! Their students are high achievers and im looking forward to going there next year"
Senior,4,"The pricing is good, the opportunities are great, and the campus is beautiful. You make great connections and have amazing networking opportunities."
Junior,2,Humboldt State University is a terrible campus under the current administration. It has the potential to become a great university if there was investment and focus on student education. I would like to see a new dean and more people of color taking administrative jobs.
College Junior,2,"There really is no greek life. More of ""clubs"" that sororities or fraternities."
College Freshman,2,"Humboldt county is the Marijuana capital of the world,"
College Freshman,2,They do not market internships or jobs often at all.
College Freshman,2,We have a couple frats and sororities. Its not really where you want to be though.
College Freshman,2,"Mold everywhere and the washers smell like mold, very moist place in Humboldt."
College Sophomore,2,You're in Humboldt county weed is ver accessible but do not fall into peer pressure
College Freshman,2,Not very much Greek Life available and the ones available aren't very good.
College Freshman,2,I feel for housing we pay to much money and we don't get very much space. I would give housing a higher rating if we had bigger rooms and all around more breathing space.
College Junior,2,"my experience was terrible. thank god i had a single room.

however i have heard from many people that they loved it."
College Junior,2,"Many upper division courses are only available for 1 time with only 1 professor teaching the class. 

Not many online courses are offered. 

I noticed that this campus does not offer enough studying areas for students. The library is outdated, small and cannot fit all HSU students during finals week. 

Registration is not great either, but that's the school's intention. 

Workload of classes is expected and not rigorous."
College Junior,2,"It's bad, especially in the dorm I was in. The first day I moved in, the rooms and hallway reeked of mold. Stay away from the first 2 floors of cypress."
College Junior,2,"As an incoming freshmen I expected the many suggested resources; very few were actually offered. 

This school feels like a scam. I question the value of education I'm receiving. 

however the forest is great and my labs take place there. I can't complain about that. 

It sucks how almost everyone is either a stoner or hippie. And I really wish there were more students and faculty of color on this campus. As a non white person at HSU, I can't help but feel uncomfortable and reminded that I'm not white. 

This school lacks a lot of mind stimulating substance.. compared to a few local colleges I attended before transferring. 

The worst part about the area: all the food is terrible and too pricey.

Best part: I can graduate in 4 years."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is not important at school. No one except for the greeks really care about greek life. There will be the occasional party but not very often.
Recent Alumnus,2,Our campus it not open to diversity
College Sophomore,2,"As a student of color, my Humboldt experience was pretty racist, within the city of Arcata, and within the University...."
College Junior,2,"it's funny how kids come to this school because they think it is a party school, it is not. We actually care about our education."
College Sophomore,2,"I am not much of a partier, but even I know that the parties suck, they are very intimate and claustrophobic."
College Sophomore,2,"Humboldt is its own world. They claim to be very strict, but most of the time no one cares enough to do anything."
Recent Alumnus,2,I did not receive any financial aid because I'm an out of state student
College Freshman,2,"Its hard to find a party, cops usually shut them down quickly. House or dorm parties are the way to go, but even then its poor.No Greek life."
College Junior,2,"The campus is small, an considering it is a college town it is not difficult for parties to be busted quickly."
College Junior,2,"There are only three places where you can eat on campus, well maybe more if you consider the other places that sell snacks. I believe that since the school is admitting more students, they need to also expand parking and cafeterias. You will get tired eating at The J if you live on campus. I work on campus at the depot and the food there is probably the most popular on campus. There aren't a lot of vegan, gluten free, on campus even though the school has been recognized for it. P.S. I'm not either of those, I am a sometimes vegetarian."
College Freshman,2,House parties get shut down pretty fast and are pretty hard to get to unless you have a mode or transportation which most students don't have. It is really unsafe to walk at night in the Arcata community (especially if you're female) so parties are mainly packed with dudes that get pretty drunk and WILL make you feel uncomfortable. Dorm parties are just a bad idea in general because people get pretty rowdy and if something is damaged then you have to pay for it. It is better to just have a small get together with your friends instead of going out.
College Sophomore,2,the party scene is not that great you will only find kickbacks and never something you can really call a party. the only time to party is halloween.
College Freshman,2,"Parties happen but are overcrowded and get shut down quickly. The drugs on campus seems excessive, especially hallucinogens. Humboldt is not all that big of a party school but mainly a chill environment where many people can get together in the forest, in the dorms, or off campus and find a way to have a good time. I personally found it hard to find people who did not do drugs as a usual thing."
College Freshman,2,Difficult to find a party.
College Sophomore,2,The town is too small and does not accommodate the college life. Humboldt is too far from everything and gloomy as well. Retention is hard to keep here
College Sophomore,2,There is a greek life but its just beginning. The following is small and the greek life is not popular.
College Sophomore,2,"College is expensive and I have to take out private loans.  There are fees that are straight up ridiculous.  This isn't just at Humboldt though, or California, it is this country at large, this entire system that puts young people in debt for wanting an education."
College Junior,2,If you're not of age to go to a bar then you're out trying to find house parties that were probably already raided 10 minutes ago. Best nightlife here is to spend it having fun with your own group of friends that you trust.
College Junior,2,There could be more food places open late. The hours in time are poor because they are run by local businesses. Where's the In N Out?
College Sophomore,2,"They can do so much better with what they are doing, the school still is predominantly white. I believe they should have more faculty/staff of color in order to set a model that all can do it."
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly you either have to make your own parties or find someone with connections because the nightlife is always the same. There is no variety, and it makes life even duller here."
College Sophomore,2,The settlement concerning that one UPD officer reflects poorly on the others as it makes me feel unsafe and the concern for women who have been sexually assaulted is poor.
College Freshman,2,"Sorrorities dont have their own houses because theres this law in town that 7 or more females living in a house is considered a brothel. I think it is unfortunate but that being said, I don't hear much about greek life on campus. The fraternities host parties every weekend but I don't know about sorrorities. The sorrorities that I heard of so far does community work a lot which is really good on them. But i never plan on joining greek life. Also, nobody hates them or they dont hate non-greeks. its all mutual. You cant even tell."
College Freshman,2,If Greek life is your top priority I wouldn't really come to Humboldt.
College Sophomore,2,There's one bus line that goes in an eternal circle around Arcata. It drops you off at the library circle with few minutes before the hour to get to your class that's conveniently on the other side of campus. Your best bet is owning a bike.
Recent Alumnus,2,for a grad student it is EXTREMELY limited.
Recent Alumnus,2,Financial aid doesn't really try to help you find ways to pay for your college and afford to go to Humboldt State.
College Freshman,2,"I say bad because  I didn`t  get enough what I wanted  back I was in high school and  i really  screwed up everything  and I had done  everything that I suppose  to do  but  my  staffs  drag foot  filling out the form to give  to my school so thats the reason why  I didin`t get enough finial aid  I suppose to get $27,000 of grant money"
College Freshman,2,Its confusing that  the message  they school send  to me that  students are not aloud to do any drug material nothing. But abut time  I get to the  school  theirs  students  smoking weed in each corner  even inside their resident halls . And  some  of the student  including myself  cannot handle the smell.
College Freshman,2,This is like any school it will take the measure needed if you break any rules and there are many people that walk around the dorms in the evening to check up on the students.
College Freshman,2,Living in the forest its hard to get a good signal so a trip to the library is sometimes needed.
College Student,2,"The athletics are bad. Not a lot of people are competitive nor in shape. I think there should be a stronger competitive force on the teams at my school. Unfortunately, there isn't yet."
College Freshman,2,There are very few things to do here if one is not old enough to go to the bars  and clubs.
College Junior,2,"We do not have sufficient parking for the amount of people at this school.
We do offer a lot of alternative ways of getting to school, but the majority of the students at HSU live off campus or are commuters. 
Campus permits are extremely expensive, and even then it's a lottery system, so you have no idea if you will even get a spot. I have been to classes 20 minutes late trying to find a spot before. 
But, the minute you park somewhere and your meter runs out or anything, you can bet your brother that you will have a ticket that is at least 40$. "
College Sophomore,2,"I've had terrible experiences and I've had wonderful, it all depends are where you live. My first year, I lived in Sunset dorms. The setup was you had your spacious room (single, double or triple), on either a co-ed or gender specific floor, and you shared a bathroom with everyone on your floor (of course different bathrooms for the co-ed floor).  The social atmosphere was great there since you're sharing common areas with around 50-300 people. All my good friends were made living there. The CA's, or authority figures, were kind and understanding. Ours was laid back to a fault, he was fired after that semester. The furniture was decent and convenient considering the cost of living. The housing office employees were always helpful and quick to respond. There are several places to eat or buy food on campus, some bad, some good and prices range from cheap to ridiculous. 
My second year I spent in the Creekview Apartments. I lived in a single bedroom and shared the common areas with four of my friends. The space was large with big windows and nice furniture in the bedrooms and living room/dining room. The views are amazing since you're tucked away in the forest, but you are on top of a steep hill and farthest from the main campus. Parking is great though, compared to Sunset where they allotted 15 spaces for over 600 people. My huge problem with Creekview was the authority figure. She was clearly on a power trip, writing you up for the smallest of broken rules. My roommate once got written up for lending me her key card because I'd left mine in the apartment. My other roommate and I received mandatory dorm changes after an argument over dishes. Her reasoning is it was violating roommate responsibility. I'm now on housing probation because I argued with her outrageous ruling.   "
College Senior,2,"This school does not have many sororities and fraternities. The ones here are mostly based on ethnic lines (Latina, Blacks ext.). They support the community but mainly are below the radar of most students. This is not the school to join if you have interest in that type of group. "
College Senior,2,"This school is not very diverse. The administration of the school has acknowledged this and is attempting to bring more diversity to the campus. This is largely due to the isolated location of the school in northern California, far from the diverse big cities that make up much of California's population. The atmosphere is very liberal and ethnicity is never an issue that is considered around campus."
College Freshman,2,They have computer labs and such in the library and around campus but they are not very great computers.
College Freshman,2,"In arcata the cost to live off campus is somewhat expensive compared to living in eureka. Eureka offers alot more compared to arcata. The only reason why most live in arcata is because its closer to the school, but living in eureka is alot cheaper. "
College Freshman,2,Its average the greek life here isnt that big but is going to be more diverse very soon. 
College Freshman,2,There are usually some homeless and transit people that usually walk on campus. Keep a look out for them because most of them will want something from you 
College Freshman,2,"I feel relatively safe when I'm walking around campus, but not at night."
College Freshman,2,There are many things to do in Humboldt for different kinds of people. 
College Sophomore,2,"For the most part it was simple. I didn't receive as much aid as I need, especially being an out of state student. "
College Sophomore,2,"Humboldt is known for their marijuana. Naturally, it's going to happen. I really don't feel like people are left out if they don't partake in these things. You can still meet people that have your same views. Both drugs and alcohol are pretty accessible to students but the RAs will write you up if they see you partaking in such activities. "
College Sophomore,2,Everything in the town of Arcata is close in proximity. My experience living off campus was not the best. I had a landlord that wasn't very good at his job and the parking lot was horrible. 
College Sophomore,2,"The computer labs and printing on campus are fine. The internet in the dorms could be better, especially in the actual rooms. "
Freshman,1,This place is absolutely terrible for any given students. The system in place and how they operate is absolutely astounding with how unprofessional they are. The faculty that work here you never know if it's going to be a pleasant experience or not. There have been multiple times I've witnessed illegal and in other words unsatisfactory handling of situations. There have been stabbings on campus that the school went silent about. There have been incidents that should bring this university to national-level recognition for the amount of improper and downright wrong way of them treating students and alumni. I while in housing have had to witness them siphon money out of everyone's pockets for whatever they can. During the power outages they couldnt even properly feed the students which is just terrible planning even when they had a week notice. They have terrible communication across campus and theyve lost multiple documents. The custodian staff has also stolen multiple things from me.
Alum,1,"The staff are a mess, the cops are a little too protective of the college's reputation and the students are all doing busy work instead of learning much from what I saw there. If you like to waste your time and money this is the place to go. In all seriousness though I'd say as an alumni don't go really it's trash."
Junior,1,"HSU couldn’t care less about me!! Neither did Arcata. I, like many students, was homeless at Humboldt State. I couldn’t get on campus housing and none of the apartments I applied for fell through. I asked the school many times for any temporary housing and never even got a reply, so I had to drop out and move back home. Which some students can’t even do. I was living in my car for the first month until I realized I was fed up. I felt so unsafe. Even as a large 21 yr old male, I’ve been approached by many local honeless men who live in the woods. HSU’s campus is very dilapidated, there’s no funding for anything, and there’s not many clubs or frats. Not a good school if you crave the true college experience. But a good school if you like nature and don’t care about getting a job after college."
Junior,1,"The area is unsafe and literally anyone can come onto the campus, so I’ve interacted with drug addicted homeless people right outside of my dorm, by my classes, and even in the buildings. There’s a housing problem so many students are homeless. I also don’t recommend the school to anyone who isn’t an environment science, botany, or zoology major because there is zero funding for any other program."
Alum,1,"Honestly not a great school for the money. It's cheap, but even then it leaves much to be desired. The science programs are alright. They advertise small class size. The flip side of that is - all of the staff and professors are absolutely slammed and will struggle to find time to help you. 

They have labs before lectures...professors will teach multiple classes using the same content (slideshows, quizzes, midterms all pretty much identical between the two different classes). PSCI 101 and PSCI 112 may be different on a transcript as well as in the course catolog - but they may very well be the same class as far as content goes.

There's a reason only 1/4 of their freshman class graduates. They don't advertise this. I really wish I didn't waste time and money here."
College Freshman,1,"I am apart of greek life and it has only gotten worse, one of the reasons i wish to transfer."
College Sophomore,1,No parties the cops bust everything since it is a small town
College Sophomore,1,small town= the cops are being called by your neighbors
College Junior,1,I do not know what Greek Life is. I do not know how to become a part of a sorority.
College Freshman,1,It's way to expensive and waste of money.
College Freshman,1,Don't really feel it's necessary.
College Junior,1,"There is nothing really offered in the far north of CA. 

Most students graduate and leave Arcata and never return.."
College Junior,1,I'd assume its the worst because it is not present on this campus compared to most CA colleges
College Senior,1,"The school is very bias in who it helps on campus and why; the school states it is a very 'diverse' group, but there are very few people who are actually anything other than white and the forums and protests they have are still very one sided.  The students are very angry, bitter, or ignorant to the real world around them and thus the staff are too.  The parking is a joke when it comes to the pass and the amount of spaces allowed.  This school is great for small town folks who don't want to branch out, but for us transfer kids, it's the worse!"
College Sophomore,1,"It is awful. Everyone is nice, but the living conditions are awful, its always loud, it always reeks, it is honestly terrible."
College Freshman,1,More of a club. No housing. Greek life is not big at all.
College Sophomore,1,do not have that I know of
College Freshman,1,In my experience I was on campus when about 16 CA's got fired. As an independent student I never found CA's necessary until we were left with none. I was unhappy with the way the administration dealt with the situation and i watched as students who were once CA's struggle to find shelter and food once they were fired and declined their room and board. Also the administration declined them their right to appeal the situation and it seemed that faculty was bias towards the school opinion. I believe HSU puts up an image that everyone is equal but I found myself feeling like it was an act.
Recent Alumnus,1,Campus Apartments are ridiculous. The building was meant to only last 10 years and then be taken down but they haven't yet. They need to get rid of them and rebuild.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no greek life, they are irrelevant. Nothing really happens between them and the community at large."
College Sophomore,1,I would appreciate this school more if they had more opportunities for my own major to get scholarships because I'm struggling to make ends meet.
College Freshman,1,"Being in my position (parents being teachers and two siblings) apparently we are too ""financially stable"" for me to receive anything."
College Freshman,1,"I didn't come here so I could join a frat, get hazed, and become yet another product of that culture.  People here are radically individualistic and I like that, so I'm happy to give it 1 star."
College Sophomore,1,"If you have a car, plan to arrive on campus 30 minutes before class. It is a nightmare to find a spot! Half of the parking lots are reserved for residents or staff so the general parking sucks. The cost of the parking permits is $150 each semester for a car, motorcycle I believe is $40 a semester. They do prorate it as the semester goes on. I parked off campus, which is hard and very far, until the price went down to $90 (took four weeks). Be careful of parking off campus as some neighborhoods require a parking permit and the signs that say that are scarce. If you park illegally on campus, you will get a ticket! They are strict and do not give pity. If you're parked illegally for a long period of time, they may give you another ticket on the same day. I once had to be rushed to the hospital via ambulance and my car was parked at a meter. When I was released 12 hours later, I had four tickets and they did not care that I was hospitalized so I still had to pay the fines ($33 each). "
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone knows Humboldt's reputation as a pothead's school. I personally don't partake but know plenty of people who do. I've been pressured but stood my ground so they backed off and wasn't bothered again. Drinking is highly prevalent too. If you live in the dorms, the CA's and UPD make there presence known but you have rights and as long as you keep it in your space, they won't bother you. But if you are caught, it's a huge deal (they overreact in my experience). Mushrooms have become a fad within the past few years. Easy to find in the forest and I'm sure there's a class offered about them. There are harder drugs available in the county, specifically in Eureka, but I haven't seen too many cases of its use on campus. "
College Sophomore,1,I do not qualify for financial aid so I have to work many hours a week to help pay my rent and bills. Which is completely unfair and it's the one thing I hate about college is that I'm not getting assistance when everyone around me is.
College Freshman,1,"When you have a car and you live on campus i recommend that you dont drive your car at all til about 5pm, thats when everybody usually is out of class and you can find a parking spot. If you leave early during the week youll never find a parking spot. "
College Sophomore,1,I thought the cost of permits was too high. I got only one ticket and it was the mistake of the parking attendant. I took it up with campus police and they took the ticket away and apologized. Parking goes really quick on campus so get it fast. 
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus can be a nightmare because there aren't enough spaces nor is there room for a new parking lot. The cost of a parking pass is outraegous and you never know if you'll even be able to find a spot. At times, it's best to look on side streets off campus and just walk."
College Junior,1,"Unless youre into smoking marijuana, the nightlife is non-existent. There are no nearby clubs/bars/etc either."
College Junior,1,"The smell of marijuana everywhere you go, being smoked by students and staff, is enough to turn away any driven, focused student looking for education. I am transferring out. And yea, the weather is okay..."
College Junior,1,"I have changed by major once, which is very common at schools. However, at no other school I have heard of do they staff such unmotivated staff. From the people working in admissions who I initially dealt with, all the way to their ""top professors"" who seem to be shining examples of life as a typical Northern California stoner. This was my dream school before applying, and now I unfortunately regret my decision and have to go through the tedious process of transferring."
College Junior,1,Campus police really don't play any games when it comes to regulating policies. The slightest noise violation can get your entire hall in trouble if you live in the dorms. Their focus seems to mostly be on drinking and partying in the dorms and parking violations.
College Junior,1,"Permit costs are way too expensive. Parking spaces are limited and students are always struggling to find a spot. It's a bad situation. The big parking lots are far away from buildings and makes it difficult for the student to run from a building to the parking lot in time, so they end up getting a ticket for not getting there on time. I know a lot of students who have gotten tickets for no reasons and that is not fair."
College Freshman,1,Greek life is pretty dead.  I only have seen three frat guys in the whole campus.  I haven't seen any sorority here.
College Sophomore,1,"though you can get anywhere by bus in arcata, the buses only comes twice every hour"
College Sophomore,1,because we are in Humboldt county there is a big marijuana scene because it is grown here.
College Freshman,1,Unless you park by 9 am you will be searching and waiting for a spot. They sell more permits than they have parking places for. You can park in the nearby town but it is all 2 hour parking only.
College Senior,1,"Although there is always usually someone roaming around campus late at night, I would still like to see more of those emergency alert stations that students can utilize in case of an emergency. I can only think of one located on campus."
College Junior,1,"The Greek Life at my school consists of maybe one or two sororities/fraternities, but I like it that way."
College Sophomore,1,"there are greek letter organizations on campus but they are hardly noticeable. i have heard of five, two frats and three sororities."
College Student,1,"I have been attending HSU since Spring 2008 and I have problem's every semester.  Now I don't even qualify for financial aid, because I don't meet the university's criteria any longer. I still qualify according to the government, but each school has their own qualifications.  I am a 45 year old returning student, but that doesn't matter.  Never let someone tell you don't worry, we will take care of you.  You must be an active participant at all stages of your financial aid preparations. No one in the financial aid department has your back.  They have too many applications to consider, so watch your own back!"
College Sophomore,1,"You're Better of Walking or Riding Your Bike – Parking is so limited! It is a pain in the ass to find a parking spot if you're not arriving on campus at 8am. You literally have to stalk a person and follow them to their car, haha. HSU and Arcata are very bike friendly though. Many people ride their bikes to campus. Its a pretty safe campus so theres no worry about anyone stealing your bike. There's plenty of bike parking everywhere. The campus is also walking distance from most places in Arcata."
College Student,1,"Food Poisoning – After my encounter with the meth addict I headed to the dining hall to be greeted by an unseen enemy, food poisoning. It was NOT pleseant."
College Student,1,Safety Not the Top Priority – Even after the first day I was confronted by a meth crazed hobo while heading to my marijuana farm up in the mountains. Can you believe the security at this place did not lift a single finger to help me survive against the meth crazed hobos and Amsterdanian sewer people.
College Student,1,"Ouch Goes the Wallet – Let's say you're a new freshman like me who doesn't have stable employment and doesn't have a car or good bike (or determination to bike your belongings and self from one town to the other) then one is left with public transportation. Unfortunatly, the buses don't run past 7 on weekends and on not at all on Sundays. Furthermore, if you don't go to HSU and a bus pass isn't apart of your tuition costs, the bus fairs of nearly  $4 will drive you... well, to biking."
College Junior,1,"Not Strict Enough – Campus police are always around and trying to enforce campus rules, but the rules are broken everywhere, all the time.  Drugs on campus are a huge problem, and students get away with it right under faculty noses."
College Senior,1,"The Lonely Island's ""Ras Trent&quot – HSU lacks in diversity aside from the southern Californian trust-fund rastafarians and the token football players. The campus is rather homogenous!"
College Senior,1,"Greek at HSU Is a Joke. There are few fraternal orders and sororities on campus. Many members are freshmen; however with the lowest freshmen retention rate of any CSU, this means nothing. In fact these are most likely to be the freshmen to get the boot!"
College Junior,1,"Alcohol and Weed – This is Humboldt County. It's pretty hard to get away from the smell of it wherever you are. It's the lifestyle here. The county is pretty much run by the grower's here. The effects of alchol is always seen, house parties are always going on. The plaza always has drunks running around that area, probably because that's where all the bars are."
College Junior,1,"Residence Housing – Since I have lived in the dorms I have faced negative situations that have made me feel unsafe and unheard. My first year a racist comment was made [racism is racism regardless of what race you, it's wrong and should happen to no one] and I reported it. Our dorm leader took over 2 months for it to go through and by then the girl made up stories she said we did, and in the end we all got warning penalties. My Softmore year housing put a 32 year old guy that gave off the creepy vibe [plenty of older guys aren't creepy, so it wasn't ageism or sexism on my part].  He made comments like ""I'm in the dorms for hot chicks"" and ""I just can't say what I did earlier"".  He was convicted of assaulting an officer, too. The first night he drank a twelve pack, the second he drank two 40's! We didn't feel safe to be alone with him. The fifth day he was there he put mealworms in our milk! I went to housing crying being afraid of potential poison threat, but they made US [three of us didn't feel safe living with him] move to temporary housing to go through a judicial process that might take WEEKS to finish. The sixth day we go back to get some of our essentials and he is being talked to by police because they deemed him crazy [he was institutionalized for 72 hrs]. Horrible experience of over-priced false sense of security for your son or daughter.  My mom was going to pull me out of college if they didn't do something. I hated it."
College Freshman,1,"Unless you're a fearless person and you enjoy hiking at nighttime, perhaps this college isnt for you. It's in a rural area, I haven't seen any potential spots for 21-and-older nightlife. Nightlife for the under 21 crowd is pretty scarce too. There really isn't much to do here, off campus school parties or cramped illegal dorm parties are the closest you'll get to ""excitement""."
College Junior,1,"The parking is as ridiculous as the school. I guess all campus parking is bad, but this is worse because you're not even getting a decent education out of it. There are only a few parking lots for students, the rest is on the street (where they feel they still must charge you, either with meters or requiring a permit). And there are no camera or security in the parking structures, so lock your car, hide your things, and don't walk at night, as your likely to get raped."
College Junior,1,Humboldt Food Sucks – The food up here matches the weather: gray and bland
College Junior,1,"Don't Come to Humboldt – I sincerely regret coming to this pathetic excuse for a school. There's NOTHING to do if you're not a tree hugging hippie, the campus is a joke (3 90 degree angle hills), and they have ""professors"" here that don't even have any degree!! If you're considering HSU, do yourself a big favor and DON'T GO. This whole school and community are a joke. And the head of the journalism department is an abysmal disgrace to, not only journalists, but real teachers everywhere. Screw this school!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks Unknown – The Greek community isn't really known in Humboldt State, nobody really cares."
College Freshman,1,"The People – There are a lot of hippie types...but it depends what you are into you can always find your typical socal people but living so far in northern california lots of burkentocks, tie dye, dreads. If you dress like a bum...people think you are cool"
College Junior,1,"The town is pretty small, and busses are free for students, which are necessary because parking after 8 am is a nightmare. you have to drive around for about an hour stalking people."
College Freshman,1,"I live off campus, so I wouldnt really know what the nightlife is like. I am also a mother so I cant really join in on those activities. But I hear there are a few quiet parties and alot of people may go to the bars witch are just down the street."
College Freshman,1,"It is a very diverse college at humboldt state university. I see all types of shapes and sizes, everyone seems to get along just fine. I have rarely heard of stereotypes or racism happening within my college community."

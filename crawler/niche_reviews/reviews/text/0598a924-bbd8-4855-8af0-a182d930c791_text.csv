Sophomore,5,Berry is an excellent choice for anyone to go to school. There are so many majors and minors to choose from. It has one of the best Animal Science programs in the nation. Berry has a beautiful campus and there are deer everywhere. It is the biggest campus in the world. There's so much to do at Berry and they offer so many opportunities to get involved. Berry has prepared me so much already for the future and I've only been there for one year. There are so many opportunities to get help if a student is struggling. All tutoring services are free and everyone is so helpful. Berry is the place to be.
Senior,5,"I love the Berry Bubble! The campus is always lively. It is the largest (and most beautiful) campus in the world--27,000 acres of land to explore, hike, bike, photograph, and thrive in. The community is wonderful and there are always campus events! The academics are challenging and very well rounded. With small class sizes and a small campus, you really gain connections with professors and other students. The work experience is the school's best draw. Every student is guaranteed a job--from magazine editor to costume shop employee, media rep, office worker, or even dairy farmer!"
Senior,5,"No, I have not taken any courses online with Berry College. This is not an applicable question here."
Freshman,5,Berry College is a great place to get an education. The professors care about how you are doing and are ready to help if you need it. The campus is beautiful and feels safe. Berry is filled with great people who will make your college experience memorable.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is safe and beautiful! The academics are rigorous, but thorough! I’d like for the college to be more supportive of the Equestrian Team as a college sport."
Sophomore,5,I took online courses to finish the semester because of Covid19. The instructors are very easy to talk to and are available for help.
Freshman,5,I just finished my first semester at Berry and I love it. It's challenging but not impossible. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
Freshman,5,"This was my last option in terms of getting into college, and I wished I had this as my first option. The students and professors here are very nice and helpful with everything, and the campus is beautiful."
Alum,5,"The campus is gorgeous, the faculty and staff are kind and supportive, and the overall atmosphere is positive and accepting! Depending on the area of study (and one's personal academic strengths), the courses are very challenging. Diversity is unfortunately lacking, due in part to the cost of tuition (although scholarships are available) and the location in the North GA mountains."
Niche User,5,"Berry is a great atmosphere as soon as I stepped on campus the teachers and students made me feel welcomed. The teachers sounded lie they cared, for example at other Universities your probably more like a number to them. At Berry they seemed like they cared about you and who you are as a student."
Freshman,5,Very Organized and kind people that are very knowledgable about the campus and the opportunites that it has to offer.
Freshman,5,"I loved the overall atmosphere of Berry, it is a beautiful campus and I made a lot of good friends. Most of the professors are excellent too, willing to get to know you and to work with you."
Niche User,5,I love it. It is so pretty. Lots of room to be outside. Lots of trails to hike that lead to beautiful destinations. Ponds that are very peaceful to sit by. And tons of places to hang your hammock and chill while you study.
Junior,5,"I love the small class sizes and the interactions you get to make with the faculty and staff. Professors go out of there way to make sure you get all the help you need. Academics in all departments are rigorous, but doable if you're willing to put in the work. Events on campus are really fun, if you actually go to them. Concerts are always pretty good bands, and some events are amazing, like turning the entire student activities building into a casino, or when we have an actual carnival on campus. Clubs are also super fun, and so are the department events, like recreation sorts, hikes, etc. Every weekend there's plenty to do. Sports teams are good and fun to watch. Basketball, softball, football, and volleyball are the best and it's fun to watch them play, and all the sports events are hype. Dorms are good as well. Although some are small, the community is amazing. You meet so many people through the residence halls, and you'll always find great friends, study partners, etc."
Alum,5,Great Environment for study and learning one's field. Also can do work study to obtain experience. Opportunities exist to study abroad in the summer with courses from your major.   Professors that show an interest in your learning and acheivement.
Alum,5,"Berry college allowed me to work and to attend school at the same time. It was a small school, so I knew most of the students and still keep up with them now. Professors knew me by name and were invested in my success."
Alum,5,Berry provided me with the opportunity to find my passion and grow within it. The mentorship I received from my professors and the friendships I made are invaluable.
Sophomore,5,Berry is a small school which is amazing because the teachers actually know your name and you get to experience more hands on learning one to one instead of surrounded by 100 other students in 1 class.
Senior,5,"At Berry I am always surrounded by a supportive community of my peers, employers, and professors. They provide every possible opportunity for students to get involved and learn outside of the classroom with hands on experiences. Not to mention being surrounded by a beautiful atmosphere."
Niche User,5,So far I have fallen in love with Berry College from their campus to the school itself. They are small so it has a familial feeling and is always working to improve themselves and their students.
Alum,5,"Berry fosters an incredible community among students and staff, the campus is beautiful, and you get opportunities here that you wouldn’t get anywhere else."
Senior,5,Berry has truly felt like home. The campus is incredibly beautiful and the professors are always working to provide an exceptional environment for education. I have thoroughly enjoyed every moment at Berry.
Alum,5,"More than I ever could’ve dreamed of from a college experience. 

Berry had everything I was looking for in a school. Small class sizes, real world opportunities for students, and a tight knit community."
Freshman,5,Berry College is an incredible and unique community that cannot be found anywhere else. The “Berry Bubble” is truly something to behold.
Senior,5,"Being a part of Berry College was a life altering experience. I transferred here from a larger more ""nationally recognized"" school but Berry was just an incredible fit. I know you hear it all the time but the community you find at Berry is unrivaled. I have a personal connection with so many of my professors and Berry makes it so easy to get involved. I am part of multiple clubs (shout out to the ultimate frisbee team) and was placed in a student work opportunity that perfectly correlates to what I want to do with my career. These are just a few of the things that make Berry College the best college experience out there."
Junior,5,"Small class sizes and helpful professors mean you're never alone on your academic journey! The campus is also absolutely beautiful, perfect for anyone who loves nature or hiking."
Sophomore,5,"Berry is an overall close-knit community. The students and staff focus on making first-year and transfer students feel welcome and comfortable in their new environment. I've enjoyed the beautiful scenery, and with about 27,000 acres of land, there is always someplace new to explore. The professors want to see their students succeed and smaller class sizes mean that students are able to receive one on one time."
Alum,5,"Overall a great school! Much of college is what you make of it, which is especially true at Berry. Get connected to extra-curricular activities and be sure to go to games (or at least leave campus every now and then)."
Sophomore,5,Berry College is an overall great campus with amazing people and professors. the people and professors at Berry College truly care about your well being and do not treat you as if you're just a number. The campus is extraordinarily beautiful and offers great places to hike and great hang out/study spots for you and your friends.
Sophomore,5,"I could not have asked for a better jump start to my future!    Everyone who works at this campus,  as well as the professors, and coaches, are all very supportive and have interest in you as an individual !"
Senior,5,"Berry is a great school! I have enjoyed my four years here because of the great academics, amazing people, and the outstanding ways to get involved in the community. I have grown as a person and got out of my comfort zone by trying new things that I would have never done before. If I had the chance to do again, I would!"
Sophomore,5,"Berry College has an amazing student to professor ratio. The professors are always available to meet outside of class. Unlike large state schools, Berry has a tight knit community. Everyone rallies together when there's a problem or student in need. There are a multitude of D3 sports, intramural sports, clubs, and on campus activities. Berry College is an amazing place to graduate from!"
Freshman,5,"Berry College is an amazing college. It is a beautiful campus with lots of landscape, wildlife, and large amounts of diversity. Berry is a great school where everyone has something for them and there's a place for everyone, regardless to color, gender, or ethnicity. They are also one of the best colleges in the nation, particularly when it comes to their education program. All of these are reasons that I chose Berry to continue my education."
Alum,5,"Berry College was amazing. I felt like I was apart of a family. All of my professors knew me by name and were more than willing to help. Berry also gave me amazing opportunities like studying abroad in Italy, student teaching in a local school starting freshmen year, mentoring incoming freshmen, and getting a  job before I even graduated. Berry will forever be home!"
Freshman,5,"I love Berry College. I always knew I wanted to go here and now I do, which is honestly a dream come true. I'm a commuter, so I can't really speak on food or housing, but the campus is amazing and the academics are rigorous but fun. Of course there are some professors I don't like, but overall they have been fun, intelligent, and easy to get along with. I wouldn't change much at all."
Niche User,5,Such a wonderful school! I fell in love with it instantly. I’m looking forward to attending next year!
Junior,5,Berry is another home to me. Every faculty and staff member cares for you as if you are their child. It’s where I’ve gained friends that are now brothers and sisters to me that help get through the tough times. It’s academics are challenging but they get you ready for the outside world and open up so many opportunities in life. On top of all those qualities we are placed on such a beautiful campus that allows so many opportunities to have some time for yourself. For example hiking to the reservoir or having a picnic. This college allows you to fully experience the college life and be able to have to most wonderful 4 years of your life.
Sophomore,5,I love Berry. The people are so welcoming and the college offers something for everyone. The academics are challenging in the best way and there are hundreds of opportunities for extracurricular activities.
Freshman,5,"Berry is a small college, but it is one of the most beautiful places in America. The professors make an effort to know the names of their students and want to see each of us succeed to the best of our ability."
Sophomore,5,It is a great environment with a beautiful campus. Professors are great when you need help in classes and career advice and guidance. The faculty does a great job and are very engaged with the students. The athletic programs are fun and great to be involved with.
Freshman,5,Berry College is a great school. I am just a freshman but so far I love it. The campus is so pretty and gigantic. There is always something to do. The professors are all great and really want to see you do well. Professors are willing to help you outside of class too. Overall awesome college.
Freshman,5,"Berry College is my home away from home. Professors really care about you, and the courses are academically rigorous and enjoyable for me. My advisor is fantastic, he knows all of the ins and outs of getting to medical school and is super willing to work with me. The campus is absolutely beautiful. Today it snowed in GA, and although I wasn't there, the pictures are absolutely magical!"
Freshman,5,"I love Berry College. The environment is just so beautiful and phenomenal. While it may be true that it is the world's largest campus, it doesn't feel like that because it isn't so spread out. So many things to do."
Freshman,5,"This is an amazing college. I would recommend Berry to anyone with passion, drive, and the grit to succeed. You will need to work hard, but this college is everything you could dream of in getting a higher education. Not only is it the largest college campus in the world, (over 27,000 acres), they have a 99% job acceptance rate after graduation."
Niche User,5,"Berry is BEAUTIFUL. The people are so kind. The environment is just so happy and free. I loved visiting both times, and I didn't want to leave. I CANNOT wait to attend Berry in the fall!"
Freshman,5,"Berry is an extremely interesting and unique school. Berry college is located on the largest college campus in the world. There are miles and miles of sprawling forest, wildlife refuges, structures dating back to the 1800s that are maintained and cared for providing a rich environmental history as well as historical history. The campus and buildings are breathtaking, from the beautiful Frost Chapel to the Ford Complex, the architecture is truly inspiring. The campus staff are also to be commended as they are more than willing to work one-on-one with students to help them with anything they may need and keep them on the path to graduation."
Alum,5,Great School! Professors care about your success and a wonderful campus to learn on! The campus is gorgeous with tons of wildlife. A very stress free environment that allows you to focus on anything you want to accomplish.
Junior,5,I have had a great experience at Berry College these past 3 years. Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help . If I have a question about an organization or anything really I know that I can always reach out to staff members/ department chairs that will nicely answer my questions. Also the career center is a great place to visit if you are ever wondering what next steps to take for your future in a professional setting. The college is centered around serving others and making an impact on the community and that is what makes Berry different from other schools because Berry is concerned with not just the campus events that go on and promoting the School but also contributes to help organizations in need . 
College Freshman,5,Don't drink. Don't do drugs
College Freshman,5,"Professors are intent on giving students the best learning experience. Classes are meant to be engaging and give students hands on experience for a well-rounded education. Berry College provides a variety of jobs on campus to all students who wish to work. Jobs are scheduled to not conflict with any classes. People are very friendly, close-knit environment. Good sense of community. Beautiful campus!"
College Sophomore,5,"I LOOOVE my academic advisor!!! He was also my professor for Intro to Animal Science and Orientation to Animal Science. He's a nice guy and he's funny! When things got bumpy for me a couple of time during my first year, he always reached out to me to see if I was okay! I also love my honors advisor, Dr. Whelan. I liked the way she conducted class (she was my Writing & Rhetoric professor). I also like how she cares about the honors program and all of her students! My favorite class so far has been Intro to Animal Science because we got so much hands on experience so quickly!! I definitely wasn't expecting that. It was amazing."
College Freshman,5,I love everything about Berry
College Student,5,Berry has a very low crime rate especially compared to other schools. This doesn't mean that Berry is perfectly safe though.
College Freshman,5,There are usually events every week regarding internships or future job opportunities. There will always be options for you to take a hold of.
College Freshman,5,"We are a substance free campus, but that doesn't mean students aren't drinking or smoking pot. If you're looking for it, you'll find it. If you aren't, then you won't find anything."
College Freshman,5,"Gated, Manned Guard House, Scan/Track Visitor Ids, All Dorms Locked 24/7"
College Freshman,5,"As a young woman, I feel completely safe on Berry's campus. Not because the security is great, but because everyone who attends is pretty much trustworthy."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love my on campus job, I couldn't ask for a better job anywhere else my freshman year!"
College Freshman,5,I love this school because of all the opportunities to learn and grow and become a leader.
College Freshman,5,I have never felt unsafe.
Senior,4,for the curveball that was thrown at every college this year I think Berry did a reasonably good job and transitioning to online remote learning to finish out the fall semester they implemented many new policies to not only keep us safe but also to continue the quality of education that they are known for.
Senior,4,"this school has an absolutely beautiful campus with over 27000 acres of pristine wilderness, accompanied by some outstanding academic and a committed faculty and staff all working to provide the best experience and education for each student."
Sophomore,4,The professors made it as easy as possible for all the students. They all want you to succeed. They are available to help most of the time.
Sophomore,4,"I love it there! the only reason I gave it four instead of 5 is because they hype up the weekends saying they always have something to do which is false, its pretty quiet on weekends and not much to do. But everyone there is very friendly, they have small classrooms which allow students to connect with teachers, and its a beautiful campus"
Sophomore,4,All my teachers were very understanding and cooperative. Everything seemed to run smoothly and berry handled and transitioned so well
Niche User,4,Berry College is a fantastic school that provides its students with many opportunities for success. I have enjoyed my time at Berry. Great campus and staff that really care about their students.
Freshman,4,"Originally, my classes were all on campus, but then Covid-19 happened and we moved everything online. The transition was smooth and the professors were understanding. While I would have rather been on campus, the online work well."
Freshman,4,"It’s not what I expected. I had a rough first semester, but I learned so much. I’m looking forward to my second semester."
Freshman,4,Great school. about to tour again but had alot of my family go to this school and the campus is beyond beautiful!
Alum,4,"Berry was a great college to attend. I enjoyed the small class sizes and the one on one with professors. The campus is beautiful, people are friendly and the food is good. There are plenty of clubs and student activities to join as well."
Sophomore,4,"my experience in my short time at Berry has been very successful. in the classroom, the class sizes are very small and the professors are easy to talk to and available during office hours for extra help. There are also several outside resources like the tutoring at the Academic success center and help with essays at the writing center. The Berry community is very small and close knit so it is easy to feel important and not just a number. KCAB is the student led activities team and they do a great job of putting on events throughout the whole semester. Everything on campus is close together which makes it easy to get from class to class. Berry is not a party school so it isn't a good fit for people looking to party every weekend."
Sophomore,4,"I like Berry. I have only been there for a semester, but I love it. The other students are caring and likeable. They truly care about how you are. The professors and administrators are also very helpful. They care about your future and successes."
Sophomore,4,Berry College has an excellent student community. The class sizes are small which makes for better learning. The only issue is the tuition and how hard it is to pay for without loans.
Freshman,4,"Berry is a great school with a large focus on building a community. The student body is very friendly and teachers are easy to talk to and for the most part, very flexible. The campus itself is beautiful and there is always things to do both outdoors and inside, especially weekend nights. The only potential negative is it's not a party school, it's very much christian influenced."
Senior,4,The campus is beautiful and quiet.  There is usually something going on so you can stay busy.  The professors can be hard so good study habits are a must.  I would like Berry to update their Town Houses to better living arrangements and they need to allow off campus living instead of requiring you to live on campus the whole time.
Freshman,4,"I like Berry because I feel like they care about their students and the level of academics is a lot higher than a lot of schools, especially in Georgia."
Junior,4,berry does not have a party scene which is something that i like because i am not a partier. the student activities board throws fun things almost every weekend for the students to do. the premed opportunities here are great. students here are very dedicated in their studies
Freshman,4,"Academically, Berry is a great school. The professors care about their students, classes are small and comprehensive, and students are constantly engaging in intensive projects. The workload is pretty big, but you definitely feel like you are working hard and learning a lot. The student work program is also a nice addition. Socially, you have to force yourself to get involved if you want to make friends and have things to do in your spare time. There isn't a ton to do on campus or in Rome, but student organizations are a great way to get out of your dorm and make your experience a lot better. Definitely not the place to go if you prefer party schools, but it does provide students with a lot more academic and involvement experience than most schools."
Freshman,4,"All of the professors at Berry College really care about their students more than their paychecks. They truly want you to exceed in their class. I don't live on campus, but it is more than worth it to drive to Berry every day. The parking situation isn't great; they need to expand as their population expands. Everyone at the school is very kind and even if you don't live on campus, you get submerged in the ""Berry Bubble""."
Freshman,4,"I have had a rough first semester at Berry. Many issues occurred in my family life and unfortunately I missed a lot of school. However, Berry staff worked very well to get me where I need to be to succeed. I also got food poisoning four times from the Dining Hall."
College Freshman,4,"Residential college. Dorms are decent in space. Furniture is a little mix-matched, but of the same style. Resident halls are cleaned up and revamped when needed. Resident Advisors make students feel welcome and comfortable from move-in. (""Berry Bellhops"" help carry freshmen's items to rooms on move in day!) Fair rules and decent compliancy."
College Freshman,4,"While not a division 1 school, sports teams are highly valued on campus. Sports events are attended as a community. Berry College also offers a wide variety of sport and exercise equipment and classes to non-athletes. The facilities are new and very well maintained."
College Junior,4,"My first semester at Berry, I was very unhappy and wanted to find another school. However, I ended up finding something else: great friends, classes I enjoyed, and campus activities. Berry has become a place I miss when I'm away on breaks, and I would pick it again."
College Sophomore,4,"I think getting a degree from Berry is valued highly. Of course, it's not like an Ivy League degree but locally Berry is known as a great school. Especially for students hoping to go to vet school, like I am!"
College Sophomore,4,"My experience as a young Afro-Latina at Berry has been interesting to say the least. I love my friends and I love my professors, but there are some very hateful and/or ignorant people on campus that make my experience less than it should be. I've loved all of my animal science classes so far because they're really fun and I'm finally learning about what I love. I think I would chose Berry again if I had to do everything over BUT I would try to steel myself for the hardships of being a minority in a severe majority."
College Freshman,4,The teachers I have met so far seem supportive.
College Freshman,4,Berry offers great opportunities for internships.
College Freshman,4,Berry tries its hardest to be a very safe campus
College Freshman,4,The dorms can be outdated but are always tidy and clean.
College Freshman,4,"Berry has a large show of support in everything it does, including sports."
College Freshman,4,A degree is highly valued
College Freshman,4,still a slight chance of worry
College Freshman,4,Administration and offices work together with me.
College Student,4,Berry had a great program where every student has the opportunity to work on campus and hold a part-time job while they are studying. Most Berry students are able to get internships while they are attending Berry and when they graduate.
College Student,4,"Berry has a relatively new state of the art gym on campus called the Cage Center. Some of the hours are a bit weird and it can be packed however the facility is very nice. Also, since Berry sits on a very large campus there is plenty of space for outdoor activities."
College Student,4,"Berry is a great school that has tons of activities for students to participate in. The average course load here is way more challenging than most would expect. Although, Berry does have a good amount of resources for students to use."
College Senior,4,"Berry sends a lot of people to graduate school, and many people have jobs right out of college."
College Senior,4,"The quality of courses is amazing - they aren't easy at all. But, the professor go out of their way to help students."
College Senior,4,Berry is a super safe place. People routinely feel safe enough to go on night walks to enjoy the scenery.
College Senior,4,"At Berry, the professors care about your success. They go out of their way to meet with you and make sure you understand what is going on."
College Freshman,4,"There is never campus crime. I can leave my computer in the library, go eat across campus, come back and it will still be there untouched. I always feel safe. Campus security is always driving around campus. Police are always a call away."
College Freshman,4,The professors are always willing to help. All my professors have known me by name. They are all very passionate about their fields at that makes classes more fun.
College Freshman,4,"Since I am an athlete I see the inside of everything. The football players are exalted, but that's also because we have a new stadium and only three year old football program. Other sports people care about and attend but not as much as the football games."
College Freshman,4,The professors at Berry are wonderful. They are always willing to give me help if I need it and are very punctual when responding to emails. Classes are challenging but that's because Berry is a more rigorous school. There are plenty opportunities to become a better student. I have learned a lot at Berry. There are so many options for extracurricular activities so you will always be able to get involved.
College Freshman,4,I love it here. It challenges me and is helping me become who I am. I hope to continue my work here.
College Freshman,4,"I feel like a degree from Berry has the idea of a strong work ethic attache to it. People think of Berry an picture hard-working, decimated Southern, college students. Alumni are very well connected once they graduate."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is actually pretty great. Our rooms are a good size considering they're dorm rooms. All the given furnishings are still in good quality. Just recently, all the beds in my dorm,Morton-Lemley, were replaced during Winter Break. I don't know specifics about the cost of housing or the ease of the process since I am just a freshman.The only people who have a hard time getting from their dorm to class are the kids up at Ford and the Winshape kids. They're literally a mile or more off main campus. Sometimes it feels like no one in the dorm talks to each other. Other times it feels like no one will leave me alone."
College Freshman,4,"Berry tries very hard to create a united student force for the school sports here. However, once football ended, it seemed like no one cared about sports anymore. Intramural sports are a weirdly huge deal here. There are an insane amount of facilities for that at the athletic center. I would tell you how our school teams perform, but I honestly don't know anything about that."
College Freshman,4,"Strong Academics.  Helpful professors.  They are great,  Gorgeous campus.  Just no life after exploring natural beauty."
College Freshman,4,"I live in a gorgeous, well maintained castle.  Cool experience."
College Freshman,4,"Like all colleges, community bathrooms aren't fun. I wish they would get rid of the tubs in Ford because the drains are always clogged, causing the water to quickly rise up to your knees while showering."
College Freshman,4,"I don't really identify with the athletic department, so I cannot give an accurate rating."
College Freshman,4,"The student-teacher ratio is very small, allowing students to have more one-on-one time to make sure they fully grasp the subject. Some teachers give everybody the same grade on a subjective assignment, which I don't appreciate."
College Freshman,4,"Freshman housing is aged, rest is terrific, lots of choices."
College Freshman,4,Really great education but some professors purposely try to fail kids just to make their classes harder. I wanted to be a history major but got scared away because I need to maintain HOPE
College Sophomore,4,"Berry challenges students in many different areas of study. Berry provides many opportunities in work on campus, athletics, and clubs. The dual degree engineering program does a great job of preparing students for further studies at other universities."
College Sophomore,4,It really depends where you live on campus and what living atmosphere you want. It can range anywhere from excellent to very poor.
College Freshman,4,The professors are great and really care about our success. They are also very skilled in their areas. The only thing that is rough is that we are on the plus minus system.
College Freshman,4,Berry is known for its students being involved and getting experience early on so they are prepared and will have a leg up on other applicants.
College Freshman,4,"Its nice because people are generally pretty ok to live with, there aren't crazy parties or anything, but people can be route just like at any school. Its also great that there isn't greek life or housing so there arent huge parties."
Niche User,2,"Close minded. Conservative. Nothing to do. If you like nature, you'll be fine. It's super whitewashed"
College Student,2,"Berry doesn't have normal Greek life on campus. since the student body is small, Berry only has Greek life for the music program and the honor societies."
College Senior,2,"Generally speaking, berry college is not a sports college. People play sports, and some are even good, but its not a huge following. Laxbros aren't fun to interact with. Athletics facilities are new, as well as the stadium."
College Freshman,2,"Whoever in responsible for dealing with sexual assault here does a horrible job of dealing with victims of it. Everyone whose ever been assaulted on campus has been met with doubt and victim blaming from everyone including the administration. The campus is so poorly lit at night, especially for the students who must walk from Ford to main campus. I do not feel safe walking around campus at night. I will pull out my keys and ran as fast as I can to my dorm."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The career prospects are mostly regional. The school is well thought of in the local area, but it takes extra effort to find good work/internships and most of it must be done on your own without help from the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,Varsity sports are not well attended and the average student may irregularly watch games on weekends.
College Junior,2,"Athletics aren't a very big deal at Berry. We just got a football team 2 years ago, and the stadium just this year. We aren't very good and it will take a little while to build a strong interest in the sports."
College Senior,2,Berry college is pretty. That's all it has going for it.
College Freshman,2,"We are a D3 school so our athletics are obviously not the top, but I am an athlete and being in a non scholarship environment can create a better teams at some times, but it can also make it worse in some instances because there is nothing keeping the athletes on the team. Students attended football games, soccer games, and volleyball games, but other sports like swim and dive were under supported."
College Freshman,2,"With the school being so expensive, it is hard to get enough scholarships to lower the price. The scholarships they have available are extremely hard to get."
College Freshman,2,"It almost seems like they trick you when you come for a campus visit. The food seemed diverse and delicious, but that is only because thats the one day they actually take the time to create diversity. Every day is pasta and chicken. Every, single, day. The cookies are to die for though..."
College Freshman,2,"Not a plethora of options, and the area isn't made for it."
College Freshman,2,You have to  make your own party. Go to the peach.
College Junior,2,"The administration fails to take into account students' views on a lot of issues, and much of the time it seems like the only view they care about is that of the Board of Trustees who line their pockets."
College Junior,2,"There is little to no party life on campus, you have to go off campus for that."
College Freshman,2,Dining hall is really awful.  I only eat salad or pizza when I go.  I feel like I am wasting money on the unlimited meal plan that I can't even use because the food isn't good.  Valhalla is great though!  I wish there were more options.  I get tired of the same three things.
College Freshman,2,"I am from out of town, Wisconsin, and everyone tends to go home on the weekend. It makes it tough for me. There is little social interaction between everyone. The aesthetics of the entire campus are beyond beautiful but it does not help when no one wants to do anything."
College Freshman,2,"Coming from a member of the one fraternity on campus, there is virtually no greek life here."
College Sophomore,2,Can't go anywhere off campus without a car.
College Junior,2,"If you want to make sure you have a good parking spot, leave your dorm at least 20 minutes before class. Parking isn't the best, but the dorms are within a close proximity to the academic buildings, so most of the time you won't even need to drive to class."
College Sophomore,2,"People are friendly and get along, but not all is perfect. Religious beliefs are not widely accepted if you do not believe in a God or if you are a homosexual. However, if you do not speak of your personal beliefs, you are going to be just fine."
College Freshman,2,"Berry is a dry campus. Dorm policies regarding visitors of the opposite sex are very strict (not allowed in dorms before 10am or after 1am except in lobby and may not spend the night anywhere in the dorm). Academic standards are high. If you get caught breaking rules, the consequences are pretty hefty."
College Freshman,2,"The computers function fine and aren't outdated. The wireless works for about 5 minutes at a time if you want internet, and about half the freshman class is still using the guest network because the network is near impossible to configure yourself and the technical support people are hard to find. Also, ever since tech support configured my computer to use their network, I have had problems connecting to non-Berry networks such as at home and my relatives. An ethernet cable is a must, but the jacks are difficult to get to in your room and there are none elsewhere on campus. I have also had multiple problems where Berry has incorrectly input my information in their systems so anytime I need to reset my password it tells me that I don't know my own birthday. Frustrating to say the least."
College Freshman,2,"Some residence halls are pretty nice and have recently been renovated, while others remain dilapidated and lacking basic amenities. Dana hall's dorms (freshman guys, mostly) have sinks in the rooms, which is a huge time saver. Rooms are completely different even on the same hall and it's really all luck of the draw."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Everyone Lives on Campus, Off Campus Apartments Are Cheap but Not Very Good – everyone lives on campus, off campus apartments are cheap but not very good"
College Freshman,2,"Sports Are Good but Not the Focus – Berry College has opportunities for students to play sports, but sports are not the focus of the school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Rome Is Slow – There are some bars around that have a few nights for under 21, but you really have to be 21 or older for any nightlife.  For me that was at old havan or or bars , drinks and a cigar in hand hanging with friends, or simply dinner and a movie.  Most things shut down early"
College Student,2,"There is not much racial diversity to Berry at all, or at least compared to my high school. The dominant race is white, with only a handful of other ethnicity. Also, it's not just predominantly white: it's predominantly white females. They're everywhere. They're all there is."
College Junior,2,"Dry Campus – Alcohol is not allowed on Berry's campus. Even if you are over 21, you have to go off campus to drink or find somewhere to drink and not get caught. The first time you get caught it's a warning, but punishments become more severe with the more offenses."
College Junior,2,"Little Off-Campus – Berry is very much so a residential college, so there is little housing off campus. Apartments are hard to come by in Rome, and not many people live off campus."
College Student,2,"Extremely Strict – Berry is really strict when it comes to alcohol, since it is a Dry campus. They are getting a football team in upcoming years which may make the school a little more relaxed but for now they are rather strict on anything of that sort. "
College Senior,2,"The nightlife is primarily school activities.  There are a few clubs around the area, but they are often described as sketch.  If  you really want to party, most take the trip to Atlanta or Chattanooga.  There is not much transportation, you hook a ride with a friend."
College Junior,2,"Dry Campus – The policy is that no drinking is allowed on campus. Considering the school has been called one of the ""wettest"" dry campuses, the school is not extremely strict with its no alcohol policy."
College Freshman,2,Dining Hall Food – D-Hall has some really good days and really bad days. It seems to be mostly bad lately. The food looks old and gross.
College Junior,2,"The ratio for Berry girls to boys is 3 to 1. This is fine for me. I have found lots of male friends, and since I am off the dating market, I don't have that to worry about. However, I have heard plenty of complaints from my female friends who are looking for someone to date, but all of the good ones have girlfriends. The best part about Berry is that there are people from all different kinds of lifestyles. Regardless of what you are looking for in a group of friends, we have somebody here like you."
College Sophomore,2,The dining hall is tasteless and serves the same foods over and over. The take-out/mini grocery store is similarly limited.
College Sophomore,2,"The male population is sparse at Berry. The gender ratio is about 70% female and 30% male, or even more skewed towards female."
College Sophomore,2,Take It Seriously. the college isnt too vigilant about rule breaking on campus but if you are caught its likely that you will get in a good amount of trouble
College Freshman,2,"Residential Campus – Berry College is a residential campus meaning that students are highly encouraged and usually limited to living on campus. Only certain exceptions allow students to live off campus including having parents living within the area or being married. There are little to no opportunities for students to live off-campus, but it essentially makes the campus as a whole more well connected."
College Freshman,2,"What Drug Scene – There is one. But good luck finding it. Its mostly alcohol, but there are a couple of people that make you wonder."
Sophomore,1,Great academics but school doesn't care about students safety. They do nothing about rapes on campus no matter the severity. 20x high rape rates than any other college their size
Freshman,1,"Very overpriced school for the experience you will  get. There were a few things I liked about Berry like the gyms (Cage and Richards) and the Reservoir. At Berry, the tour guides will try to lure you into thinking school is fun and amazing. That couldn't be further from the truth. SOAR (orientation) is very long and childish. The people at Berry are sheltered and do not interact much.  Professors in the science and math department do not teach very well (or at all), which makes those classes even harder. The dining hall closes too early, and is repetitive with its food. Poor housing choices unless you're an upperclassmen with a lot of hours. Minimum wage pay for campus jobs. Rome is also a pretty boring city. Although it does has a few good restaurants. Athletics are a joke other than football and softball at Berry. Pretty campus, but isn't as pretty during winter. 2/10 overall for me. Would not recommend for the price tag."
Junior,1,This is the premier college to attend if you'd like to avoid experiencing new cultures and an exciting city.
College Freshman,1,we don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,"Berry does not have a Greek Life and although the school tries, there is virtually no social  life or anything to do after you have exhausted hiking the GORGEOUS campus.  Extremely boring yet sweet school.  Actually, a good first step for me after private school all my life, but I'm ready for more.  Very peaceful and safe transition from private school, but not what I would choose for 4 years."
College Freshman,1,"Again, my feelings relate solely to one varsity sport that was greatly disappointing and the responsibility for this is top down.  I am certain that there are teams with strong leaders that promote Christian conduct, discipline, unity, team spirit, and a welcoming environment and don't have an older coach trying to hang out and be one of his players rather than being a leader and defining expected character of the team.  I have been an avid athlete since age four and worked very hard all my life to play college sports.  My varsity sport experience was so disappointing that I resigned my position on the team and I was a starter. My family and I were heart broken, but the team environment was unacceptable."
Recent Alumnus,1,We do not have Greek life at Berry College........
College Senior,1,Seriously disgusting. I pay way to much to be living in the conditions I do. Berry should be embarrassed.
College Freshman,1,Food makes no since and is horrible!
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek Life
College Freshman,1,What is this nightlife you speak of? This is Berry!
College Sophomore,1,"Now that the new freshman are here, there is no room for anything."
College Sophomore,1,It's extremely difficult to find parking spots during the afternoon at most of the academic buildings. Plan accordingly!
College Freshman,1,"As an african american student here at Berry, it isnt very diverse at all. But its very easy to fit in and make friends."
College Sophomore,1,"The options are fine if you can get the clearance to live off campus. However, that is a very big if."
College Freshman,1,"NON EXISTANT – need i say more? The ""clubs"" are a joke. There are few parties on campus. If there is an off campus party be prepared to drive out to the middle of nowhere. Your best bet is to save up and go to Atlanta."
College Freshman,1,"Not very diverse. Mostly white, heterosexual and christian. Sheltered people as a whole."
College Freshman,1,"Everything is closed after about 8 o'clock and on sundays. This really sucks when all you want is pizza. But no, you can't because every one decides that it's unreasonable to have a pizza place open on a wednesday night of finals week. Becuase OOOOH NO ONE WANTS PIZZA THEN. IT WOULD BE SO STUPID TO WANT QUICK AND EASY FOOD DURING FINALS WEEK"
College Freshman,1,"Berry is not a place for everyone. Most people try to ignore the lack of diversity (religious, ethnic, socioeconomic), but it is glaringly obvious. The religious overtones are constantly bearing down on coursework and the divide between the few liberals here and the conservative majority increases every day. Berry isn't all bad, but it certainly isn't mostly good either. Too expensive, remarkably closed-minded and unnecessarily difficult classes make Berry an outdated and schismatic school."
College Junior,1,Parking is not all that great due to the lack of parking spaces. Most are taken up my faculaty from 7am to 5:30pm.

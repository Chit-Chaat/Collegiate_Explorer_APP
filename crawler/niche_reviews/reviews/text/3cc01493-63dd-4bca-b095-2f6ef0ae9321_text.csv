Freshman,5,Professors are very understanding and are willing to work with you since most of them have no experience online teaching either. It's been a big learning curve for everyone involved
Freshman,5,"I loved the campus and the environment that was portrayed through the staff, professors, and fellow students. But more then these things, I loved the learning and the knowledge I recieved from every moment on Southwestern's campus. It was these moments of connecting one disciple to another that made me fall in love which the community I had become involved with."
Alum,5,"As someone who considers herself to be friendly and affable, yet also easily overwhelmed by too many people, I think that Southwestern provided a way to be in close community with other people and interact with others in meaningful but also lighthearted and fun ways. I would also consider myself prone to deep critical thinking and asking questions and the liberal arts teaching philosophy really encouraged and nurtured that kind of learning/growing. 

It's close enough to Austin, Texas to have an endless wheel of entertainment possibilities at your disposal--should you choose to make the drive--but also not in the thick of the city itself. I also really appreciated their efforts to be environmentally and socially conscious, both in the city of Georgetown (which is powered entirely by wind energy) and on the campus itself."
Junior,5,"Not only is SU a beautiful place to be, but the close knit community that every student shares, allows for hands on learning and personal connections between fellow classmates and professors."
Senior,5,"As an international student, I cannot be more grateful for the opportunities I have had and the skills learned at SU. The personal relationships formed with professors are unmatched and my experience as a student athlete was excellent.  Highly recommend."
Freshman,5,"Even though Southwestern University is a small, private college, there still exists a diverse community with lots of friendly students and faculty that want to help you on your academic journey. Here the professors and the faculty actually CARE about how you are doing academically, what you want to do in the future, and how to get there. That doesn't mean that they will baby you though."
Niche User,5,Amazing university ! The professors are very dedicated to the success of their students and many are very creative in their teaching. The campus is beautiful!
Sophomore,5,"Whether it be the financial aid office or an academic department, they will go out of their way to help you. Southwestern has so much to offer, you just have to ask! Take advantage of the events that are put on throughout the year and join any of the numerous organizations on campus."
Alum,5,"I cannot speak of Southwestern highly enough. The culture of the campus is incredible, the education is exceptional, the social life is fun. I truly realized how great of an education I received from the school once I left and began competing with peers from other institutions. Southwestern truly prepares you for graduate programs better than any other school and it encourages critical thinking."
Junior,5,"I thoroughly enjoy Southwestern. It has a beautiful campus, attentive professors, and great academic resources and material."
Alum,5,"I love the community of SAGU
Great leadership and Professors 
Campus is continuing to grow and stay up to date"
Freshman,5,"Entering Southwestern as a freshman was a bit scary, but right away my nerves were settled. I have already found wonderful friends, helpful professors and a great place in Georgetown."
Sophomore,5,"I love Southwestern University. The classes are very challenging, but the professors are more than willing to help students. The campus itself is beautiful, and the Georgetown/Austin area is a great place to be filled with many opportunites."
Freshman,5,"Before starting my freshman year, the experience was enjoyable. The staff are very friendly and helpful as well as the students. The environment is a good one, one that I will definitely enjoy learning in."
Sophomore,5,"Although at first glance I was not completely sure SU would be the school for me, after simply days there I knew that I was home. The classes are small, and the teachers truly care about the individual educations of their students. I was so encouraged in my desire to pursue not only a double major, but a minor as well. Southwestern truly encourages you to reach for your dreams. And they have so many resources available for you to actually achieve those dreams. I have found lifelong mentors and friends at Southwestern, and I highly recommend it to all!"
Niche User,5,"It offers a lot of excellent information about the majors offer and what steps to take to continue with your studies, good and safe area to live while pursuing your career."
College Sophomore,5,You will get a job after graduation. Southwestern has a good name for itself.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are probably the best in the world honestly.
College Freshman,5,"Above all else, the one thing we can all agree on is that we live on a safe campus"
College Freshman,5,Everyone is respectful and welcoming
College Freshman,5,The Career Service Office is one of the best and the Internship Services are phenomenal. Getting experience and connections to alumni or other career options are easier than you think with their help.
College Freshman,5,"The small class sizes and personal touches by the professors are why you pay so much for this school, but it is so incredibly worth it."
College Sophomore,5,"There are people on campus of all religious/non-religious and political beliefs. Everyone is very accepting and accommodating to those of religious and ethnic minorities and majorities. For the most part, everyone is very accepting of others' political beliefs. People tend to respect differing opinions and lifestyles of others if they differ greatly from their own. People of many different sexualities and sexual orientations are present on campus and are always accepted by their peers."
College Sophomore,5,The career service office is always putting on events and giving notifications for upcoming career fairs. SU alum are very active and networking is super easy.
College Sophomore,5,I've had professors ask me to go out to coffee so we could talk about what's going on when I'm down or they're worried about my emotional health. My professors love setting up lunch meetings to talk about class and what's going on in current events.
College Sophomore,5,"I was not about Greek life when entering University as I didn't want to join some party oriented group of shallow people, but Greek life at Southwestern is so much different. You can't rush until the second semester, so you already have multiple friends in all the fraternities and sororities. Greek life here is all about fostering life-long friends and giving people a place to be themselves and have a supportive community around them. Southwestern is a hazing free campus, and it is incredibly easy to join Greek life."
College Sophomore,5,"Southwestern is an entirely unique and incredible experience in itself. Classes overlap and students are encouraged to have ""Paideia"" moments, in which they make interdisciplinary connections between two seemingly very different courses. The university president is incredibly involved and welcoming. Teachers invite students to their homes for dinner and discussions over coffee. I have one-on-one connections and relationships with my professors that let me ask the questions and get the help I need. Everyone on campus is open-minded and intellectually inspired. I know I'm getting the best possible education in an environment that facilitates learning and question-asking."
College Freshman,5,"I feel completely safe walking on my campus alone. I know that we have a strong community police presence and the campus is located in a town with a very low crime rate. I don't know of any sexual assaults that have occurred on campus, at least since I have been at Southwestern. I will do anything in my power to prevent that from happening."
College Freshman,5,"Getting into the classes you want can be a little difficult because Southwestern likes to keep the class sizes small. I have learned that I have to register as soon as possible to get what I want. However, because they keep the class sizes small, it is much easier to for the professors to really get to know you. It also makes it easier to approach the professors because you know you are more than just a face in the crowd. The variety of classes is incredible and the concept of Paideia in interwoven in all of them. In fact, the variety makes it a little tough to choose a major because there are so many incredible choices."
College Freshman,5,"I have the privilege of being a member of the Varsity lacrosse team at Southwestern. In addition to the academic programs, what drew me to Southwestern as a player was the coaches. They are professional, supportive, and involved in all aspects of the players's experience at Southwestern. I appreciate the balance between academics and sports, which is one of the reasons that I chose Southwestern over a NCAA DII school. It is important to me that academics come first, followed by sports, not the other way around. In addition to being a player, I also work as an athletic trainer for the other varsity sports, so I have had the opportunity to see the school involvement. Southwestern is a small school but approximately 1/3 of the students are in some type of varsity sport. School spirit rocks and there is always a strong student presence at any sporting event. Intermural sports are as big at Southwestern as Varsity sports, so the students who don't play Varsity sports are often playing intermural. Varsity athletes are involved in intermural sports during their off-seasons also. That is one big advantage to attending a DIII school because you don't have the same constraints about what you do in your off-season. All in all, the athletics at Southwestern fit perfectly with the focus on academics."
College Freshman,5,"I was nervous moving away from my friends to attend school in Texas, but I have found new families at Southwestern University. I have my new lacrosse family, including my supportive coaches, the older player, and the players coming in with me. I also have my dorm family with whom I have participated in first-year seminars and activities. Southwestern's Paideia program creates an atmosphere that facilitates the development of new relationships. This program is unique to Southwestern and, in my college search, I found nothing else that compares to it. The program encourages students to look at the interconnectedness of all subjects and to use that knowledge of interconnectedness to guide degree and career choices. I truly feel that I made the best decision for me in coming to Southwestern. While it was hard to leave my home, family and friends, this move has provided me with opportunities that I would not have had otherwise."
College Junior,5,My school has some of the best teachers I have ever had. They are all very committed to their role as an educator and it is very refreshing to be surrounded by that compared to how rare a great teacher was at my grade schools. The environment of the school is also really great. You feel vary safe and cared about by all the staff and students. It is all around a very wonderful school.
College Sophomore,5,"I am very happy with my decision to attend Southwestern. It is a challenging school, but I believe it is preparing me for the future."
College Senior,5,"Southwestern University challenges students both academically and personally to grow into critical thinking human beings that can step outside of themselves to engage in creative ideas and diversify themselves as individuals. Through interdisciplinary ideas students are able to take concepts from multiple courses and apple them to each other and their degree. It truly is a community, everyone knows every one, and with the small size it is easier to interact with professors and develop relationships with them. I have truly enjoyed the opportunity to take classes outside of my major like dance, ceramics, theatre, religions studies and internships as well as study abroad. I think studying abroad in London has been one of my favorite experiences since I went with people and professors from my school and found it very easy to apply my studies to the vas culture of the U.K. I am so glad I choose this school, even some nights when the paper seems to hard, or my personal life is falling apart, I know I have support and can look back and say I have grown immensely."
College Freshman,5,It's fair to say that nearly every employee at Southwestern really cares about the students. Those in the business office dealing with financial aid and scholarships are no different.
College Sophomore,5,"It's easy to meet guys at fraternity parties, around Georgetown, and through friends."
College Sophomore,5,"Students at Southwestern are very safe. Currently, we are part of a national conversation about sexual assault and safety, because we care about educating each other. However, Southwestern is very safe and a great party environment."
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life at Southwesten is a huge part of campus life. Greek life is accepting but selective enough that not anyone can walk in and join. Traditional fraternity type men will be drawn towards Pike, soccer players and stoners to KA, athletes esp. football players to Phi, and gay men or less traditional Greek men to Sig. Most girls want to join Alpha Xi Delta or Zeta Tau Alpha, but less traditionally sorority-type women might prefer Tri Delta or Alpha Delta Pi. If you want to establish yourself as a somebody, go Greek!"
College Sophomore,5,"Going to football/basketball/baseball/lacrosse, etc. games is a great way to hang out with friends, sit in the sun or yell at the other team, and build school spirit. Pre-gaming suggested."
College Sophomore,5,"I was honestly surprised at the variety of options available in Georgetown. Being a suburban towns, I expected to find only chains, but it's cute small town-ess provides cafes and cute spots."
College Sophomore,5,"Fraternity parties at Southwestern are very enjoyable. Everything you're looking and dreaming for in a fraternity party: themed costumes, drinking, beer pong, and dancing. Sig offers a more alternative party scene. We've had a bit of hiccup this year because of the protestors, but next year hopefully we can re-establish the scene."
College Sophomore,5,They are honestly great. They understand that college includes partying and drinking. They work to maintain safety.
College Sophomore,5,"You might think that you can't afford a liberal arts education at a fancy school like Southwestern, but they tend to give out great scholarships if you have the grades to earn it"
College Junior,5,Hundreds of options for offcampus dining withb a variety of quality and price
College Freshman,5,I am part of the football team and the support is amazing!!  The fans are great and coaches are amazing and care
College Freshman,5,The financial aid department was very helpful and never gave us any problems even when we had to appeal.
College Freshman,5,SU is a great university. Everything is right here. The people are amazing and the professors are always there to help
College Sophomore,5,"The courses are amazing.  Very small, involved, and interesting.  The professors are very knowledgeable in their fields and there are a variety of interesting courses."
College Junior,5,While our school does not have the numbers that would make us look diverse the CDSJ has helped to cultivate a safe place that is accepting of all people.
College Junior,5,As long as you aren't an idiot you probably will never have any sort of negative interaction with SUPD. Even if you do get caught being stupid if you own up and take responsibility you're probably just going to end up going home with a warning.
College Junior,5,"Chief Brown has made our campus into one of the safest places a college student could hope to be. While sexual assault is still an issue, with several occurring in the last few years, there are significant systems in place to both prevent assault and support survivors."
College Junior,5,"With four national fraternities on campus Greek Life is big enough to include all those who are interested without completely dominating the social scene, no matter what atmosphere you like there will be a house you are welcome in."
College Junior,5,Dave Voskuil is a fantastic member of our admissions department and he personally made me feel like as though he handled everything personally and at every event I met him he remembered who I was and everything about me.
College Junior,5,I live in a house not a two minute walk away from campus and split a very cheap rent. It's cheaper to rent a house for 12 months rather than living on campus for 8.
College Student,5,"I won a 80,000 dollar scholarship. There was no application I had to do, and they only looked at my interview and admissions info."
College Freshman,5,The academic program is rigorous and has high expectations for all students. There are many opportunities for students to broaden their education here.
College Freshman,5,There was no difficulty or even criteria for the international studies program here. It's simply one of many degree plans here. The most difficulty I've had is with my academic advisor; he doesn't know anything about my program so I'm working on getting a different advisor.
College Freshman,5,"I've never felt any reason to not feel safe or secure on campus. I see campus police patrolling around the parking lots and I see a lot of admin on campus grounds throughout the day. I've only ever seen students, faculty, or parents on campus and have never heard of an instance where a ""non-student"" or anything suspicious was reported on campus. It's a fantastic environment. I could probably pitch a tent in the middle of the ""mall area"" outside and not be the slightest bit worried for my safety."
College Senior,5,"I no longer park on campus since I commute, however when I did live on campus I never had an issue."
College Senior,5,"I no longer live on campus, but when I did I had an amazing time. The dorms are incredible!"
Freshman,4,I love the professors and the opportunities available and I really excited to get back on campus as soon as it's safe.
Freshman,4,"The professors were very open and willing to make known their own insecurities while switching to online teaching which actually leveled the playing field when dealing with everything that was going on. They were real with the fact that though we need to and did continue learning, there was an authentic sense of ""we're in this together"". Which I appreciated greatly."
Sophomore,4,"The school is a great place to live, and the food is great. The students here however are very disrespectful if you share an opinion they do not agree with. Also the school is very expensive for what it is."
Sophomore,4,"Currently as a transfer sophomore at Southwestern, I can't say enough positive things about the university. There is no shortage or kindness and helpfulness on this campus. The administrative staff is unlike any I've ever seen in that they truly want to connect with the people coming in and out everyday. The students understand and value what it means to have a supportive community. It's such an incredible environment"
Senior,4,"Southwestern has been a great college experience overall. The academics are amazing, and the social life is really what you make it."
Sophomore,4,"Southwestern's campus is wonderful, along with the staff. It is just so amazing since it feels like my second home."
Sophomore,4,"Southwestern has a wonderful feeling of community, creating a campus that is usually accepting and welcoming of those curious about their field of study. However, Southwestern falls short on its humanities studies as it transfers most funds and resources into its STEM programs, neglecting certain fields. Southwestern also faces the troubles of preventing minority groups from achieving representation and acceptance on campus."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the close relationships that you are able to establish with professors and alumni since the school is so small. It makes it much easier to find opportunities to succeed in life outside of university.
Junior,4,Southwestern University allows for students to reach their full potential with rigorous curriculum; promotes a passion for young adults towards intellectual and personal growth; allows students to express their opinions openly; encourages diversity within the community; encourages students towards activism in the pursuit of justice and the common good.
Alum,4,"If you want the small school experience, you'll definitely get it at SU. Tiny classes, and you develop close relationships even with professors you only have once. The small school experience is noticeable when it comes to campus-wide events (been improving in recent years) and greek life. Overall, I enjoyed the opportunities given to me at SU.  The administration is somewhat shady/greedy, but that's typical of any school. Also, the school is notorious about covering up unsightly occurrences such as sexual assault and accidents that happen on campus. So if you find yourself in the midst of that stuff and no one is listening, SPEAK UP - protests can and have been  very effective. Horrible food. Beautiful, beautiful campus. Very expensive."
Sophomore,4,"Southwestern University is an amazing university that is fine-tuned to prepare students to be anything that they set out to be. The liberal-arts roots paired with the idea of ""lifelong learing"" insure that the students will be successful for the rest of their adult lives."
Sophomore,4,"So far so good. I have had a ton of access to resources for me to succeed academically. I play on a great sports team and my teammates are great. But socially, it's been a little hard to really bond with everyone. I am not extremely close to more than 2 people, but I do have people I can hang out with and go to a party with. Just not many lifelong friends the way people picture college."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is great on campus. They are all really nice and interact with people who aren't even in their sorority/fraternity. They throw great parties and are welcoming to everyone.
College Sophomore,4,"I do not know enough on the subject in order to elaborate when it comes to jobs. however, our Careers Services Center is very helpful in finding internships for us in the area. They have a list of students who have obtain different internships and these students are available to be contacted if you want information. They also host a formal dinner where some of these students talk about their experiences through those internships and what they recommend. They host other events to this effect to help connect students to prospective employers such as BBQs with employers in the area and internship fairs on campus. The people at the center sit down with you and help you make a plan based on your interests. Whether you are looking into something worthwhile to do during the summer or polishing up your resume, they are willing to help you. They are very friendly and welcoming."
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are usually pretty small especially when they are not core classes. The largest class I've been in had about 30 people. Labs are pretty small too and I really like that because it is much easier and comfortable to have discussions in class and the teacher gets to know you better. There are some REALLY good professors who are just super passionate about their fields and/or are really good at explaining a topic. They make class interesting and some subjects easier to digest. They are also usually very accessible or are willing to find time to meet with individuals but the student usually has to take the initiative. Professors have very different teaching styles across the board and some are definitely more appealing to specific types of people. There are only a handful or so of professors that I always hear complaint from. The majority of those complaints are NOT because of the course load or their teaching style but rather that the teachers expect a lot and I personally don't think that is a bad characteristic. There a smaller number of professors who are not very good at lecturing or do not like to help students but this number is very small and other students will usually warn you before you sign-up for their classes. Also, it is wise to keep in mind that others' experiences will be different from yours and that maybe you'll like a professor that they didn't."
College Sophomore,4,I trust people on campus enough to leave my dorm room open for quite a while if I'm in the building. I even leave stuff in the library or the classrooms and I have never had anything stolen so I trust people. I feel very safe walking to my dorm from the library even at 3:00 AM and even at those times I can see the SUPD officer in his little golf cart. I do feel a little bit more unsafe when running on the outdoors track at night since that side of campus is not lighted enough but otherwise I feel very safe all the time.
College Sophomore,4,"This school is small enough that you will probably see everyone, both students and staff, at some point even if you don't know their names. If you are very involved on campus (and most people are in one way or another) you will probably get to know a very large portion of the population. Everyone is very friendly, welcoming, and supportive. We overlook our differences, whether they are religious, political, cultural, etc., and respect each other. I think that most people on our campus realize that it is more important to work with people with different ways of thinking in order to have multifaceted conversations rather than striving to impose one's own individual beliefs and opinions on everyone else. 

Teachers are very passionate about what they teach and are very approachable; this also includes our current president who is very open to visitors and loves discussing elaborate topics with students. Students are worldly and well-rounded; most students are not only passionate about their chosen major(s)/minor(s) but also involved in sports and some sort of art form(s) (music, theater, painting, sculpting, photography, etc.).

Overall, this school is made unique in the fact that it is a community and most members are well-rounded individuals with many interests and passions who enjoy sharing those passions with others. I have felt welcomed from the very first time I set foot here and there is an over whelming amount of places to seek help when you need it."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are not always the most skilled at being teachers, but most of them love their work and are happy to help students as much as they can."
College Freshman,4,We have a lot of programs in place.
College Freshman,4,It is revered as an academically challenging school.
College Freshman,4,It is revered as an academically challenging school.
College Freshman,4,"It is a very small, family like campus. There are support pieces in place. The academic rigor is definitely challenging."
College Freshman,4,Most professor care about you as a student.
College Freshman,4,Classes are difficult but the community is great
College Freshman,4,i love the small class size
College Freshman,4,Freshman dorms are the best
College Freshman,4,"I've enjoyed being able to easily get involved. However, It is sometimes difficult to manage academics along with everything else."
College Freshman,4,There's not really a problem with safety on campus. The campus is lit up a lot at night and SUPD is easily available for any circumstance that may arise.
College Freshman,4,The cost is always going to be more expensive than living off campus but you miss out on opportunities to live with friends and it is an easy way to make friends.
College Freshman,4,The small classrooms allow you to have a better understanding in the class because you are able to work with the professor and other students very easily.  The accommodations and facilities on campus are amazing and if you need help with anything they are always there to help.  The school work is hard and demanding but the rigorous studies pay off and will help you in the future.
College Sophomore,4,"The best parties, as previously mentioned, are the only parties and they are seen at the frat houses. Unless you know someone throwing their own party, off-campus house parties aren't something anyone can show up to. I've personally met a lot of my good friends at parties, as most of the campus gets together to party together (the campus is small, remember that). I, as a female, always feel safe and I have friends within each fraternity that I know and trust. It's not like on movies and at big universities here, when you walk into a frat house, you pretty much know and recognize almost everyone there, so you don't feel so alone and freaked out."
College Sophomore,4,"The academics offered at Southwestern are great and there are so many fun and interesting classes that are cross-listed for multiple classes at once, so you can earn maximum credit and have fun while doing so. The professors are, for the most part, crazy passionate and engaging. The curriculum is always laid out clearly in each professor's syllabus. The registration process is fairly simple and goes by credit hours earned. Workload is fairly heavy for each class. As an art history major, I can expect 2-3 hours of reading every night, just for one of my four to five classes. Prothro and third floor library are prime studying places. As for study options, there are always academic tutors and your professors are always happy to meet with you (they very strongly encourage you to) and study groups are pretty easy to form."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Police are always around and park near frat row, ready to walk someone home or intervene. Sexual assault is taken very seriously and I feel very safe."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms have a really nice vibe. Students tend to know everyone in their halls and hang out together late at night. The dorms are pretty large and clean, but a little expensive."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the student population is involved in one sport or more. Everyone likes to go out and support their friends and dorm mates at collegiate sports events. Intramurals are highly advertised and have a very high participation rate. Some of the gym equipment is rather outdated or old, but everything works well is in good shape."
College Freshman,4,"It has its ups and downs, but overall it is the best place I could hope to be.  There may be schools that are easier, or more prestigious, but this place feels like home already."
College Junior,4,I love this school although the faculty is not that great
Recent Alumnus,4,My time at Southwestern University has been great and I have grown a lot as a person since I first moved in as a freshmen. I've always been somewhat of a shy and quiet person and the smaller campus helped to draw me out of my shell. I've come to know a lot of people in my classes and formed friendships with many of them. The individual attention and time I have with my professors have really been beneficial. The professors I've had so far have truly cared about their students. They've been more than willing to meet and talk about topics that I might have been having trouble with or just needed a greater explanation of. They've also been really helpful in sort of guiding me along as to what I want to do after I graduate. I've learned a great deal during my time at Southwestern and I'm glad that I chose this school.
College Freshman,4,"I am personally not involved with Greek life, but in general even non-Greeks like me are fully supportive of the Greek community, and vice versa."
College Freshman,4,"There are so many good restaurants in the Georgetown area.  From 600 Degrees pizza to Nancy's Sky Garden to the Monument Cafe and more, you will honestly run out of money before delicious dining options nearby."
College Sophomore,4,"Most students choose to live on-campus because Southwestern is a residential college, not a state/commuter school. Some students like to rent houses with friends."
College Sophomore,4,The people in the aid office are great
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I was put in a random lottery selection to which of the 3 dorms I would be assigned to. Of course, I was assigned to the oldest building when everyone crosses their fingers for the newer fancy dorms. But it's not bad at all. The roommate assignment process was great and I love my roommate, I have plenty of storage space for my things, and campus is pretty small so I'm within walking distance to everything."
College Sophomore,4,"I grew up in the area, so I'm used to everything we have. It's average cost, pretty convent, there could be more places with discounts, but its okay, and we do have a decent amount of variety. Definitely check out Dos Salsas, The Monument Cafe, and Mama Fu's. Those are my favorite non fast food restaurants to go. Fast food options that are great are Whataburger and Hat Creek."
College Sophomore,4,"People tend to do their job, but there are some things they let slide, but it doesn't affect me, so I don't really pay attention to it."
College Sophomore,4,"It's nice. People can get loud and the dorms are a little old, so you can hear through the walls, but other than that it's not too bad. Many of the dorms don't have elevators, which can be a little rough, but I don't need one. If I did, I wouldn't be able to live in the dorm I wanted too, I'd be confined to one dorm. I like it though."
College Freshman,4,We have a pretty good variety of places to eat and several of these places offer discounts and allow us to use our pirate cards which helps to free up cash
College Freshman,4,"If you do what you are suppose to, you shouldn't have any problems. Officer brown is the best!!!"
College Freshman,4,Good for on campus housing
College Senior,4,More students should come to games.
College Sophomore,4,"Still not sure if I want to rush, but I like all the Greek organizations for the most part. Everyone is nice."
College Sophomore,4,The classes are amazing! They're really small and the professors really care about every student learning.  The only thing that sucks is the very stressful workload.
College Sophomore,4,Really fun!  Sig is totally amazing and the themed parties rock.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is truly lovely with historic buildings and green, green grass.  There's a lot of sports areas (well, enough for a small school), and the coffee bar and cove are great hangouts.  However, not many people go to the events."
College Sophomore,4,"If it's something you really want to do, you will enjoy the internship, and the pay is just an added bonus. Time commitment and responsibilities are a must and teach you to manage your time better."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus police are constantly in rounds and because the school environment is small, it's easier to feel safe. the police are also very quick to access with students via email and texts to alert students in dangerous situations."
College Sophomore,4,"From what I have seen, there are pretty nice houses in great condition around school, but many of them you would definitely need a car to get back to and from campus."
College Junior,4,"With most of our students receiving financial aid, the process is certainly inclusive, the average amount is $18,000 covering a little over half tuition."
College Junior,4,Housing is fantastic for Freshmen in the FYS classes. Sophomore year there are less options but after the apartments are great but costly.
College Junior,4,I enjoy being an art major but sometimes it really sucks having to take so many required Art History classes as well as keep up with a lot of general ed requirements. The workload is as expected for art and I wouldn't expect anything less. If you're a non major it may be a lot but I think the work created is worth the amount of work you get to put into it.
Freshman,2,"Georgetown is a pretty down to earth city; the square & Blue Hole are nice. Everything pretty much closes at 7 or 8 pm because the population the makes up the city is pretty much old people.
Most of the people that come here are from small private high schools & are pretty sheltered. I guess in college they feel the need to party to an excessive extent. The whole school revolves around greek life - and this is why we’re in trouble with Title IX involving rape cases.
I once asked my professor why he made his test so much different than his assignments & he responded: ""Welcome to college."" There aren't many majors here. Not a lot of people know about this school outside of the area, unless they did research.
There are no healthy food choices here. Everything is pretty much preserved or has an unnecessary amount of preservatives or just fried. There was even a caterpillar in the sandwich. There's a reason it's a D-.
If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't come back."
College Sophomore,2,Sexual assault isn't taken as seriously as it should be.
College Freshman,2,"We could use better athletic facilities, equipment and improved attendance at sporting events."
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene is almost exclusive to the frat houses and certain off-campus houses. Bars and clubs are pretty much all located in Austin as Georgetown is a quiet, old-person city. Anyone can get into the frat houses, but alcohol is limited (you need to know people and) and to get alcohol at a registered party, you need to show your driver's license to get a wrist band that proves you're 21."
College Freshman,2,"The Commons is disgusting. I am counting down the days until I can have my own kitchen and avoid it forever.  The Cove is better but still not all that great either, though I have friends who seem to enjoy eating there. The only thing I like about campus dining is the Dining Dollars provided through the meal plan, with which you can buy starbucks drinks, milkshakes, and certain small grocery items at the Cove."
College Junior,2,The Cove is nice but your meal plan does not work here. The commons has really limited hours.
College Junior,2,Best place to live is definitely the Lord Center. Sadly it is more than double the price of other oncampus housing.
College Sophomore,2,"Most people are white, middle or upper-middle class, cisgender, and heterosexual.  Diversity is nearly nonexistent.  We have some international students, but not many.  There are quite a few gay men, but that's about it."
College Sophomore,2,There's not much to do in Georgetown.  It's pretty small with few restaurants and most shopping centers appeal to older people as opposed to students.
College Sophomore,2,There's really only a few fast food restaurants and some other places in Georgetown.  You have to go to Round Rock or Austin if you want anything other than that.
College Sophomore,2,Not great.  The dorms are very small and ridiculously priced.
College Sophomore,2,"It's what you expect, long and a hassle, but they're usually pretty generous in giving what you need depending on your household income."
College Junior,2,"The Commons are great for a month, and tolerable for about two years. After that myself and my friends all just cook for ourselves now. Cove food is excellent though at night."
College Junior,2,There is a reason we call it Crapogee. The network is usually available but leaves a lot to be desired in speed.
College Freshman,2,We have little diversity. The majority of the population is upper middle class caucasian.
College Freshman,2,"The transfer advisor is great, but the whole application process for a Spring Transfer wasn't the best experience for me. My admission decision came very late and I ended up missing our ""Sprog"" day. A lot of the questions that I had regarding transferring in addition to deadlines and dates for the Spring semester that I was very concerned about were not listed on the website and I recall lost of e-mailing different staff back and forth regarding application items and whether or not they were received.

The more important criteria for admission seemed to be GPA, essay, and what was deemed to be a well-rounded applicant based of information provided in the application.

The only tips that I could offer would be to follow-up on all information submitted to the school to ensure that it was received on time. I would also advise taking a tour of the campus, and speaking with the different advisors personally so they can see your face and get to know you more as an individual."
College Senior,2,"Not many vegetarian options, difficult to eat clean."
College Freshman,2,"This was our first year for football so it is understandable that we didn't do so well. Overall, athletics are not that great. The events are fun to attend, but don't expect Southwestern to win. "
College Freshman,2,"The parties are the same every weekend. There are parties at the frat houses Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, but expect to get burnt out quickly. They get boring. If you want to have fun then go into Austin. "
College Freshman,2,"Since the campus in in a suburb of a large city we do not have public transportation. However, there are a lot of things in walking distance. You will need a car to go grocery shopping or anything of the sort. "
Alum,1,"Worst college.experience ever.  Retention is HORRIBLE, many friends transferred to other colleges after 2 years. Drinking was paramount in the student social scene with multiple student campus deaths related to alcohol. Sexual harassment by recruiting officers and racial prejudice against black students was pervasive."
Sophomore,1,"Student life is abysmal.  The professors are old and have one foot out the door and do not care about students.  The food is pretty bad, especially on weekends when it seemed like they just through mush together and called it dinner for students.  Dorms were not bad but they will get messy in a hurry and there are some ant problems.  Especially do not attend this school if you are from outside the state because you will be miserable."
Freshman,1,"As a freshman at Southwestern University I was shocked upon arrival to move into my dorm that there was no help to assist me when I was moving all my belongings in the dorm. I received countless emails that there would be people helping me move into my dorm, but there was no help. Already, I did not have a good welcome. 
The dorms in my opinion were creepy and dated. The RA's were very unhelpful and hardly wanted to help me when I had questions about living in the dorm etc. They had attitude! 
The classes were okay- nothing special as they were described by admissions. Throughout the whole admissions process they told me how great the classes were, but they were lying. The teachers were not great. I had a theater teacher and she was so negative and burnt out with her job. I thought the Chinese department was going to be stronger, and it wasn't strong. I was very disappointed. I transferred after one semester."
College Freshman,1,I hate the fraternities. Just call them rape houses.
College Sophomore,1,"It's horrible.  It's cheaper to buy every meal separately than to be on the meal plan.  The food has such a small variety and it is all terrible.  The cove has some good options, but it's not part of the meal plan and there are few healthy options there."
College Senior,1,"Greek life is a huge part of Southwestern's culture, I do not identify with Greek life because I think I am able to network better without the hassle of rushing and paying dues."
College Sophomore,1,"There are no clubs in Georgetown, so everyone sticks to going to the frats or going to Austin. "
College Sophomore,1,"Most can probably kind of find their niche here, but I have a few friends that have said they wouldn't actively want to be seen as close friends with any of the black kids, especially if at a frat party or something... But its really not that it's an actively hostile environment for minorities or anything, just not a necessarily comfortable place for them to put their head above the fray."
College Freshman,1,"No Car, No Way – Texas doesn't believe in public transportation, so if you don't have a car then you won't be going anywhere but the Georgetown Square. The school doesn't have any way of getting the students into Austin on the weekends, unlike many schools outside of major cities. This wouldn't be a problem if the campus wasn't so tiny. You'll be ready to get off of the campus grounds by Friday. It can seriously drive you crazy being locked up in this bubble. "
College Freshman,1,"Out of Staters Beware –  While the number of out of state students does seem to be rising, the school isn't working to accommodate them at all. There are many issues that will arise living at Southwestern if Texas isn't your home. Getting to the airport is probably the biggest issue, especially if the best option flight to get home leaves at 8am. There's also the issue of culture shock. While it should be expected on a certain level, it can really put a divide between the in-state and the out-of-state. If you're brave enough to move to Texas, then it means you probably want to experience new things. The Texans here absolutely do NOT. Most of them can't even imagine being two hours away from home, and they won't understand why you are even here. They won't want to learn anything from you about what it's like to live outside of Texas, and in the end, will not appreciate the little diversity you are bringing to the school. "
College Sophomore,1,"Lower your standards – Most guys will tell you, if you plan on coming to southwestern, lower your standards on girls.. a lot."
College Junior,1,"The city of Georgetown is very similar to a retirement community! Good places to eat food, but every place that is decent is over crowded with 60+ year olds."
Recent Alumnus,1,"SU is one of the college that changes your life....in negative!
Believe me ...don't apply!! 
or 4 yrs in a boring hell!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"No Way – if you dont get drunk and use drugs, you are out!
and you dont have so many alternatives"
Recent Alumnus,1,"No Way – The worst weather in the us. unpredictable and so humid
downtown Austin it is much better"
Recent Alumnus,1,Police Doesn't Exist – Southwestern is really unsafe and u can find easily people drunk on the sidewalk

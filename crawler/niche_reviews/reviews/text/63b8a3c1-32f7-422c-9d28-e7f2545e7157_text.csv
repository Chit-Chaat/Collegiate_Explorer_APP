Junior,5,My online experience has been a bit rough from my side at least. The school has been handling it very well to say so the least. It is organized very professionally and I feel they did a great job transitioning to online classes.
Junior,5,"I would say Stetson is a very beautiful college filled with lots of opportunities with professors that care for you ever step of the way. Although it is an expensive college, it is also proven itself to be worth the money. All the opportunities it provides equal the amount you are willing to spend."
Freshman,5,My online experience has been wonderful. Each teacher takes time to invest in classes and they are patient with the new techniques.
Freshman,5,"The students and staff are very diverse and they try to find ways to include other students. Everyone is very lovable and they make you feel like if you were at home. This is my first year at Stetson and it has been a great experience. Everyone is routing for you to accomplish your goals and everyone has goals of their own. It makes you feel like if you were part of a family. For a student who loves small classes, this school is perfect for you! Teachers know you by your name and they assist you in every need."
Alum,5,"Looking back as a recent graduate of History, Stetson by far has one of the best Academic programs out there for History, Honors programs, and undergraduate research.  From this, Stetson's strengths are founded by their Professors and strong resource network. Classes are a mix of reading before class, discussions on readings, research, and lectures. From each of their programs, I have become a better researcher, speaker, critical thinker, and prepared for the professional world if I went straight in. 
Before you do anything, I highly recommend meeting with Graduate Prep and other services available from the Career and Development Office to help kickstart your post-college plans. They are available for all alumni(which is a strong network too) and are a fantastic resource to work with.  As a side note, this is not a party school like FSU; but here you'll find an inviting and thriving community alongside local events you can take part in on Stetson's Campus and downtown DeLand as well."
Freshman,5,It is a beautiful camous! They are very efficient and are always there to help you if you need it. They ahve so many resources for you to improve your academics and so much more!
Freshman,5,I haven't taken any online classes but have jumped on some webinars and they were all very informational.
Sophomore,5,"My first year at Stetson has definitely been one I will always remember.  The school academic wise is pretty great.  I know I am getting a great education at a very prestigious institution.  Stetson really cares about their students and families.  Stetson of course did not plan for the Covid-19 to happen, but they did the best they could do during the time.  They are planning thoroughly for next semester, and of course hope we can have in person classes.  Since Stetson is such a small school most students choose to go their because they can get to know their professors and have small class sizes.  Stetson is doing the best they can and are trying to help their students financially during this time as well.  I am very proud to say that I go to this University!"
Sophomore,5,"What I liked about Stetson University was how I was able learn the tools necessary to use my God-given talents and intelligence to better the world through the advancement of scientific knowledge. Stetson also has very polite people and great student life. The professors there are also very knowledgeable about their subjects, and they have taught me many things in regards to what I need to know for the rest of my life."
Alum,5,"A wonderful academic institution for higher education. I had the pleasure of attending all four years here and it made my life for the better. Small classroom sizes, lots of one-on-one interactions with professors, and a small town environment that you just cannot beat anywhere else. I want my children o attend this school someday.

I am a proud Alumni of this University. Go Hatters!"
Freshman,5,"Stetson is a great school, for students who like being able to have a connection with your teachers, and have access to the best tools to further your academics"
Senior,5,Going to Stetson was for sure one of the best decisions that I have made in my life. The small school vibe is felt in the classroom where you can build strong connections with your professors. It is placed in a perfect setting close to the beach with a nice downtown area.
Freshman,5,"Stetson is a great school, It has a beautiful campus and great student life activities, not to mention small class sizes that give you easy access to your professors to answer any questions you may have."
Sophomore,5,I love Stetson! I wanted to go to small school and this was perfect for me. The professors really care and the town surrounding is pretty cute and it’s not to fat from Daytona. I am an international student to and I really think Stetson tries hard make you feel at home. The people are amazing and very diverse which was amazing especially coming from a different country.
Sophomore,5,I love how close everyone is to each other! I love the professors and the passion for what they do! Will make friends forever!
Freshman,5,"I got accepted into Stetson University! It is a beautiful campus with great students, if you like a smaller school then this is the perfect college for you. The classroom ration is 13:1 so you get optimal one on one time with your professors."
Freshman,5,"Since I have been at Stetson University, I have been given many opportunities to get involved on campus. I have joined three Multicultural Student associations on campus as well as joined club Softball. By joining these extracurriculars I have made many associates as well as became better accommodated as a Freshman. My experience regarding my academics has been none the less great due to professors going above and beyond to assist their students on their academic journeys. The professors make it their mission to teach us lessons involving real world problems and engage us with group assignments or activities. In addition, I believe Stetson has done a great job regarding their efforts to make the campus diverse and inclusive. They have made many accommodations as a Predominately white and private Institution in order for many students of all nationalities to succeed during their four years of enrollment. I believe I made the right chose to appoint Stetson as my home away from home."
Sophomore,5,It's an amazing community. I have found my home away from home there. The campus is beautiful and it is a great group of people. I consider Stetson my home and the people there my family.
Sophomore,5,I like how inclusive and diverse stetson is along with the student programs that they put together to add culture on campus.
Niche User,5,Applied and got admitted into Stetson. The staff was very nice and accommodating. They were able to answer all of my questions during the open house. I like that they were able to separate the students and parents for the presentations.
Freshman,5,"This is a really wonderful school, close to Orlando and Daytona but not too heavily populated. Communication was one of the biggest factors I looked at when choosing my school, and Stetson was the only school that was always responsive and quick to help applicants, and that responsiveness and welcomeness remains once you’re a student here. The campus is gorgeous, the professors are extremely patient and knowledgeable, and there are a plethora of opportunities to study abroad or explore beyond your major. The school starts you off on their “Stetson Promise” which promises to pay tuition for a semester extra in case you don’t graduate in four years, and it guarantees opportunities to apply your knowledge in labs for science majors or performances for music majors rather than compete with graduate students for those opportunities."
Graduate Student,5,"Campus involvement is very big at Stetson. Stetson is located in a small town, but if the activities in the town do not entice you there are big cities close by with fun things to do."
Sophomore,5,Love the campus and academics so far. I have been very happy with my professors and the classroom environment that Stetson provides.
Freshman,5,"I'm in my freshman year at Stetson University , loving everything at the school so far.Since I have been here I haven't been home sick so that's a good sign. There is so much fun stuff to do on campus. Professors are very understanding and helpful. .Looking forward to 4 great years here getting my degree and playing college Baseball."
Freshman,5,"I am an international student from Brazil and I already feel at home here at Stetson. As I walk around the small campus, several people say hello and want to know if I'm ok. I don't feel like a number, but as someone who makes a difference in the Stetson community.
The classes are small and the professors are very good. The food surprised me because it is of good quality."
Freshman,5,"I love the fact that Stetson is a small campus with a student population of a little over 3000 students. That way, professors will be more attentive to their students vs a university with 60000 students and classrooms with 300 students. The campus itself is very warm and friendly! As you are walking around campus, you are eagerly being greeted by students, staff, and administration that are willing to help give you directions to your destination or even answering questions that a freshmen or transfer student may have. Stetson University is the university that you’d want to go to if you love a close, welcoming atmosphere as well as a stable relationship with your professor."
Senior,5,"My experience with professors is great at Stetson, because of the small class sizes. Also, relative to my friends at public universities the education is more in-depth. Lastly, the education does not just focus on theory, but practicality too."
Sophomore,5,Everyone is so helpful. Staff and other students helped to make my transfer so easy. The campus is amazing. Overall could not be happier!
Sophomore,5,"Stetson is a wonderful place to really branch out and explore different areas beyond a single major. As a music student, I love surrounding myself with such confident, supportive, and creative people that do more than just play an instrument or sing. Many even double major, which makes their jobs even more difficult to manage practice time with homework, meals, hanging out with friends, and most importantly, sleep. The services provided by the school also benefit students with resources to use in the future."
Freshman,5,"Fun, welcoming environment. Everyone is polite and willing to help. The campus is beautiful with tons of palm trees to make you feel like you are in Florida. Great location too. Lots of food downtown. And close to the beach."
Freshman,5,I have absolutely fallen in love with the atmosphere of Stetson University and I can't wait to call it home for the next four years!!
Sophomore,5,Stetson University is one of the best schools in the nation. All of the staff wants you to succeed in and out of school. There is a huge school culture and a lot they are doing for their local community and giving back.
Freshman,5,"It is a beautiful campus in Sunny Florida! I have fallen in love with all the staff, and anyone I have met there, its a dream school to go to. The classes are small which means you can have 1 on 1 with teachers and get a real connection with the class, and fully understand what you are doing. At this campus everyone is friendly and seems outgoing and like they have a bright future ahead, which is what you want to believe if you go to school here. If you have the chance and or the funds to go here it is a no brainer to attend Stetson and to experience all the amazing events they always have going on."
Niche User,5,"What I liked most about Stetson University is all the programs the university has to offer, and how much different greek clubs their are on campus. Also, how beautiful the campus is.  I also love that their graduate rate is high, that just shows that any students do finish school there.  Also, love that their campus is VERY safe."
Freshman,5,Stetson University is an amazing and eclectic community of caring and conscientious students. Each person's uniqueness is appreciated and there are so many opportunities to tap into potential.
Niche User,5,They respond to emails quickly and provide all the information you need. They are kind and their website is easy to navigate through.
Freshman,5,"Not only is Stetson a beautiful campus, it has some of the most amazing professors. The people on this campus and the professors that teach here have made this a wonderful college to attend."
Sophomore,5,"Stetson University is a very welcoming school. I felt like I fit in and belonged to a community on my first day at campus. I am very happy with my choice. The campus is small enough to see familiar faces, but there’s also plenty of opportunities to meet new people and get involved on campus life."
Freshman,5,"I love it. The academics are challenging, but it means I am actually learning something. The people are all great as well"
Freshman,5,I really like how Stetson University cares about their students.  Their academic success plan for each major and student is the perfect amount of balance.
Niche User,5,"I loved the small campus. The brick buildings are absolutely beautiful. Stetson has small class sizes which makes it easier for students to contact their professors. Students also have free resources such as resume helpers, tutoring, and a library."
Niche User,5,Stetson is a high acheiving school that also makes everyone feel welcomed as well as included. There academic achievements are extraordinary and the student life seems very fun and welcoming to new students.
Junior,5,The Csmpus  is beautiful and the town has a lots to do. The school has clubs or groups for everyone not matter your likes
Sophomore,5,"Stetson University is a great place to receive not only your education, but also an all around college experience. Stetson hatters are some of the nicest people your life will expose you to!"
Freshman,5,Stetson is a beautiful campus with high student involvement. The class size is very small which makes communicating with the professors very easy. The professors are amazing.
Alum,5,"I am in love with Stetson University. For those of you who don't know about Stetson, I recommend that you visit. I love how it feels like I am back at home with my family. I feel safe, loved, welcomed and happy."
Junior,5,"Stetson University has given me the experiences and the support I have always wanted in a college. The small class size allows me to develop close relationships with the teachers and students, building a network of valuable connections that will be important throughout my college career and beyond."
Senior,5,"Academically rigorous, but faculty and staff are all very supportive and want you to succeed. There are loads of resources in all different areas should a student need additional support. The campus is simply beautiful and they care about the environment. They use native plants and build green aspects into all of the new buildings. Classes are very small when compared to state schools and that results in a very personal experience with the faculty. People know each other on campus. It is a tight community feel and a diverse population. I would definitely recommend."
Niche User,5,The times i have been at stetson were the greatest of times. I will be attending in the fall and Stetson is a great school and I would pick any other to go to.
Niche User,5,"From first look, Stetson's campus is very beautiful and very well-organized, but on the inside I can tell that the school is more heavily focused on getting things that needs to be done and less of a party mood. I very much enjoyed this type of mood because I care about finishing college without any distractions and that is the vibe that I get from Stetson University."
Niche User,5,Very affordable campus in Central Florida. small class sizes and the many resources available to students to insure academic success.
Freshman,5,It's my favorite school ever. The dorms are nice and everyone at the school is very friendly and welcoming.
Freshman,5,"I love the way professors are, so helpful.  I am from Puerto Rico and that means that the English is my second language and they help me even more with my works.  I am doing my best and they see that.  I am not just a student.
Classes are great, I love my biology class so much.  
I know I made the right decision to move to Stetson University.
The campus is a lovely place, quiet where you can be yourself and nobody judged you."
Alum,5,"Stetson University has incredible faculty, staff and students that strive to create an inclusive and challenging educational environment. I felt very at home at Stetson, and greatly appreciate the time that I spent there.
Over the past few years, there have been a few administrative decisions that have been questionable, such as unusual aesthetic additions and a large enrollment increase without sufficient housing opportunities. Much of the campus has been under construction as of 2017, which created some short-term inconveniences but will (hopefully) lead to long-term improvements!"
Sophomore,5,"I'm in my second semester and love it here! The environment is so healthy and it is a beautiful campus. The small class sizes allow you to get your teachers and classmates better, and allows for more discussion based classes instead of lectures."
Junior,5,"Although it is expensive, the professors care about the students and I have no complaints about the school."
Niche User,5,I liked the classroom and how students have connections with the teachers. Th campus is also beautiful. The atmosphere at the college is breathtaking with positivity overflowing.
Sophomore,5,"I am starting my sophomore year here and I love it. All of the professor are great and the students are good too. The professors are willing to help you and meet after class; all you have to do i ask or go to them during their office hours. The food in the Commons (the cafeteria) is pretty good. We have an Einsteins Bagels and Johnny Rockets on campus. We are in the middle of expanding, so there is quite a bit of construction going on though.  We have a lot of P-Safe (Public Safety) people around we also have emergency buttons that you can push to notify the local police all over campus. If you are out late at night, all you have to do is call P-Safe and they will come to you with a golf cart and take you anywhere (as long as it is on campus)."
Niche User,5,I went to their orientation and professor and students there were so nice. The lesson that they thought you were not boring and they made it interesting.
Freshman,5,"I was truly amazed with the amount of information, quick responses to any questions and engaging staff that Stetson has. It is because of their genuine care to help make me significant and not just a college number that I have chosen Stetson University to continue my education."
Alum,4,"Stetson is a small college with a wide variety of people and groups. The smaller amount of people gives it kind of a high schooly vibe, where everyone knows everyone, this is definitely both a good and a bad thing here. Academics vary depending on your major. Business, political science, music and psychology are all great programs with engaging professors who want to see you succeed. The school of health science is very lacking in funding and staff. Night life is fun, frat if is popular but you do not need to be apart of it to have fun."
Alum,4,"We had to switch halfway through the Spring 2020 semester due to COVID-19, and the History Department quickly set up a plan and transitioned to fully online classes starting in Mid-March.  My Professors were quickly able to provide the highest quality of education they could given the circumstances and were very accommodating as they were in person.  I have not taken a class exclusively online, but Stetson has high caliber Professors who are able to work through the online barrier with high efficiency."
Freshman,4,So far Stetson has been an awesome school. The people are extremely nice and welcoming and want to help you no matter what. They all want to help you with your college choice no matter if its Stetson or not because they truly want what's best for you. The campus is also absolutely gorgeous and very clean and many buildings new.
Sophomore,4,"I love the fact that Stetson is a small community. Class sizes are small enough to where we can have open classroom discussions, and professors get the chance to know you personally. Additionally, I would like to see a change in housing. Students pay way too much to live on campus and the dorms are not up to par; we don’t get what we pay for."
Senior,4,"Stetson is excellent at providing opportunities for students and promotes self growth and pushes students to be their best, both academically and socially as there are multiple social organizations on campus. Being a freshman orientation leader for 2 years and going into my senior year I can also say that Stetson puts a lot of its effort into the incoming class, so take advantage of all of the opportunities that are being presented to you. It may seem like a lot but you’ll be happy you got involved earlier on as the campus is quite small and everyone falls into their own group"
Senior,4,"Thankfully a lot of my professors adjusted our online learning and were considerate and very reasonable with timelines and were able to recognize which assignments were just not able to be completed. Stetson has also provided all of the students to online access to campus resources (such as tutoring) and Stetson has created virtual cultural credit options (needed to graduate). Overall Stetson has accommodated to my needs and pleased me, but not all professors were as nice as mine"
Senior,4,"Stetson is known for having a small, intimate campus. This is why I chose Stetson and I've had professors that care about me. Some of the best and most knowledgable teachers."
Sophomore,4,Stetson University is a great school. The campus is beautiful and the teachers are eager to assist and accommodate for extenuating circumstances. They sincerely want to see you succeed.
Alum,4,"Stetson is a very nice school, on the smaller side so you will see similar faces every day but you will also see new ones. Academics are good, professors are mostly friendly and the social scene is something that you will have to put time and effort into."
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere and community that is present at the school. Professors are genuinely interested in all of their students lives and what helps them personally succeed. Peers will constantly smile and wave at you or even make small talk even if you have only met them once. The student led exercise classes are extremely uplifting and create a fun time even if your sweating to your death. What I don't enjoy about the school is how cheap and difficult they are with providing financial aid to students.
Freshman,4,Stetson has the best environment and the smallish town where everyone is so closed-knit. Stetson University is a private university with four colleges and schools located across the I-4 corridor in Central Florida with the primary undergraduate campus in DeLand.
Alum,4,The professors are incredible; they truly care for the students and are willing to help out in any way they can.
Freshman,4,"Stetson is a good school if you want to be challenge. I'm only a freshman right now but so far its been okay. Stetson is a diverse campus , this is an excellent to have if you want to surround your self with different cultures. But I'm not a fan of the food, I do have a meal plan but I don't use it as much because its not the best food I've had. Also stetson is quite expensive so I recommend doing scholarship's and save up."
Sophomore,4,"This school is great when it comes to academics. The professors here set you up to advance in life and they really care about your academic success overall. I love the small class sizes because you are able to connect with your professor in order to enhance your academic success. The classes are tough but that will only make you better in your field and you will be recognized and paid accordingly to the work you put in. One thing I would like to see change would be the food on campus. I feel as though there should be something added to the food flavor wise. On that note , I’d also like to see more options that students are able to choose from when dealing with meal swipes."
Senior,4,"Stetson is a very good environment to be in. The professors are always willing to talk and discuss anything at any time, the campus life is thriving, and people are so friendly. The education level is at an all time high and it is a very rigorous course load. I highly recommend it if you are motivated and responsible."
Freshman,4,"When I was looking through colleges to apply to, I didn't even know Stetson University existed or was a good option to go to. But after applying and touring the college, the campus and welcoming students immediately captured my heart. The music program is absolutely incredible. We have the rare opportunity to have lessons with professors everyday to hone our skills in music. The faculty care so much about their students as well. With the smaller student population, it is easier to get help from teachers in class. The only thing I dislike about Stetson is the price of tuition. Upwards of $70,000 a year is a little outrageous, but it makes sense since it is a private school. Now that I'm here there is no doubt in my mind that this is the right place for me."
Freshman,4,The community at Stetson is one of the most friendly and welcoming places. Every since I got here I've made so many friends who I think will last a lifetime.
Senior,4,AACSB accredited in both Business and Accounting. Small school with strong academics and excellent professors!
Alum,4,"I was 17 when I started my Freshman year at Stetson as eager to have my independence and start a new journey similar to all of my peers. Though the town the school was in, Deland, was nicknamed Deadland I did not mind. Not having much going on was ok because it allowed me to focus on my academics. Even though I did not get as much from my philosophy degree as others did. I had some of the best professors I think I will ever have. They challenged us to think beyond, to consider other ways of reaching a conclusion and they were passionate about their lectures. One thing I would love to see change is the activity in the town. To go to a good mall you had to travel at least an hour."
Freshman,4,"Stetson is very diverse and the student life is great there, the professors care about your success and safety. The athletics are all treated equal no sport is better than any other and the campus is nice just like their food."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus and the overall atmosphere. All of my professors know me well and I am able to get academic resources very easily. And the people are great!
Sophomore,4,"So far I absolutely love all of the teachers; they are all extremely invested in their students and in helping us. Beautiful campus!!! Wonderful library and computer access (though it'd be helpful if there were more Macs instead of in two labs that have been closed at the same time before). Food's pretty good, too, lots of options.

 Inter-departmental communication is a big drawback though, and there are plenty of big events where you're told you need to go one place for this one thing, and the people there know nothing about it. And response to dorm situations has been...okay. I'm paying a lot of money for this dorm, and I would hope the problem could be fixed."
Freshman,4,"Stetson is a lovely school aesthetic-wise and has a very friendly staff. It really seems like a school that prepares you to come out a success since most kids come out with jobs, and I don't hear many complaints. My biggest issue is that the website is very difficult to navigate to find appropriate information, and sometimes it's difficult to get a clear answer to your questions. Other than that, I think so far it's great."
Sophomore,4,Everything at Stetson is great. There's great people and clubs and teachers. The only thing that I had a problem with was the lack of effort to make diversity on campus as important as everything else.
Freshman,4,"Stetson is a great school! Since it is small, professors really get to know you and they actually care about you and can spend more time helping you. Everyone is super nice, including the students. There are tons of opportunities for you to grow and get involved. The town DeLand is a cute close-knit community, there are tons of way to be involved outside of campus as well. The only downside of this school is the cost, it can be pretty expensive and there are many ways that you can get charged (like losing your dorm key). If you're looking for a party school, Stetson is not the school for you. Stetson is very academic and rigourous, so the lack of a party life may be downside if that is what you are looking for."
Junior,4,"Nice enough school with a nice campus and interesting ways to get involved in student life. Small student body and in a relatively small town. Not a ton to do in town, but not too far from Daytona or Orlando, so a car is recommended. Not a lot of parking depending on your housing. Very expensive, but you'll have a more personal relationship with your teachers."
Senior,4,"Opportunities are fantastic. Teachers are great. Good resources for students, both academic and non-academic. Lots of opportunities to volunteer, learn and grow into productive members of society."
Junior,4,"Stetson's campus is beautiful and the students here are all friendly. I love the size of the school, you will almost always see someone you know when walking to class."
Sophomore,4,"I love going to Stetson. The campus is beautiful, the academics are great, and the professors are top notch. Housing is pretty average. Freshman dorms aren't great but the other buildings are nice. There's a lot of animal friendly housing, too. The food is continually improving, but right now it's decent. Our new coffee shop has a lot of options including sandwiches, fruit cups, salads, sushi, and pastries. There are not a lot of vegan options on campus, though. Class sizes are really small, and professors are easily accessible. I have had several really incredible professors who care about the success of the students. Greek life on campus is pretty small, but we have a lot of fun. The party scene is pretty good, but if you're looking for more than just a lot of frat parties and a couple clubs downtown, Stetson isn't it. Diversity is somewhat lacking at Stetson, mostly when it comes to faculty. Overall, Stetson is a great school."
Niche User,4,It is a pretty good college. They have a very good music program. The professors are helpful and attentive to you.
Junior,4,"I love my school! The professors are amazing, and I love the versatility in the degrees here. There is always something going on! I love the people here! It's a beautiful campus! I wish we would get more food options outside of the main dining hall. I also wish that the wifi was more reliable."
Alum,4,The thing I loved most about Stetson University was the people I met there. It has an incredible community filled with people who care about you. The class sizes are great and your professors want you to do well. Stetson is small but it has left a lasting impact on me. A great perk is you will attend a University that has a beautiful campus.
Sophomore,4,"I like the various amounts of academic and volunteer opportunities. The professors and administrators are easy to reach and willing to both listen and help their students. The overall environment has allowed me to grow both as a person and academically, and I've made relationships to last a lifetime."
Sophomore,4,I like the atmosphere that is at Stetson University. The campus is small but very nice and has a lot of ancient history behind it. The people are diverse and come from different backgrounds and have different stories.
Senior,4,I love how stetson university is diverse when it comes to the students that attend the school. they do not have a dominate race that attends the school everyone has an equal chance to get in because it is not about race it is about what you bring to stetson university to make the school a better place.
Senior,4,"I like the atmosphere here, very friendly and strongly connected community. We have a lot of great professors, friendly staff, engaging classes and more. The biggest difficulties are funding (we're a rather expensive private school, and when tuition goes up, don't expect your scholarships to follow) and clubs. Right now our campus is so focused on diversity and inclusion that they've manged to go the other way, anti-discrimination. As someone who's trying to restart a Christian club on campus, being told that we can't require our leaders to adhere to a Christian code of conduct is frustrating. Whether or not we resolve this remains to be seen."
Senior,4,"Stetson University is a wonderful college filled with amazing professors who are always willing to help you out. Being at a small campus lets you really get to know your classmates and the faculty around you. The courses are rigorous and require a lot of study-time outside the classroom and attendance is required for most courses, but the knowledge and skills gained from the university are things that you will be able to utilize and apply in your daily life. The only downside is the cost of tuition. Unless you get a full-ride or near full-ride scholarship, you will graduate in a cesspool of debt."
Junior,4,Picking a college to attend was a really hard decision for me considering I am not a very good decision maker.  When choosing a college it had to have a gorgeous campus and not too many students.  Stetson has just that.  Stetson campus is so pretty it makes walking to class that much better.  The best part about stetson is the student to faculty ratio which is around 1:13.  All of the teachers I have had so far knew my name and who I was as a person.  That is hard to find in a University.  The teachers at Stetson want you to succeed and go far in life.  They are always willing to help all you need to do is ask.  The opportunities and help Stetson has is awesome
Senior,4,"Although Stetson is a small school with some retention concerns, students must find themselves at home while on campus. As an incoming senior I know I made the right choice with my education and I understand my peers that transferred earlier on- the small population and small class sizes weren’t fit for them and that’s okay! Stetson offers great , in depth courses where you truly get to know your professors and feel like you’re not just student #123"
Sophomore,4,"I am only a sophomore but I have learned a lot about this school from my first year. It is a private college with very small campus and small number of students, which is the perfect environment for me. They have decent resources and faculties where you can ask questions and get good answers."
Sophomore,4,"Stetson has been a great first year Freshman experience. I have become very involved on campus and have received great academic support.  The small student to professor ratio provides an atmosphere that supports success. 
Food needs improvement but that should be helped by the new dining facilities opening this fall."
Sophomore,4,Stetson is my home away from home. The campus is beautiful. The dorms could use a facelift on the interior. Students are friendly and professors are willing to help when needed. My favorite place on campus is the duPont Ball Library.
Alum,4,Knowledgeable and caring professors and rigorous academic study. Plenty of clubs and organizations that one can join to provide community service or simply to learn about other cultures and demographic groups. A very enriching college education experience.
Freshman,4,"I am finishing up my first year at Stetson and I love it. Everyone is super friendly, great professors, great academic resources, and the campus is beautiful."
Junior,4,"Stetson University is a great institution with very knowledgable teachers. In my  3 years at stetson, I have been exposed to great literature and an abundance of knowledge from the faculty. Stetson is a small school which provides a smaller student to teacher ratio. I believe this is extremely important when considering what university you'd like to attend. The teachers here know you by name and care about you succeeding."
Freshman,4,I went for one semester and had to take an early medical leave. The majority of the staff is really nice and super helpful.
Sophomore,4,I liked that the professors usually do attempt to be available for their students. The food isn't the best and they can easily fool people into thinking the dorms are better quality than they actually are due to the buildings being of differing quality.
Senior,4,"The tuition is overpriced, but the professors are great. A lot of one on one time with your professors. If you have a question, you can just knock on their office door and they are there to help you. Space wise, Stetson is accepting more people that the number of people they can accommodate. The music program is top notch, but we still do not have a performance hall. Instead of the Welcome center, we need to build a performing arts center for all the musicians."
Junior,4,"Being a Stetson student means being a thinker, walking across a glimmering campus that is the home to historic brick buildings and palm trees, and enjoying the lovely downtown area."
Junior,4,The Stetson Music school is a rewarding program to be a part of. My complaint is simply that Stetson is trying to increase enrollment and our music building doesn’t have to capacity to take more students. Currently we do not have enough practice rooms and we need a concert hall for the opera program as well as the symphonic band.
Junior,4,"Stetson has a beautiful campus. The administration has a lot of work for improvement, but the teachers at Stetson truly care for their students. There are so many ways for students to get involved on campus."
Alum,4,I had an incredible experience at Stetson. Many professors are still close mentors and instilled in me a passion for academia. I loved the sweet town of DeLand and the proximity to natural springs and the beach. I was also able to get involved in several campus organizations and build an incredible community of peers.
Niche User,4,Cliche small happy buddy-buddy atmosphere. Really good teachers and very big library. I'm excited to attend.
Senior,4,"Stetson University is a wonderful institution full of eager students, inspiring professors, and an opportunity to better yourself personally and professionally.  Many professors care a great deal about their students and will do anything to help them succeed."
Sophomore,4,First year and I loved it! It's a great environment to study ! :) I meet a lot of new people and there's a lot of great opportunities!
Sophomore,4,Stetson University is a great school. The atmosphere is amazing and it is an amazing place to get your education. I have not had any problems there. The administrative staff is always eager to help you in any way that you need.
Freshman,4,"Stetson University is a great private school in DeLand, Florida. The campus is one of the most gorgeous campuses I've ever laid eyes on (and I've visited about 30 schools up and down the East Coast). The faculty is so enthusiastic and passionate, and everyone has such a strong dedication to ensuring student success. I moved to Florida from my home state, New York, just to attend. It has been everything I expected it to be. The professors are truly caring and informative, the student body is extremely welcoming, and it really feels like home to me. My one complaint would be the food. The food on campus is pretty horrendous, and I'd really like to see that change."
Senior,4,Beautiful campus. I love the small class sizes and the many resources available to students to insure academic success. I am very happy with my decision to study here!
Junior,4,"Stetson is a very diverse school. It has small class sizes that allow students to really get to know their professors. They do have some ""knock out classes"" that will really test you skill depending on your major. It's a great learning experience with understanding professors that will take the time to get to know you and help you out, whether you're still currently in their class or not."
Freshman,4,"Nice campus, but in a boring city, there's not much to do around here.
Class sizes are small and there's lots of resources to utilize if you ask for them.
there is construction that will continue into summer of 2018 which is annoying"
Alum,2,"If the School of Music does not take on the task of bringing itself into the 21st century, it's not going to make it and will eventually be forced to suffer accreditation.  One of the requirements to belong to the prestigious National Association of Schools of Music to provide ample practice and performance space.  How they get a pass on this I do not know.  The school is currently the only school of its caliber and size in the entire Eastern United States without a modern, professional performance hall.  They have a small chapel which has long outgrown the school.  The Symphonic Band crowds on temporary risers which are dangerous, the Jazz Band must perform off campus and there is no legitimate theater space anywhere for Opera or Musical Theater productions.  The did have a theater at one time, but it got too old and tore it down without replacing it.  For the price and high quality of instruction, this is inexcusable.  It shows lack of support on the part of university leaders."
Senior,2,"The school feels like it’s going South with stricter rules, good professors firing, and incompetence staff through out the school."
Sophomore,2,It’s a nice campus but there’s nothing to do in deland area. I feel like it’s high school all over again with all the rules the school has
Junior,2,"Great Academics and professors, however, administration does not seem to care about students voice. Required meal plan for freshman and sophomores are just about making money. Tuition has gone up every year I have been here and there has been zero change to my scholarships."
Junior,2,Nothing special about the school. Lots of wooded areas for biking or walking which is fun but nothing to do party or hang out wise the school is more for work in my opinion
Freshman,2,The campus is beautiful but the price to come here is pathetic. The dorms are average - unless you live in Chaudoin Hall. Greek life is horrible. The professors are average and the staff are barely there.
Freshman,2,"Currently a student at stetson. Terrible experience. The academics are good, but the campus is so tiny you can cover the whole thing in 3 minutes tops. You see the same people over and over so if you don't have great friends it can be tough. The party scene is non-existent so don't plan on going out. Alcohol free campus. Deland is a dump, and the food on campus is absolutely awful. One small buffet every day for each meal. Do not come to Stetson unless you want to go to high school all over again"
College Junior,2,The housing options on campus are fair and offer a variety of different living options for students of all ages.  The largest problem with housing at Stetson stems from the administrative staff that runs the department of Housing and Residential Life.  This department is entirely unorganized and unprofessional in most aspects.  Many of the staff members are under qualified and not very helpful with their jobs tasks.  It is nearly guaranteed that you will have one negative run in with Housing at Stetson during your time attending.  Staff members like Barbara Hawkins clearly do not know how to execute their tasks and often leave a very unprofessional taste for students and family members that attempt to communicate with the university.  The cold and difficult persona that she presents makes it impossible to communicate with the school regarding housing issues.  I would recommend reaching out to anyone else on staff as they probably offer even a little more help than Barbara as she attempts to iron out her personal issues with the human race and develop some form of customer service and people skills.
College Sophomore,2,"Most people come from upper middle class families. If you are poor and have problems affording this college you will find people who can sympathize with you to, but be careful because some of these sympathizers are just rich kids mad about getting their scholarships taken away cause they cannot cut it grade wise. The school is predominately white but minorities can find clubs such as the black student association. Most people at the school are straight, so if you are gay you will most likely need to find a partner elsewhere."
College Sophomore,2,Greek organizations have pretty bad substance abuse problems which many faculty advisers ignore. If you are anti drug do not be vocal about it since it can ostracize you pretty quickly (personal experience).
College Sophomore,2,"I cannot speak much on this topic because I've never invested my time into the athletic spectrum of the school. From what I hear, our sports teams are mediocre."
College Freshman,2,"The degree I want (nursing), Stetson doesn't have."
College Junior,2,When you start receiving money from other scholarships; the school then finds reasons to not give you the full amount of money that is originally given to you. They will say you didn't do as well as the year before. Many students are having issues with this problem of the school being stingy with the students money.
College Freshman,2,"It could be worse, but barely. The commons is atrocious from insects in food to lipstick on ""washed""  glasses. Not to mention oddly flavored but varying quality ""mystery"" meat frequently. The Einsteins sandwiches are amazing however the main problem is there is only one kind per week and horrendously timed meal periods. The Johnny Rockets Burgers are also decent yet take a while. All in while if you have the money you will order pizza all the time. If you don't? Ramen from their overpriced convince store."
College Junior,2,"There are only 2 apartment complexes that accept students, so they can be competitive to get into.  They are both approximately 15 minutes away from campus, so you need to have a car or rely on your roommates because it's a mile walk with no sidewalk or streetlights and several hills to get to the closest bus stop. Even so, the buses do not run very often, so it will take approximately the same amount of time to take a bus as it does to walk the entire way.  And the walk takes you through a bad part of town.  But it is still worth it not to live on campus.  Their rules are overbearing, the housing staff is hard to deal with, and they are outrageously overpriced.  Living off campus is much cheaper."
College Junior,2,"The meal plan requirement is a ridiculous scam to screw students out of even more money.  The service at the on campus restaurants is awful, and the food standards are sub par.  Einsteins has left the plastic attached to my cheese and toasted it and given it to me. They have also given me stale bread and bagels numerous times.  The price of each meal is several dollars more than what they give you if you paid cash.  It is ridiculous that you cannot use your own money on your friends or whenever you want to eat.  The limited menu of what you can get for a meal swipe is preposterous.  The amount of meals required is simply too much for one person to eat, so they are forced to let their money be wasted on a weekly basis.  Everything about the meal plan is unfair and an evil money-grab.  Newton's was the best restaurant the school had, with a variety of good food, and they got rid of it."
College Junior,2,"The residency requirement is too long.  The list of items you are not allowed to use is too comprehensive.  The kitchens are not well kept.  No one cleans them.  Certain people get blamed for others' noise and there is nothing they can do about it.  People are irresponsible with trash and recycling, and then the entire floor is threatened."
College Sophomore,2,I had to take out an enormous amount of loans! Very little need-based aid here.. All I have to say is thank god my high school grades were good.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you go to frats, you're not likely to find a real party around here. Maybe off campus if you're cool hanging out with high schoolers and townies."
College Sophomore,2,Little selection and the commons is well known for giving food poisoning.
College Junior,2,"Stetson makes it very difficult and/or expensive for freshman, sophomores, and juniors to move off campus.  While seniors are automatically kicked off and have a hard time applying to stay on campus.  There are not a lot of options in the town, because the space is taken up by retirement homes.  Finding nice off campus housing places requires having a car and being willing to commute 15-20 minutes."
College Freshman,2,the administration is kind of ignorant to the students needs
College Junior,2,I am classified as independent and do not have a co signer for additional loans. I am struggling to pay for housing on campus. Financial aid do not appear to help student with such hard circumstances.
College Freshman,2,"The only parties at school that are decent is at the frat houses specifically Delta Sig and Sig Nu. Delta Sig is primarily for people who drink and Sig Nu and for people who dance and drink or just dance. However, the Dj provided sucks and it's a student. The sound system is mediocre and you would rather go off campus to enjoy nightlife."
College Freshman,2,"I am unhappy at Stetson, the facilities, food, community, closed minded individuals make this school hard to enjoy."
College Freshman,2,"The music always sucks, the Caribbean parties are fun though. However don't expect to be turnt up at Stetson. A car  is needed to have fun to find entertainment elsewhere"
College Freshman,2,Very few options. RAs are vey lax and unsupportive. There are no events to build  community within the dorms
College Freshman,2,"No good school spirit, athletes lack enthusiasm as well"
College Junior,2,"As the student body has increased, the level of competition to get a bid has increased which is a new dynamic for Greek Life.  The sororities also have a tendency to look down on non-affiliates and have become increasingly clique-y. (This is coming from an affiliate."
College Junior,2,"Considering the amount of tuition increase on a yearly basis, there is no consideration for tuition increase and the academic based scholarships are not always reflective of a student's academic history in high school."
College Junior,2,"As a review for the administration, they've limited us severely within the last two years.  They don't allow anyone in the Commons unless he's eating there (not a policy my freshman year), the Coffee Shop is closed Saturdays, overall, a negative administration."
College Junior,2,Not many options or people to rent to students
College Sophomore,2,It's so unhealthy. It tastes like grease and other nasty things. They don't even know how to cook rice. You are required to have a meal plan for two years despite it being awful.
College Junior,2,"There isn't too much diversity on campus, to be honest. There's enough racial diversity so no one can say the school DOESN'T have it but it's still overwhelmingly one demographic in particular (white). There isn't too much of a variation with economic background either; many students I have encountered are from a higher middle class background. As for political beliefs, I would say the campus is fairly liberal but, again, that is from observation and those I have encountered. There is NOT a big variation with sexual orientation. If there is a LGBT alliance organization on campus then they are EXTREMELY quiet. There's hardly any representation for this community. As for religion, this is the category that is more diverse. There is a good number of organizations for students of different religions to join and connect to other students."
College Sophomore,2,i do not know of any transportation available to students
College Sophomore,2,gets very boring and old after awhile
College Freshman,2,The areas around town are sketchy and there aren't many choices aside from crappy houses
College Freshman,2,Walking places downtown is easy but going anywhere else you need a car.
College Freshman,2,Too small and feels like high school. Wish I had applied to more schools and actually visited before I attended.
College Freshman,2,Dorms feel old and dirty. Not that nice. Some dorms are nicer than others.
College Freshman,2,Many crimes go on in the town outside of campus but still very close to campus. Dorms are moldy and disgusting. Not a very safe area.
College Freshman,2,its Florida weather. Florida weather is ALWAYS BAD!
College Junior,2,"There are really no bars or clubs, just restaurants and a few dingy sports bars."
College Junior,2,"There are no scholarship opportunities through the school for graduate students, which I think is completely ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,"I am a picky eater who eats based on textures first and taste second.  I have texture issues with most of the meats served in the Commons.  They are getting better since they switched food providers, but it's a slow process.  The Commons is a buffet-style and as such, one must pre-pay in order to get in, which is frustrating because the online menu is never up-to-date and the menu outside of the door is only sometimes up-to-date.
I would say the best aspect about the Commons are the omelets made at breakfast.

Each student on a meal plan can choose to exchange a meal for certain foods at one of several on-campus dining options such as 2Mato (Italian food, mostly pizza and strombolis), Einstein Bagels, Nitelites (ice cream), or the coffeeshop.  Flex points can also be used in these places as well as at the on-campus convenience store."
College Freshman,2,Not much to do on weekends
College Sophomore,2,"The dinning halls them self are very nice but the value of the food offered is poor. There are moments that I have to eat the same food for lunch and dinner. Also, the system it self makes you pay before you go into the cafeteria, meaning you can't just go in and pay for a salad or a drink, but you are charged a flat rate."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms at Stetson are not anything special, and are pretty small. The good thing about my dorm is that it has be refurbished and is in a good location"
College Sophomore,2,"Well in DeLand, Florida when it rains, it doesn't just rain it floods! 
When it rains at night, it's just the worse because not only are the roads flooded but the street lights in DeLand are so dim it's impossible and a struggle to even see what's ahead of you.

When it get's hot, it's muy caliente!! However, I live 20 minutes away from Daytona Beach and NSB, and 1 minute away from the school pool so i'm lucky :-)"
College Sophomore,2,"The small downtown area of Deland is cute because of the antique shops and small town dining. But not much to do for college students on weekends. The movie theater is about 20-25 minutes away, all of the downtown shops close around 5 or 6. Only one red box movie rental machine and all the good movies are never available. The closest mall is about same distance as theater or maybe a little further. Again it is a cute town but there really is not much to do."
College Sophomore,2,"We have a newly established football team that will be playing their first real season this upcoming year, the alumni are all pretty excited, but the majority of the student body is less than enthusiastic."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking at Stetson is horrible, there are not nearly enough spaces for everyone that has a car. Public safety has a strict parking pass policy before 4pm and each lot is color coded per parking permit. So driving to class is not advised unless you want a $75 parking ticket."
College Sophomore,2,"Nightlife is pretty limited, everyone starts at the frats and then heads to the bars around midnight. Other than that, there isn't really all that much to do, unless you drive to Daytona or Orlando, neither of which is all that far away."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is not central at Stetson. There are a few sororities and a few fraternities but they are not everyone's main focus. The focus here is more academic and less partying, however there are still parties. I feel like the people who participate in greek life don't exclude people who aren't in it. It's a school of about 2,500 students so everyone becomes tight knit."
College Senior,2,I am not a greek myself so I am unsure of the exact housing situation for them. I did feel a little out of place in one of my upper level classes because they seemed to have all been part of a sorority but I also have friends who are greek and they don't judge. Maybe I don't realize the judging but greeks don't bother me.
College Senior,2,"The parking permit for the school is about 75 bucks. I have gotten a ticket for parking in the wrong spot because there were no spots left. I feel that if I am paying that much for tuition and a parking sticker, they should invest in more commuter parking."
College Junior,2,"There are very few dining options off campus, the small town of deland florida doesn't have too much to offer"
College Junior,2,"because my school is very expensive it is kind of difficult to even talk to someone in financial aid, but when they are able to see you they try to help as much as they can but sometimes don't know what there doing. the school keeps a lot of the staff in the dark when they do changes so it is a lot harder for the financial aid people to do there jobs."
College Junior,2,"the housing is horrible unless you live in stetson cove, UVA, or hall A. it used to be a fairly easy process until they switched to electronic housing selections my sophomore year, and allowed the freshman to enter the apartments before upperclassmen. which is really bad and because of it the school is having many problems with the student body"
College Freshman,2,"Well, because I'm a picky eater AND a vegetarian, the food and dining options receive a C-. The food is mediocre at best and since I only eat but so much and only certain things, Stetson just isn't outstanding. There's no variety, mostly the same things everyday. One thing I can say is exceptional is the Coffee Shop, but then, the smoothie machine goes out regularly."
Alum,1,No online experience at all so I do not know why I am being made to fill out this portion of the review.
Freshman,1,"As a current student at Stetson University, I will say that this college is not as good as it sounds. It is charging students way too much money for below average services such as dorm and food. Professors are great but the rest are just bad. Due to COVID-19 many of the students has to evacuate and they’re not even giving us back 1/10th of what we paid for the dorm and meals. Many students and I paid from $4,000-65,000 per year and we only get $400 back but not even as cash or check but credit unless you graduate.One of my friends live in Nemec Hall and they’re having a mold problem and the ceiling above one of the showers fell and nothing is being done about it. Why are they charging us so much money if this is what we get out of it. I thought this would be a good school to go to but I was wrong. Pick a different college if you can."
Niche User,1,"I wish I could give Stetson less than 1 star because it was truly the worst experience I have had in my life thus far. I went for one semester and wish I could take those 4 months back. The dorms are absolutely disgusting, which they force you to live in for 3 years. My roommate was an awful person who only made my experience worse, but it seems that most people from Stetson are all like my disgusting excuse of a roommate. The classes are small and also just strange honestly. It’s in the middle of a cow pasture, and the nearest target is almost 30 minutes away, so if you need milk then good luck. There’s absolutely no party scene, it should really get an F for partying, NOT a B. The only anecdote you need that will explain the party scene there is one time I was invited to a party (that was in a frat kids dorm which is just ??) and they told me to wear a cowboy hat. They weren’t joking. If you’re in high school looking into going to Stetson, I really advise you reconsider."
Junior,1,Nothing to do at this college and it’s in the middle of nowhere. Doesn’t feel like a real college experience
Freshman,1,"I’m a freshman at Stetson and have had so much trouble meeting people. There’s nothing to do here. The doorms are awful and the people that live in them are really weird. The clubs are tiny and the Greek life I’ve seen is pretty much inexistent, I’m not much of a partier but if you are be warned, there’s only one bar to go to and I don’t know if it even counts as one it’s so small. I always thought private universities had better acedemics but I honestly can’t see how that is possible when the teachers here are so average"
Junior,1,It’s a hard school in the middle of no where. Wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless you really like nature
Junior,1,"They Don't Call It Dead-Land for Nothing. This town is quaint and small, but unfortunately this means that you need to leave it if you want to find something fun to do. If you're a nature buff, you can go Blue Springs Park or Deleon Springs. Also, the beach isn't too far away. If you're looking to party though, look to Orlando or Daytona. Deland is pretty lame. There's one club: Ace of Clubs, and a couple of bars. Deland is really only good because it's close to other fun spots."
Senior,1,"It’s a good school if your just there for the academics. There’s really nothing to do, if you like to party or go out your screwed and would not recommend this school"
Senior,1,im so bored its in the middle of nowhere. if you like nature then you found your home but if not then have fun trying to find any decent parties
Senior,1,just finished my first semester and Stetson and it was the worst 4 months of my life. The classes are way too big and you get no individual attention as a student. It’s like nobody would notice if you weren’t there. The new dorms are horrible and made with cheap materials. All this school does is try to suck money from you for the most stupid reasons. The parking is the worst and nobody listens when the students say this over and over again. I will be transferring to SJU in Philly next semester and can not wait for a better college experience. Think twice before attending Stetson unless you want to be just another one of the thousands of students. Even the counseling department does a terrible job at responding to clients. This school is a scam and its educational quality is significantly less than my high school. It was a waste of my time and ruined my spirit.
Senior,1,i should have transferred when i had the chance. theres nothing to do on campus i feel like im trapped. They say the small class size is helpful but really it just makes it easy for the teachers to point out your mistakes. they treat you like kids here.
Senior,1,Small school feel. In the middle of nowhere. Not much to do but there are a lot of parks if your into wildlife
Senior,1,Nothing to do I’m so bored here. No social life everyone is so full of themselves and stuck up. Should have gone to a bigger school
Junior,1,"I'm currently a junior at Stetson University. First things first, IF YOU'RE A DIGITAL ARTS MAJOR DO NOT GO HERE! Their digital arts department is severely lacking. They have you follow step by step to tutorials but hardly explain what you're doing or how the software you're using works. The food is absolutely god awful. The dorms are horrible, small, & outdated. I moved off campus as fast as I could, & if you're not a senior it's almost impossible which is crazy considering they don't even have room to house freshmen. The campus is beautiful, but it's small. You're always going to run into people you don't want to see. You can only party off campus. You have to pay for a parking pass, & there's hardly any parking. If you have to park in a lot that's not in your assigned color zone, they'll write you a ticket. I've met some great faculty, staff, & teachers, but overall it's just not worth it. It's basically high school round 2."
College Junior,1,"The food is never anything that is actually good for you. I am slightly allergic to ranch and that is the only option if I want to eat a salad at the school. The food is way over priced, if I want a burger it is 8 dollars and then i have to pay more for the fries and a drink even though it is my meal swipe. I should be about to have a full meal with my swipe and it not cost me extra money that I don't have."
College Freshman,1,"If you can get off campus, it's great. ResLife sucks and chances are will never approve you for off-campus. Even if dorms make you die."
College Freshman,1,"Campus food is TERRIBLE. Had I tried a meal here prior to deciding, I never would have came. I eat in the Commons like once or twice a week, against my will."
College Sophomore,1,I don't follow that crowd
College Sophomore,1,They do not care about student's needs at all. Awful. I've never felt more ignored.
College Freshman,1,The school is constantly trying to change your financial award. And many of the school scholarships are unorganized and they have you reapply for them.  I saw the merit scholarships lures people in but then later on you realize that the reward is not worth what the school offers as a whole
College Senior,1,"I personally don't care for greek life and think it shouldn't be a factor in school. It is a distraction and encourages ""bad"" behavior."
College Freshman,1,"Theyre strict on drinking here, It's limited to beer only, no liquor and no beer bongs."
College Freshman,1,The dorm halls here are awful and disgusting. Its kind of ridiculous for the money it costs to go here.
College Freshman,1,"Got busted for alcohol twice in my dorm, give out parking tickets rampantly."
College Junior,1,"Stetson barely has an equal amount of different backgrounds on campus. They say they want to diversify, but I haven't seen them make the right adjustments as yet to make the ethnic groups they already have on campus feel welcome. I know they are changing but I feel that its going to take a while."
College Junior,1,"Stetson students have been fighting a nowhere battle with Sodexo for many years to give students more options. Vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options are sparse and low-quality. Everything else is extremely unhealthy, and the caloric information they provide for each meal seems unrealistic. 

Also, I have had issues with cross-contamination in which a knife with peanut butter was to cut my turkey sandwich. I am extremely allergic, had an attack at home, and never received a reply to an email I had sent expressing my concerns.

I give them a D because I know that they have implemented changes, but it is safe to say that no one is ""happier"" with these so-called improvements."
College Junior,1,"Health services is barely competent. I got bronchitis and went to health services during Fall semester. Health services charges copay (like a real doctor's office). They didn't really help me, and I got sicker and sicker. Days later, I was so sick that I had to go to an urgent care. I had to pay $83 to go to urgent care and get a prescription for $100 worth of drugs. 

About safety, there was a point during the Fall when I learned about rapes that had occured on campus. This made me feel incredibly unsafe. I brought my concerns up to public safety, and was treated like I was crazy. It was a horrible experience. I don't think campus is very safe, and I don't think Stetson is very open about reports that they get. When I was dealing with some bullying issues, it took months to get them to do anything about it. If safety concerns you, I wouldn't suggest Stetson. "
College Junior,1,"Well, think the Greek Life office is not good and gossip about kids in the houses all the time. Worst of all, the students who work there are not confidential."
College Freshman,1,"Conrad is the best dorm. The rooms are big and the bathrooms were re-done over the summer. Chaudoin is the worst. There is mold in the vents, so everyone is constantly sick. The bathrooms are disgusting, partly because the people in the hall are pigs, but also because the cleaning people refuse to clean on weekends. They also do not clean the showers. All dorms have community kitchens, which is nice because the food on campus sucks. "
College Freshman,1,"I do not feel comfortable at Stetson. Everyone is really big on alcohol and not only pot, but pills. The academics suck and  it is WAY overpriced. I really wish I could get back the money I spent on this semester. I am so glad I am transferring!"
College Freshman,1,"For Gluten-Free/Celiacs/Cave(Wo)Men – I have severe reactions to gluten, like pass out, migraine, heart problems, depression, and so on. And I was having issues and they really tried to work with me on it, but there was so much cross-contamination that it was impossible. If you have severe allergies make sure you go through the annoying and painful process of opting out of meal plans. It's worth not passing out in class. Also, the food was not very good when I did eat there. Nothing was fresh or really tasty and healthy. I found it strange that a school so hell-bent on ""green"" wasn't using sustainable foods or local growers. For what they charge you, which is outrageous, they give you the cheapest food."
College Senior,1,"No diverse faculty or student body. Not a diverse curriculum. They do not support these programs, at all.  The administration does not fund such programs since they are white. There is a history at this unviersity that cannot be avoided."
College Senior,1,"A White University--Not Open to Diversity – This university boasts alot of pluses--small classes, personal attention etc, but it is demographically very white, both in faculty and student body.  There are many racially motivated events on campus. They have no South asia, African studies or latin studies programs. They do not support diversity in their currriculum either. Avoid it. A highly selective, deeply racially divided community. Terrible experience. Would not come back."
College Sophomore,1,"They Don't Call It Dead-Land for Nothing. This town is quaint and small, but unfortunately this means that you need to leave it if you want to find something fun to do. If you're a nature buff, you can go Blue Springs Park or Deleon Springs. Also, the beach isn't too far away. If you're looking to party though, look to Orlando or Daytona. Deland is pretty lame. There's one club: Ace of Clubs, and a couple of bars. Deland is really only good because it's close to other fun spots."
College Freshman,1,"You Should Not ""Party&quot – Too many drugs and alcohol. 
Those two topics give an F to Nightlife."
College Sophomore,1,"Frankly, I think I've seen a couple of bus stops on North Woodland as it runs past campus. I've never actually seen a bus there though. It's a two lane road so it would stop traffic completely, no question. I personally have my own car and have since I was a freshman. I've never had to use a bus around campus and I don't know anyone who has. If you are just trying to get around campus from one class to another, you don't need transportation. All of the buildings are easily within walking distance of each other."
College Sophomore,1,"The campus housing and apartments are decent in number, but geographically they are the best place to live. Commuter parking is low and the residence halls surround the central campus area. The nearest apartments that the school does not own are a car ride away, but you have to get through town first."
College Senior,1,"Small and Sparse – DeLand is a small town with not much going on. Orlando is a hike, but Daytona's not too far away, and there's plenty to do there. Embry-Riddle is the closest school, and Stetson students don't really mix with their students."
College Junior,1,"Unless you like sports bars/dive bars, you're gonna hate the nightlife in Deland. Brickhouse is probably the most popular place to be in Deland. All Stetson students go there mostly Thurs, Fri & Sat night. Every other night will be locals & townies. Drinks are cheap here & be sure to try the raspberry margaritas--ask for TJ to make them :) There's also some new ""club"" on Woodland Blvd called Ace of Clubs & all of Stetson has been going there. Goodcompany is another popular hang for the Stetson kids. Those are basically the three spots people go to. Not much going on here it's pretty miserable. If you wanna go to an actual club you have to make the drive out to Orlando (roughly 45min). Daytona Beach bars/""clubs"" I heard are pretty trashy...OH, & for those of you that are under 21, fear not because Deland bars would go out of business if they actually carded anyone. Drink your little hearts out ;)"
Recent Alumnus,1,"They are slowly eliminating parking to restrict the number of student drivers, which is DISGUSTING! Students that have cars and licenses should have every right to drive. Not to mention that it was forbidden to drive to class, so on rainy days my books got ruined and I couldn't even sell some of them."

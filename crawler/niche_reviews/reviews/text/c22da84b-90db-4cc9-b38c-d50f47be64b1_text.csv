College Senior,5,"all rooms are simillar, have airconditioning, great social atmosphere, low cost, right on campus, and easy to apply for a spot"
College Sophomore,4,My school taught me how to be an independent thinker and worker.The structure of the school is very much of letting know the approach to the student but letting the student decide and work on his own pace.I believe that a system as that prepares someone for the real world where there is no one on top of you and no direction either.
College Senior,4,The Chef is outstanding and always tries to keep the menue varying
College Senior,4,Talmudic Law â€“ Professor is very dynamic and gets the class involved.

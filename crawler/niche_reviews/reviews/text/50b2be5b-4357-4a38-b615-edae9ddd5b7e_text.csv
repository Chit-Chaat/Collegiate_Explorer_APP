Sophomore,5,My online experience isn't completely horrible. All the professors are very available to reach out to in a timely manor (unless its super early or super late). Syllabus's are very informative and the classes aren't too terrible. There are some classes you have to teach to yourself but its really not that bad.
Sophomore,5,"I'm still attending but as it being my last year, I have been taught well and learned a lot. I went to Harford Tech which taught me some of my major, and continuing it at Harford has helped me a ton."
Sophomore,5,HCC has great instructors that truly want you to succeed. The campus really gives you a top University feel.
Alum,5,I had an excellent experience at Harford Community College. The professors were very helpful and want you to succeed.
Sophomore,5,"It is a wonderful school. They care for their students. My experience at Harford Community College, has been a great."
Sophomore,5,HCC is outstanding when it comes to helping students. I feel like I have all the support I need. My professors are amazing and salts willing to help.
Sophomore,5,My professor were always quick to reply back to any questions I had and a tutor is always available to help with class work.
Niche User,5,Everyone is very helpful and super welcoming. The classes are engaging and the teachers are more than willing to help you if needed.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy that simple fact that the campus is so environmentally open and has pretty landscaping. This makes new students, like I, feel more welcome and not as afraid to be a part of a community that is very welcoming. I also like how the staff is super friendly and encourages students to ask questions or if they are struggling, they are welcome to free tutoring at any time while being on campus. I struggled in my biology class when I was in high school, however, my teacher explained the content very thoroughly and it helped me understand the material a lot better, even though high school biology and college biology different completely in the topics being covered. Harford Community College not only offers excellent programs that help students, whether they are fresh out of high school or straight from a job they have held for 20 years, but they do not judge or discriminate based on the current knowledge of the student."
Sophomore,5,"This college campus is beautiful, modern and welcoming. After taking a 14-year hiatus from college, I re-enrolled back at HCC and couldn't be happier with that decision. The campus staff and professors have made my transition seamless. I am happy to say that after 14 years, I will be gaining my AA in English this Spring."
Sophomore,5,I love the fact that the professors are so willing to help the students. Majority of the teachers that I have had have taken the time and effort to help me and make sure that I understand the concepts that are being taught.
Sophomore,5,"Great learning environment and very relaxed, a good choice to save money when starting out for a degree."
Freshman,5,The professors at Harford are fantastic and really cater to the students needs. The campus does really well at involving everyone even though its a small school. The academics are great. The buildings on campus are maintained well and the layout is great.
Sophomore,5,My experience with Harford community college has been a great experience. I immediately felt welcomed seeing that there are other African Americans around the college campus and being active in certain events. This makes me feel included in the college with how they welcome my culture and I love the new opportunities they offer to learn useful things needed to know in life when we become independent adults.
Freshman,5,"The experience I have had thus far at HCC has been truly rewarding. The faculty at this institution are comprised of truly remarkable teachers, who not only possess the knowledge for their areas of expertise but the compassion of spirit and dedication to their job that is commendable indeed. For many individuals, as for myself, the two-year Associate degree program at instititons such as HCC merely serve as a waystation on the path to greater academic goals. That characterization, however, does a total disservice to the high value knowledge and experience that a student gains by attending places such as HCC. My time on campus has proven the merits of this point, and to recognize the meaningful place HCC holds for me is to salute a school of higher learning that is exemplary in all ways."
Sophomore,5,"The campus buildings are very organized, making classes easy to find. Professors are eager to help students learn the material."
Graduate Student,5,I love the college the faulty is very professional and the students attending the college is great. They need to have commute bus for to travel from one part of the campus to the other side
Sophomore,5,HCC is one of the best community colleges in Maryland from the staff and the programs offered they are the best choice for your money!
Sophomore,5,"I like that at Harford Community, all the professors I’ve had were very helpful and made each student feel important."
Freshman,5,"Harford Community College is very good with classes, sports, and just a place to feel good about spending your money and earning your degree! Easiest and best choice ever! It’s cheap and better than going to a university."
Sophomore,5,Its a good community college helps you find a better college. most of the professor are great and will help you succeed in their class
Sophomore,5,"The teachers are phenomenal.  Every professor has a detailed, outlined syllabus with clearly defined due dates.  The professors are all very passionate."
Sophomore,5,"Harford Community College offers an excellent education at affordable rates.  Helpful advisors, will provide information on student schedules and transfer options. Interesting course choices."
Sophomore,5,"I love HCC. They're beyond the best as far as community colleges.  There's so much opportunity at this campus. The trained staff of advisors go out of their way to ensure that you are on the right track, without wasting money or class time. They offer a wonderful duel program with Towson University to earn your RN to BSN easier. The campus is overfilled with all ages of students.  And their success rate is fantastic! I am currently taken pre-nursing studies and love it! They also offer tons of campus support and activities to mingle with peers and Professors."
Junior,5,"The nursing pre requisites were very competitive because everyone was trying to get into the program. Once in the program, everyone is like a big family supporting each other and trying to reach the same goals. It is hard, but it is also extremely rewarding. I highly recommend  Harford Community Colleges nursing program. It is also a lot cheaper than most universities which can be extremely beneficial in the long run."
Sophomore,5,"Great professors, Great campus, and overall a great environment. I really enjoyed my first year there and can't wait to go back for my sophomore year to get ready to finish my associated degree."
Freshman,5,I completed my first year in this college and I am loving it so far. The professors are amazing and the help in campus is wonderful.
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Harford! The classes were large enough to create the opportunity for friends, but also were not to large that speaking you did not feel overlooked by the professors.  It had a great atmosphere with plenty of ways to further yourself, education, and career."
Sophomore,5,"Harford Community College offered me a multitude of opportunities to learn and grow personally as well as academically by providing an engaging and safe environment full of people who share the common interest of learning from others and furthering their academic and professional careers. 

As a small, 2-year institution, HCC gives students more opportunities personal interactions with each other and teachers, while encouraging more participation and discussions.

I also need to make a point to praise the instructors at HCC--almost all of whom (I've taken classes with) lent a great helping hand to my academic success and personal growth. 

Without HCC, acting as the stepping stone to attending a four-year institution, I would not be the student and human I am today. As an HCC student, I have faced challenges, won victories, and made relationships that have shaped me into the compassionate, motivated and resourceful intellectual that I am today. I am proud of myself and HCC for that."
Sophomore,5,"Students always feel welcome. Instructors are friendly and nice to talk to. They help to make students succeed. They have the best programs and it cost less to attend the school. Overall, Its a very good school."
Graduate Student,5,"I had an amazing experience at Harford Community. The people there are really nice and the experience was just really fun honestly. I was never one to make friends at college, but I actually really did enjoy talking to people in class and learning from very enjoyable, fun, easy going teachers. It was a great run, and I wouldn't hesitate to take classes at Harford in the future."
Freshman,5,Harford is a very good community college. It is very welcoming and very easy to navigate. The professors are all very good at what they do. I enjoy coming to class and learning. It is a nice school to help a student adapt to the college workload without the distractions that a 4 year university brings.
Sophomore,5,This campus is beautiful and the people are so amazing!!! I loving coming to learn and grow with my peers!
Sophomore,5,"HCC is a great and affordable way to start your college career. The classes are flexible and the instructors are friendly and knowledgeable. Most of all, it's very affordable and prepares you for transferring to a 4 year university."
Freshman,5,It is a great place that allow me learn at my own pace. The lecturers are great and take you along with them every step of the way.
Sophomore,5,"I am a single mother of 2 and currently expecting my third. Harford Community College makes it really easy to work around my availability. Be it all online classes, hybrid classes or night classes. Attending HCC gives me the knowledge and security that I will be able to provide for my family with the education I receive from this college."
Sophomore,5,"As an art student the experience was amazing. The professors really did their best to teach you everything they could. I'll be truly sad when it's time for me to graduate, everyone was great."
Freshman,5,My experience at Harford Community College has been amazing since starting my first semester in the fall. HCC is a great environment for learning and being as successful as possible.
Freshman,5,"I love Harford Community College! The teachers are all really intelligent and the college provides the students with everything they need.  If you need your papers reviewed, theres a learning center.  If you need a tutor, they have tutors.  They have a great library with helpful librarians and the staff is all so nice! They campus is very pretty too."
College Junior,5,I loved all of my professors. I have been here almost two years and I've never had a problem with any of them. They always make their selves available to you.
College Junior,5,Learning things that I didn't even think I would find interesting. Teachers make learning fun and involve you so it makes the experience so much better.
College Senior,5,They transfer credits one they receive their $5 fee that is meant to be paid by the students
College Senior,5,I had a great experience with my online classes
College Senior,5,"Class size depends on the subjects, some are small and big. They have all courses with good professors but you need to study hard to get a good grade"
College Senior,5,"I love the overall experience, they have co-operative education programs and internships for all majors"
College Senior,5,"Best community college ever, they have a lot of online classes"
College Freshman,5,My experience with courses and professors from my school has been nothing far from great. My professors are always so reliable and they help thier students through anything they need. It's also a lot easier to have a relationship with your professor because of how small the class size is compared to a big university.
College Junior,5,"Even being a late transfer student I was able to enroll in the classes I needed (didn't waste money on filler classes) to be a full-time student and play a sport. Combining playing a sport with a full-time schedule I was still able to have a social life and had plenty of time to finish homework. Credits transferred over almost flawlessly, with the exception of one elective"
College Student,5,Online is the best. It's easy because you can go at your own pace. Nobody is slowing you down.
College Sophomore,5,I had great financial aid.
College Sophomore,5,the best asset of harford community college is not only their nursing program and facilities but it is their library.
College Junior,5,"The experience that I have had at Harford Community College has beyond exceeded my expectations, I have had such a great experience here so far and I can't wait to continue on, I will miss this school dearly when I graduate next year. Harford Community is unique because of the diverse and friendly community here of staff, professors, and students especially. If I had to do it all over again I definitely would go to HCC again."
College Junior,5,"I have had a great experience with all the courses I've taken and all the professors I've had, they are very helpful, specify to your needs, and are flexible with their schedules if you ever need help. If it weren't for my awesome professors I wouldn't have made it this far in school."
College Junior,5,"Advising and career services are extremely helpful and supportive, I've had an incredibly pleasurable experience every semester when I've had to apply for classes or if I had a question about anything."
College Junior,5,"The student body here at HCC is an incredibly kind and diverse community when it comes to the majors people pursue, the ethnic, political and religious backgrounds. I do wish there was a Gay Straight Alliance here though. Everyone here is extremely friendly and accepting, a total stranger would say hi and ask you how you are as you're passing by. I have made a diverse group of friends the past two years I've been attending HCC."
College Junior,5,"The academics at Harford Community College are amazing, they give you so many classes and so many awesome professors to choose from, with the added bonus of having the same class and different times to fit specifically to your schedule and to your needs. The class registration process is very, very simple and easy, and if you have any questions advisers are more than happy to help you. There are plenty of places to study on campus, there are special study areas in every building and quiet study rooms in the library and if you are ever struggling with a class you can go and meet with a tutor in the testing center, they are also more than happy to help you."
College Sophomore,5,Its a lot cheaper than a 4 year college but that is to be expected with a community college.
College Junior,5,Never had a problem with any of the resources on campus.
College Junior,5,I applied for it and got it.
College Junior,5,The enrollment experience is extremely easy. Everyone is very helpful keeps you updated on deadlines and times. It's not so much there fault when it comes to the academic challenges as it is my own.
Sophomore,4,"Over all the professors are willing to help and make your college experience easy and full of knowledge. For me it is relieving to see that if I am having a rough time my professor will be there to help me, or if I am feeling down they will check up on me. It isn't too expensive so if you are on the fence about going to college and money is an issue I recommend Harford Community College."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning is not for everyone but this semester students had to choose between online school or no school at all. I chose online school and it has been difficult, but my professors have been very patient with me and have made it easier to learn."
Sophomore,4,Great online course options. Some instructors are absent during the semester for online courses and others are extremely involved and communicative during the semester. I don't mind either scenario. Grades are generally posted quickly and I have always been able to get in contact with instructors in fast and timely manners. They all want you to succeed and you can see and feel it at Harford. With COVID recently and everything going online instructors were quick to follow up and communicate with students during transitioning. Most online courses have weekly due dates and when there's an extension it is quickly notified by the instructor. I would highly recommend HCC whether that's in person or online.
Sophomore,4,"The instructions are clear and if you have problem understanding, most professors are there to put you through."
Sophomore,4,"I would love to give 5 stars. But this Pat semester was a little unorganized with the pandemic going on. However my previous semesters were great. Instructors are very helpful, and they seem like they really want you to succeed."
Sophomore,4,My experience with HCC was excellent with courses that were designed to be online. I’m in the nursing program so this semester was particularly difficult having to switch that class to online. It wasn’t a smooth process but hopefully the next semester we will be back to a face to face environment for this program.
Freshman,4,Everyone is involved in getting the students engaged with their education resources and college life
Freshman,4,Online was only presented due to covid. My classes were predominantly on campus classrooms which I enjoyed. The professors were positive energetic engaging and willing to work with you. I had no stress going to class. Due to covid I had to complete my spring semester online with just two or three of my courses.
Freshman,4,"Most of my professors are amazing, but i did have one bad one my first semester that caused me a lot of anxiety and stress. HCC did handle it well I believe, but I don't know how well considering he quit before they could take action and fire him."
Niche User,4,"Really good Community College, administration was very helpful in answering all my questions, as well as the students that attend there."
Freshman,4,very good experience from financial aid department to admission department no problem was in and out
Sophomore,4,Harford Community College is a great college. The Professors are very good and easy to engage with. The campus is a clean and safe environment. The online classes are easy to follow. Overall great college.
Freshman,4,"So far I've enjoyed my experience a lot. Despite it being a community college, the professors are good and I enjoy the smaller class sizes."
Junior,4,Harford  Community offers a broad range of classes and times which makes it very easy for working students to attend class/
Freshman,4,"I love Harford Community College because of all the wonderfully helpful and respectful staff, as well as the inviting and friendly students there that always make me feel welcome."
Sophomore,4,"What I enjoy most about Harford Community college is the diversity of courses that they offer for both credit and non credit students. With such a wide range of courses I am rekindling some of my old passions that I have long forgotten. For instance, due to the art programs offered at Harford Community college I have rediscovered my love for drawing. At Harford  Community College I feel as if there is a general sense of hope and encouragement among the academic advisors as they have guided through semester after semester. Whenever I had a meeting with said advisors I always walked out knowing what I had to next and exactly how I was going to do it. In all honesty I can't think of any major polices that need to be established and or changed both in the classroom and on campus. In conclusion, I love Harford Community College its where I will make my dreams become a reality and have forged friendships that will last a lifetime."
Freshman,4,"Harford community college is very similar to any other community college. It is much more affordable than a university. The cost allows me to just be a student and not to worry about being in immense debt. The curriculum is easy to follow and in general, the professors are very nice, and diverse individuals."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed certain parts of HCC and other parts I did not. Everyone that works there is very friendly, and most of the buildings are updated and nice or they are currently updating them. I was one of the lucky ones that got an advisor that knew what she was doing with my major, it's a role of the dice especially since you are assigned by last name instead of major. At HCC they have good and bad teachers for each major,  it depends on how you get."
Freshman,4,"Overall the college is a great starting point for anyone who is unsure where they wan to go afterwards. The campus houses many activities to keep students there entertained such as a pool, a tennis court, and a nice trail to walk through the woods. Even though I have not met the professors yet, I have been told nothing but great things about them."
Freshman,4,Harford Community College is great for students like me who wants to get to a university. HCC is helping me prepare for that. If only HCC has my major I wouldn't be transferring.
Sophomore,4,"Harford Community College is a great place to start if your planning on attending college right after high school. Personally, after high school I didn't want to leave home so I decided to get a part time job and attend HCC part time as well. Its been great! The learning center has flexible hours and the professors are passionate about what they are teaching. The library is full of resources to help with any projects/presentations."
Sophomore,4,I love that at HCC it is a great way to save money and still get a good education. I’m treansferring to Towson and I feel like I will be prepared for when I get to Towson with going to HCC to start.
Junior,4,I would stay at Harford if it was a 4-year school. They need to  change that. I enjoyed my time there.
Sophomore,4,"My professors are great, some may have a different teaching style but personally it worked. The paralegal studies program is a great way to be introduced to law. stay on your grades though because once you miss a class you must likely can not catch it until next semester."
Graduate Student,4,"I loved hcc. Beautiful campus, and great teachers who love the material. Iwanowski for organic was by far my favorite teacher! The only problem I had was that their advisors are lazy and give inaccurate information a lot, so it’s helpful to get a grasp on how everything works and go to them as little as possible. I’ve seen them misdirect friends into classes they didn’t need, only for my friends to find out later on and realize that they wasted their time and money on some of the classes."
Alum,4,Mostly awesome professors and challenging courses. The campus is very good for a two-year college. The athletics division is second to none and the cost of attendance is very low. Happy that its partnerships with Towson University to make it easy for students to transition to a four-year university who may not know where to go.
Sophomore,4,"Harford Community College provided a managable transition from high school to college. I learned a lot here and met many wonderful professors along the way. In fact, I wish I would have utilized my time here participating in more of the events. The library is a wonderful place to study. 

The only improvement would be better parking of course!"
Freshman,4,"Harford Community College is a two year accredited institution. Academically speaking, the professors are amazing at what they do. They are extremely dedicated to helping students out  during office hours and through email. The course content itself is appropriate and the expectations are reasonable. As well the campus has a learning center with tutors to help students with any class. The best part is the learning center is free to use for enrolled students, its paid for through your tuition. The librarians are also very helpful with reviewing any paper you have written and help you find credible sources. The campus is rather small since it is a community college, which makes it rather easy to navigate. There are numerous clubs on campus for a diversity of students on campus. Financially, the college is very cost efficient for Harford county residents.  The only thing I would recommend is that the college put in more study room in the library."
Sophomore,4,"The professors have helped me find my passion, and helped me figure out exactly what I wanted to do with my career path!"
Sophomore,4,"Harford Community College is a great college. The staff are all friendly, and there is a lot to do on campus. The professors are mostly great and put information in a way that is easy to digest. The other students are often interested in college and make great study buddies, but not always. The library is great for studying too."
Freshman,4,I liked how understanding and patient my instructors were. I also liked how much financial aid the college has to offer students in need.
Sophomore,4,"It is a small school, which iss good for me and other people that are imilar to me. If I could change something about HCC, it would be that they should make their activites and all more noticable to the students."
Freshman,4,I am a current freshman and have had a great experience. I am a full time students and all of my professors have been very helpful with my transition to college from high school.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshmen at Harford Community College and I have to say that my semester here so far is going great. It's a nice college with small classroom size and different majors to apply. In HCC there is 35 clubs and so many student activities events where you can participate and get involve with the schools. The schools has an app where you are updated on the school's event, what university is visiting, games, clubs and etc."
Niche User,4,"Its a typical above average community college. There is not really anything too outstanding about it but the resources are very good. Then have modern, well-functioning computers and labs. The professors are helpful but could be better."
Sophomore,4,Wonderful place to learn! Great instructors. Everyone is very helpful. The only concern is rude administration at registration desk.
Sophomore,4,Harford community college is a great college for any resident. They are very accepting and have a ton of fun activities as well as are very interactive with their students. The teachers are outstanding and the college promotes their environmental additions to their buildings.
Niche User,4,"As a student who participated in dual-enrollment, HCC provided challenging and useful courses to my college transcript while I was still completing my high school diploma. It provided the flexibility for me to work and go to school, all while maintaining an affordable price."
Junior,4,"To anyone who is just starting their college career or looking to continue their education I would definitely recommend Harford Community College. Not only is the campus beautiful, but there is an amazing staff who is always willing to help, and there are so many programs of study to choose from."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Harford was challenging. I had courses that were kinda difficult but I still managed to get through them. At first, I was skeptical about staying at Harford because I thought it was very boring and I didnt really know anybody, but that changed when I started to get the swing and meet new people who were in my class. I would like to see a change in the activities that they have for the students here. Like activities that will get the whole campus to interact with each other. "
College Junior,4,"At my other school, I hated online classes, but now I understand the system because it is so easy to use, I prefer online now."
College Junior,4,"Teachers are very understanding and always available to you. Everyone cares for you and understands the goals you have, and pushes you towards these goals."
College Junior,4,"Good classes, interesting courses from the course catalog to choose from!"
College Junior,4,"The program is taking real professors from the market and having them teach students, with there professional background. They also have connections that getting internships is a breeze!"
College Junior,4,"Great program, with great teachers that come from experience. Also getting real world experience with the schools intern program!"
College Freshman,4,I personally don't like online courses because I'm more of a visual learner. I like being one on one with my professors because I just simply learn better this way. Another reason why I'm not interested in online classes is because of the work load. I just feel like if you have to teach yourself and if you don't get It then the assignments are going to pile up and then your test scores could show how difficult the experience was for the students.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience at school is great because of how focused and determined my professors make me feel in order to do well in thier course. My professors are always there when I have a question that has to do with thier course. If thier not there in person then thier always available through email, or even phone calls, which I think it's great that they put so much effort into helping thier students."
College Junior,4,I just enrolled into my first compressed online course and it's amazing. I have near immediate contact with the instructor as well as live Skype sessions for tutoring. The work load is expected as its a 3 credit class being served in 5 weeks
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy playing for a sports team here because it's made me feel more connected to the school. Most of my professors are great people and instructors not to mention I registered on the last possible day. The business administration program is great because of professors like James Hughes and Raymond Menasian. Typically small class sizes, all under 25"
College Junior,4,Beautiful campus with strong sports and friendly professors makes Harford a great place to continue education at.
College Junior,4,the engineering classes are very interesting. we have many different assignments from hands on work to group work to presentations to new and interesting programs on the computers. if you enjoy engineering the slightest then these courses are for you
College Junior,4,i enjoy the classes the students and the faculty. everyone is willing to help with problems and us students have a considerable ammount of fun while not in class.
College Junior,4,"the courses are challenging enough to keep me interested, however if it becomes too difficult the instructor is willing to help. the most enjoyable this however is out in the quad almost every day a group of friends and i play catch and or a game of frisbee."
College Student,4,Many people recruit from campus.
College Senior,4,It is very interesting and fun! There is always something new to be learned & the teachers are so enthusiastic about the topics discussed!
College Senior,4,"I honestly believe that Harford is very goal orientated. This school wants the best for each student and goes further than expected in order to try to make faculty and stuff happy with results from students. Harford offers a lot of fun activities, and study sessions in order to both sit back and relax, and also helpful stuff in the tutoring center."
College Sophomore,4,I would choose a different school only because my current school doesn't offer a lot of career fields I was interested in
Recent Alumnus,4,easy transferring credits in and out
Recent Alumnus,4,related to the field of work.
College Freshman,4,I really like the idea of community college. I like the fact that my professors care and want us to do well.
College Junior,2,their isnt a very good network of graduates and alumni but it doesn't mean it will damage finding a job
College Sophomore,2,I do not believe that there has been more than one job fair at Harford Community College in the last three years. If there are any employment recruitment opportunities then they are inadequately publicized.
College Sophomore,2,Only here once and it was semi helpful. Alumni is almost non existent as the usual student body is not supportive especially after leaving the college
College Sophomore,2,Few people are taking advantage of the opportunity presented in the community college. Most are just there because they were told to go by their parents. The goal is to get a C and leave in the 3 years it takes a lot of people to graduate in and leave.
College Sophomore,2,Its always either extremely cut short so you only get the bare minimum or the time period of the class is really short so you have a huge workload.
College Freshman,2,Harford Community is a two-year degree college. So ultimately there is no post-grad services.
College Sophomore,2,There's little to no information about career services easily available at HCC.
College Sophomore,2,"I took a hybrid course, and It became an online course. I personally don't do well when I cant physically go to a classroom, and then my teacher was complacent, so I didn't learn much."
College Freshman,2,I do nothing at school other than attend my classes and go home right afterwards.
College Freshman,2,I haven't had experience with transferring credits yet. There's also no way to get ahold of my transcripts unless you pay money and see an advisor. 
College Senior,2,I have been there on and off for ten years and my academic experience has been met with disappointment and low expectations.
College Senior,2,The resources are there but there no one that educates the students on what is available to them.
College Senior,2,"There are variety of students that differ from religion, ethnicity, views, and personalities. The student body consists of first year college students that have just graduated from high school. Parents juggling school, children, and careers. Also individuals planning on transferring to other higher education institutes. It is a friendly campus environment."
College Senior,2,I am a engineering major and the classes are expectantly difficult but  there is a few teachers that make the material harder to learn because of there lack of guidance.
College Junior,2,"While the financial aid office is very helpful, I found it difficult to actually obtain any financial assistance for the upcoming semesters.  I am currently unemployed, separated, and living on a reduced income.  I applied for aid, but due to the fact that I am still legally married, I could not obtain any aid as they consider my husband's income when applying (I completed a FAFSA form as required).  I am finding it very difficult to pay for college and would like to obtain a scholarship/grant of some kind to be able to move forward.  At this point I can only take 1 class per semester and my estimated graduation date for a 2-year degree is 2015 (I started in 2011)."
College Senior,2,"I honestly am not satisfied with my college experience. The college only allows 2 days absence and do not care if you have an emergency (father in hospital). When you try to email your professors, mine in particular do not reply to answer questions. To add, you only have 15 minutes to get to your following class so it does not help when a professor wants to extend his/her lecture.
However, I appreciate the fact that we have a free gym and on campus job options. Work-study is extremely helpful to my academic success."
College Senior,2,There are never enough computers available during the day for students to use.  Many bring their own laptops.
College Senior,2,Raising Tuition – Harford Community College recently raised their tuition with little to no warning.
College Senior,2,"Nothing Special. After a year at HCC, I can honestly say, there is nothing special about this school. The teachers are like the teachers in high school. The students all know each other from high school, so its awkward when you don't know anyone. The classes are like high school. One good thing is that all my credits will transfer to the four year school I""m going to."
College Senior,2,There really isn't anything special about HCC it is just like any other community college. It does not offer very many clubs or events to attend and the ones it does have are not promoted very well.
College Freshman,1,I would have never have chosen to go to a community college.
College Junior,1,"Needs a Lot of Work – There is always problems with the network. I'm constantly running into ipconflict errors across the network. Some of the computers have errors logging into the network or crash while using the simplest of programs. The last problem is the website and owlnet having many broken links. In all, the network is unreliable, dial up is faster then this."

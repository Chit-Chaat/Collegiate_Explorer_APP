Freshman,5,"I am taking most of my classes online and even though it does take some getting used to, the professors are trying their very best to make it work!"
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman here and I can tell you that I love it so much here! Everyone is super nice, the food is great, and it is so easy to find amazing friends!"
Junior,5,what I like about the university if the variety of class options they have to choose from each semester.
Junior,5,"I recently took an online class that was ran very organized by the professor, the syllabus was very clear and everything went as scheduled."
Alum,5,"I took a few classes online but not many. The professors are responsive and helpful. During the COVID pandemic, all my classes were switched online. We received no money back, I dont believe this was fair because the online courses do not provide and same experience and hands-on learning you receive in the classroom."
Sophomore,5,I think University of Rhode Island did a very good job of converting to online curriculum. I didn't feel like my academics really suffered all that much after the switch.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Rhode Island has been my home away from home, and has helped me experience personal growth, both socially and education wise. The classes offered present me with the highest education possible, focusing on my personal goals and interests. Thankfully, URI also provides a feeling of ""home away from home"", creating many opportunities to join clubs and activities."
Freshman,5,Its campus is beautiful and they nursing program is amazing and the teachers are so caring and helpful.
Niche User,5,"I love how diverse it is and there is an amazing student life on the campus. Although, the dorms could be better and worked on, the campus is an inviting and wonderful place to be as the students and staff are great people."
Freshman,5,"Excellent major choices and may clubs to choose from.

Room and Board is quite expensive. There should be more
meal choices."
Alum,5,"I loved the school! It is in a perfect location, very close to providence and very close ot Narragansett!"
Junior,5,"A really great university! The administration is really friendly and helpful, you can tell that they really care. Classes were interesting and structured well, professors were passionate about what they were teaching and the students. The campus is really pretty and in a quiet secluded area. The surroundings of the campus are beautiful and scenic. The university has a really nice vibe to it and its great to go here."
Freshman,5,"I love URI, beautiful campus and close to Providence. Have made great friends and enjoying my classes.  There is something for everyone here."
Junior,5,"I love URI and the welcoming community. The only thing I hoe to improve is school spirit as well as celebration of diversity. As a member of Greek life, if you choose to join it is an easy way to make friends but this is the case for any organization that you join on campus so if Greek life isn't your thing you will still be totally fine."
Sophomore,5,As an older returning student my experience at the University has been very fulfilling. I get great encouragement and support from the professors and staff. I would recommend this University to all older returning adults.
Niche User,5,"I am a prospective student and after viewing the campus, I was very pleased with what I saw and blown away by the new Engineering building."
Freshman,5,"Arriving at the University of Rhode Island felt as though I was coming home. I have learned to manage my time, made new friends, and understood what independence truly means. Although I am learning to live on my own, the University of Rhode Island provides me with resources that pushes me towards the path of success. From academic advising to the counseling center there is always someone here to give you hand. Not only that, but the professors at this University are empathetic and understanding individuals. Furthermore, in high school I loved being a member of the track and field team and I was captain for two years. While on campus, I felt as though a part of me was missing. Until I discovered the Club Track and Field team through friends of mine who are avid runners. Here, I rediscovered my passion for running and I can compete as well. Overall, in the University of Rhode Island I found who I am and realized that I am capable of much more than I believe."
Senior,5,"I've found the URI community to be very welcoming. The professors in the Economics department are always willing to help, and are extremely knowledgeable regarding their subjects."
Junior,5,The University of Rhode Island has so many options for everyone! It has such diverse courses and every teacher truly wants to help.
Senior,5,What I love about URI is that I was able to grow into the women that I am now. Through my classes and meeting my friends who are the closest people to me now. I have learned about by going to URI and experienced so many great memories that I will defiantly not forget at all.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Rhode Island has provided with the experience of State School through the student diversity and wide variety of studies. As well as, the personal connection and care from the professors."
Freshman,5,"I love how URI felt like home. The campus alone is so beautiful and so nature filled, that it made me happy to breathe fresh air and walk around and see so many trees and flowers. It was a change from being stuck inside my home and neighborhood, where there was barely any trees or flowers growing. But, the people there also gave me a sense of comfort, my peers, and my professors were always there to help and I can say it has really helped me grow not only as a student but as a person."
Freshman,5,The university of rhode island is a great place to visit and get an edcation. The enrollment services staff were very friendly and understanding of my certain needs.
Senior,5,"I can't say one bad thing about the school. the campus is always clean and gorgeous. there's always something going on whether it be sports, hundreds of club events, greek life events etc. all of the professors in my departments are always available and friendly. they've been improving old buildings and always open to listen to the student body when something needs to be fixed, even if they aren't always fast to act upon it."
Sophomore,5,"Excellent College with many different majors and minors which are highlighted by it's Engineering, Pharmacy and nursing programs as well as the world renowned graduate school of oceanography. The facilities and clubs sports and activities are top notch. Living on campus as a freshman is excellent and the university provides LLC's (living learning communities) where freshmen students can live with other people in their major which especially helped me to make friends and start study groups which was more effective and helped a ton with classwork. Food tastes good but isn't that healthy however if you can eat the same stuff every day you'll be ok."
Junior,5,"My experience at URI has been nothing but great. The community at this university works tremendously to create the best college environment for all of their students. I immediately felt welcomed as a freshman and joined Greek life which was one of my best decisions so far as it has provided myself many opportunities and leadership positions. Also, being on the pre-med track, the academic clubs have only provided me support and connections in my future career path."
Sophomore,5,"This university truly cares for their students. They do not only believe that the students will succeed but, they make sure of it."
Alum,5,"Great school in a beautiful location. On campus housing is generally new, clean, and comfortable. Dining options are always delicious and offer diverse meal choices. Lots of very interesting courses available from knowledgeable, friendly professors. Can’t beat the gorgeous, walkable campus, as well as the fact that the beach is only minutes away! Don’t forget that URI was ranked the number one party school in the country at one time!! Social and party scenes are always great, so make sure to find a good balance between academics and socializing!"
Sophomore,5,I am studying kinesiology at URI and I love my major and all of the classes I have taken so far. All of my professors are easily accessible and knowledgeable. Although it is a big campus it is not overwhelming and the surrounding area is really nice. I love going to the beach nearby and trying out all of the restaurants.
Sophomore,5,URI has been a great fit for me thus far. I am a second semester transfer and it is much better than my first school in all aspects.
Niche User,5,"This college is amazing! It has a very welcoming environment and the people are all so kind! I applied late to URI because I was originally going to go to the Community College of Rhode Island through the Rhode Island Promise Scholarship. However, I was not aware that the credits from CCRI could not transfer into the kinesiology major at URI. So after applying late to URI I still got accepted quite soon after applying. I appreciate the flexibility of URI and their understanding of my situation!"
Freshman,5,The University of Rhode Island is a great school with amazing people and great parties. I would like to see URI cost less money.
Niche User,5,"One of the main things I really about this university is its campus life. there is always something to do and you will almost never be really bored. One thing that I may want to see change is the conditions of some dorms. although they are not terrible, they can improve on it. but, i only speak for the dorms that were first made. Overall, it is a great place to study and expand personally."
Niche User,5,"I am a student athlete who took an official visit to University of Rhode Island and loved the experience, and college life."
Graduate Student,5,"I was went to uri from 2011-2013 and attained my bachelors degree in business. I was living at home in providence while the 2 years I attended so i was communting back and forth. But While on campus, there was always good food, good environment, and many activities."
Freshman,5,"So far I have only visited University of Rhode Island two times. However in the brief time that I spent there, I really enjoyed the modest size of the campus and the old-fashioned style architecture of each building, as well as the amazing students and tour guides that I met."
Freshman,5,"amazing school, great students amazing education. the dorms and buildings could use a little TLC. but nonetheless it is a great school. Ive only been here one year and it has been the best time of my life . lots of parties so don't get distracted! but overall 10/10 would recommend. the food goes so crazy here absolutely amazing. the location is literally perfect, its not to far from civilization like a ton of other colleges are."
Freshman,5,I love this school! Everyone has been extremely welcoming since day one and I have made some of the greatest friends here. I'm lucky to call this place my second home and I would recommend URI to everyone.
Senior,5,I love being a student at URI because of all the opportunities that are provided. I feel like I am actually prepared to enter my career field.
Freshman,5,"I thought I was going to struggle going out of state for college but URI is definitely like a second home to me. The courses are challenging and engaging and the professors really seem to care about their students. There is many opportunities for students to get involved and find an organization that they can align themselves with. The food isn't awful despite what people might say, there's a lot of options which is nice."
Freshman,5,"I am a Talent Development student here at URI, which is a group of in-state students accepted despite their disadvantaged backgrounds. As a TD scholar I was able to take summer classes going into freshman year and get ahead on classes, knowing the campus, and making friends. So far, while still only being a freshman, I deeply enjoy attending URI and have recommended this university to younger friends and family applying to schools."
Niche User,5,Even as a high school student my overall experience with University of Rhode Island is great. The reason I say this is because they give the opportunity to allow high school student to take their college classes.  They also open up all accesses that University of Rhode student would have to the high school students which allow them to feel as if they are real college students. This allows the student to prepare themselves for college and their future career pathways. The one thing that I would change about The University of Rhode Island is that they have more offers to the high school students on college tours and explain what would happen if the student was to attend the school.
Freshman,5,It is a very welcoming place to be. Especially those not used to being away from home. The professors are nice and the parties are great! It’s right by the beach too so it is nice when it’s warm out to take a trip to Narraganset with some friends and just hang out.
Niche User,5,"Many option of majors, club, minors, etc. Not very diverse, but education is good. Very nice campus with all services possible. Food is amazing, and people and professors are really helpful and nice."
Senior,5,"There are many things I enjoy about being part of the URI community. To start off, I enjoy being apart of a diverse community because you can meet people from all different parts of the country and see how they adapt to this environment. I also enjoy how all of the classes are close to each other on campus which makes them easily accessible. I enjoy being apart of the URI community because no one judges whether you are muslim or christian or different in any aspect, everyone is treated the same. One thing I would like URI to change would be an upgrade on many of the dorms/housing they use for the students."
Senior,5,Plentiful resources throughout the University that allow students to maximize their education.  Excellent courses and professors. Beautiful Campus in an amazing location.
Sophomore,5,I like URI because the campus even though for a University it is small enough to get everywhere in a good amount of time. I enjoy URI because they allow me to get extra help through the program I'm apart of which is Talent development. If I wasn't a part of this program I would review URI differently because I wouldn't have known about half the resources and people on campus that I do now. I love the writing center and that you're able to see your academic adviser whenever you want.
Alum,5,I had a great experience at the University all the staff were very helpful and friendly. I am a veteran and the services there were great. They have a good student vets organization. I went through the biotech program and was given an internship opportunity. I highly recommend this program to anyone interested.
Freshman,5,"I'm so excited about URI - I will be entering as a freshman in September and already I feel like it is the best college.  Everyone, students and staff, have made me feel at home.  The communication with prospective and new students is great.  There are so many opportunities already for involvement.  So excited to start school in just a few short weeks"
Sophomore,5,"Love the school! Academics are very good, the campus is Beautiful and there are lots of things to do during the week. Sad to say it is a real suitcase school-lots of students go home for the weekend! The food was great to begin with but got very boring as the months went on. So Far I really like it but definitely more for my major than anything!"
Sophomore,5,"University of Rhode Island is what you make of it. It is a beautiful campus with the beach only 15 minutes away. The science department and nursing school is a competitive program that I am happy to begin. I would recommend joining greek life on this campus as well as it helps you get involved and make friends. It is hard to find other things to do all the time without greek life. The dorms are small as freshman but frat circle and houses off campus are super nice. The food is also decent, what you would expect at a University."
Junior,5,"Great STEM fields, lots of opportunities for involvement in research other extracurriculars. If you're looking for social things, join Greek life or you won't get to party. It's a smallish school, you get to know everyone fairly quick. Living so close to the beach is great! The winters are awful and walking up hills suck."
Junior,5,"University of Rhode Island is the third college I have attended and  the only one i have considered home. With new opportunities each and every day, i am never bored and am happier than i have ever been. I was given the oppurtunity to join greek life on campus which has pushed me to get involved and meet lasting friendships i didnt think i could ever make."
Junior,5,"I love the campus involvement, there's so much for students to do and get involved with from social/ professional greek life, sports, on campus employment, and tons of clubs. I would like to see a little more done about sustainability and waste on campus."
Sophomore,5,"My first year at URI was absolutely amazing.  The professors I had were phenomenal and were always available whenever help was needed.  The resources on campus are easy to find, and very accessible.  My academic advisors are exceptional, and helped so much when I needed help picking out classes, and for advice.  The two dining halls are pretty good, and each one has different options to best fit your hunger."
Sophomore,5,"I loved the University of Rhode Island because of its dedication to make its students happy. The school constantly made changes to keep its students entertained. There are always fun events planned for students that everyone can attend. URI provides you with excellent resources to make the absolute most out of your college experience. There are hundreds of clubs and ways to get involved on campus. I lived in a Living and Learning Community, which meant I lived in a dorm with people from my major. It really helped me succeed in my classes and introduced me to so many friends!"
Junior,5,URI has two beautiful campuses and a good mix of new and old buildings. New projects are constantly underway to improve the community as a whole.
Freshman,5,"I love this school so much, they provide so many opportunities for the students and there's always something going on. They have so many different resources to help the students succeed both in school and outside of academics as well. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else!"
Freshman,5,"The local area is great and the  campus is very diverse. The campus is also very lively and involved and the student life is great. The dorms need to be refurbished and re-done due to the old age and wear. The professors are very helpful and care about the well-being of each and every student. Greek Life is very active and the Panhellenic council works extremely hard to have all students involved with beneficial activities, not only to the students, but the surrounding community. Habitat For Humanity is one of the best programs that URI offers and is a life-changing experience for the students and other individuals that the students are helping."
Junior,5,I have loved going to school here. The classs are great and the campus is gorgeous! Compared to so many schools the tuition is more affordable and financial aid packages are great.
Sophomore,4,"As a student pursuing a biology based major,  the classes offered allow for every opportunity to succeed and foster further curiosity. The structure of the courses and course requirements allow you to take classes that you might not have gotten the chance to take otherwise. There are also many unique minors to choose from."
Sophomore,4,"URI has an array of classes, clubs, major, and minors to choose from that allow you to have a well rounded course load."
Sophomore,4,There's a huge variety of clubs and ways to get involved with students. There's also a lot of ways to customize your education- it's pretty easy to major in multiple areas and still have them connected in one-way or another.
Sophomore,4,"So far it's pretty good. My professors are very understanding of the fact that we're struggling to adapt to virtual learning as much as they are. Many are open to suggestions about how to teach the class, including some syllabus changes. URI is trying it's best to make it feel like you're involved with campus by extending activities into Zoom or Webex."
Sophomore,4,The university of Rhode island has been a good experience for me so far after transferring here my sophomore year. I believe the facilities and campus are very nice and modern. I believe the teachers and other staff are quality and they are willing to help you as a student. I don't live on campus so those two points I mentioned are my main focus. For that I would consider URI a 4/5 stars.
Niche User,4,The University of Rhode Island handled virtual learning exceptionally. The teachers adapted very quickly to ensure students would still receive their money's worth of education.
Niche User,4,"I have really enjoyed the whole University of Rhode Island experience. URI does a tremendous job of ensuring the safety, well-being, and overall health of its student body, and faculty. I would definitely the University of Rhode Island to a friend."
Senior,4,I took three classes online over the summer. Each professor used different platforms to accommodate to their course needs. I feel as though each professor made themselves available for students to reach out to them.
Senior,4,I like that the University of Rhode Island is in a beautiful area. I would like to see change in the school acknowledging racial injustice and ensure to the minority students that the school supports diversification and equality.
Sophomore,4,"I needed to have classes online because of COVID-19. It would not have been my choice to take online classes, but my experience was very good because of how my professors handled it. The classes remained mostly the same and I still had the option of extra help."
Sophomore,4,"I love URI and the resources it has for me as a student. I can always get academic help and it was overall an amazing school I can't wait to return to. I loved the campus, the people, the teachers, the for was decent, and it felt like a home away from home."
Graduate Student,4,"I have loved my years at URI, especially in the pharmacy program. The curriculum and school culture is very welcoming and professors are personal. I feel comfortable asking any of my professors for help and attending office hours."
Graduate Student,4,I never took an online course until COVID-19 hit. The second half of my spring semester was all online and URI did a great job of adjusting and offering video capabilities and teaching while remote.
Alum,4,"Expensive school. The food on campus is OK. Decent nightlife, but there are no parties on campus. You have to join a frat or sorority. 
The teachers are good, and the staff is helpful."
Sophomore,4,I love University of Rhode Island. All the professors I've had have been very dedicated and hardworking. All the staff is extremely kind and helpful.
Freshman,4,"The campus at URI is so nice and I feel very comfortable and safe when walking from class to class. I would say that my favorite thing about URI is the basketball games, everyone shows huge support for our team and it’s just a fun experience."
Alum,4,"university of rhode island was great! the campus is beautiful, and the teachers are (for the most part) so knowledgeable and caring."
Alum,4,"online experience was great! i found online learning to be easier than in person, and also enjoyed the freedom of being able to manage my own time and coursework."
Sophomore,4,"My overall opinion of the University of Rhode Island is good so far. It's only my first year, going to be second next semester, but it's been great. I made plenty of friends, found some clubs that interested me and found great hangout spots with my friends and have taken many adventures with them. The professors I've had were great and really care about their students and making sure they were doing well inside as well as outside the classroom. I've been able to get out of my comfort zone and have been presented many opportunities to grow. The support system has been amazing and will definitely have long lasting friendships/relationships with my friends, professors and advisors."
Sophomore,4,"URI was the best choice I ever could have made for school. I have found my best friends here and have made connections with professors I never though would happen. The environment of URI makes the school even better, and being by the beach with so much off campus housing is something that sets URI apart. One thing I would say URI could improve is its parking. There is not nearly enough spaces for commuters and the walk is so far, but overall URI is great and I have no regrets coming here."
Freshman,4,I am very pleased with my classes and the path I am taking to get my BA. I am very happy with my dorm. There is little that I would like to change.
Sophomore,4,University of Rhode Island is the first college to make me feel like I am at home. URI has provided a sense of education and resources that have been beneficial and updated. The technology and campus itsels is all new and being renovated where my money is well spent. I have learned a lot through my science courses here and any other Gen Ed courses have also been well informative.
Sophomore,4,I've enjoyed my experience at the University of Rhode Island. Most of my professors have been kind and helpful in my classes. I've been studying and learning more about topics that interest me and can further me in the future.  There is a multitude of programs/extracurricular activities to get involved in as well.
Junior,4,This school grew on me well. The professors are so nice. The gym is huge and clean. There is always something happening on campus. Lots of sports. GO RAMS!
Niche User,4,I believe that URI is a top 3 best college in Rhode Island. It is a great college for engineering and provides students with a higher education. Since it is in a small state the community is already familiar. Not only is the education great but the housing and party scene is phenomenal.
Sophomore,4,"Professors are very invested in the outcome of their student's learning, interested in their futures and make helpful suggestions for pursuing life goals. I will say that not enough maintenance is put into the design/music buildings. Although the design and creative arts professors and classes themselves are top notch and wonderful, the workspace is old, temperature is whack, and classrooms are small."
Junior,4,"People are very friendly, there are great professors at the school, a lot has been done to make the kingston campus as beautiful as it can be. Recently there have been a lot of strides towards making the campus a safer place. The security threats are always taken seriously and investigated to the best of their ability. There are a lot of places that can help you when you are not sure of something, whether it be acceptance or financial questions. Absolutely beautiful and very nice place!"
Freshman,4,"Its great, beautiful and fun however its very expensive. I feel involved and welcomed. The classes are thorough and helpful. There is lots of support for any class with the Academic Enhancement Center and tutors."
Freshman,4,At the university of Rhode island it was very welcoming. Having orientation and welcome tours really helped with the transition of moving there.
Sophomore,4,"I love University of Rhode Island! I didn't originally expect myself to be so happy in a big school like this; before I came here iI was a little scared of dissapearing in a sea of students in such a big school like this. It truly feels like a commmunity and a home. The students here are so kind and I quickly found my place. There are so many amazing organizations, clubs, and sports to help you find your people. The teachers are amazing and kind."
Sophomore,4,This school is known as a party school but it really does have great academics. URI Also does a good job of having different activities to do around campus every once and a while whether it a fun run or a holiday meal at the dining hall.
Sophomore,4,I am the third generation in my family to go to this school. They really care about students and I love the campus. They invest a lot of money into new buildings every year. The classes in the engineering department are great and challenging. They have an amazing academic testing center and disability services.
Sophomore,4,"It's pretty good. There is a very good culture here, and the school is on the high end of medium sized so you are definitely able to find your group while at school."
Niche User,4,"The area around the college is really nice; plenty of places to eat, drink, and go out. The university itself offers a variety of great programs such as their well known pharmacy and oceanography programs. They also offer plenty of graduate programs in case you consider taking that route. While their Kingston campus is the primary location, they have other campuses in different parts of Rhode Island which offer specialization."
Senior,4,"Overall, the professors are great. The biology program is amazing as well as psychology. But, the chemistry department could use a ton of work. They should honestly just wipe the slate clean and start fresh. There is only about 2 good chemistry professors, all of the other ones do not explain material to the extent that it needs to be explained."
Senior,4,I have had a great personal experience at URI. What you put into it is what you get out of it. Beautiful campus. Certain departmental communication could be better.
Niche User,4,Went on a campus tour and was very impressed with all this University has to offer.  Students seemed happy and well adjusted with lots of school spirit.  Great food choices on campus .
Sophomore,4,"Really big University, but lots to do. A lot of options within classes and majors. Advisors are there to help and do a great job. Teachers are friendly as well."
Graduate Student,4,"I attended URI as an undergraduate in the Pharmaceutical Sciences department and I am now a graduate student pursuing my PhD in Pharmacology and Toxicology. I loved URI and the campus. The campus is very nicely set up in tiers with the academic buildings and library being primarily at the top of campus, top of the hill. The dorms and dining halls in the middle, halfway up the hill. And then the athletic buildings and fields at the bottom of campus. Additionally, the professors in the College of Pharmacy are very good!"
Freshman,4,"Great campus, great professors. Lots of resources provided to help you succeed in classes. RAs are very helpful if there are ever any problems, and always there to talk to if needed."
Freshman,4,"I have very much enjoyed attending the University of Rhode Island. There are many resources to help students academically and socially, along with tailoring to any special needs a student may have. They have been extremely accommodating of my needs and show great care for their students."
Sophomore,4,I am now a sophomore at the University of Rhode Island. I can honestly say that I have enjoyed myself here. I am getting more involved now being in my second year. My biggest complaint is about the dining halls. I believe that they should be open later because they close too early for college students. I always get hungry later on when I am studying and would like to go get food and am left having to eat something small. Also the lunch ladies are kind of rude for no reason. There are a lot of classes available for students. I am currently in the Doctor of Pharmacy program and so far taking my general education courses I am liking it. Overall I believe that this is a good school and am excited for the next four years.
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my classes and new friends that I've made. Although sometimes I feel like the dining halls, library etc. get too busy which I find is a little annoying."
Niche User,4,They have a great campus that is safe and great for all students. There is a lot of opportunities for everyone here.
Freshman,4,"As of now I am enjoying my experience at the university of Rhode Island. I feel like it is a space where one feels comfortable to be themselves and meet new people. The university provides great opportunities and hands on work. The professors are also very comprehensive and understanding, which makes one feel good and feel like we're able to openly talk to them about anything."
Niche User,4,Beautiful school!  Didn’t get to do a tour but managed to be told about all the hidden gems by the amazing librarian that has worked there for 20 years!  Showed us the wall of fame on the 3rd floor. Amazing. Loved the charm of all the nestled buildings. I've also heard about the diversity and the culture that URI brings. I love the welcoming environment that URI offers.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman enrolled at the University of Rhode Island. It has been so exciting meeting new people from around the world and getting involved on campus. The students here are so kind and encouraging. Having the opportunity to live on campus has been the best experience, and I would recommend to others to try to become a Rhody Ram!"
Sophomore,4,"Rhode Island is an excellent school that's especially good for students in the Biology and Marine Biology fields. There's a beach less than 15 minutes away from the Kingston campus. However, there aren't many parking spaces at all, so don't bring a car if you come here."
Freshman,4,"Over the summer, I participated in URI's summer program called the Talent Development Summer Success program. This six week summer sessions help first-generation, low-income, students participated in college courses and help them become more prepared for college when they start classes in the fall. This experience for me was extremely helpful because it gave me a chance to transition into the college life before the academic year even started. Because I took this program, I feel like I am bound for success throughout my first 4 years at URI!!!"
Junior,4,"Making friends was the best part about college. Without them, my time there would have been horrible. Chemistry there is very hard."
Freshman,4,"Love the location, close to beaches and great restaurants. Professors are great but the food is pretty bad. Some dorms have been renovated so they are nice but others are old and no air conditioning."
Junior,4,"Although URI is not the most well known university, my experience has been very good so far. I am an incoming junior with a major in computer science. The computer science department is small and doesn't have a lot of funding compared to other departments. But, the professors are some of the best I have ever had. They really care about your education. There are a lot of opportunities for career development with various career fairs and a very good career center. Overall, this university is  more about the quality of professor's and the people than the funding."
Senior,4,"The college's curriculum is a ‘zero to six’ program; this means that you begin as a freshman and complete the program in six years and graduate with a Doctor of Pharmacy degree.  The program is so successful because it stresses critical thinking, active learning and clinical experience that prepares students for practice in a variety of professional settings."
Alum,4,"I truly enjoyed the experiences I gained over at the University of Rhode Island. The atmosphere is very safe and welcoming. The clubs and student life is incredible, one I will never forget. I enjoyed the education I received and all the courses I attended. Although some of the classes are larger in size, which is suitable for most, however was larger than I personally felt comfortable with due to enjoying a closer relationship with my professors and being able to ask questions whenever needed. This is something that they advertise so this does not deem to be a major problem. Overall, I would recommend this school to anyone."
Sophomore,4,"I love attending because I've been able to meet some of the greatest people in the world and had no problem networking. Everyone is so inviting, friendly, and helpful especially when navigating a new place."
Junior,4,The University of Rhode Island is a huge campus filled with many opportunities. It’s very diverse in what field a student might want to consider majoring. You get to meet lots of unique individuals and learn about many other cultural experiences.
Sophomore,4,"My first year at the University of Rhode Island was more than I ever expected. It was such a great year that I am eager to be back there in the fall. However, no one school is perfect. One thing that stands out to me when it comes to talking about improvement is the freshman dorms and living space. Although my roommates and I made the best out of our living area, it definitely could have used some maintenance and you could tell it had been around for a very long time. The school is putting money into so many other things such as sports and seniors housing, but they should really be putting all that money and building towards better freshman housing since they are the students who have to live on campus for the full first year. Things such as thicker walls, clean and secure window to keep out bugs, and an elevator for injured or handicapped people, are all things that should be provided in every dorm building, not just one."
Senior,4,The University of Rhode Island is a great Higher Education School with dedicated teachers working hard to help their students. The athletic program is also very good with the men's basketball team previously playing in the March Madness Tournament. Overall the experience at this school is very good.
Freshman,4,"When I walked onto the campus, I felt like I was home.  From that moment I Knew that I wanted to spend my next four years at URI.  Everyone  I came into contact with has been willing to go out of their way to be helpful.  There is something about a smile on a persons face that just makes you feel comfortable."
Junior,4,"When you get involved in the right organization, you'll have a blast and a great 4 years. The resources here for academic and personal success are through the roof however."
Senior,2,"If you fail a class after freshman year it stays on your transcript for good unlike other schools. They recently told over 1800 students they could not live on campus due to COVID-19 precautions. This means many students will have to live off campus, yet  the town of Narragansett--a popular spot for college residents in the area--has made plans to limit the amount of students living in a house to 3. This would impact students that have already signed lease agreements for up to 4+ people, meaning they would have to pay to break the lease and find somewhere else to live. Overall great school if you're going into pharmacy or something science related, nursing, engineering, or fashion but not really great for other majors. Also in the middle of nowhere so if you want to drive 20 mins to get literally anything you need it's a great school for you."
Freshman,2,"Very much if you're not in Greek Life you have no social life. Parties are invite-only and I felt like it was very much like high school. I do a club sport and at other schools, it's at most $100 to participate, mine cost over $300!! I felt like there were so many cliques and most students do not live on campus. I am not from Rhode Island and came here knowing no one, and felt very isolated a lot of the time. Academics are okay, but nothing spectacular. Hard to find something good to eat as a vegetarian."
Sophomore,2,Professors were all over the place and very weird preppy culture. I did not like the people here and did not feel it was the place for me. Everyone was very preppy and conceited. I felt like everyone was always trying to one-up each other and I am not that type of person. Professors were all over the place and were not good at teaching.
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms have 3 people crammed in them and are very small. In my dorm, rules were not enforced and other students in the hall disturbed those trying to study or sleep"
College Sophomore,2,It's too expensive and you will not have a life if you are not apart of it.
College Sophomore,2,Apparently in my school if you are not in greek life you have no life. Some greeks if they are nice they associate themselves outside of there fraternity or sorority. But most fraternities associate themselves with others. Girls are very snobby and stuck up in a sorority. It affects the people outside with the negative attitude they give and how they have no friends because they are not involved. My opinion is everyone who joins a frat or sorority is only paying for their friends and are fake.
College Sophomore,2,"I think that the school itself is alright if the environment is one that a student wants to be in. My favorite experience thus far is attending Gender and Women's Studies 150. I would never choose this school for myself if I could do it over. I didn't want to choose this school the first time, either. I don't enjoy the environment, the campus, or the fellow students. I am a ""straight edge,"" meaning I don't drink or use any type of drug, and URI students drink and use drugs regularly. It is hard to form relationships if one doesn't do the activities that most students like to do, so I don't do much. I do not feel like most professors care about student success, and that also makes me feel unhappy about attending the school."
College Freshman,2,Very few people find internships with the help of alumni or the university
College Freshman,2,"Housing is fine, but the social life is isolating. Most people just stay in their dorms with the dorm shut."
College Junior,2,"Hated my first two years. I lived in a triple in a room that used to be a closet. Second year I got a single, and lived with an entire hall full of freshman boys? Dorms are the hottest, most humid thing ever and the bathrooms range from okay to disgusting."
College Freshman,2,Heard very little about outside knowledge of the schools academics.
College Freshman,2,Im in Hillside which is the newest dorm on campus. Even though it is the cleanest and has the nicest study lounges the rooms are small. Triples are enforced constantly. RA's are either your best friend or worst enemy.
College Freshman,2,"Everybody in greek life already knows each other and only look into people from back home or the ""models"" of society. It is a major organization amongst the university and runs most social events."
College Freshman,2,"I would not choose URI again, I am currently in the transfer process. As an out of stater I have found it hard to find a place for myself. I have met many people and can call them friends but have not found a strong base to follow here. Everybody already knows each other here making it very difficult to join a group. Greek life is very overwhelming making it one of the only ways to truly meet people as the sports teams are not a big influence on campus."
College Sophomore,2,The quality of courses makes me feel as if I am not being challenged enough and the poor location of the school doesn't leave many options for things to do outside of class.
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms are small and they force triples on freshmen, making the rooms even more crowded and barely livable."
College Sophomore,2,School spirit isn't very noticeable on campus and sports aren't a large part of the school.
College Sophomore,2,"The location of this school is terrible and makes it very boring, especially coming from a big city."
College Freshman,2,"Overall the Greek life on campus is a pretty big deal. A big part of camps revolves around the Greek life students. There is a particular atmosphere on campus that if you are not apart of Greek life, you feel different and not included. These students are cliquey and run the school basically. Overall if you're not a Greek life student, this school is not very good because there is not a lot done for the non-greek life students."
College Freshman,2,Did not like it at all.
College Sophomore,2,URI needs to help students get summer internships.
College Freshman,2,it just wasn't right for me. Transferring somewhere next fall.
College Sophomore,2,"I am currently doing very well academically, however there is nothing fun to do on campus or around the town."
College Junior,2,there are lots of people who dont seem to have social skills
College Sophomore,2,Took way too long to process
College Sophomore,2,I would not be here filling out scholarship surveys and applications if I got the financial aid that I needed. The struggle is real bro.
College Freshman,2,Look what major u are taking. All of them have different ratings at this school.
College Freshman,2,"The housing is very tight and most people are tripled, the food is horrible, and there is nothing to do on campus for fun."
College Freshman,2,The off campus dining is the same repetitive grease joints located at the Emporium.
College Sophomore,2,"The freshman and sophomore dorms are very poor, but upperclassman and honors housing is pretty nice actually."
College Junior,2,"The sports at the school are basically a joke. While the games are fun to attend, a lot of the teams (I won't say who) honestly just can't play well."
College Freshman,2,"Housing is sub-par. Weldin, Barlow, and Hillside are the best. Mostly all housing are 3 per room. Very small rooms and pretty disgusting bathrooms. Mostly all students go off campus housing after Freshman year as upperclassman housing isn't great either."
College Freshman,2,"School is VERY strict on alcohol usage in dorms and on campus. RA's won't hesitate to write you up for noise violations and drinking. Otherwise, they leave you alone on most other things."
College Junior,2,"In the woods, on the side of a hill."
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid is hard to come by at URI. it can be a struggle to get the loans that you need to take out each semester especially when you aren't getting much if any financial aid through the school
College Sophomore,2,I wish the dorms were in better condition. The bathrooms that belongs to the suits are just as filthy.
College Sophomore,2,Pray you are not in the Sophmore Slums...
College Junior,2,"I don't have a car on campus, there is not nearly enough parking and it cost a bit too much for me to think it is worth it"
College Student,2,"There are some computers in the library but don't count on getting one if it is during finals week.  The Wifi is so-so, meaning that sometimes you will take 10 minutes to get a connection but once you have it you're good."
College Student,2,"It is a lot of work and if your good at it then go for it. If you like it, then go for it."
College Junior,2,I am very happy that we have Ripta to hop on in the winter to get to classes.
College Freshman,2,there is too much fast food and costs too much money
College Freshman,2,"We have shuttles running around campus all day and they come to every stop every few minutes. However, I have never used them because I would rather walk and not gain the freshman fifteen. The Ripta is definitely very helpful. No matter what stop you go to, the ride is two dollars. I have taken the ripta to providence to go to the mall and it worked out perfectly and it was cheap!! It goes all around Rhode Island including the party town, Narragansett. The only problem with it is that it stops running around 10:30. So you can't take it back to campus after going out to providence for the night or going into Narragansett. Then that leaves you with taking a cab.

Cabs are expensive. Its about $20 each way to go to Narragansett and its about $80 each way to go to providence so you should get a good sized group together if you're going to use that option. You also HAVE to book a cab early in the night if you want to get a ride. They book really really fast and I've gotten stuck in narragansett before. If worse comes to worse though, you can call a cop to pick you up and drive you back, but thats a last resort.

I brought my car to campus second semester and it was so worth it. If you don't want people driving your car then don't bring it because its a lot cheaper than using a cab if you get a friend to DD using your car for you and your friends. Then just have your friends throw in a couple bucks for gas money."
College Freshman,2,"When it snows, the shuttles are not enough to transport everyone"
College Freshman,2,They tend to be too strict in certain things making things more difficult and inconvenient
College Freshman,2,"You need to have your own computer, and printer unless you want to pay for printing (10 cents each page). The wifi here is AWFUL. it goes out 30 times a day, and is so slow. I would recommend bring a chord to help speed up the process. The printer you need to bring, CANNOT be wireless, it will not work (probably because the wifi is so bad)"
College Freshman,2,"There is a lot of alcohol and marijuana use on campus, especially in the freshman dorms"
College Freshman,2,The campus is always so windy and cold during winter
College Sophomore,2,It's more stressful than classes.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are very small, cold, and sometimes have insect infestations. I personally would rather live off-campus than to spend the money on URI dorms."
College Freshman,2,If you do not have a car there is actually nothing around unless you take a bus to providence or somewhere like that.
College Freshman,2,A lot of people would rather just smoke than go out and do something
College Freshman,2,"The hill makes the whole campus like a wind tunnel, it is bone chilling walking to classes in the winter."
College Freshman,2,"The smell of weed wafts around the campus all the time. We host Pot-Fest every year on 4/20 and the quad just turns into a giant hemp festival, where almost everyone is stoned and the University sells food and puts on music."
College Freshman,2,Unless you are in a frat or play a sport you aren't getting into any parties. It is pretty bad for underage students.
College Freshman,2,"Depends on the department, but from my experiences most of the learning here is done through the student taking the initiative and learning it on their own. The professors, outside of a rare few, don't really know how to teach."
College Junior,2,"This year the weather has been pretty bad, but it is sometimes milder during the winter months.  It is very slippery, but manageable."
College Junior,2,I had a really horrible experience with financial aid at the University of Rhode Island.  I lost a semester because of it.  My advice to you is to stay on top of it and you will be fine.  Please ask your parents for help if possible.  Work on it together.  Another option is to go to a free financial aid help center in your community.  DO NOT PAY FOR COMPLETING YOUR FAFSA!
Recent Alumnus,2,"Its not that I can blame classes being canceled due to the amount of snow that comes down in RI, it would be better if it did not snow as much though."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not care for the dinning hall food, makes me sick. "
Junior,1,"I wish I never applied to school here, or started attending classes here, URI is a huge for profit school, they don't care about whether, or not you, or your child learns anything. They make you pay upfront so they can fail you out of their STEM programs as fast as possible and then berate you the entire time for doing so. Save your money, save your time, save your sanity and go to school in Boston, or literally anywhere else for that matter. In all honesty, I would rather eat shards of glass while walking across hot coals than continue going to URI, but it's too late for me, but not for you."
Junior,1,"Same as above. I wish I never applied to school here, or started attending classes here, URI is a huge for profit school, they don't care about whether, or not you, or your child learns anything. They make you pay upfront so they can fail you out of their STEM programs as fast as possible and then berate you the entire time for doing so. Save your money, save your time, save your sanity and go to school in Boston, or literally anywhere else for that matter. In all honesty, I would rather eat shards of glass while walking across hot coals than continue going to URI, but it's too late for me, but not for you."
Freshman,1,"I was very unhappy at URI. I went random for my roommate and I guess that my fault, but still we could not have been more different I mean literally had nothing in common at all and were on completely opposite schedule, Why even fill out the common app and all those questions if they don't care and don't look it pointless. The services at URI is horrendous I've never seen people do there jobs so poorly. I asked for a room change with one of my good friends there before Christmas break and when I wen back 6 weeks later NOTHING CHANGED.  I mean they has 6 weeks off to do it and I didn't get that room change until I threat end to leave the school. Once my money was involved they were right on top of it.  Then when I finally did move out it took the people 6 weeks to go to my old dorm room and get the fridge that I had been using all year. I can really say I was very unhappy there and I don't recommend it. College has enough stress. Campus service shouldn't be the main cause of it."
Sophomore,1,"Bottom half of campus is gross as well as dining and housing. Need to be a part of greek life in order to go out and have fun. Not that many clubs or organizations to join. Also, the weather is terrible rains a lot so you will come back from class soaking wet. Most students live off campus when they aren't freshman anymore. However, the off campus housing is typically around 30 minutes away so you would expect to need a car."
Graduate Student,1,"I wouldn't recommend applying to the graduate school. I applied in late November and didn't receive a response by March.  This place is terrible for getting back to people and its hard to get a hold of anyone. Overall, bad customer service. DO NOT APPLY TO THIS SCHOOL BIG WASTE OF TIME!!!!!"
Freshman,1,"URI is a horrible place to go to school. The campus is ugly, the dining halls are HORRENDOUS and everyone knows it. EVERYONE leaves on the weekends and I mean everyone. They either visit other fun colleges or they go home because there is absolutely nothing to do in or near Kingston, Rhode Island. Nothing. The sophomore dorms are called the sophomore slums. All the parties are at least 15 minutes off campus, nothing on campus at all."
Freshman,1,"""This is a Business... and I will not take business away from this school and give it to another."" -MY ADVISOR"
Freshman,1,you pretty much have to be in greek life to get lit. or have a car on campus to get to invite only parties
College Sophomore,1,At parties and even if you are not at a party pills are taken all the time. Alcohol it depends if you are an alcoholic or not.
College Sophomore,1,"I detest Greek life on URI's campus. Greek life makes the social atmosphere of the school worse than it needs to be. Greek life encourages students to drink and do drugs, which I think is a horrible legacy to leave. Non- Greeks view Greeks as slightly snobby people who only care about throwing parties and hooking up with people. Greek housing is pretty nice on campus. The Greeks get their own house, depending on their letters, and they live with fellow members. They have kitchens and a living room, so they don't have to interact with other people if they didn't want to. You can often tell if there is a group of people from Greek life together because they wear the same clothes."
College Freshman,1,Only parties are off campus and are invitation only. its like high school all over again
College Freshman,1,"no parties on campus, if you don't have a car you are screwed"
College Freshman,1,"BEWARE OF THIS SCHOOL! I have had probably the worst year of my life attending this university. This school is a commuter school and only about 1/3 of its students live on campus. This, coupled with the fact that the only parties at this school are off campus, makes social life on campus NON-EXISTENT. The majority of the student body here is extremely cliquey and isn't interested in meeting new people. This probably stems from the fact that the majority of the student body here is from Rhode Island and will only socialize with their friends from high school. The only plus to this school are the gorgeous women, but they all have sky high standards and are really just a tease. After one year of hell, I am finally transferring and know at least five other people who are doing the same thing. I CANNOT WAIT TO LEAVE THIS AWFUL SCHOOL"
College Sophomore,1,Everyone is on some type of drug. It's ridiculous. And no one stops or enforces the rules. The 'three strike policy' is not enforced whatsoever.
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you're in Greek Life, there is no night life."
College Sophomore,1,There's nothing but parties at this school. All the time. I would be woken up every night by some drunk/high person either partying outside (when it's nice out) or right outside my door at like 3 in the morning.
College Sophomore,1,"It's all the same. Thin, preppy girls, and big, preppy guys. Not much diversity but there is some. If you don't fit that mold you won't do well here."
College Sophomore,1,There are not many interesting classes to choose from. Major classes are pretty cut and dry.
College Sophomore,1,"The Health Services building is difficult to find, and not very helpful. My roommate went when she was sick and they did nothing to help her. There are cops on campus but they don't do anything. Everyone runs stop signs and speeds, I'm scared to cross the street regardless if I'm in a crosswalk or not."
College Sophomore,1,There are not many opportunities from this school. There are always too many hoops you have to jump through before you can do anything.
College Sophomore,1,There are not many opportunities from this school. There are always too many hoops you have to jump through before you can do anything.
College Sophomore,1,"Dorms are too small, and always dirty. RA's don't care and often don't help."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek Life is the only thing ever going on on campus. If you're not in Greek Life, you're no one and there's nothing to do. 

plus, they're all snobs and believe they're better than everyone."
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you're in Greek Life/Sororities or Frats, there is absolutely nothing to do on campus. It's a huge party school, as in that's all that they do. Dorms are disgusting and constantly noisy/reeking of pot. Some professors are good/nice, most could care less how you do. Most also don't respond in a quick manner whatsoever."
College Freshman,1,"ATTENTION ALL INCOMING FRESHMAN: do NOT go to this school if you're not planning on joining a frat for sure freshman year!! there's no other good parties, all frats have are socials which are exclusive to the other sorority only. just not worth it go down south so much better"
College Freshman,1,They hounded me to pay loans and I  wasn't even out of school yet. Plus the people in Green hall are so mean.
College Senior,1,"Most of the people that I know of that are in sororities all look the same and act the same way. I honestly have no idea how being in a sorority/ fraternity would look better in a resume if all they do is heavy drinking and do horrible things to people who are rushing. To me, the people that I have seen in sororities are fake and are good at fooling others in who they really are."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus police are there to give you a speeding ticket for following the flow of traffic, and sexual assault victims DO NOT get the assistance that they need."
College Senior,1,Very hard to receive the financial aid you truly need. The financial aid office is not the most helpful. They cannot answer questions about what you can do if you still need more aid.Constantly tell you they have a thousand students to manage so processing your paperwork will take time. Must send in several forms to prove your financial need. I have suffered several headaches after dealing with these people. Constant disappointments.
College Freshman,1,"I have had a very bad experience with financial aid, and I am still struggling to pay for my tuition. This is why I am here."
College Sophomore,1,Campus is in the middle of no where. Good luck.
College Sophomore,1,Commuter and resident parking is the worst.
College Student,1,I am not enjoying it at all because I am not good at it. I dont want to just barely pass my classes.
College Freshman,1,After about a month I knew I wanted to transfer
College Freshman,1,There are rarely parties on campus and if you're not a girl or in greek life you're probably not going to any parties
College Freshman,1,"Greek life rules, if you're not in a frat theres not much to do"
College Freshman,1,Drinking on campus almost occurs daily but even more on friday and saturday nights. Greek life is a major cause of the problem. I know when they haze drinking and drugs are a part of the process.Its not a secret to anyone on campus.
College Sophomore,1,i do not get the financial support i should get. 
College Sophomore,1,Parking lots for commuters are too far and the shuttles are never on time. 
College Freshman,1,The parking lots are very far away and over priced. 
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have a car, good luck and if you do, good luck. Without a car it is hard to get anywhere. The Ripta offers transportation but is a confusing public bus system. If you own a car, get ready to be the designated driver. Everywhere."
College Freshman,1,None exists on the small campus
College Freshman,1,"Not that interested in parties. I know they exist and have had opportunities to attend. Average, I would say."
College Sophomore,1,"While the beaches are a major plus during the nice weather, the ""nice weather"" only lasts for a few weeks in the beginning of the school year and around finals week (which you can't even enjoy because of exams). New England winters are long and cold and the power has gone out on campus multiple times and cancels have been cancelled a few times. The walkways are always icy and never cleared very well, which makes getting to class a hassle, especially because the campus is one big hill."
College Sophomore,1,Parking at URI is awful. That is the main reason why I don't want to move off campus because of the hassle of having to wake up early to just find a decent parking spot. Living in the dorms is much more convenient and can save you lots of money because you don't have to worry about paying for a parking sticker (which is 200$) or your car getting towed (which is a notorious mid-night activity on campus).
College Senior,1,"I have to admit I absolutely HATE parking on my campus. I HATE IT. You can never find parking between 8:30 am through 2 pm, our parking permits are overpriced, the parking service officers are Nazis, and all three of our commuter parking lots are too far from many of the buildings in which people have class. Our university needs a complete parking makeover."
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any financial aid when I need it. They really are not helpful whatsoever when it comes to this they just base everything off of FAFSA.
College Sophomore,1,horrible dirty old dorms for lower and upper classman. they are spending money building yet another gym ( we already have 3 on campus) and what they need to spend their money on is updating the old crappy dorms
College Senior,1,Parkingpermits are expensive around $175 this year I believe. And if you park in the wrong parking lot or anything you get ticketed or towed and if you get towed it sucks it happened to me and I have to pay over $150 to get my car back.
College Senior,1,"URI is a dry campus, therefore they are pretty strict about any partying on campus. If you're caught you have to see the academic discipline council. After two strikes you lose housing. My advice, if you're looking for the college experience just do what everyone else does and move off campus."
College Junior,1,"The parking is absolutely awful at URI. There is not enough room to facilitate all of the cars on campus and one of the lots suggested is at the very bottom of campus, almost a 15-20 minute walk all uphill. Even worse is that in the winter they do not salt any walkways, so it is extremely icy and a lot of injuries are inflicted. Parking costs for residents are $250 and commuters are $175 a year. Unfortunately even with the high price of a parking sticker, parking is not guaranteed. 90% of Kingston's towing branches from URI. Almost everyone I know has been towed for at least $100. The school has had many complaints and students are often late for class due to the parking crisis."
Recent Alumnus,1,There is absolutely nothing to do unless you drive into Narragansett or into Providence.
College Freshman,1,"Yeah, there's a mediocre frat party here and there, but if you want to do ANYTHING other than grind on strangers in a crappy basement and don't have a car to get off campus, you're screwed."
College Freshman,1,"Rhode Island drivers are VERY slow and if you live off campus it can take a long time to get to school.  The buses don't that many places so it's difficult to find a bus to take.  They never run on time and are very inconsiderate of other people on the road, whether driving or walking. The buses drive all through campus and have even hit people before. There's a joke if you get hit by the RIPTA bus you get free tuition.. not sure if it's really a joke though."
College Freshman,1,"it sucks to say the least same stuff every day and there are 2 dining halls for about 15,000 students. Please tell me how thats supposed to work."
College Freshman,1,I recieved barely any financial aid and no scholarships. Im out of state which makes it harder to pay for this school. I am constantly trying to find ways to earn money or save money
Recent Alumnus,1,"You Better Have a Car. The University of Rhode Island's off campus housing is one of my least favorite attributes to the school. While the houses that are available off-campus for rent are very budget friendly and well maintained houses, they are all located far away from campus. It is impossible to live off-campus at URI unless you have a car. THe college neighborhoods are a good 20 minutes away from campus and with traffic and commuter parking you have to leave atleast an hour before your class time. I also think it is irresponsible for URI to promote off campus housing that is so far away from campus without offering a shuttle or ride program for students, it promotes drunk driving."
College Senior,1,New england weather. can get warm but can get real nasty
College Junior,1,"Parking at URI is rough to say the least. The lots are awfully far from classes and the shuttle sometimes leaves when students are running toward them to get to class. The price is hefty, but understandable considering we do have a shuttle system."
College Freshman,1,Buses Should Be Needed – As an active member of Greek life I feel there should be buses that are shuttle through ever two hours or so for students to get around in the area and be driven back to campus. For off campus parties sometimes there is no transportation or a person doesn't want to be designated driver. By providing the whole campus with these bus shuttles students can safely enjoy their weekends or weekdays. There would be lesser drunk driver accidents and an decrease drinking on the campus itself. The campus would stay cleaner

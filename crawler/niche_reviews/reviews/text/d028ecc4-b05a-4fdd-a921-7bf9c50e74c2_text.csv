Senior,5,"I'm glad my first three years were spent in-person because the campus and buildings are beautiful. The buildings are dome shaped and the inside is even cooler. Open classrooms and light projections on the ceiling. Really cool gear in all the equipment cages. Art and photography line the walls. If you're serious about design, photography, or any of the other fine arts I'd recommend LAC. Also ""Mama Terri"" in admin is the best!! If you have any problems she's there for you."
Senior,5,Virtual learning has taken some getting used to but my professors have tried really hard to make it work.
Alum,5,LAI in Winston Salem is a great school. I really enjoyed my time there.  The instructors are very helpful and knowledgeable about the materials that are being taught.  It is a great school to attend.
Senior,5,"Extremely knowledgeable faculty that focus on preparing you to go directly into working in your field. I have also gotten experience in other areas from working with students from other departments, which broadened my skill set. Made a lot of good friends that I look forward to continue working with."
College Senior,5,The school helps the students with job prospects.
College Senior,5,I feel the courses offered and the class sizes are great for me.  I like small classes because I like the one on one instruction that I get at Living Arts.
College Senior,5,This school is great.  I feel I am ready to enter the workforce with very marketable skills.
College Senior,5,This school is awesome!   The teachers are always available to help no matter how busy.  I like the school because it is small and everyone (staff and instructors) know your name.
Recent Alumnus,5,The instructors take time to make sure that the students understand the topics that are taught during the classes. If you need help with anything they are there for you.  LAI has a mentor program for the students and also you can come in for tutoring when you need help with your classes.
Recent Alumnus,5,LAI keeps you informed of job openings and information that is helpful in your career.
Recent Alumnus,5,"LAI in Winston Salem the classes and the instructors are great. My courses consisted of Medical Terminology, Anatomy and Physiology, Intro to Pharmacology, Therapeutic communications, Intro Computers, Professional Development, Pharmacology Clinical Essentials are some the classes that are offered. The instructors are nice, friendly and great at their jobs. The instructors are very helpful."
Recent Alumnus,5,When you go out on your internship you are sent out to some offices where you may have the opportunity to be hired. You are sent out to some great medical offices where you get a lot of great training.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The work load is hard, you just have to be dedicated and apply yourself to your work.  I worked full time and was a full time student at Living Arts Institute (LAI). I worked five days a week and every other weekend. It was challenging trying to fit in time to due my homework, spend time with my family.  It was a great experience for me."
Recent Alumnus,5,I went to Living Arts Institute in Winston Salem and I loved it.  I really enjoyed that after you finished your courses you got to go out on an externship to work in your field before graduation.
College Senior,5,They were awesome about taking my credits from my 4 year university
College Senior,5,Already have a job lined up after graduation.
College Senior,5,It is terrific.  I am definitely happy and will be recommending this school.
College Senior,5,Great academic experience.  Instructors are very helpful.
College Senior,5,This experience has been wonderful.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The academic experience was great. I enjoyed the whole learning process from the homework, books, and tests all the way up to the externship. Again I was hired from my externship. Why wouldn't it be good?"
Freshman,4,"So far most of my classes are in class. The only online classes I have had were also taken place in the classroom. I learn just as much, but as all online classes go confusion still occurs."
Freshman,4,So far Living Arts College is a great experience. I feel as though I have learned more in these 5 months than I have in the last 4 years.
Freshman,4,"My current experience at Living Arts College is awesome. Luckily, I was fortunate to be placed in an Apartment by the school for my first year; it is very beautiful. The area is great; there are a lot of great restaurants and places to shop."
Senior,4,"The school is highly specialized in the six majors that it offers: Interactive Media, Animation & Game Design, Interior Design, Photography, Audio Engineering, and Film.  Nearly every teacher hired to instruct the student body has been exposed to the line of work themselves, so they understand what's required to be successful in their field.  The external parts of the college, such as student/professional services, financial aid, admissions, and other staff have been wonderful in managing the school and providing students the information they need to progress in their field of study."
Senior,4,"If you come here to put in work, you’ll be fine. The largest issue is that it attracts some very lazy students that fail to do anything with their degrees because they want everything handed to them."
Works Here,4,The college works really hard to do the very best for their students. The vice president takes great pride in her students and will bend over backwards to assist them in making network contacts.
College Sophomore,4,Students learn on the latest technology and learn hands on compare to just theory
College Sophomore,4,"After talking with current and past students, I found that every one is very satisfied with what they had learned and the way their careers are going."
College Sophomore,4,everyone was so helpful and nice
College Junior,4,"Pretty Fun Experience – So far that i've been here i've had a very enjoyable experience. what makes this school so unique is the amount of creative freedom given. Minus the medical students here, students are not judged on how creative they present themselves in public such as crazy hair, or crazy wardrobes. It is an art school and therefore people are rarely alienated."
College Sophomore,4,Super Small – This school is super small and the teachers help you when needed.
College Junior,2,"Needs More Focus – While I like that the school wants to give you a large skillset, I think they should focus on the skill that you wanted to be good at in the first place: your major. But in the end a degree will get you far, so I can't complain."
College Junior,2,"A High School – This school is honestly ran like a high school. The maturity level is amusing coming from an 18 year old out of high school for barely a year. However i will go on to say that the students are very accepting, minus the medical students."

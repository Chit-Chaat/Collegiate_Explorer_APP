Alum,5,I felt like Mercer was on the cutting edge at the time. When I attended Mercer the courses and educators were very comfortable in online learning and led to an extremely successful learning experience.
Alum,5,I spent two years at Mercer for undergrad. I loved the campus and loved the University Center. It has a small town feel in a fairly large city. The on campus experience is fantastic as a majority of students live on or near campus. Great downtown and plenty of great college experience. The University also has great sports and interesting speakers. The University Center has given the University a truly unique feel. I loved my two years as a student there.
Alum,5,"Mercer University is a wonderful university. The service and research opportunities are top tier, especially for a school of this size. The professors are top notch and go above and beyond to serve students. I loved my time at Mercer and believe the opportunities Mercer gave have changed my life. Campus is also beautiful, walkable and has lots of green space."
Alum,5,My graduate classes are online and the professors are great and very thoughtful.  They are available outside of scheduled classes.
Sophomore,5,"Mercer University aims to help students become very well rounded. Not only are the professors and faculty teaching students to become professionals, they are also helping students become leaders amongst their peers and in their communities."
Sophomore,5,They made the learning experience from in class to online seamless. Professors guided students and made sure communication was their priority.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Mercer has been an awesome one. With the campus being small, you get direct access to all your professors and the help that you need. Our professors are always willing to help, easily accessible, and give many resources. All the students on campus are friendly and get to hang around. However, one thing I would like to see change is diversity within the school. I feel as though minorities don't have enough outlets to let out their issues and problems that they face on an everyday basis. As a minority, I feel as though it would help. Nevertheless, we have several minority clubs that we can join to help us cope with our experience and possible loneliness. Overall, I love Mercer and can't wait to expand my horizons here."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online classes, because they don't offer very many for classes for my major. In person was preferable to online classes."
Alum,5,The professors are amazing and dedicated to helping their students succeed. The school is located near Mercer Village which has amazing food choices.
Senior,5,Mercer is a fantastic school. The professors are excellent and the student body is warm and welcoming. I am so glad I decided to pursue an education in nursing here.
Sophomore,5,"My online experience has been a positive experience with excellent support.
Although, the experience has been positive, I look forward to returning to campus."
Freshman,5,I feel mercer made a wonderful transition to online and I felt very accommodated during the time. They made sure the professors were very understanding.
Freshman,5,I really love the small family feel of Mercer. Everyone is so friendly and the class size is a perfect match for the amazing academic programs offered. I loved it.
Sophomore,5,Most professors here really just want the best for their students. They are willing to go out of their way to ensure that their students feel confident in class materials. The beautiful campus and friendly atmosphere are plusses too!
Freshman,5,"I loved Mercer but couldn't stay due to financial reasons. I was caught in the trap of middle class but couldn't afford Mercer. Campus is walkable, 10 mins from end to end max. Professors are incredible. They're smart and classes are definitely rigorous. I never had to wait more than a few hours for a response from a professor, even late at night. Dorms are hit or miss. Legacy and Sherwood are great but the rest aren't so great. Mercer also has a contract with the Lofts and the 3 year live on requirement, so they have a monopoly on off campus housing. It is insane as a student have to pay $900+ a month for an apartment. Campus food is actually pretty great and the freshman meal plan is bomb. Bring rain boots and an umbrella because the drainage on campus is bad so water flows down all the sidewalks. Paper mill stinks but you get used to it. Definitely a party scene in greek life or athletic teams, it's just under the radar. I loved Mercer and will miss it."
Graduate Student,5,Great program! The professors are very helpful and class sizes are small. Location is perfect for me and they offer online classes.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Mercer University! It is the BEST college for me personally from its smaller size, leadership opportunities, professor to student ratio, rigorous classwork and all of the fun things to do!"
Niche User,5,Advisers has really help me to stay in school and continue to work towards my degree. The school is a bit pricey and my adviser has tried to help me find scholarships to be able to stay in school.
Freshman,5,Beautiful campus full of great people and amazing professors. The staff and admissions workers really want to give you the best opportunity here and you aren't just a number.
Niche User,5,Everyone is super welcoming and friendly. I love that the campus is smaller so I’m not constantly running around
Freshman,5,"Here at Mercer University, you would undoubtedly be given plenty of opportunities that you will not find at other colleges. Mercer has presented me so many opportunities from studying abroad, service in my community, and life-long friendships. At Mercer, the professors are so helpful, friendly, and understanding. Like other universities, there are rules, but here they truly want you to succeed. With an average class size of around 22 students, you form personal relationships and friendships with your professors. With that being said, you are able to approach them with anything whether that is a simple conversation, advice, or recommendation letters. Although I had trouble picking a university to attend, I do not regret my decision under any circumstance."
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus, great people, and a great education that will prepare you for life. Both of my parents went to mercer and as a child I had dreamed of going to that university. I have finally had that chance and it is everything I had ever dreamed of."
Alum,5,"I loved Mercer. I felt like I was really known on campus and wasn't just a number in the classroom. The campus was easy to navigate, and there always seemed to be something going on on campus."
Junior,5,I love Mercer! Small classes and personal relationships with your professors can't be beat. I've attended larger public universities and found myself lost in a sea of faces. At Mercer they really care about innovation and academic success.
Junior,5,This school genuinely wants me to succeed. They have helped me out in so many ways. The number of students is low enough to get a lot of individual help and most of the professors are helpful.
Freshman,5,It’s my first year at Mercer and it’s pretty amazing so far. Everyone gets along and the campus is a good size. Classes are a good size so it’s easier to receive help.
Graduate Student,5,Awesome experience.  Spiritually and academically fed.  Loved it and want more of it.  Excellent experience for those who are undecided about where their place in the world.  You will find your calling and much more.  So seek and find your calling.  You are worth it.
Freshman,5,"Mercer is an excellent school. I was very impressed when I visited campus for the first time. There exists a large amount of service opportunities and a personalized education here. My only complaint would be that Mercer is very cheap and tight on money. The physical experience you get is not really worth the amount of money that you put into the school. The dorms are infested with black mold and the employees that are supposed to clean them just sit around all day and hardly do anything. The quality of the food is a little under average. The main cafeteria is a health hazard. The employees aren't managed very well. The way that the food is handled and prepared is concerning. The hours are also terrible. There is practically nothing opened on the weekends for the large amount of money that freshmen have to pay for meal plans. If Mercer could invest in better management of the food services, residential life, and upkeep their infrastructure, things would be a lot better off."
Niche User,5,I love Mercer when my mom used to work there because I got to experience and tour the campus and the people are very friendly and polite.
Junior,5,"Mercer University is a wonderful school. The staff are all well-educated and helpful. The professors teach classes; no TAs teach a lecture. You get so many opportunities because of the size of the school. The campus is beautiful. The only downfall is the area surrounding campus. It is a little rough, with criminal activity. Also, there are never enough parking spots for the amount of students who live and commute to campus."
Freshman,5,"I have had a great start at Mercer and see it being the best 4 years of my life. I came here with some hesitation but now that I’m here it feels like a home away from home. Great people, lively campus, good food, rigorous courses, and just a great vibe no matter what dorm you’re in"
Niche User,5,"Mercer University is my dream school. I am currently a high school student but have been on campus for many reasons, and every encounter has been pleasant."
Graduate Student,5,"Mercer University is an institution that is not only invested wholeheartedly in the education of its students but also in inspiring students to use their education to make the world a better place. Professors are clear and friendly and seek to make their classes engaging. Because of the smaller class sizes, students get to know their professors and vice versa, allowing mentor relationships to form that last well beyond the four years of undergraduate. Overall, Mercer is a school that is equally focused on the development of the student as well as what the student can do to make a difference with their education"
Graduate Student,5,"I love that it is geared towards the working adult.  The atmosphere of the classroom and the knowledge of the instructors make prepares you for life.  The instructors prepare students for professional growth, assist with deciding on your dissertation topic, research, and placement after graduation."
Junior,5,Mercer has proven to be an outstanding college not only with the academics but also with the staff. I have always gotten a timely response from each professor and have never doubted that each teacher wanted me to do well.
Junior,5,"Mercer has a great atmosphere: everyone is kind, and the staff and professors care about you (for the most part). Housing could be way better, but improvements are coming apparently. I’m mainly here for the academics though, and I’m not disappointed. I definitely feel like I’m paying for the education that I’m receiving, at least in STEM CLASSES. (I can’t really speak about non-STEM academics, aside from gen eds.)"
Graduate Student,5,Mercer is a great community that wants to see you succeed. Great support is provided by the staff and my peers.
Freshman,5,My experience at Mercer University has been amazing so far! I couldn't imagine being anywhere else. I love that I don't feel like I'm just a number here. The care for students' education and overall experience in college is evident here.
Freshman,5,Mercer has provided me with an university that I am ready to make my mark on. It has allowed me the opportunity to achieve my career goals and meet new life long friends along the way.
Niche User,5,"I went to a Saturday Preview of Mercer and absolutely LOVED it. The students were very informational and helpful with campus life and classes. There are so many classes to choose from, and I could tell that many of them were challenging. Overall my experience was very great!"
Freshman,5,Very challenging school that is full of caring educators. Has the opportunities of a large university with the intimacy of a small university
Niche User,5,"Mercer University is a great school for those looking at small sized colleges. It has a very welcoming atmosphere and the people there are all eager to meet you and make you feel welcome. Their music program is one of the best in Georgia, in my opinion, so if you're looking to be a music major, Mercer is definitely one you should check out. Overall, it's a very good school that aims to help students succeed in every aspect of their college career and beyond."
Freshman,5,"This is a great school.  Between the classes, professors, and the new friends I've made, this was a great choice for me."
Niche User,5,"WOW! SEEMS LIKE A GREAT SCHOOL! People are socially active both on campus and political sphere. Love the campus and the area around the campus. It's a great school for nursing, love how people around me are recommending me this school!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Mercer University. I'm a sophomore here now and it's so community-based! If you want to go out and be social, you can. But if you want to stay in or focus on your studies, it's easy to do as well!"
Junior,5,"I adore Mercer. It has something for everyone- whether it be studying abroad opportunities or intramural sports (of which Mercer has a wide variety.) Traveling the world is very easy with Mercer because there is a wide variety of programs. Its one of the best parts of Mercer. Mercer on a Mission offers students the chance to take classes with Mercer Professours and then do service abroad- such as Vietnam or South Africa; however, the best part is that very affordable. There really is something for anyone."
Graduate Student,5,I've only just begun my studies at Mercer and so far I am loving the institution. The professors are very knowledgeable and passionate about accounting. I feel engaged in all of my classes and am learning a great deal. Mercer's staff is also very well connected with businesses and offer students the opportunity to meet with employers during on campus events.
Junior,5,"My favorite part about Mercer is that there’s always a way to get involved on campus. Wether it’s through clubs, sports, or jobs you can always find a way to stay connected with other bears!"
Freshman,5,"I am a current freshman at Mercer University. Students can individually interact & get to know their professors well since Mercer has a tight-knit community. We have various clubs and organizations for everyone: Greek life, athletics, student council, choir, and other social groups. Beautiful foliage and trees adorn the campus."
Junior,5,"Mercer is a good school, I really like it.  Nice campus, only complaint is that they need more parking."
Junior,5,"Mercer is a very reputable college with one of the best engineering programs in the US. It is a tough program that requires you to work for your degree. Mercer University has a cutting edge research center (MERC) that employs engineers and scientist and allows students to get hands on experience in their field. They coordinate with companies that offer summer internships to give you the experience you need to be an in-demand graduate. I am very proud to attend Mercer University in Macon, Georgia."
Junior,5,"I love Mercer. It is just the right size campus, and there is something for everyone to be involved in: Greek life, student organizations, intramural teams, honor societies. Class sizes are perfect for the standard of rigor the college has set. I wish the administration was ran smoother; after freshman year, there seems to be a sort of drop-off in communication and care."
Junior,5,"Taking the tour is definitely something everyone attending this school should do. It is a beautiful campus with a lot of different buildings, along with being a community in itself that makes you feel at home."
Senior,5,Mercer University instantly welcomes you into their family. There are always fun activities on campus and the professors are so supportive.
Sophomore,5,"I love mercer, it truly feels like home! The campus and campus life is something that cannot be matched anywhere else!"
Niche User,5,I attend Mercer during the summer through a program called Upward Bound. its a fun experience mettign new people and learning new things in and out the classroom.
Freshman,5,Mercer is home. This school promotes service and leadership around the community and globe. It opens doors that I did not even know existed. The professors are dedicated to helping you succeed and each student is a helping hand. I am thankful for this university.
Freshman,5,I LOVE Mercer! The school has such a loving and family like community and the professors are so passionate about the student's success. The only thing I would change is the admissions cost.
Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere that Mercer University has. The students on campus are very friendly and are very welcoming. They have many different fields of study that you can study and they give you that home felt college life that you could ever want in a college.
Niche User,5,I visited Mercer University. I went to a Saturday preview and heritage scholars day. It has a very nice campus.
Alum,4,"Mercer's Macon undergraduate campus was an incredible place to spend 4 years getting my BA in Biology. The only issue I had in going there was that I felt as if you were not going into one of their graduate programs, you were not given as much guidance on where to follow after graduation. I am now back at Mercer trying to finish up my prerequisites for nursing school."
Alum,4,"I have not had much of an experience with online learning at Mercer, but in August I will start full time as an online student."
Junior,4,"Due to corona Mercer went fully online last semester. It was challenging at first because everybody had to do some adjusting. Overall, Mercer coped best they could with the situation. I would personally not recommend online classes, but I think it boils down to learning style."
Senior,4,Online learning at Mercer was Okay. No one was prepared to transition online in the middle of a pandemic so It was hectic for a little bit. Once everything settled we had a routine for our classes and everything went well.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience has been very good. As with any campus, there is need for improvement. Dinning and dorms can always present more choices and upgrades."
Senior,4,Mercer offers great resources and opportunities for a variety of interests. On campus and on the outside it may not look like a lot of things are going on in such a small place but you just have to stay informed and get involved with a few groups. A new world of interests and service opportunities will open up when you go out and search for them. But you have to stay connected and go to events and force yourself to meet new people. Although the food options are getting better it is at a very slow rate and they need to change their main cafeteria (The Fresh Food Company) as it is very unsanitary. They need more dorms instead of expensive Lofts as Mercer is severely overcrowded and there are limited parking spaces which could be fixed with a parking garage. The students suffer when Mercer doesn't communicate properly or act in a timely manner.
Junior,4,My online experience was fine. I believe it was the same for everyone across the country ; unexpected and difficult to adjust to
Sophomore,4,Overall is has been a good experience.  The food will have to make a major improvement. Housing has issues with the older dorms. The Lofts are a good place to live but has issues with being part of campus and other times that are stand alone. The internet needs to be hard wired and not just WiFi.
Freshman,4,Being online has not been very difficult. My professors are very understanding and flexible making it easy to get assignments completed.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Mercer University has been great. Everyone, from the staff and faculty to the other students, have been extremely welcoming and inclusive. I have made wonderful friends that I believe will be in my life forever and so many different clubs from cultural to entertainment it is hard to choose. One thing I would like to change about my school is the number of opportunities for scholarships. It would be beneficial to students who are having difficulty paying for college to have more opportunities and diversity in scholarships."
Senior,4,The campus looks very nice. The people are also very welcoming and the area is surrounded by excellent scenery.
Freshman,4,"I just finished my freshman year and its better than i could've imagined. Even with the covid crisis, the staff handled everything very well. A certain teacher did become lazy once we moved online but that doesn't reflect the whole staff. Overall it was a great year at Mercer"
Freshman,4,"like i said above, it was handled really well despite some lack of effort on a certain party. Overa it was good"
Junior,4,"Mercer University is an Institution that will challenge you and will prepare you well for any profession you choose to enter. Even though the curriculum is rigorous, you will have support from your fellow peers."
Freshman,4,Administration can be difficult and rude depending on who you talk to. Overall academics are challenging but this is easily worked around due to tutoring services.
Sophomore,4,Mercer University is one of the hardest universities. Its very tedious but it will be very worth it in the end !
Freshman,4,I love Mercer University's campus and facilities; they are very well kept. I would like to see better dining options for students.
Sophomore,4,"I like Mercer Overall but the surrounding area isn't very safe and the campus food is average at best with limited diversity in options. Dorms are okay at best though there are huge disparities in the quality of them. For example, Plunkett hall is unquestionably the worst dorm on campus and Legacy would be considered the best for Freshmen. PLunkett has problems with AC/Heating, cleanilness, mold, outdated and almost shabby in structure and appearance yet the Legacy dormitory was the blinding opposite. It was new, beautiful in desgin with a modern look and students had no issues with mold or their windows not being able to open. All that being said, Mercer has incredible professors. They're are usually excellent and very intelligent and willing to help students and make sure you learn what you need to."
Freshman,4,Mercer is an excellent school. It has a very welcoming atmosphere with outstanding professors. My only complaint would be the physical condition of the campus. There are a few very nice new buildings. Most of the old buildings and dorms are outdated and dirty. Mercer hardly puts any money into renovations and repairs. The food management is also terrible. If you are looking for a quality education and uplifting community and are not particular about the physical environment then it is a great place to be!
Senior,4,I went to a scholarship event at Mercer. The students and the staff were very welcoming and answered any questions that I could possibly ask. The environment and the staff are very welcoming and the college itself offers hands-on experience for students through labs.
Junior,4,I really enjoy Mercer University.  Their engineering program has a complete pre-set course plan.  The campus is beautiful and safe.  The professors are very helpful and accommodating. They work hard at helping students find ways to finance their education.  The only thing I would like to see improved on is their athletic programs.  The college is more academic minded.
Freshman,4,"The college, at least the Liberal Arts side of it, is full of an emphasis on learning rather than memorizing and teaching skills that could be used in most facets of life rather than something only to be used for one semester and then never remembered again. The curriculum is tied together to emphasize that and every student will most likely gain a fresh mindset on certain aspects of life or skills applicable to any career field."
Sophomore,4,Some of the mandatory classes are frustrating and take more work than classes where you actually learn things. They also have a strong Christian backing so expect them to talk about God in class. Otherwise it’s great and the teachers are amazing.
Niche User,4,"Mercer is a great school. Loved atmosphere & facilities. It’s a private college so tuition is expensive. Everyone (students) is friendly & there are lots of social events, clubs & extracurricular activities. Academics are challenging. Could have used better advisement choosing classes, and more help from professors. There is some tutoring available from other students. Due to size of college & class sizes (60 or so students) it’s hard to get individual help. Found a full class load overwhelming due to rigor of subjects taken. Biggest problem is expense."
Alum,4,"As a student athlete at Mercer University, I found it possible to have a good academics/athletics balance, though the athletic department doesn't always take into account student input on coaches (on my 4th year I unfortunately had a truly awful one).
I found Mercer On Mission to be a life changing experience, and would recommend MU for that reason alone.
You will find professors that will become mentors, particularly in the chemistry and business departments (speaking from experience)."
Sophomore,4,"The admissions process at Mercer University was by far the most delightful. I told my dad the day we toured that everyone looked so happy. I started at Mercer as a sophomore due to my dual-enrollment credits. I am taking 17 credits my first semester here, and I have hypothetically figured out a way to graduate with my bachelor's in psychology in two years. I love this campus. It genuinely feels like a home. However, I will have completed all of the courses I need my major, minor, and gen-ed requirements in a little under two years, but because they will not reach 120 credit hours, I will not be allowed to graduate early. I have to stay and pay for another eleven classes even though I will have technically completed all I need to. I find this pointless and a waste of money."
Sophomore,4,"Mercer is a small and friendly community. We love to help whenever and wherever we can, whether that be in school or out in the community. Our classes are small, so students can receive more  1-on-1 time with professors!"
Freshman,4,"I love the campus because it is very spacious yet you are connected to your peers. The professors in the business school are so helpful and are willing to connect students to scholarships and internship opportunities. Mercer is very dedicated to providing every student with an internship because it helps students to find good future jobs. Overall, the campus is a great environment for  college students."
Senior,4,"I like the community connections that Mercer offers. When attending Mercer, there is a tight knit community that you are instantly a member of. Everyone is so supportive of your goals, plans, and dreams to pursue your career."
Senior,4,"Mercer is very fostering of advancing education, sometimes the resources aren't quite there though. Like any other college, you can find professors who go above and beyond to help you and then you'll find professors who just simply don't care anymore."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the diversity on campus. The faculty and staff are brilliant and truly want to help all the students in whatever capacity. The campus is self is beautiful, however the older dorms need a lot of TLC and there needs to be more affordable on- campus housing. The food is not great, the dining halls hold weird hours, especially on the weekends and the food is a hit-or-miss. Overall its a good school with lots of opportunity for success."
Sophomore,4,"Mercer is a great fit for students looking for a small scale college with great relationships between students and professors. Classes are usually small giving room for questions and interaction. At Mercer, students are more than a number in a system."
Sophomore,4,"Mercer provides rigorous and extremely challenging courses and programs. Faculty members are engaged and care about the students. The campus is absolutely beautiful and developing even more. However, the surrounding area and Macon in generally are not necessarily known for being safe and beautiful."
Graduate Student,4,"I attend Mercer University for my MBA. I received the idea to apply from my sister who obtained her Bachelor's degree from Mercer. She had an amazing experience where she was involved in different events and had a great rapport with her professors. Although most of most classes have been online I am able to communicate with my professors often. This semester I am taking an in person class and my professor remembered me from a class I had taken with him prior showing deep investment in student success. Additionally, whether online or in person students are invited to  participate in career fairs, varying events and presentations."
Freshman,4,"The school, although private, charges an outrageous amount for things that they make mandatory. They also are poor at communication with students on important matters."
Freshman,4,Mercer University is one of the best colleges in Georgia. The professors here genuinely care about each and every one of their students. There is always a way to get involved on campus. The students are all so friendly and welcoming.
Junior,4,Return books between campus. It should be easy to return books even if you are not at the designated campus .
Junior,4,I attend the Atlanta campus and not the Macon campus so my experience is probably a little different but its a great school if you are looking for a non-traditional experience because it geared more towards the people with a busy outside life and adult issues .
Sophomore,4,"Mercer University is a very prestigious university that offers a plethora of opportunities for every type of professional field that one chooses to study. The academic rigor of Mercer university is challenging, and causes one to master time management, self-discipline, and studiositas. The education and professors offered at Mercer are very advanced and upscale. The campus offers several research programs, jobs, student tutoring, and study abroad programs in addition to class curriculum. There are several ways to have fun on campus including various clubs, intramural sports teams, and hots pots for social activities with friends. Overall, I would say Mercer University is a very good school with much to offer its students."
Sophomore,4,It’s a very friendly atmosphere. Most of the people you meet are nice and the food is pretty is good. Also there is always something to do on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Mercer university is nice close knit community. Due to its small size and low student population, it is simple to connect with everyone making it seem like a family there. However, the class at mercer are tough, but the professors make it easy to offer help to the student with their office hours. The negative thing about Mercer University is it's location; Macon does not offer a lot of things to do and it can get boring."
Junior,4,My time at Mercer has been wonderful. The staff are friendly and helpful. The classes are small and there is always help with math labs and study groups.
Junior,4,It’s been a pretty good experience overall.   No complaints. You must work hard and study in advance as well as put in a good effort.  I suggest not working while studying.
Senior,4,"Mercer University is a great school overall. The people here made me feel so welcome, and I truly felt like part of a family during my 3 years as a student. Most of the professors are incredible people; I could tell they wanted to see me do well. Because of the small class sizes, it is really easy to build relationships with your professors and get to know other students. For me, this really helped to ensure my success in classes. In addition, there are lots of organizations and volunteer opportunities on campus to help students get involved in the community and feel at home. The campus is absolutely beautiful! However, housing isn't the greatest; some of the dorms are rather old. A few dorms are new or have been renovated recently, so those offer a better living situation. Also, there aren't many food options on campus, and I rarely visited some, as the food was inedible. The meal plans they offer are ridiculous and are not at all worth the money you are asked to spend."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Mercer University is a school that builds students to impact the world. The faculty are always open to help students with their struggles and do not hesitate to tell students about any opportunities that might benefit them."
Sophomore,4,"Overall everything is pretty good. Some of the dorms and buildings are old, but they are historical landmarks so there's not much to be done there. The buildings that aren't historical are skjdbflak"
Sophomore,4,"Mercer University is an excellent college with rigorous academics and professors that generally know their students and seem to care about them. I love the small class sizes and personal interactions. It's a great learning environment! The cafeteria isn't very allergy-friendly (celiac) Dorms are old and runnfown.RA doesn't do anything if students disobey rules like smoking and having members of opposite sex in for romps all night. I know many students who drink and do drugs on campus in dorms and nothing is ever said or done about it.  Fraternity parties are a regular thing but not my style. As a non-drinker and non-party person I just wish I could find other ""like-minded"" individuals to hang out with because I don't quite fit in with the ones in my area. It's still better than going to college back home up north and a lot less expensive. I love my professors and class sizes and I'm learning every day. That's what I am here for."
Sophomore,4,"Mercer is a great university with history and multiple programs on campus. While meals and housing can be problematic at times, I am engaged with my studies and enjoy classes."
Junior,4,I like the fact that the classes are smaller and the professors really care that you learn.  The campus is beautiful and very safe.  They have a great library.  The campus life is good.  The food is also great.
Freshman,4,The campus is extremely welcoming. You can walk around school and see many people that you know but also see new faces every day. There are so many activities and organizations that help you find your niche quickly and help you acclimate to college life.
Freshman,4,"Mercer University offers a lot of rigorous courses which I love, but it is definitely not for everyone. Most of the professors seem to really care about whether you succeed in their class or not, and they are very helpful outside of class. The campus is small but very pretty and provides great exercise, and is very historical. Overall, Mercer is a great school that is growing everyday."
Freshman,4,"Although Mercer isn't the newest and most impressive-looking college, it has amazing professors and resources that make up for it."
Sophomore,4,"Mercer University is a great, small campus. It is very academically challenging, but the professors here are excellent (with very few exceptions). Mercer has many opportunities to gain connections for after graduation. One of the negatives about Mercer is definitely the dining options. The hours during finals and holidays are horrible, especially for students that have to stay on campus. Overall, an excellent university!"
Graduate Student,4,"I am currently a graduate student at Mercer University. I could not be happier with where I am today. Knowing the great amount of loan that's piling, I am grateful that my parents allow me to become a bear. I love the professors and students at Mercer. The school isn't too big, so everyone is like a family at this university. I graduate from Mercer University Undergraduate program. Now I am currently enrolled in a graduate program at Mercer in the Atlanta campus. Both campuses provide great preparation for the real world. I love that the school offers small class sizes and opportunity to interact with the professors. College can be very stressful, but Mercer offers destresser events and opportunities for students. I thank God everyday for this opportunity I have at Mercer University."
Niche User,4,I loved its variety in majors as well as its campus. It was beautiful and not too busy. I would like more options in terms of scholarships.
Senior,4,"Mercer University is a great school to attend. The quality of the education is worth the hefty investment. The school is in the process of increasing diversity and the social construct around it, but it has a way to go. The professors are great and love to help."
Sophomore,4,"Mercer is a great school, especially if you are wanting to go into the Law, Medical, or Engineering fields. There are also plenty of organizations to join and extracurricular activities to do. Only negative I've found with Mercer is their food choices and availability. There are plenty of different food options, however some more healthy variations would be a nice addition. On the weekends it is almost in possible to find any food location open, especially at weird hours whenever you are getting the munchies."
Sophomore,4,The campus is gorgeous. Food could be better. Love the friends and sisters I made here - seriously some friends for life.
Sophomore,4,"I have only been at this college for 1 year now, but I really enjoy the small class sizes which really allow for a student to ask questions and get involved."
Freshman,4,"At first, it took some time to transition from being a high schooler to a college student. Everything is a different experience and I learned a lot from my first year. Overall, Mercer is a great fit for me because it's a small school. I was able to make many friends and be involved in a lot of things. Mercer has its ups and downs, but I learned to make most of my time here the best as possible. It's important to get involved with the school, so there is no feeling of not fitting in or not liking the school."
Freshman,2,"My experience at Mercer was wild. Though I have some good memories from being there, the bad memories shadow the good ones. The students at Mercer are off. It's like their afraid to say hey back when you say hey to them. They also judge you if you don't go to parties like its some requirement for students. The food there is HORRIBLE. I got food poisoning from eating their food and so did many other students. The dorms are in desperate need of renovation. I definitely will never forget Mercer. It has left an impact in my life and education."
Senior,2,"The professors accuse you of teaching if you have the same answer as literally anyone in the course, with 0 material to back up their logic, but you cannot fight the mercer honor council system as it only exists to side with the Mercer faculty."
Senior,2,"This is the worst run institute I have ever seen. Their administration does not care for the students whatsoever and the school does everything in their power to limit the freedom of their students. The professors for the most part are good but they know they have no power to say where the future of the school goes. The administration does not care for your well being, only the financials."
Senior,2,I took several classes online and the courses were no better than traditional courses. As a matter of fact the platform for traditional courses (canvas) was the exact same for online classes so if you wanted the online experience all you would have to do is skip class. They need a better format of increasing the educational experience online. A string of powerpoints and nothing else are not helpful.
Niche User,2,"I'm deeply conflicted about the time I had here. I really appreciated how kind and supportive the staff was, often going to great lengths to look out for students' wellbeing. All students, too, were very nice to everyone.
However:
The entire experience felt extremely impersonal and disingenuous. I was admitted on a full ride, all expense paid, and even still I feel the value is lacking. I was promised research opportunities, funding, plus constant campus and community involvement, and got none of it. I was left feeling abandoned, and that the school was extremely uninvested in its students. To top it off, the students were very cliquish within their majors, and often very introverted. Worse still, Macon itself is miserable, boring, impoverished and disheartening. I don't recommend this school except to Georgia-bred people who don't mind poor accommodations."
Graduate Student,2,"The campus is hit or miss, the social dynastic is mixed and friendly off campus. Advisors seem to express to you what you wish to hear. Parking is not the easiest and the Professors are really hit or miss. I’m unsure why the University staffs certain Professors. One I have heard endulges in pot and another Selby is a straight up sociopath. I believe some Professors even engage in behavior with students that is highly unprofessional, given my moral and ethical beliefs. 

Overall the weather is nice, much cheaper living than where I am from. Wouldn’t have been my top choice, but I was there!"
Freshman,2,"As t was my first year here, I noticed a lot of things. Coming here, I knew how expensive the school was but figured it was so high because it’s be worth the price. I was mistaken. The area surrounding Mercer is so sketchy and underdeveloped there isn’t anywhere to go besides the tiny campus. The academics seemed pretty challenging and the professors are okay, but it wasn’t anything special. The staff working in financial aid and registration make going to the school very difficult. They assume everyone just has 10k sitting in their back pockets. Everything about this school screams unoriginal to me; this school is for one brand of person. This school is definitely not worth 50k a year, this was a year wasted."
Junior,2,"I'm frankly upset and feel stupid for choosing this school. The facilities are outdated and falling apart aside from the UC, Legacy, and the football stadium. The professors are hit or miss. The advisors repeatedly lie, and it's nearly impossible to get any real help planning your future from anyone (including those advisors). Registration and housing assignments are both a living hell. Parking is also a nightmare. 

On the bright side, the people here are really nice. That's what drew me to the school. The food options are pretty decent, and there are lots of fun things to get involved with. The campus looks beautiful from the outside. Unfortunately, these positives don't begin to counteract all the issues the school has. I would not recommend this school unless you can attend for free or for a very discounted price."
College Freshman,2,The housing at mercer is currently bad but the President is working on improvements that will improve its overall quality.
College Sophomore,2,"Macon is a pretty unsafe city, but Mercer is working on keeping the students safe. Mercer Police is always a call away."
College Sophomore,2,Poor gym facility for students to work out
College Junior,2,"Walking to lunch one day during a random day on campus, a friend and I started hearing loud bangs. Living in the political climate we do, we were terrified and ran to a nearby friend's apartment and tried to call the campus police. After about 10 minutes of not reaching anyone, we all received a campus email reporting that the sounds were test fireworks on the football field. This experience typifies safety at Mercer: the administration does what makes them money, and thinks about the students' safety as an afterthought."
College Freshman,2,"Freshman housing is awful, but after that Housing is great."
College Junior,2,The housing at Mercer is becoming very cramped. Many of the residences are old and out of date. The cost to live on campus is absurd.
College Freshman,2,"Greek students are viewed as ""paying for friends"" and are annoyed by the Greeks. Not many non-Greeks avoid the Greek housing and don't bother hanging out or spending time with Greeks unless they intend on joining a fraternity/sorority. Greek housing is available off and on campus, with most parties being off campus (due to Mercer being a dry campus; however that doesn't really stop anyone from hiding/consuming alcohol)."
College Sophomore,2,"The chicken is still pink sometimes, they create weird things with the food (eg. Putting jalapeños in fruit salad), the caf closes early, and only subway is open on the weekends"
College Sophomore,2,The food in the cafe is poor except for lunch on wednesday and friday. Other than that breakfast is fine but dinner is never exceptionally good unless its pizza or off the grill. Additionally their vegetarian options are not as available as they promote.
College Freshman,2,I wish Mercer would offer more off campus housing besides the lofts. The Tatnall Place apartments are really nice and more of those apartments should be made.
College Freshman,2,There's nothing really close or that good. Mostly just fast food restaurants. Everything looks sketch and not clean.
College Freshman,2,"The cafeteria food is disgusting. I never go to the cafeteria anymore because it's that horrible. Overall, it kills my stomach and my vibe."
College Student,2,"It's a dry campus, and you're not allowed to have the opposite sex in your dorm after 11. It's almost as if we're in boarding school more than at college."
College Sophomore,2,"The greeks here always just bash each other and talk about how much they hate each other. They are the biggest, and possibly only source of drama on campus. They also are the leading suppliers of drugs on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Macon is an okay town but there's not a whole lot to do without driving 30+ minutes to get away. Downtown has some nice restaurants, but for shopping you should go somewhere else."
College Sophomore,2,I really feel like theres not much to do and that the public transportation isn't accessible enough to travel around the city.
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid process is good but there are no merit-based scholarship programs to apply for in my program at Mercer.
College Junior,2,"There is nothing for college students to do here. We have a park, and that's about it."
College Junior,2,"They are pretty strict on students. It makes it hard to have a fun social life on campus. I understand that it is their job, but they could chill out a little bit."
College Sophomore,2,Wifi is a huge issue at Mercer. The connection is constantly going in and out.
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman housing is very old and needs to be redone. However, it has a lot of history. As you continue your years at mercer the housing improves. In recent years, mercer is making efforts to make new housing available to the growing campus size."
College Senior,2,"Parking is extremely limited. If you arrive any later than 10 AM on weekdays, you'll have to park at the far end of campus. The good news is that's only a 5 minute walk to anywhere on campus, so it's not too bad."
College Sophomore,2,Georgia weather is extremely unpredictable.
College Sophomore,2,The area surrounding campus is not the safest.
College Freshman,2,It is a very unsafe area to live. Burglaries and shooting occur daily.
College Freshman,2,"Mercer is a ""dry campus"". I quote that because come on. There is alcohol everywhere. What college campus doesn't have alcohol? Some residence assistants are total jerks. I got written up for loud music on my iHome. iHome's are not even that loud. Other residence assistants are awesome and give cut you breaks because they realize they're students too. They want to have fun. The curfew's for being in the opposite sex's room are ridiculous. 12AM on week days and 2AM on weekends. If you're quit about it, you'll be fine. If not then you get in trouble."
College Freshman,2,Mercer is not that diverse.
College Freshman,2,the freshman dorms are absolutely terrible and way too small for the amount of freshmen
College Junior,2,There is nothing for late at night that's close
College Freshman,2,Only thing is a trolly going downtown
College Freshman,2,We get in trouble for nearly everything. And it is always a fine as the result.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone has an ego. No one is friendly, especially the athletes."
College Freshman,2,The good parking spots are usually filled up with people who never leave. 
College Junior,2,"There are not a lot of options available late at night, which makes it hard to really enjoy campus. I say this because other late-night food options are far away from the rest of campus, and the options on campus close early in the day, making them unreliable."
College Junior,2,"The only public transit system for the campus is a trolley, but it only goes from Wednesday to Saturday, and does not make a lot of stops."
College Junior,2,The spaces on campus run out quickly.
College Senior,2,I have no problem with the work load.
College Sophomore,2,"There is limited parking on the campus. You are also only allowed to park in certain spots based on a certain color decal, which makes it more difficult to have parking without a ticket."
College Sophomore,2,"Georgia's weather is almost unpredictable. But no matter how bad or good the weather is, you can always find something to do on campus."
College Junior,2,"Macon is just a rough town. Most people live on campus, and for good reason."
College Junior,2,They are building the football team; basketball is decent.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is strict about noise.I understand that people need some peace and quiet, but it gets a little aggravating when RAs are always under your skin. College isn't always just about the silence. We have to have some fun sometimes too!"
College Senior,2,I never received a scholarship although I applied for one.
College Senior,2,"I attended the Regional academic Douglas campus and we all were working adults attending school at night. Therefore, having a nightlife at Mercer was not an option."
College Sophomore,2,The food sucks. there is a few fast foods joints but the cafeteria isn't good
College Junior,2,"I'm fortunate enough to live within walking distance of the campus, so I seldom have to take my car. If you want to get a parking space near your own department, you probably need to find yourself on campus either before 8:00 a.m. or after 4:00 p.m."
College Freshman,2,"The caf is terrible. Same food day in and day out. You will find the 200$ you are given to spend at the on campus subway, chick fil a, and burger studio will dwindle quick."
College Freshman,2,"Sports, except for men's basketball, is heard little about. The women's basketball team rarely gets a student section at their basketball games but men's basketball will get the whole school's support. Lacrosse, baseball, etc are rarely talked about. I don't even know if they are good. However, now that we are getting a football team, our support for sports will hopefully increase!"
College Freshman,2,The student body has a lot of greeks. The students are somewhat attractive and dress in casual clothes or gym shorts. They only like to party but it is a very connected student body.
College Sophomore,2,"Freshmen girl's housing is not bad at all. MEP (Mary Erin Porter Complex) is where all the freshmen girls live and consists of three buildings: Boone, Porter, and Dowell. Porter is a suite style with two bedrooms and a shared bathroom and Boone and Dowell are community style with one bedroom and two bathrooms on each hall. The building is old, but the rooms are clean and not too cramped. The community bathrooms aren't bad. Sometimes they get filthy, but you usually don't have to wait for the shower and the water pressure is good. There's a sink in the Boone and Dowell bedrooms for brushing teeth, etc. I'm living in the Adams-Winship apartments now. First of all, they are small. Housing crammed my roommate and I into a tiny studio apartment. We also had to move from our old apartment to a new one last semester because we had a spider/mouse infestation. It was really disgusting and stressful. However, housing was willing to work with us and move us to a new apartment where we have not had a big problem with pests. The full kitchen is nice. I've heard that Mercer Hall is the best place to live, but I am sticking to the apartments for the rest of my time here to have a kitchen. "
College Freshman,2,"Going through the financial aid process for me was nightmarish. It was by far one of the worst experiences of my life. With the school's academic scholarship, the Pell Grant, and subsidized and unsubsidized loans, I still ended up with too little to pay. My advice is to start the financial aid process IMMEDIATELY, and to apply for as many scholarships that are necessary. For Georgia residents, I suggest that you keep your high school GPA above a 3.5 so you can get H.O.P.E. Mercer is not a cheap school. But you definitely get what you pay for- a valuable, top notch education."
College Junior,2,"The application process for admission was simple. My program process has been difficult and challenging.  I started out as an education major but has been unsuccessful in passing the GACE test. I changed my major to Human Services with a concentration in Social Services and Mental Health along with a minor in Education.  It has been difficult getting some of the courses that I needed, so I could not attend some semesters. I have also used up all of my financial aid funds, unemployed and does not know if I will be able to finish my degree.  Mercer is a private school there is not a lot of scholarship available to me."
Senior,1,"The teachers stopped teaching. They only posted PowerPoints ,and our exams were still extremely difficult. It was impossible to learn everything online without in class instruction."
Graduate Student,1,Please do not do your MBA degree at Mercer.  Several of the professers are lazy and arrogant.  The refuse to answer student questions and help with specific problems even during office hours.  Dr. Steven Simon is a horrible instructor.  He teaches International Management and a Production class.  I am warning other potential MBA students about him and the Stetson School of Business at Mercer University.  Go to Emory or Georgia State instead.
Freshman,1,"I left Mercer ASAP. The small college ""benefits"" are a lie. I now go to a larger university and I have had more opportunities here, even though I am ""competing"" against 40,000+ students here. Overall, Mercer is unsafe, overpriced, and does not care about its students- only money.  My friends were SHOT at on campus. I could go on and on about safety, but the campus is in the middle of the hood. Many professors are known for making CORE classes ridiculously hard so that they can fail students. The school doesn't care about this because that just means they will receive more money in the long run. The dorms (other than Legacy) are falling apart and I cannot believe I had to pay $6000 to live in a dorm whose halls were infested with mice (and the university barely tried to fix the issue). I am also 99% sure that the dorm was full of mold as well because I was always sick from allergies. Student life feels like high school- full of drama. I wouldn't recommend this school to my worst enemy."
Sophomore,1,"This review is mixed depending on the race of the viewer. If you're Black and you've been accepted somewhere else, choose that school. You'll regret your decision if you choose Mercer University. If you're any other race, it'll be the best four years of your life."
Niche User,1,"Don't waste your time or money going here. I could rant but I'm not wasting anymore time on Mercer than I have to to warn people. My freshman year at Mercer was by far the worst year of my life. The education, food, housing, literally everything but Greek life sucks. Stay away. It seems super nice until you go here. Also the campus looks so nice on the outside but everything (with the exception of a few) are crap on the inside. Campus is also very unsafe."
College Junior,1,This is the worst part about Mercer- it is really difficult to find an on campus job. I even qualify for work study and I haven't been able to find a job here in two years- and I've applied for at least 15-20.
College Senior,1,"I am noting here that this rating does not incorporate my actual overall experience at Mercer. This review is rather an accusation on the issue of transparency. If you are a current student, you are likely getting the sense that the school is a bit stingy (whether it is due to the recent expansion, or just the way it is for most US colleges, it is there). I usually tend not to publically criticize, but several recent experiences triggered me to write about this issue for the lack of means to conveniently and reasonably express it elsewhere at the moment. The sold items on campus are extremely overpriced to say the least, but more significant issue is that I have recently experienced several overcharges in the food court area, and I believe it has become chronic. This semester, I have been paying attention to the price they charge me on the food items I purchase, and they slightly overcharge a bit (0.5-1.0$ per item) than the price that is shown on the item. I have experienced this with subway sandwiches and some grab & go items. Of course, it's not significant enough for me to go back and ask for a refund or voice my opinion publically, but it bothers me that they are deceiving us. Most students don't ask for a receipt especially when they are purchasing with dining dollars, and I think they are taking advantage of this. If you are a current student I urge you to pay a bit attention to it. If you are a prospective student, I want you be aware of this situation."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't do much good on campus or community, just there to party and social life is barely existent unless you are Greek. Doesn't leave much left for the average student"
College Junior,1,They didn't help us find an off campus housing.
College Junior,1,Not a party scene at this campus.
College Junior,1,Not a lot of housing.
College Student,1,"There really isn't a city to begin with. It's as old as the people here, so it's not really a place for college kids which is why I definitely wouldn't want to live here when I get older."
College Sophomore,1,the only good thing about our meal plan is the dining dollars.
College Freshman,1,there is not much to do within walking distance so if you have no car.....you're kind of stuck.
College Freshman,1,This place is overrated. Sugarcoated from the very beginning. All they want is money.
College Freshman,1,Mercer wi-fi is the worst thing on this planet. Doesn't stay connected for more than 5 minutes.
College Freshman,1,"Freshmen halls are absolutely the pits. Plunkett Hall is always flooding, or the air conditioning is broken."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is horrible during class hours. There is never anywhere to park ten minutes before class. If you're already running late, add about ten extra minutes to find a space and then walk to class."
College Sophomore,1,Very seldom are my core classes taught at the Regional Center I attend for the college.
College Sophomore,1,I am in continuing education for Adults. We are not shown much respect or consideration for our dedication to enhance our working career. Our parameters of life are much different and we still addressed as children at times.
College Sophomore,1,Financial Aid and Bursar are abrubt and rude is you are having difficulty with understanding financial aid. I really did not want to go back to school after an ordeal I had with them.
College Freshman,1,"A good amount of students are involved in greek life at mercer, but out of these involved 95% would not get a bid at a school with real greek life. You can pretty much get into whatever frat you want, but i've heard the sororities are a little bit more selective. Any review here that claims that greeks rule the school are people who are in a frat and have no idea what real fraternity life at big schools is like."
College Freshman,1,athletics / athletes are not supported at mercer by the student population. Our successful basketball team couldn't even fill the bleachers with free admissions when we had a game on ESPN. The football players act as if they own the place even though they're entirely mostly chubby nonathletic freshman.
College Freshman,1,"Everyone is so similar, most come from religious backgrounds, I hate that most everyone is into partying or church because there is nothing else to do. Mercer accepts only one kind of person."
College Junior,1,No permit cost! Which would suck you if we had to pay for this ridiculous system of parking. Its very hard to find parking and at least 5 or 6 buildings share the same parking lots which is horrible! Fines are always 25 dollars unless you do something as drastic as park on top of a car. Note: not possible. But tickets DO add up. And everything on campus is within walking distance so you should be just fine.
College Junior,1,Mercer Universities Atlanta campus is mostly a graduate school campus so there is not much of a nightlife because most students have part time or full time jobs.
College Senior,1,It's Ok – A lot of students left school due to lack of financial aid. It's a rough process to get it at times and then we get charged and have to turn in a huge amount of money in one day.
College Senior,1,"The way the campus is set up, it's kind of tough to find a parking spot near your dorm or class. Plus, almost every weekend, parking lots are closed down for unnecessary events and people who don't have decals or go to the school are allowed to park close by. Also, the campus police never charge people who illegally park on the lines or non-parking zones, but only people who have the wrong decals."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The ""whiter"" greek associations have the larger houses (two stories) that have the louder, messy parties that sometimes have late night chantings. Don't worry, there is VERY little diversity represented as a few Indians who desire to be European-looking. Call it what you will to those who may become offended; I don't care. If you have an apartment near the greek village, then you'll hear, assuming you're not under the influence of a drug or more.  The ""non-white"" greek associations have smaller housing, usually one level, and have some parties but not of the caliber of the larger greek houses.  **For those offended, get over yourself. Your experience is different from everyone, including those who are your peers."
Recent Alumnus,1,"there is none – You can count those of Asian descent and Latin descent but there is a slight larger percentage of those of acknowledged African descent.  No, diversity is not encouraged. One will discover that if he or she enrolls or visit for a few days and don't believe those who work for the school, their mission is to get money for the school. Attention: those who are offended: get a life and just because you don't agree with me doesn't mean what I say is false.
"
College Junior,1,The parking at Mercer can be summed up pretty eaisly: Theres not enough parking spaces! Its a headache to find a space sometimes.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Bias and Crazy – Most of the ""All-American"" females look alike: tanned, wear shorts, tanks, and flip-flops with sunglasses. They swear to be Christians even though there is a great chance they will not like you without personally knowing you.  The guys are no better.  I rarely found a hot guy, and the a few of the professors look better than the male student body.  The guys were just as bias as the ""epitome"" of womanhood on the campus, and crazy.  I met more than one guy who mentioned crazy things like: ""Homeless people should die because they've lost their reason to live.""  I do not like hearing drivel like this.  Most of the guys do not have any muscle tone at all except in the mouth area.  I have found mostly beer bellies, flabby arms and not so toned calves.  The intelligence level was not much different so why bother seeking any mate at Mercer University.  If I did ever count the few hot guys, I believe I would not count to twenty."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Despite Mercer's slogan, ""Smarter than the average bear,"" this school doesn't challenge its students to learn for the career they desire and seek because too many professors are so concerned if they like you or not.  I would not recommend this school to anyone who is mature in thought, has her own opinion, desire to be challenged, and to have professors that will assist you without ulterior motives.  If you relate to a great part of the campus population, which hunts and eats its prey and carry prohibited hunting knives on campus, then this is a potential hangout.  Intellect is not really something that is sought after for prospective students, only if you have money or is willing to accept loans is the main requirement to attend Mercer University.  If I could do it all over again, I never would have transferred to Macon, Georgia's Mercer University.  For viewers of my review, please contact older alumni and you may learn of similar experiences to mine.  Mercer University is not interested in producing tomorrow's scholars, only tomorrow's bigots and sycophants."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not as Quick or as Simple as One Would Hope – I have found it to be idiotic for the my financial aid counselor to not have my aid available for me to accept online whether or not she is out of the office because I was prone to late fees.  I do not think that the bursary office and the financial aid office communicate well when it comes to students' accounts.  The process may take weeks like it did for me during more than one semester.  Besides waiting for my aid to be accepted and available, which is only known by the counselor even though you can click ""accept"" thinking the money is there waiting to be claimed, my loan documents were not processed. It is not always easy to meet with the counselor.  If you try to go into the office like I did once without paging them across the hall, you will get a nasty attitude from another counselor while holding the door preventing your entrance.  I did not know because no one had informed me of that method.  I would suggest that only new students enter Mercer because there will be more money available, and I think transfer students get the ""scraps"" money."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Worth the Headache – I am not sure if training is involved when it comes to helping students but I had such a difficulty when I transferred in to be sure which classes were accepted or which were not accepted.  I was on wild goose chase for two semesters by the ""assistance"" of the biology department chair only to find out that the registrar's office had already determined which classes were accepted.  Second, the professors play the game of favoritism based on your looks and if you are willing to act as if you do no have an opinion. I am not one who plays follow the leader because I can think for myself, and I'm not above being corrected but Mercerians (people who identify themselves as Mercer people) are.  I would not go through the unnecessary challenges I had endured again for anything or anyone.  Mercer University is popular because of people from the previous generations who believe in the Old South way of thinking: conservative, eurocentric, biased according to socioeconomic status and gender.  I attended Mercer University because I wanted to complete my Pre-medicine program in biology in hopes of becoming a doctor.  Well, this school did nothing to enhance that dream, only challenge my self-worth as a human being.  With the ostracism I received from both my professors and my classmates, I did not enjoy my learning at Mercer University, but I am sure I got to live what my older relatives experienced during the Jim Crow ear. With the shortage of doctors in this country, I am not concerned about finding employment in my field.  Even though my experience was not so great in the biology department, and the chemistry dpeartment's professors are not that different from the biology professors due to experience brought my science courses, there are some good professors.  I suggest that prospective students talk to students, not recruiters, because you can ask both general and personal questions and get mostly truthful answers."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Macon Is the Old South, So That's What You Get – I had only visited two restaurants, both on or off Presidential Highway.  The Indian restaurant near Walmart has equally bad service as the food.  The waiter only came to my table three to four times: to take the order, deliver the food and beverage, and to deliver the bill.  He didn't return for refills.  The food was over-spiced so I could not taste what was on my plate.  The second restaurant was Ryan's, a buffet-style place where the service is a little better than the food.  I have yet to have bland macaroni and cheese besides this place, and the service is a bit slow for the popular dishes.  So, as I said before, Macon is the old south, where you'll find mostly old buildings with little or no renovation.  One would surely have to ask others where they would go, or seek for yourself; I do not expect much success.  You'll find more diverse cuisine in the grocery store in the international aisle."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Enough Places for Students – I have seen students struggle to stay parked on campus.  When there is no parking available, there are a few near a park and near a few small business, but I know that those parking spaces are not meant for students.  Students also park sometimes near the police area, which is not good, and park along the curb of the apartments near the campus police, which is also not good.  I can only suggest to stay put whatever parking space you find, and move only on the Saturday and return the car no later than Sunday early afternoon.  Otherwise, you are out of luck for on-campus parking.  Even the professors have trouble find space, too."
College Sophomore,1,"You will receive some sort of scholarship and/or financial aid this school is just too expensive without it. However, you have to hound these people to get your stuff credited to your account. They will dodge your emails and never call you back. You pretty much have to go there in person everyday for as long as it takes for the problem to get fixed. Never neglect your account keep a watchful eye it will change quickly and many times without notice until they've frozen your account."
College Freshman,1,"First year students are not allowed to have members of the opposite sex in their halls after 12 on weedays and 2 on weekends. Come on Mercer. Get with the times. Also, campus police are hawks about parking for absolutely no reason. Its almost as if they force everybody to park as far away as possible from their halls. And they waste no time writing a parking ticket, even if you were temporarily parked to drop off your groceries."
College Sophomore,1,"It's Awful Here. It's extremely cliquey, gossipy, and feels like high school. There is a reason why everyone around campus calls it Camp Mercer. The first month was great, but immediately after there was a sharp decline in happiness amongst the student body. I would strongly recommend trying a different school. Way too small."

Sophomore,5,"I love everything about TLU. However, one thing that sucks (but that can't be changed) is the Covid procedures. I'm a sophomore, so I was able to experience TLU during my freshman year (even though it was cut short) before Covid-19. At TLU, there was always something going on. I went to many on campus events and cherished every part of it. Now, the school isn't even allowed to do most of the events this year because of social distancing. It sucks and I pray that everything will go back to normal sooner than later."
Freshman,5,Online learning has been way easier than expected here at TLU. Every professor is very knowlegable on how to help you with any uploading or general tech problems.
Freshman,5,The staff throughout the entire campus are just the best. They are extremely helpful and patient with all students. The campus has a very welcoming environment and the students take the academics seriously.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing!!!! The school does everything they can to help. There are incredible graduate programs and the care that the school puts into their academics is something I missed out on in high school. The campus is beautiful and the students are extremely diverse. The dorms are very nice and the school has gone above and beyond to make sure the students can adjust to campus and dorm life. I was considering transferring schools first semester but I learned about all the amazing opportunities Texas Lutheran University has to offer. It is a small campus, but everything is so close it is nothing to walk wherever you are going. There are masters programs you can apply for where you receive your master's degree in five years and its incredible. In addition to all of these things, when applying for Texas Lutheran University, you receive a scholarship based on your high school performance. Many students have over half of their yearly tuition taken off by this. It is a small, but incredible school."
Sophomore,5,"Because of the circumstances of the coronavirus, my dorm life was cut short and we had to finish the second semester of my senior year online. It was a seamless transition from one to the other and we relied heavily on the faculty to make this adjustment. We relied on zoom as a substitution for face to face meetings and life went on as usual. I learned just as much as I would have if I were on campus and there was just as much faculty support during these trying times. 
We received emails twice a week about the news regarding everything that was affected by the virus and the portion of my semester spent online was not difficult. Texas Lutheran University did an outstanding job dealing with pandemic and transitioning from us going to class and living on campus to moving home and doing things online."
Senior,5,"I love my school. It's a small school in a small town, but I grew up in a small town, so I love the small town feel. All my professors truly know me and have a genuine concern for my well-being. This schools has helped me succeed and truly helped me to further my education."
Junior,5,Did not take any classes online but professors very helpful.   They are available to help you whenever you need.
Freshman,5,"I only took online classes because of Covid, but the professors were understanding of the struggle. But besides that they Earley had you take any online classes, unless it was during the summer."
Freshman,5,"I have only been studying at TLU for a semester but my time here has been great. It's a small community in a small town but close knit if you are social and explore the area. The town lies between cities so if you are bored you can travel out of town to find an adventure. TLU has an engaging community, the professors there try a build a relationship and work with. Big plus for remembering my name."
Niche User,5,"I have gone to TLU's Summer Music Academy for 6 years, and it has been some of the best experiences of my life. I had so much fun and made countless new friends and memories I will never forget."
Freshman,5,I love our mentor program. They offer on campus help from our peers free of charge. I attend to be a mentor my sophomore year
Niche User,5,"I would rate TLU a five out of 5 stars because, Everyone is super friendly and willing to help you with anything. For example, if it is your first time stepping on campus and have a question about a building or anything. You can ask anyone and they will be more than happy to help you. It is a great environment."
Niche User,5,"I've visited the campus a few times and It is beautiful. Aside from that, the staff is so welcoming and nice. They make sure that you feel welcomed and that you feel comfortable on campus"
Freshman,5,"Texas Lutheran University has been such an amazing school. They have so many opportunities fro you, and there is always someone to help you out when you need it. Whenever you are struggling, they will do everything in their power to help you succeed. The  school is a small size so everyone knows almost everyone. Your professors actually care about you, and since the class size is small, they know your name too."
Niche User,5,"Whenever I visited the campus it was beautiful, there is so much diversity within the community. All the students and individuals in campus were all helpful and nice!"
Freshman,5,"my little bit of experience was excellent,meeting with the admissions and track coaches was definitely a moment i will remember."
Senior,5,"I love the small and friendly environment TLU has to offer. It is really a small knit community. The class sizes are small enough so your professors know what kind of student you are and can be readily available, should you need help with studying or understanding a certain concept."
Junior,5,"Still attending, great school. I have been on the soccer team all four years and it is one of the best experiences ever."
Niche User,5,i loved how the campus was very welcoming. they were very caring people and took the time out of their schedule to show you around their campus. i am currently a high school senior and i plan on attending this university next year. i am very excited and cant wait to start. i am planning on living on campus and having a roomate that is very friendly.
Niche User,5,"this college is full of nice people, when applying they will guide you step by step and make you the priory. Small campus with Teachers that care"
Freshman,5,This has been a great experience so far. I love the small classes and atmosphere.  Everyone here is nice and very helpful.  I play baseball and really like the coaches and team. It's like a family away from home.
Freshman,5,"Texas Lutheran University is a wonderful place to get a post-secondary education. They have so many resources to help students succeed, such as free tutors (also known as Collaborative Learning Assistants,) and organized study groups led by advanced students, as well as library and staff resources that exceed expectations. TLU also provides large merit-based scholarships to students that enroll. If TLU were to change for the better, I may suggest that more programs be added for students that have non-denominational faith and for more majors to be added."
Sophomore,5,Texas Lutheran is a school where you feel at home and just enjoy going to school. The teachers help you out anyway they can and since it is a small school it makes it easier to excel in the world and makes you feel better.
Sophomore,5,"I love been a TLU student. TLU campus is small and has a familiar atmosphere. TLU has the best professors, because they care and believe in you; not just in the academic part but in a personal note. They really care for your well been. I have learning disabilities and the Disability department and all personnel have been working hard to find the correct and better accommodations for me to better understand the material, get me prepare take the exams and been able to succeed and complete my degree.  Other think that I like about TLU is that everyone including staff make me feel like Iâ€™m part of the TLU	 family."
Sophomore,5,"This school is amazing! The small campus and tight knit faculty and staff truly make you feel that you are cared about. At Texas Lutheran, you are not a number or statistic but a person, a student who has goals, and these professors and staff are there to guide you to these goals. Even the students are amongst the nicest I have met."
Freshman,5,Texas Lutheran University is like my second home. There are so many people on campus that you can count on and the professors are always in there office.
Freshman,5,"The school itself is located in a very safe environment. As a student it is easy to find academic support due to the fact that it is a small school opposed to public universities. You can also build relationships with you professors. Although, it's a good school it is very expensive with tuition ranging about 30,000 annually."
Junior,5,The campus is beautiful and majority of the professors are amazing and also very easy to communicate with.
Freshman,5,I have grown to the people I have met here at Texas Lutheran University. The teachers here are fantastic and a great help to me when I need it.
College Freshman,5,The programs here are great for what I want to do which is go into Pharmacy.
College Freshman,5,My professors are great and very helpful!
College Freshman,5,I always see police officers around campus protecting us.

College Freshman,5,Professors are very understanding and help a lot.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,Very clean and it has a real home feeling.
College Freshman,5,I'm glad I am blessed to attend this magnificent school.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. I have the trust in my fellow peers to leave my door unlocked throughout the day.
College Freshman,5,I love living in a dorm and on campus. It really gets me involved in social life on the campus and ceases to leave me bored. I very much enjoy the suite-style dorms because I get my own bathroom and have no desire to live with a community bath.
College Freshman,5,"My experience at Texas Lutheran University has been wonderful. Coming from a very small high school, I really enjoy the small campus and feel like it will be a good transition before graduate school. I have not met someone I dislike and everyone is extremely friendly in passing."
College Freshman,5,"A purposely small campus that enables you to not only grow as an intectual, but as a human being. I love it here, TLU has really enabled me to think deeply, find meaning, and to think critically."
College Freshman,5,There are so many opportunities at the school. The accounting program is by far one of the best as it will be easy for me to get an internship and also my masters degree while I am attending the school.
College Freshman,5,Great environment for everyone. The campus is full of great students and teachers. I love being a part of the school.
College Junior,5,I am really impressed with the various diversity at my school.
College Junior,5,"My friends tell me, is great and ok to live on campus."
College Junior,5,The nightlife in my school are very quiet. Students are most of the time busy.
College Junior,5,Athletics at my school are very competitive and students embrace it.
College Junior,5,The campus police are doing a great work by protecting us.
College Junior,5,It is great but not interested in it. It is nice.
College Junior,5,"To my point of view, the academics offered at my school are great."
College Junior,5,"I have very nice professors in my school. The courses are great, and there are very interesting topics."

College Freshman,5,It's fun living in a dorm and having a roommate.
College Freshman,5,Fans are supportive and teammates are committed.
College Freshman,5,Meeting new people and making new friends easily
Recent Alumnus,5,"My experience at TLU was wonderful! There are plenty of organizations to be involved in, the classes are informative and challenging, and the professors are incredible."
College Junior,5,"The school is a great school, and they are open minded, they were very friendly."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school. I love how small the population is and the teacher to student ratio is great because you get a lot more one on one experience and help. If I could choose all over again, I would choose this school in a heart beat."
College Freshman,5,I really enjoy my majors program. Athletic training at TLU is a very strong and successful program to be a part of. Working with 8 other classmates in your grade allows for more one on one with your preceptor. The preceptors in my program are very helpful and meet with us twice a semester to talk about progress within the program and how they can help. They are always available to talk and advise their students. They make learning our competencies easy and fun!
College Freshman,5,"I love biology, and the professors are amazing! They believe in you so much, it makes you feel good about your work and choice towards your major"
Sophomore,4,"I take a few of my classes online, and even though I dislike learning online (because I feel that I don't understand the material as well as I would if I was in person), I think that the professors have done (and are doing) their best in this transformation to online. They provide one-on-one zoom meetings with you if needed, which is basically the equivalent of going to the professor's office hours. I love that the professors provide us with everything we may need to be successful in this new online learning environment."
Senior,4,Great campus atmosphere and very nice staff.  Overall I have enjoyed my experience with Texas Lutheran University.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the online learning experience was pretty good. TLU seemed well prepared, and handled it well. However, some professors made the semester more difficult since classes were online."
Sophomore,4,"The dining options and quality need to be improved. The current meal plans offered are too expensive based on the quality of food served. Also, updating the buildings on campus would be nice."
Senior,4,"Very few classes are designed to be online at TLU, so transferring our classes to an online format was very difficult, but still a amazing experience. We worked together to get through a very difficult time."
Junior,4,TLU has always been a top choice for me.  The only thing is the cost is high which makes things a little difficult.
Junior,4,Texas Lutheran University is a very small community school. All professors and staff are willing to help you to succeed. I really enjoy the environment and the student life.
Sophomore,4,"I do like Texas Lutheran. It's small enough that you get to know students and professors personally, and it's its own community. SOme of the dorm buildings are too old, and the food options aren't the best, but the actual learning and opportunities are great."
Freshman,4,Ive only been here for a few months but love it so far. the Campus is beautiful. the professors are very personable and want to see you succeed. Would definitely recommend this school to anyone
Freshman,4,"Perfect fit for someone who isn't looking for the typical public university landscape with 100 students in a class. A small campus in a small town where everybody knows everyone. The class size is very small with a student to teacher ratio of 15:1. Texas Lutheran has a good culture with lots of tradition, especially in the baseball program."
Freshman,4,"Love the small class sizes, but would love if more people knew about the university! Games and activities would be more fun if more people were hyped up about TLU including the fan base for sports"
Alum,4,Great small school with incredible student to teacher ratio. Beautiful campus and close to major cities. It really has a great community that supports each other.
Senior,4,I love how small Texas Lutheran University is. The university is division three which creates a sense of community and belonging. As a student you create relationships with a lot of students and athletes. You also creat student-teacher relationships with your professors. Class size is small compared to other universities which is also benefit of attending.
Freshman,4,"I love Texas Lutheran because of its small, but diverse student body. Upon arriving at TLU, I was worried that there wouldn't be a group that suited my interests, but there was actually many organizations to choose from. 

One thing I would love to see TLU improve on is building more of an established relationship with prospective students in high school. As it is a private university, I heard of TLU from others telling me about it, not from TLU themselves."
Senior,4,Texas Lutheran is a wonderful school and I know that I made the right decision when I chose TLU. Everyone is very friendly and close-knit. The professors are great and really want to make sure that you understand the material and aren't just memorizing it for a test. The only thing that I would really change is the food in the dining hall.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Texas Lutheran has been the picture of serenity. The campus is small, the classes are personalized, and there's a visible commitment to diversity and public service. The curriculum is very goal-oriented, making sure your skills are utilized to the full extent needed to enter the job market in your chosen profession. As for the campus and student life, it's very peaceful and low-stress. There are some issues with organization processes that could use improvement, and the surrounding area isn't much to look at, but overall TLU has solid reputation that is well-earned."
Sophomore,4,TLU was the perfect school for me right out of high school. It was small and close to home. I made some excellent friends and played soccer my first year.
Freshman,4,I will be going there in the Fall. Took a tour and it is a peaceful campus. Not too big. Staff was helpful and friendly.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy that TLU is a small school. The student to professor ratio is about 20 students to 1 professor,  which makes communication with professors efficient and effective."
Junior,4,"This school is very good for people who do not learn well just being lectured at, they have a variety of majors and make you go outside of your major to fully use critical thinking.  Academics is by far the most important thing here at TLU and is great for hands on learners"
Sophomore,4,Itâ€™s a wonderful school and the professors are amazing! You will get a great education here at TLU!
Freshman,4,"TLU have been a blast, I have very good professors who explain things I may have a problem understanding on. I have a great schedule that fits how I work. I've got the chance to become friends with a whole lot of people I would not have met usually. Lots of them comes from places miles away which boggles my mind! I have found my classes very interesting and not too difficult, Just gotta keep up on whats going on! The only major problem I have is the mytlu website we use to access lots of things is a little difficult to navigate through when it comes to finding things such as student employment and some things aren't able to be found online such as some events. Other than That I really am enjoying TLU and blessed I even get the chance to attend this amazing university."
Freshman,4,"Nice campus. The dorms are nice sized. Not many parties, but Texas state and UTSA aren't far. Small classes. Very diverse. Decent NCAA DIII. SCAC CONFERENCE.                                              ."
Junior,4,"Small school, friendly environment. Professors are helpful and can spend time one on one if you need the help. Campus is small and there are a lot of programs to get involved with. I love my school!"
Sophomore,4,"I LOVE the people here at TLU, everyone I have met is nice and are great people.  What I would like to see change is the number of students here at TLU, we need more students to come to TLU and show school spirit for all sports and become a nationally recognized school not only for academics but sports as well."
College Freshman,4,Sometimes people don't respect the quite hours.
College Freshman,4,The facilities are well maintained and nice. The only issue is sometimes when we get out at practice at nigh the Athletic Training Facility is already closed.
College Senior,4,I've never felt I was in any danger while on campus.
College Senior,4,So far the atmosphere is nice and professors are willing to help as long as you attempt the work.
College Senior,4,TLU does well at offering options for internships for everyone.
College Senior,4,I've been able to get the help I need in and out of the classrooms.
College Freshman,4,The courses are very well built. The only issue I had was with the Freshman Experience course because it was not uniform. Some classes were doing much more work than others and it was not very fair.
College Freshman,4,The quality of the alumni network is wonderful. They continue to give wonderful donations and scholarships to the school and students.
College Freshman,4,"I, personally, have never been involved in any crimes or anything like that. However, I do feel very safe at campus and I know there would be people there for me when I would need them."
College Freshman,4,"The professors at school are extremely helpful and I love the fact that you can have a one on one conversation with them. I am not just a number to them, but someone they are actually intrigued on teaching to."
College Freshman,4,Centennial is probably the nicest building on campus and I really enjoy living there.
College Freshman,4,They keep the facilities maintained and it's great being a part of their program.
College Sophomore,4,"I am a brother of a fraternity on campus and am very proud of it. Administration, however, has an agenda against greek life and puts significant effort into placing limitations on it."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus
College Sophomore,4,"It was a fun campus when I first arrived, but going into my second semester the nightlife disappeared.  That's the only bad thing about the area."
College Junior,4,Its close to home for me and my Dad works there
College Junior,4,I like how strict TLU is with visiting hours and the guest policy in that a guest must be escorted by the people they are with because I do not want to feel uncomfortable in a space where random people can walk around
College Junior,4,I wish I could've received more scholarships since I am currently going to be at TLU for two extra years.
College Sophomore,4,we haven't had a problem that need police in my experience
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of really friendly people at TLU. You just have to be willing to step out of your comfort zone and talk to people!
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of local and chain restaurants in Seguin that students are able to enjoy!
College Freshman,4,I love staying in centennial hall! Most of the dorms are very nice and have a lot of availability.
College Freshman,4,The administration and student body take great responsibility in educating and trying to prevent sexual assault. The university provides great resources and information is readily available around campus.
College Freshman,4,"Athletics at TLU are great! I feel as though we are often overlooked because we are a small D3 school, but over the past few years our athletics have been very successful in winning conference, conference tournaments, and even finishing in the top 3 in conference. The athletics at TLU continues to grow and become even more successful."
College Freshman,4,"i love how many majors are offered at TLU, and the reason the classes are hard is because they believe in you"
College Freshman,4,The school sprint for TLU football games is awesome. For a small university we support our team
College Freshman,4,Greeks don't treat non-Greeks any differently. Greeks are involved in campus activity.
College Sophomore,4,Campus is a secure place that offers much help when needed.
College Sophomore,4,The scholarships I was awarded have covered a majority of my tuition although I still have a lot of loans to pay for after graduation.
College Freshman,4,There is a Subway literally 5 minutes away and it is the best place every. They have a drive thru which is 24 hours. There is also a bunch of other places all around town that provide us with variety.
College Freshman,4,The health and safety on campus is good. I don't have any issues with it. I feel very safe being on campus. I know the school works hard to ensure that there are no issues.
College Freshman,4,I don't live on campus but am always in my friends dorms. Its a fun time and I think the campus is fair with all the restrictions they have.
College Freshman,4,Music Majors have a lot of hours that they have to complete. I love it though. I love doing music so I don't mind putting all these hours.
College Freshman,4,The town is a good place to study. Its easy to navigate and there is any type of store you might need.
College Freshman,4,Most of the dorms have small closets. There are various styles of the dorm rooms.
Sophomore,2,The campus is extremely small and there's really nothing to do in the area. It gets boring seeing the same people everyday with nothing to do. They took away the bluebell ice cream for blue bunny lol
College Junior,2,"TLU used to be so much fun until the administration cracked down...but now, there is nothing that goes on during the weekend and everyone complains."
College Sophomore,2,It is not as good as other schools.
College Sophomore,2,The city is not very attracting and there is nothing to do here besides school.
College Sophomore,2,"The rain creates what we call ""Lake TLU""."
College Sophomore,2,The drugs at our school need to be eliminated.
College Freshman,2,Is ok not much to do here.
College Freshman,2,I have never seen any transportation offered at the college.
College Sophomore,2,they aren't over bearing but want the best for us
College Sophomore,2,We aren't allowed to live off campus till senior year
College Sophomore,2,More healthy option would be nice
College Sophomore,2,"Students rely heavily on cars to get around town. However, the town of Seguin recently added buses, with a stop on campus. It comes by every hour or so, so transportation in Seguin is definitely improving."
College Freshman,2,Any nice off campus housing is far from campus.....
College Sophomore,2,Small town and places close by 10pm. Have to travel to other cities if you want to go somewhere other than just a house party.
College Sophomore,2,"We have an Athletics program, but our keniesiology program is better. Our teams... especialy foot ball... are not that good."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Very Outdated â€“ The nice thing is you have a lot of room. The bad thing is most of the housing is old. Seguin and the dorm opening in the fall are new, but that's it. The newer buildings are nice and the three connected Baldus, Trinity, and Clifton are pretty good. The apartments are awful. Just plain and simple. The efficiency do not provide enough of a kitchen. It is pathetic. There isn't even a way to plug the sink to wash dishes. The other bad thing is you are forced to live on campus until 21 unless parents live close by."
Recent Alumnus,2,Walmart Is the Hang-Out Spot â€“ There isn't much to do in Seguin. People go to Wal-Mart to hang out. No real nightlife unless you drive to Austin or San Antonio.
College Junior,2,Not Much to Do â€“ Seguin is a small and an old town near San Antonio in which Texas Lutheran University is located. There is not much to do here besides studying.
College Freshman,2,The school spirit here sucks there really isnt any. we dont have a football stadium we play at the local high school . the sports teams are ok for the most part but the football team hardly wins
College Freshman,2,Res Life â€“ The girls dorms are way better than the guys dorms. the guys dorms are super small but they have a lot of things the girl dorms dont. TLU is building a new coed freshman dorm this year though and making all dorms coed except for trinity
College Sophomore,1,"The reslife here makes their living off of screwing people over and milking as much money out of the students as possible. They recently changed the one year on-campus residence requirement, to two years before being allowed to live off campus, without any justification. I was once charged a large disciplinary fine for something a roommate was responsible for, even after explaining this in a ""hearing."" In another instance, one of my roommates/close friends who was an out-of-state student was kicked to the curb, with his belongings--which they, at one point threatened to seize--with nowhere to go, rather than simply allowing him the small amount of time he needed for his move-out arrangements to be achieved--even though I was still able to stay in the room--simply because he was unable to return to school the following semester due to financial reasons. They also schedule many of their move-in and move-out days in the middle of the week, which makes things exceptionally difficult on students who do not have a personal form of transportation, especially when their parent(s) have strict work schedules during the week, since they are only willing to cooperate in such situations at the staff's personal discretion. I have been a victim of this as well, causing me to risk missing classes at the beginning of semesters because they were unwilling to compromise on my move-in. They are extremely inconsiderate and, many times, unwilling to make any accommodations for anyone, unless possibly if they hold you to some political favor or you pay some outrageous fee."
College Sophomore,1,Most stressful thing in college.
College Freshman,1,You see people smoking on campus and underage drinking.
College Freshman,1,"I am a theology major here at TLU and there is not a single theology professor that believes marriage is between one man and one woman, or that Adam and Eve are real people, or that Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation. All of them teach ""inter-faith dialogue"" relativism, skepticism and other unorthodox doctrines. If you believe that the Bible is the perfect word of God and that it contains no errors, contradictions or mistakes I advise that you don't come to TLU. If you are a christian in name only and completely rejects the scriptural teaching that Jesus Christ is the ONLY way to heaven then TLU is for you."
College Junior,1,Our Football teams shares a stadium with the Seguin Highschool football team. and the coaches forget that kids here have classes to take care of especially since there are no athletic scholarships. Facilities are low quality.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no transportation at or near the school. Students without their own vehicle are out of luck.
College Freshman,1,"Lack of Involvement in the Sports Department â€“ TLU sports, though hyped up as they are, does not involve the entire student body as much as I would personally like. I have no feeling of wanting to go to a sporting event mainly due to the lack of advertisement from the sports department."
College Junior,1,In Seguin there really is no transportation available. Its extremely difficult to go anywhere unless you have an automobile. There are taxi services but are rare to find. You are better off carpooling with friends.
College Freshman,1,"Nighltife in Seguin â€“ there is no nightlife in seguin whatsoever if you want to do anything fun you have to go to san marcos ( texas state) or san antonio (UTSA, Incarnate word etc)"
College Sophomore,1,"I was living in the girls dorm called Hahn, and it was horrible. when visitors came, it was kept very nice by the janitorial staff, but during the actual week, it was disgusting. Throughout the year we had bug and mice problems. during both times, girls in our dorms were afraid to sleep in their own rooms and none the less anywhere in the dorm. Toilets were kept unclean. Shower curtains started to grow fungus and all types of things. As well, when you had a problem and needed to contact and RA, the girl RAs were unhelpful. if you needed anything done, you had to ask a guy RA to do it for you or you will not get any help."
Recent Alumnus,1,"See My Post on Greek Life. I feel that if the greeks were allowed to host parties on campus with alcohol, it would solve more problems than getting rid of them supposedly did."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Take Off the Chains. In my time, greek parties were allowed not just to take place on campus, but to serve alcohol to those of age.  Certainly some underage drinking took place, but at least those students that during the normal learning about alcohol process indulged too much, were close to their dorms, and in the safety of campus.  By disallowing alcohol to be served at greek parties on campus, it forces those parties to move off campus (because we all know college students will party, and will drink), and so by being off campus there is NO supervision, and if someone has too much, they may make another mistake and try to drive back to campus, or could become victim of any number of other unplesantries.  

Remember that college is more than learning about calculus and literature, and also about learning how to be an adult, and that part of that learning is making mistakes, and let the social life on campus be more than coffeehouses and a watered-down version of what I remember of the ""last slam before we cram.""  Let the greeks provide that place to party, stipulate that there must be campus police on hand for security, like we did in my time, and maybe I won't have to hear radio news reports about TLU students (football players more than students, but enrolled at my Alma Mater all the same) that ganged up to beat on a student at a different school."

Niche User,5,I did have to take online courses because of the COVID-19 pandemic. My experience during those online courses was excellent. All of my professors made it evident that they worked hard to get the students great academic criteria. I finished with a higher GPA than my in class semester.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love my online classes. I am in charge of my own schedule and I am able to get the work done within a reasonable time frame. I feel like I have a bit more freedom to do my own work and I am not constantly being reminded to submit assignments. I can access my e-learning portal from work, home or at the park. What better way to attend classes than at the tip of your fingers?"
Junior,5,I am proud to attend Albertus Magnus College. I personally feed that I belong in this school and the professor are beyond amazing. I feel that the staff and faculty are extremely helpful and are available outside of classroom hours. I believe that this campus goes above and beyond and stop at nothing to excel excellence.
Freshman,5,"The admissions staff made the process of enrollment a very informative and seamless process. As an adult student, return to college can be intimidating. The options Albertus provides allow for a working adult to have a successful academic career."
Freshman,5,The things that I like about Abertus College is that the profession are always willing to help their student out.
Graduate Student,5,"I'm attending Albertus Magnus College as a Graduate Students. Pursuing a degree in Creative Writing. The program at Albertus is amazing.  The classes are small. The professors are very accommodating too.  The school is located centrally so it's very easy to get to, right off the highway."
Freshman,5,Albertus Magnus College really cares for its students. Every single person that works there has a genuine interest in the students and is going to do everything to help you! I am honored to call myself a Fearless Falcon!
Senior,5,I think Albertus is a well put school and I enjoying my time here. I do think there should be more of a fair treatment when it comes to athletes vs all students. I think my experience there so far has been very welcoming and fun and educational.
Niche User,5,"Choosing to transfer to Albertus Magnus College after earning my prerequisites at a local community college was one of the best financial decisions I've made thus far in life. It was also one of the most beneficial. Albertus Magnus College is a small private Catholic college where professors take personal interest in there students and want to see them excel. To this day, I stay in touch with my professors at Albertus and seek them out for advice as I continue to navigate academic and professional realms outside of the institution. Attending Albertus Magnus College, to me, was a great decision."
Niche User,5,I visited an Albertus Magnus College Volleyball game a year ago and the energy of the college was amazing. They are a very supporting school towards their team and the campus has a great environment.
Freshman,5,This was an absolute blast my first semester my freshman year. All of the professors were kind and helpful. Be prepared for a lot of work but it’s definately worth it.
Niche User,5,"I completed a business Communications course as a senior in high school and really enjoyed it. Albertus Magnus College is a great opportunity for those who want to pursue business. After the course ended, I felt more confident about business etiquette and leadership. My experience at Albertus Magnus helped me understand and develop significant skills that apply to professions I will pursue."
Senior,5,"Albertus Magnus is a student-friendly college and all my concerns were met quickly, thoroughly and efficiently. The professors were knowledgeable and helpful and made my educational experience enjoyable."
Graduate Student,5,What I liked the most about Albertus Magnus College is how helpful and supportive the staff and professors are no matter what is going on in your life at the time. They always demonstrated that they enjoyed their job and were there for you. Nothing can beat that.
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student here at Albertus Magnus College. This school made the transition from one college institute to another, so much easier than I could have expected. I love this school because the professors are great; They are here to teach you and they want you to succeed. If you were to go to a bigger institution, that is not what you would be getting. I enjoy living on campus and my on campus job. I am currently training to become a Writing Associate, which is pretty much a writing tutor. There are on campus jobs everywhere and there is a work study, which means some of your money goes towards your tuition. The atmosphere is great and their are so many people to get to know."
Senior,5,"I love everything about albertus Magnus college. Amazing professors, caring staff, small class sizes, and great people overall"
College Freshman,5,Teams and staff are very friendly.
College Freshman,5,I love the small school setting. Professors are very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"I had an absolutely amazing first year at college, my dorm was conveniently close to the buildings that my classes were in. I did amazing in every single class that I took. I made so many amazing friendships with people and had just so much fun that trying to explain it here would not even do it justice."
College Sophomore,5,"Our alumni program is great, we have a specific club that's just designated to connecting to alumni in the same major and field as you."
College Sophomore,5,They are very strict about making sure everyone knows all the health and safety issues
College Sophomore,5,"I personally haven't experienced anything in the job/internship field yet, but the other services we have such as the writing center, the academic advisor center and financial aid center have all been very helpful and accommodating."
College Sophomore,5,I love all of the classes and courses Ive taken at Albertus so far! All the class subjects you can choose from is really diverse. The professors really want to help you and really want to see you succeeded. The small class sizes really help the students focus more and engage in class work because you get more one on one attention and help.
College Sophomore,5,"So far, during my time at Albertus Magnus, there hasn't been one case of sexual assault. I feel very safe on campus because the campus security is always around if you need anything. Also, you need you to have your student ID's to get into any building, so I am not worried about someone who's not supposed to be on campus getting into buildings."
College Sophomore,5,"I personally don't live on campus, but all my friends who live on campus have nothing but great things to say about it"
College Sophomore,5,We have an excellent basketball and baseball team! The fans are just as great as the players!
College Sophomore,5,I love the small sized community at Albertus Magnus. Everyone knows everyone on a first name basis. The small class sizes are ideal because you get more one on one attention and help. The professors really care about your success and they are willing to help you do anything.
College Senior,5,The classrooms are a nice size and they aren't over populated. The professors are amazing! Some of them don't believe in using books because of the cost so they provide the reading materials.
College Senior,5,The staff are all friendly they greet you with smiles all the time. The professors are caring they refuse to allow you to fail. Or should I say the only way to fail is by not having a relationship with your professor. My overall experience has been great I have formed three incredible relationships with the professors. The students are great everyone is there to learn so the classes are nice and calm. I would recommend everyone to this school that is going for their BA or MA
College Senior,5,i have not attended any athletics in school
College Freshman,5,i feel very safe at this school.
College Sophomore,5,"The academics are awesome at Albertus. I had to retake an English class to be able to declare my major and I wanted to be sure to pass with at least a B average, but I surpassed that and have not an A average so it easy to obtain as long as you put in the work!"
College Sophomore,5,There are no racial or acceptance issues at the school. Even when I went there back in 2003-2005 there was no issue. We all get along as we know we are there for the same reason.
College Sophomore,5,There is no drugs or alcohol issues at this school from what I know of.
College Sophomore,5,"I went to Albertus right after high school in 2003 and ended in 2005 to start working full time. I always thought about going back to school to finish my bachelors but never actually took the step. Being in the working field now over 10 years, I have a better understanding of what I want to pursue for my degree. I am also more mature and dedicated to finish this time. I chose Albertus to continue my bachelors because they have a great online course for my degree. I can complete all my coursework online and right now with my job and home life, this is the absolute BEST option for me and it is actually working great! I am glad I chose to finish my studies for my degree at Albertus."
College Sophomore,5,Career prospects I have never used yet but heard they are amazing
College Sophomore,5,Course selection is great. Professors are amazing and knowledgeable
College Sophomore,5,I went to Albertus in 2003 directly after high school. I thought I knew what I was majoring in is what I wanted to do. I was offered a full time job at a corporate office at the end of sophomore year and took it over going to school. I don't regret quitting school to go to work because my work experience has been great over the last 11 years. I know now I want to finish my degree for my career to advance. I am more focused now more than ever to get my bachelors in business management.
College Freshman,5,I  really love my team
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved how professors used a lot of on the job example regarding topics covered in the text. Many of the student work as professionals and was able to had to the discussion with more questions and/ or answers.
Recent Alumnus,5,need car to get to mot restuarants
Recent Alumnus,5,Great school. Professor are always willing to help
Recent Alumnus,5,The campus is not walking distance from downtown where most clubs are.
Recent Alumnus,5,My internship was great!!. The I received assistance with applying for my intership every step of the way.
College Sophomore,5,It's the heart of New Haven- a huge city! There are of course a lot of options. Yale is right next to us so it's a pretty big college place. New Haven Pizza has amazing cheesecake!
College Sophomore,5,"My parents aren't helping me with college at all. I fell in love with the campus at Albertus and wanted to go there SO BADLY! While it is a really expensive school, the financial aid makes it manageable for me since I'm paying by myself."
College Sophomore,5,Professors know their students and care about them. I met the love of my life at school and all the teachers and lunch staff always ask how the other one is if we aren't with one another. It's really cute. Everyone cares about everyone. There are a lot of job offers.
College Sophomore,5,"Everything is beautiful. Everything is amazing. Athletic center is great. There's a hot tub. Student center is really nifty. A lot of green spaces, which is cool since we're in the city."
College Freshman,5,"I have my own personal Laptop, but there are a couple computer labs around campus for students to use. Also the printing is free which is a plus."
College Freshman,5,"Albertus is probably one of the most diverse schools you can go too. Everyone is accepting of each other no matter what color, race, sexual orientation, etc."
College Freshman,5,"The campus strictness is pretty laid back, you really have to try to get in trouble. I only seen the the police on campus once because of a fight, and it was the day basketball won GNACs, so the student body was fired up and got a little out of hand."
College Freshman,5,"Its located a couple minutes from downtown New Haven where you have Toads place, bars, and restaurants. Also, there are many colleges in the area like Southern, and even Uconn is only about an hour away."
College Senior,5,"In my specific major is so rewarding. It is revealing to me the tools that I need to be able to be of service to those individuals who are hurting and suffering from a mental illness. The workload is not overwhelming and the faculty members are very well educated to provide the tools needed to become an excellent therapist. Each classroom is clean, spacious and provides the equipment needed to execute a lecture. In the Fall I will begin my internship and I am so looking forward to it."
College Junior,5,I love this school.  I would not want to go anywhere else.  I have made a ton of friends and memories there.  I cannot imagine myself being happy at a different college or university.  
College Junior,5,"The campus has many ""green"" areas to go outside and play games with friends.  At least once a year the student government has a man hunt competition.  Our campus is the perfect size for it.  There are many events held at the student center.  There is always a good turn out.  The Student/Campus Center has much to offer: a computer lounge with free printing, pool tables, snack bar, ping pong table, video games, a bar and much more."
College Junior,5,"Since the school's location is very close to downtown New Haven, there are many night clubs and bars you can go too."
College Junior,5,I love being a part of art management.  The professors are extremely nice.  They have opened up my mind to new ideas and have helped me expand my own.
College Junior,5,My major is art management.  I am able to decide what my major is.  We do not have separate admission processes for different programs.  
College Junior,5,"The school offers four mansions to dorm in and one typical styled dorm building.  Since the campus is very small, if you live on campus, you will know everyone else that lives there too.  It is a little pricy to live on campus, but you deffinitely pay for a good experience.  "
College Junior,5,"There are always spots available.  Parking is completely free.  If you live on campus, there really is no need to have a car.  You can get to any building in less than 10 minutes."
Junior,4,Unfortunately I do have a couple classes that are online. One of my classes is completely on your own which I do not like at all. I signed up for the classes with the understanding that I would be getting the in person experience as I am a student who is more successful when I am able to have that in person experience. My other class that is online is not as bad as we do have class calls where the professor goes over a PowerPoint which I enjoy. I wish that I had the knowledge of how exactly the classes were conducted before I signed up other wise I would have chosen very different courses.
Junior,4,"In the first year, the financial aid department did absolutely everything they could to make sure you were all set for your first year but after that they really left me high and dry struggling to figure out how to pay for school. That was my biggest issue with the school. The faculty and staff all have been pretty great when it came to communicating and such. They were especially awesome during the pandemic with assisting student in trying to maneuver any issues that I have run into while transitioning into fully remote so abruptly. The school has really taken as much action as they could to ensure all students, faculty, and staff remain safe during the pandemic. Although, I hate the fact that some professors were given the choice to conduct their classes remote even though I chose to take the in person route to part take in my classes. I have a hard time learning remote and wish that I would because to have the in person experience that I have signed up for."
Freshman,4,The staff is very helpful. The dorms are a bit dated but still nice. The campus is beautiful. It's close enough to Downtown New Haven so that students can enjoy themselves away from campus.
Freshman,4,So far the online experience has been good. The courses offered online have been solid. The work has been presented and accessible.
Niche User,4,"Albertus Magnus College has great faculty and staff. The Academic classes are good and relatively easy to do well in. Albertus' negative, for me, was the size. Albertus had a smaller number of students than my high school."
Sophomore,4,"I'm glad that there's a program with blended learning - it's great for a full-time working parent.  I love going to the campus, but I also like having the flexibility of online classwork."
Freshman,4,I really like how diverse the college is and how everyone is so friendly and able to get along with each other
Junior,4,"The community at Albertus Magnus College is very involved, tightly-knit, and familiar. The majority of the professors are phenomenal, insightful, and very human as you get to know them, but there are always bad apples that cause discontent among the student body."
Sophomore,4,"Albertus is a pretty decent school. Tuition is ridiculous, but the classes are really interesting. The teachers are really dedicated, and the class sizes small, so you get a lot of one on one interacting."
Junior,4,"Thus far, I have had a great experience with Albertus Magnus College.  I am currently enrolled in the accelerated degree program which I will receive my Bachelors in Business Management with a concentration in Human Resources.  I love that I have been able to continue to work my full time job and also fulfill my lifelong goal in receiving a college degree."
Freshman,4,Really enjoy the amazing communication you can have with your professors but I would like to see more diversity
Senior,4,Albertus Magnus College is an excellent school that assist in bringing  the potential out of the student. The more involved you are the more you will feel connected and comfortable.
Freshman,4,"I love the teachers, they are super relatable and love to see you get involved. There is always something to do on campus."
Junior,4,"I really like Albertus and because it’s a small school I was really able to connect with people. Most people think that small schools are lame, but they are actually great, especially with academics. I have one on one with my professors, they know me by my name and not by a number. They care about how I’m doing. Also within a small school I was able to still play sports which is a huge part of my life. The location of Albertus is also great because it’s in New Haven which is such a great city and college town. Albertus has given me friendships that will last a lifetime."
Junior,4,"I’m a commuter so I am not involved in campus life but I love all of my professors. The classes are small so that you can focus, they have little events to try to get everyone involved and raise awareness"
Freshman,4,"Albertus has a startlingly family-like community and is full of professors who genuinely want to help! Definitely a wonderful change from high school, and Albertus is more like a home than anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"Albertus Magnus College is a very connected school. Although Albertus is on the smaller size,  this however allows for many of the professors to get to know their students on a more personal level, instead of just being a number in a class room. When a person comes to Albertus I hope that feel the scene of family and community that I have come to know."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Albertus Magnus College. The reason I chose Albertus is because it has the best program for my major in the state of CT, Sports Communications Broadcasting /Public Relations. Now yes, the school is indeed really small but coming from a small high school it makes me feel more comfortable. The residential life staff is okay, they could be better, but the campus life is one to experience. I have made more friends and have had more fun living on campus than I have had in years. The classes are small which makes it easier to learn and succeed. The food at Albertus isn't the greatest, some days it's actually terrible but our school is in down town New Haven! The food places around New Haven are amazing and delicious!! Not to mention the night life which always a must there!!"
College Senior,4,There is always security posted all around the building and we also have New Haven Police in the parking lots at times. I have never had any safety concerns
College Senior,4,It's a great school for working people. Fast paced and with great instructors. I wish they had available more financial aid to distribute to working moms
College Senior,4,Nice school and program for working parents
College Freshman,4,"its very enjoyable, i absolutely love my new school."
College Freshman,4,"im doing my internship at ESPN Bristol, what more could i want!?"
College Freshman,4,"Its Great, i know friends who room and board."
College Freshman,4,"The experience is really good so far, i love my professors."
College Freshman,4,Fan Support is Great i love attending games.
College Freshman,4,Campus is very small and I feel safe but would not suggest going off campus besides downtown towards Yale
College Senior,4,"the academics at my school are really good, the professors are knowledgeable and the curriculum is very stimulating"
College Senior,4,The professors have been very accomodating with my courses especially since my disability
College Senior,4,the security on my campus is very good guards are always on duty and there is adequate lighting
College Senior,4,I have had an excellent experience so far
College Sophomore,4,"Safety on campus is great, I have never felt more safe."
College Sophomore,4,I have never lived on campus but knew people who did.
College Freshman,4,i think this school is good for kids that wanna study not party its a really small school the professor will always there to help .i will encourage people to attend the school
College Sophomore,4,"Because Albertus is set in New Haven, a rather large city, there are plenty of options off-campus for food, and the Yale shuttle buses help with transportation for those who can't/don't drive or don't feel comfortable with their friends driving them around. I've only been downtown with my college friends a few times, but I've gone to quite a few restaurants with other people outside of a college-based setting. My high school also happened to be in New Haven, and as such, I've visited the area's local spots. 

Overall, the off-campus dining is pretty good if you know what you're looking for. Plenty of delivery and pizza options."
College Sophomore,4,"The financial aid process went smoothly after a tiny hiccup during the beginning of my first semester. The issue happened during the summer between my graduation from high school and attending Albertus, but was resolved quickly. There seemed to be a problem with what my high school had sent to the financial aid office, and as such, required several phone calls from my college to my high school. As mentioned previously, the ordeal was managed in a timely and easy manner. 

As for tips I have for financial aid, it is vital that you finish your FAFSA as soon as possible. This is probably the most important step, as an unfinished/unsubmitted or incorrect FAFSA can result in a huge headache for all those involved in the process. Other than that, finding good scholarships and other financial aids takes a little investigation, and I recommend finding out about personally specific aids as soon as you can. Make an account on a website that helps search for scholarships, talk to your high school teachers about deals they can point you in the direction of, and make sure to finish everything on time. Sticking close to due dates is incredibly important, as you don't want to miss out on a $2,000 scholarship that you have absolute eligibility for just because you didn't think to look up the deadline."
College Sophomore,4,"I LEARN SO MUCH,VERY PLEASED WITH MY CHOICE"
College Sophomore,4,"Students definitely do party in the dorms (mostly Dominican Hall). The parties aren't as big as in other schools, but everyone still has fun. I would say it is a positive impact for most, negative for some who are new to the party scene."
Recent Alumnus,4,Always something to do. Your just 10 mins away from downtown parks and museums.
College Freshman,4,"New Haven has a great, diverse dining scene with options to accommodate all diets and budgets. Student discounts are generally available at places downtown, just ask."
College Freshman,4,"From my experience, Albertus is a safe, small community, and I'm unaware of any threats. Security is present and helpful. I've never heard of or encountered any crime on-campus."
College Freshman,4,There seem to be sufficient options for all students.
College Sophomore,4,I love it because it's buffet style. They have a grill that serves different things. I love their turkey burgers. My boyfriend and I always get them.
College Sophomore,4,Every one i really supportive.
College Sophomore,4,I'm an English Major and I am about to enter my sophomore year. I already have a job in which I tutor students and help them with essays. I've completed 40 hours of observing a nearby high school teacher. And I have job this coming semester in which I will be teacher assistant to a lower level English class. There are so many opportunities!
College Sophomore,4,I'm extremely happy with the program. I'm still nervous about finding a job after college but that's just me.
College Sophomore,4,"For being in New Haven, the campus is very safe feeling. Everyone looks out for each other and walking on campus at night isn't scary because everything is in close proximity."
College Freshman,4,"Its New England so the weather is always different. Since the walk to anywhere on campus is only 5 minutes, weather isn't a big deal walking to class. A perk is we get a lot of snow days since most of the school are commuters the campus usually closes if it is suppose to snow."
College Freshman,4,"The only other drug on campus would be weed, but most kids go an smoke it off campus anyway, so its not a problem."
College Freshman,4,"I play on the baseball team, and like the rest of the sports your teammates become family, and we hangout with each other on and of the field. Also, over half the students here are involved in sports, so we try to attend each other games. I do wish we did get a bigger gym, as most kids go to planet fitness or the Edge because the gym is extremely small and limited."
College Freshman,4,"I have lived in Siena Hall for my first term, its a triple, but its only me and my roommate in the room. The room is huge, we have two walk in closets and a full bathroom in our room. Not every room is like this in Siena though, we lucked out. The only problem is that we can't have a refrighrator in the room. Most likely I will live in Dominican next term because thats were everyone hangs out and I'm usually there anyway. Its too quiet and boring in the mansions."
College Freshman,4,"I like how everyone know each other. The study body is one big family, and I had have many great experiences with my teammates and fellow students."
College Freshman,4,"Compare to my old school, the classes are really small so all the professors know your name and most of them are easy going. Also, there isn't much homework, and most teaches will give you slack if you come to class a couple minutes late."
College Freshman,4,"I transfered here in the spring, and I haven't seen any crime or violence besides drunk kids destroying a bathroom in a dorm"
College Senior,4,There have not been any issues that I am aware. I received my Bachelor's degree from Albertus Magnus and am now going on to receive my Master's. And I not had any issues with security or crime. There are security officers walking the campus and there is one always circling the parking lot. If you feel uncomfortable walking to your car they will escort you.
College Junior,4,Everything depends on the type of professor you have.  Each professor works differently.  Some might give you more work than others. 
College Junior,4,Computer Labs are on the third floor furthest away from the dorms. There is only one tiny elevator in the building so it is difficult to climb all those stairs but no one is ever using the labs at night.
College Junior,4,"New Haven has a lot of restaurants, however it is a far distance from the campus itself. We share the city with Yale which is where all of the good shopping and restaurants are."
College Senior,4,No complaints are school is pretty small so it's never too crazy
College Sophomore,4,Albertus Magnus is a student centered college. It is in a neighborhood so that makes it feel very home-like. The staff is extremely helpful and caring which is a big plus!
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are dirty, have mice and bugs and are not cleaned on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,People are very childish and some classes I find pointless and off topic.
Recent Alumnus,2,I live off campus and I attend the college at night. I never heard anything about the sports team.
College Freshman,2,"ADP students are not eligible for any grants of scholarships offered to day students and i feel this is unfair. Albertus aught to do more to include ADP students in these opportunities, or cultivate more opportunities expressly for ADP students, many of whom have unique financial obligations outside of school that traditional students don't yet have (mortgages, families, etc.)"
College Freshman,2,"I get the sense that the most of Albertus' minority students are members of the ADP program, and that day students are less diverse. I am unaware of campus activities that promote or celebrate this diversity, and would like to see more done related to these topics."
College Freshman,2,"The service is extremely slow, and its basically the same meal choices everyday. I wish they would upgrade the dinning choices, but overall the food quality is good."
College Junior,2,"There is a wide variety of food.  The grill is mainly everyone's favorite spot.  You can order grilled cheese, hot dogs, burgers, and even turkey burgers.  Outside of the grill there is also a salad bar, sandwich stand, pizza place, desert bar, and an area where they cook different types of food each day.  Overall, the food is okay.  Some days are better than others, but in general the food is edible."
College Junior,2,"public transportation is ok around the campus. The city buses run about every 30 minutes. The school itself doesnt provide a shuttle, which can be really inconvienent."
College Junior,2,There are limited sports teams to choose from althoug they do now have a men's lacrosse team and the coach is very good
College Junior,2,Food Stinks – The food really stinks and what stinks more is that it is mandatory for people to pay for the meal plan if they live on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Little Punishments – I heard about a fight that broke out between two students and neither of them got in trouble. It upset me that something like that could happen at such a college level and no consequences took place. I want to feel safe and secure, I do not want to be around fighting where people think it is okay."
College Senior,2,"There Are Sports? The school population is relatively small, and as a result the sports division lacks.  Fan support is fairly limited, games and meets aren't promoted, and the ""athletic scene"" seems to be hidden in the gym composed of about 6 weight machines."
College Freshman,1,"I only know 2 kids that own a apartment off campus, which is 10 minutes away from campus. Most kids either live on campus or live home."
College Junior,1,Over All Experience – the dining hall is very small and very clean. the variety is poor and so is the value

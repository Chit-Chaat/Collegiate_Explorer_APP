Freshman,5,"The University of Montana is one college that everyone should at least visit. At the University, they make sure to get everyone involved. The college community provides a welcoming atmosphere."
Freshman,5,"Online learning has been very educational, just as it would have been in person. The professors put effort into their online lectures and are open to suggestions for improving classes. The material learned is not simply put on powerpoints, but are executed in the traditional lecture format. Overall I believe online learning is successful and would like to see it implemented as an alternative option to in-person classes in the future."
Senior,5,"I still can't believe how smoothly online learning has been going at UM. The faculty really took advantage of all the resources at their disposal for online learning, and have made themselves so available for students. Sometimes I forget that I used to attend all of my classes in person!"
Senior,5,"UM has such a welcoming and vibrant yet peaceful atmosphere. Their response to the pandemic has been amazing, and has made their resident students feel safer and more educated than ever regrading COIVD-19. Transferring here during a pandemic couldn't have been smoother."
Freshman,5,"I love the University of Montana and all it has to offer. Missoula is a very beautiful city and UM is a beautiful campus. The faculty is amazing and has done an amazing job throughout the pandemic by keeping their students safe, but also keeping the culture of traditional class on."
Freshman,5,"Great school with the willingness to help. They go out of their way to make sure that you are on track for you graduation, and there is always someone checking on you"
Sophomore,5,"the University of Montana is a great place to be. The campus is beautiful situated on the edge of town up against the surrounding hills, its very easy to get around town and there is an awesome local scene. There's good live music all the time and plenty of outdoor activities to take part in; skiing, rock climbing, whitewater rafting or kayaking, river surfing, and more can all be found within an hour of town. what more could you ask for."
Senior,5,I love the University of Montana. It is a wonderful school and a wonderful campus. I wish enrollment numbers would increase.
Senior,5,"I had attended two other universities before coming to the University of Montana. This experience has been the best. The campus is beautiful, the professors are great, and I feel like the school actually wants to help you. I really feel at home at this university."
Freshman,5,They did a great job in working around the COVID-19 Pandemic through their online learning opportunities.
Freshman,5,"Great campus, city, people, and atmosphere! Not to mention, the campus is only 15 minutes from the ski bowl, and transportation is free."
Junior,5,"The atmosphere at the University of Montana makes it feel like home. With hiking trails and Mount Sentinel at the base of campus, UM has the perfect sidekicks to go along with great education. UM professors value students and their learning experiences in campus."
Freshman,5,Had a blast during my campus tour. I got to sleep in the dorms and connects with some of the students. Beautiful!
Sophomore,5,"The community is amazing. Everyone cares about everyone. The university strives to create a safe atmosphere and they do it well. They also raise awareness of important social subjects such as rape, disabilities and minorities."
Freshman,5,UM is a calm and welcoming college. The teachers are enthusiastic and want you to succeed. It's also incredibly beautiful to watch each season go by.
Alum,5,"I really loved my time at UM. The ability to learn in such a fantastic environment was unbelievable, especially for this Midwestern kid. If you love sports then the Griz won't let you down. Academics are top-notch and the facilities are great. And you have to love Missoula. Such a great place!"
Niche User,5,"Beautiful area, would definitely recommend to anybody looking into higher education. Great major choices, great people, great school."
Junior,5,"As a Junior in the neuroscience department, the University of Montana is a diamond in the rough. It’s hard to find a university where you have a concerted effort of professors, faculty, researchers and mentors, all working together for the students. UM invests way more into our students. Instead of withholding scholarships to add money into the new dining halls (MSU), UM rewards accomplished students. As for researchers, we have the leading Evolutionary Biologists, leading Paleo-ecologists, extremely well renowned Microbiologists and Immunologists and have cohorts working towards an opioid vaccine and understandings Lymes disease. We have incredible undergraduate research in which you are not just washing dishes, but almost always are taking charge of your own scientific study. The campus is amazing, the surrounding area even more so. It’s hard to imagine a better place for a smaller price tag than the University of Montana"
Niche User,5,I went on a visit to the university because of my interest in the lacrosse program and business school. I was very impressed by everything they had to offer through the visit and I’m glad I made my commitment to the team.
Junior,5,"The campus is amazing and everything is so beautiful! They provide plenty of services to ensure success such as: multiple areas of study, nourishment (even the caffeinated kind), activities to boost spirits, even campus transportation that goes all through town! Everyone is extremely helpful even when simply asking for directions on this big campus. Teachers make sure they are available for any extra assistance needed, even providing tutoring options and their personal help during office hours! This campus is amazing!"
Freshman,5,"The University of Montana is a oasis of diversity in a state that is mostly homogenous.  As a member of the LGBT community, I stand out when all I want is to blend in.  The U allows me to blend in, and relieves the feeling of being bizarre and cast-out."
Sophomore,5,"Lots of places for study groups, and there's a very welcoming feel to campus during opening week. The University has great meal plans that cover a very diverse set of health needs"
Junior,5,Wonderful online programs that you can do from a distance. Great transfer program from FVCC to UM. Beautiful campus. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.
Niche User,5,"I have studied at University of Montana as a Exchange Student and it was the best year of my life.  The imerse experience I had there was amazing, living on campus was so helpful for my studies and the student life was amazing overall."
Alum,5,"I was enrolled in a 2-year online program and received my BSW. Even given the distance between myself and the University the service was great. If I ever needed to contact an instructor I could by phone or email and they responded quickly. The few times I needed to contact the registrars office or the financial aid office was met with efficiency and kindness. The online process was easy and you can access pretty much everything; IT, library, writing lab, etc."
Alum,5,"The Anthropology Department is great and if you are Native American, the support is superb!  You will make life long friends and find a common ground with other Indigenous students and a great support system."
Freshman,5,"University of Montana is amazing. Not only is it an amazing art school (visual and performing), it has the number one Wildlife Biology program in the United States. The class sizes are small, giving you a more intimate experience and more opportunity for help."
Freshman,5,An amazing school that I recommend to all upcoming college freshman in Montana. Lots of scholarships available and the professors are understanding.
Freshman,5,The staff and students at U of M are all very friendly and helpful! Communication with advisors is easy and they are very responsive when I send in questions.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy attending here!  My professors are super helpful and I have met some amazing friends here!
Niche User,5,"This campus is very friendly and welcoming. Walking onto campus you feel right at home, everyone either says hi or smiles."
Sophomore,5,"Most amazing and inclusive university, with amazing classes, teachers, and opportunities to help you grow!"
Junior,5,"It's a very personal school. The professors are often extremely helpful, and forthright with what they expect from you as a student. The community of Missoula is amazing, and you see that exemplified in school community as well. It's like one huge family, once you enter an intended field. Everyone works to help each other succeed."
Freshman,5,The University of the Montana is very welcoming to new students. I transferred here at semester and all of the staff and professors have opened their arms to me. Love this school!
Graduate Student,5,"I love the small town atmosphere and class sizes. UM is 10 minutes from multiple trails, a lively downtown and welcoming community."
Freshman,5,I’ve had an awesome first semester at The University of Montana. I’ve met some amazing people and have loved almost all my classes thus far. I feel like I always have something to do or some friends to hang out with. I’ve had such a fun time and can’t wait to get back! FTC!
Freshman,5,I love the landscape of the University. I love it how the campus looks like it has a little forest inside it. There nothing I want to change.
Graduate Student,5,Everyone is so nice! This campus is beautiful!! Cheapest graduate school I have found in numerous searches!! There is sooo much too do outdoors or indoors and in any season!!
Freshman,5,"As an out-of-state student here at UMT, I absolutely love it. University of Montana brings a large amount of diversity and opportunities, and has some of the best food I've ever had in their campus food court. Theres a large amount of options in everything here, from multiple food choices all over campus, to multiple clubs and organizations for students to be a part of. Everyone that comes here can find something they're interested in and can participate in. This is one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever seen. From the ""M"" on Mount Sentinel, to the trees, the city, and to the mountains all around Missoula, this campus is beautiful."
Senior,5,"This is a beautiful campus,  in a wonderful city. The academics are very diverse, and the atmosphere is relaxed and quite diverse."
Senior,5,"The classes may be quite large, but overall each student is able to learn and obtain extra help alongside class by just voicing concern, or asking the teacher for the class. There are also many resources available, including tutors, advisors and outside sources willing to give the time to those who need a little extra, in whatever area that may be."
Sophomore,5,"Lots of clubs to get involved in, great student life. Excellent consideration for minorities and the LGBT+ communities. A bit of a pocket crunch for out of state applicants."
Freshman,5,The overall view and community there is amazing. Everyone is so outgoing and it's easy to find interests as well as new ones.
Sophomore,5,"I'm first year, online student in the Media Arts program. The teachers are very caring & want to make sure you understand the courses. The courses themselves are excellent! This is the best art education I've ever had."
Senior,5,"The University of Montana is a great campus. Not only is the view spectacular, but the departments are student and academic oriented. 
Only thing I would seek to be improved would be to replace the light-poles on campus."
Freshman,5,"The University of Montana has been, and will continue to be, an excellent place for myself to attend college. From the various clubs/activities on campus, the diversity, and beauty of Montana. Makes going to The University of Montana, a wonderful place."
Freshman,5,"It is a great campus that is close to town and great food places. There are many outdoor activities near the campus as well, like hiking up the M or ski slopes a car ride away. Also, once football season is here, almost everyone goes and supports our team. Go Grizzlies!"
Niche User,5,"I will be attending Bitterroot Community College in the fall of 2017, which is a branch off of the University of Montana and happens to be located in a smaller town about an hour away. This is a nice change because it gets you away from the chaos that you would be in going to the larger University. Thanks to the UNiversity of Montana I now get to stay at home and go to college still for the first to years of getting my AA."
Sophomore,5,"I love UM. It's a great school filled with wonderful people, faculty, staff and students. The campus setting is amazing, it's right at the base of Mount Sentinel, with a hiking trail that's always available for anyone to use. The facilities are awesome, the gym and pool are great to work out at. Campus food is meh, but if you have a meal plan, it's A LOT better that the crap you can make with a microwave."
Niche User,5,"The University of Montana is a very nice school. There are lots of activities around campus, and there is the town around the campus, so there is no reason to be bored while going to school."
Niche User,5,"Very fun. Location, location! Mountains, rivers, valleys. Climbing, skiing, rockhounding, history. And the classes are top-notch."
College Senior,5,"At my school, everybody is their brother and sisters' keeper. When somebody needs help, there is always somebody there at least trying to do their best to help out. The teachers are amazing and the trade equipment is definitely up to par. I love it."
College Freshman,5,"In my orientation, the school seems to take the policy enforcement seriously."
College Freshman,5,"Even though I am new to the school, I have followed the Griz for years with my dad and mom.  I can't wait to attend football and basketball games, and possibly get on a fun intramural team.  Although music is my passion, I would love to get to know people and get on a team for some good exercise and laughs!"
College Freshman,5,"I will be attending the University of Montana in the Fall.  I can't wait!  So far the school seems to have a diverse, welcoming, and engaged student body.  The smaller campus and engaging faculty have been very welcoming and helpful to guide me towards a field of study.  I have sacrificed to save money and work in Montana for the last year so that I could attend the school of my choice.  I look forward to being a Griz and carrying on the tradition, as my dad is an alumni of the school.  Can't wait to make new friends, start my education to a new and exciting career path, and live in the state that I grew up in until I was in high school.  I love Colorado but am so ready to get back to the warm, welcoming people of Montana.  It truly is the last best place.--Katherine Gundlach"
College Junior,5,"Besides being at a mediocre college with no bearings out of the state, I enjoy every day and week of attending college. It gives me a purpose, I meet like minded people, and just enjoy the moment. FAFSA covers all of it so I don't have to pay either beyond an occasional $500 and maybe $300 on books"
College Junior,5,It is one of the best.
College Sophomore,5,"Although I've heard about the somewhat recent cases involving the football team & sexual assault charges, things seems to have taken a turn for the better with an assortment of options in counseling & proper reporting."
College Sophomore,5,It's the thing to go in montana
College Junior,5,"For our division, the facilities are phenomenal and getting upgrades to become even better. The fan support is huge. There are bars across the country that are devoted to our football team alone. Everyone at a Griz game is in high spirits and friendly. Donations run our athletics."
Freshman,4,With the challenges of COVID-19 the University of Montana has taken the extra steps to ensure the learning environment is still top notch.
Freshman,4,"Overall the campus provides multiple resources for the safety of students. They provide multiple health services. Also, the scenery around campus is breathtaking. However, when it comes to the food, the Food Zoo's menu is subpar. Most of the food is underseasoned and has a bitter taste from all the greens added to the food. Another issue with the food is the choice of what's on the menu. There seems to be no homey staple food, such as soups or spaghetti. Other than with the food issue, the campus appears to have a very social and inviting atmosphere. I would recommend any person who is considering college to come to The University of Montana."
Freshman,4,"The University of Montana is pretty good with their online classes. Some professor are unsure how to work the online aspect of classes, but overall the University as a whole has done a very well job by keeping all classes on Moodle."
Sophomore,4,"New to the college experience, but they have tried fairly hard to make it a good time. Problems with financial aid have been common as they are understaffed."
Freshman,4,Classes are well organized online and the professors are willing to help with any questions you may have
Sophomore,4,"the University of Montana is a great place to be. The campus is beautiful situated on the edge of town up against the surrounding hills, its very easy to get around town and there is an awesome local scene. There's good live music all the time and plenty of outdoor activities to take part in; skiing, rock climbing, whitewater rafting or kayaking, river surfing, and more can all be found within an hour of town. what more could you ask for."
Senior,4,"Online schooling is hard and I feel like a professor can either make it a good experience or a really, really bad one. luckily, all my professors have been excellent and really understanding about having to switch to online schooling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Online schooling is definitely not my first choice, but the teachers make it enjoyable and doable."
Senior,4,"During the pandemic we had to switch to online classes. I was pleasantly surprised by how well my professors were able to adapt the class to online. There was only one class I felt like I didn't get as much out of as I could, the rest really stepped up to the challenge."
Sophomore,4,The university is very beautiful. Lots of opportunities to get outdoors and explore nature. The professors are excellent and the people are great.
Sophomore,4,All and all the teachers where able to convert to online learning smoothly. If any hiccups happened they were there to answer studies questions and help.
Sophomore,4,"It's hard to rate an online experience from a first-time online user. I found that I struggled heavily with the online switch due to COVID-19, at no fault of the professors. The professors were very understanding and helped work around the challenges surrounding the sudden switch. Overall, I struggled with motivation to get the assignments done on time and managed my time poorly. The professors I had made it much easier on us than I initially would have expected, and I appreciate it so much."
Sophomore,4,"Some professors care more about your success than others, which is understandable - but not entirely helpful. However, there are so many amazing resources on and around the campus that help make up for lack of passionate professors. There's an amazing community at UM that really makes it feel like home. Everyone is welcome, and everyone is included."
Alum,4,I love the amount of opportunities that UMT offered. While getting my degree there were many opportunities that got me out of the classroom and in the field getting hands on experience. Many of the classes had a mixture of lecture and in field learning. I was also involved with interdisciplinary courses which included Wilderness and Civilization program and Aerie's Backcountry Medicine Program. I would highly recommend both of these programs and this college.
Alum,4,I took one class online and really enjoyed it. I loved the flexibility of the course and being able to do it on my own time. I also thought the instructor did a great job and was always available for extra help or questions.
Freshman,4,"Very friendly and helpful staff, I think they handled online learning well enough. It was still abhorrently expensive, however. Professors and advisors were quick to respond to emails and were available for phone/zoom calls."
Freshman,4,"Missoula is a beautiful city with great people, restaurants, and activities. The college feels very welcoming and the campus is safe. There is a strong community that rallies around the college and you can feel an immediate bond with everybody around you.

There might be too much of a focus on athletics.

Dorm communities feel like home but are small and outdated.

Amazing outdoor program!

The tuition and fees feel exorbitant. I don't know who to blame this for, however."
Sophomore,4,"The University tried really hard to keep students engaged online. They put out constant live streams on how students can be successful with COVID-19. Professors were asked to shorten their workloads if they could, and despite some not being the best at ZOOM, most profs really cared about their students."
Sophomore,4,"The U is a very fun place to go to school! Professors usually care about their students, classes are pretty manageable, and the social life around town is busy but not overwhelming."
Sophomore,4,"I like the people and the different communities at the university of Montana. Missoula has a small town essence with big city ideas. Because it is Montana it doesn't appear as diverse, you just have to find the right people and places."
Junior,4,I would first and for most like to say that I have spent a lot of time attending the UofM and while I feel fully vested in this collage and am a Griz through and through I do not always feel that this college is fully vested in me or my education.  I have no other collage experience to compare this to but I know that there have been many turns that I just feel that their actions were only about the money and not whether or not I as a student had what I need or the means necessary to get there.
Sophomore,4,"I liked the friendly people at the U of M as well as the professors too. Missoula is a beautiful place, and the campus is located in a very beautiful spot along Mount Jumbo. The campus is also very close to downtown Missoula where there are lots of amazing locally owned food shops, and all around very cool night life and events constantly going on."
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful and honestly overall the school is well priced and if you choose a good degree, you will get returns on your investment."
Junior,4,"My experience at the University of Montana - Missoula has been wonderful.  I am in the music studies and education programs, both of which have exceeded my expectations.  I have learned so much and I know I will be ready to be a music educator by the time I graduate next year.  A change I would like to see is a combined music education AND elementary education major that does not take more than five years."
Junior,4,I enjoy the University of Montana thoroughly. The campus is beautiful and the staff are friendly and helpful. The Forestry department is great and In an amazing place to provide an quality hands on experience that helps bridge the gap between academic life and the real world. Through internships and consultation with government agencies I have a good idea what to expect when I graduate and enter the work force.  The field trips I was able to participate in have been extremely helpful in providing hands on experience and learning that online school just can not accommodate.
Junior,4,I have really enjoyed my time here at the university. I have lived in the dorms my entire time here and I have really enjoyed and gotten to know some really good people because of this. I also think that their psychology program is really good and enjoy all of the classes offered for psychology majors.
Freshman,4,It has been a good experience. I wish they had more activities that you could do on campus. Also I wish they offered more programs as well as a better admission place to talk with if you have questions.
Sophomore,4,"Fresh out of high school, I was very nervous about my college experience. That anxiety soon gave way to the euphoria that comes with living in Missoula. Not only is the campus gorgeous, but so is the local area. Just behind the residence hall that I lived in was a miles long nature trail. Anytime I needed release from the stresses that come with student life, I simply stepped out into the fresh mountain air and took a hike."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Montana is a beautiful home to me. I have absolutely loved my time there so far. My experiences with the town of Missoula, its people, the culture, my teachers, and my fellow students has been incredibly positive, and it makes me very excited to return."
Freshman,4,My experience at the University of Montana has been great. The only real setbacks are things that are pretty much out of anybody's control right now like the budget cuts and how old the buildings are. A lot of the things people complain about don't really affect most of the student body. Some of the negative reviews I've seen make me laugh. Like yes the winters are cold it's Montana and yes if you aren't outdoorsy there isn't much to do but what did you expect? I would highly recommend this school!
Niche User,4,"I am applying to the University of Montana. My experience so far has been very good, and I am excited to attend there."
Freshman,4,"I love it here! The campus is really really small and doesn't offer many late night study places. The coffee shops we have are exceptional, though they aren't open late at all. I also really love a lot of the faculty I've come to know, though it's always best to talk to your advisor about the teachers they might have known or classes they know have been well-liked. The classes are usually pretty small which is incredibly nurturing and makes it even easier to get to know teachers. The dorms are alright, there's just a lot of small and crappy dorms, so definitely do your research and assume it's smaller than the pictures. For girls, Turner is a great option-- though it's an all-girls dorm, it's a perfectly quiet and enjoyable environment. The best thing about Turner is the sinks in the rooms and the big showers as well. I lived in Aber for a while and switching to Turner made my quality of life much higher."
Alum,4,"Most of the teaching staff go above and beyond to encourage learning.  There are balanced classroom, field time, and study ratios."
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, I have loved the University of Montana! I am so glad that I chose to come here. The campus is beautiful and they really encourage diversity and opinions of all kinds. I suppose the only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because my particular department seems to be a little disorganized."
Alum,4,"I began at the University of Montana in the fall of 2014, and attended until the winter of 2017. I received my bachelors in elementary education, and walked away with no loans. If you can say one thing for UM, they have an abundance of scholarships available to students if you're willing to take the time to apply. Beyond the bad press they've received the past few years, it's a great school. They have some work to do in regards to their enrollment, class range, etc. but these are issues they are aware of and working on."
Freshman,4,"The University of Montana is a very great place. The town of Missoula is surrounded by  beautiful view of Mountains. The opportunities in the city are great as its correlates with the college life culture. From the countless shows, to being in the middle of nature within a 10 minute drive it is a perfect place for a university. On campus there is a strong healthy influence vibe on the food. There is always some fresh greens or veggie's reliably available especially at the summer time farmers market. The professors at the university are quite liberal but it makes for opportunity to share and debate on serious political issues. They have a wonderful art program as one of Missoulas value its art and beauty of the city."
Graduate Student,4,Excited to start. Campus is beautiful. Missoula is a great town. I think that most people enjoy the school as long as you don't mind the cold winters.
Niche User,4,The University of Montana has a beautiful campus. It is full of very welcoming employees and students. The social atmosphere is so much fun and sporting events are full of excitement.
Sophomore,4,"I think that the overall feel and look of the University of Montana's campus is beautiful and engaging. My professors and fellow classmates are very friendly, helpful, and encourage me to strive for my best in all that I do. One thing that I would like to see improvement in is for UM to provide a more wide array of options in it's degrees that are available."
Junior,4,Such a beautiful place! Great Campus! They sell to many parking passes so its difficult to park. Not all of the teachers are helpful and they think that emailing is faster then calling.
Freshman,4,"UM is great! Makes being homesick a lot easier, and the students form a great community. Financial aid is hard to navigate, though. I would suggest they remodel their website."
Freshman,4,Overall Campus is beautiful. It’s large but not where you will get lost. The dorms are fairly updated and nice. Academic wise Most of the professors are extremely nice and helpful. I wish there were more restaurants/food options on campus though.
Freshman,4,"Teachers who are not super biased liberally or conservatively, little to no activism, time to learn instead of time to complain about oppressive systems. Job prospects, not tumblr and twitter fights."
Freshman,4,"The campus and buildings are beautiful. You are nestled in a valley, surrounded by mountains that are snowcapped until late spring. Deer meander around the campus, and it's beautifully landscaped. 
Another strong pro is how environmentally conscious this university is. You can't walk 10 feet without finding recycling bins, and all of the cleaning supplies are certified green and non-toxic. 
There are a ridiculous amount of social events, completely free.
The university also holds the philosophy that diversity builds a stronger community. Diversity in the student body is championed heavily, and the general atmosphere is very accepting of all races, religions, and disabilities."
Sophomore,4,The University of Montana is a great place to learn and grow through the many programs that they offer and the diversity of the students and faculty. I enjoy the university because the class sizes are average so there is still potential for one on one learning and the faculty that I have interacted with care if you are learning and understanding the material.
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere of the campus its self. It is very open while staying close together. The professors here are very helpful and generous adults. Getting involved on campus with activities and meeting new people is easy and great to do on the weekends. You really get the whole college life experience when going here, even though it is not like a big city. There is also lots to do off campus, tons of places to explore. Just have to keep your mind open about this college."
Sophomore,4,"The main reason I love going to school here is simply the location and all of the outdoor activities around. There is great food and people and the campus location is perfect! You can climb to the top of Mt Sentinel or enjoy all that downtown has to offer just within a few minutes. There is also a great music scene with venues like the Wilma, Tophat, Kettlehouse Ampitheater, as well as many others. the campus is beautiful during all four seasons and their are plenty of things to do right here on campus. The business, education, and journalism programs are all top notch and have many professors and advisors who are great with helping with job placement."
Graduate Student,4,"I attended UM as a graduate student in the English department. I received a 1-year TAship and am grateful to the university for the free tuition and the stipend while I taught Writing 101. The English professors at UM were quite good when I attended. However, the facilities of the Humanities building left a lot to be desired. Both the university and the Missoula area are overly passionate about the football program at UM, though it would be nice to see more money and devotion put toward the arts."
Senior,4,"The professors at the University of Montana are amazing, they really care about their students and the subject they are teaching. Its really easy to pursue majors and minors in different fields, and get a really well rounded education. Unfortunately, the administration and student services really don't know what they are doing, residence life is really rude and unaccommodating, administration continues to mishandle money and cut programs that students want, and don't expect to get a lot of aide or scholarships from any other the colleges or the university as a whole."
Junior,4,"The professors are, for the most part, quite good.  One of the best I had is untenured, and, unfortunately, the powers that be don't like that.  This is very irritating and quite unfair, as she is very good at her job (teaching A&P to med/pre-med/nursing students) and putting a tenured prof in that position would be unfair to the students; he/she would be unable to do research and still provide adequate instruction in this very rigorous course.  My other huge peeve is that there is way too much emphasis on athletics, mostly football.  I'm here to learn, and they seem to be quite good at teaching.  The whole sports thing, especially since there was a legal scandal involving football players assaulting female students, needs to be scaled back, in my opinion."
Senior,4,"The professors are great and are very dedicated. Some rooms need to be updated with at least decent seating and basic technology. Also, all of the professors need to be trained on the technology that they use in the classrooms. There are constant problems with teachers not being able to login or figure out something with the computer/projector."
Senior,4,"I think more money needs to go into the academics rather than athletics. Specifically, the science department. Some of the equipment could be updated. The professors are great, however."
Junior,4,"School funding has decreased dramatically while I've participated at the school. School has been cutting funds to programs and teachers, while building new infrastructure from donations."
Junior,4,"UM has a very active student body and is very integrated into the Montana community. It is often compared to CU Boulder in terms of spirit and culture. However, the smaller and more intimate campus provides more opportunity to apply your academics to your chosen career path. The most appealing feature of UM has to be the abundance of opportunity to participate in your chosen career path even before graduation. Missoula has just what any student needs and is available to give it if you look around."
Freshman,4,"I transferred to the university of montana from a community college in state, and while I do love it there, some of the overall fine tuning things with paperwork and financial aid and credits if you transfer are frustrating initially. Everyone is super friendly if you can make time to go and talk to them, and the students themselves are always willing to help out from what I've found so that was really nice."
Freshman,4,"The people are amazing here and there is a strong sense of community. Despite the university having some problems in past years with budgeting, it still provides a reliable place to continue one's education."
Freshman,4,The University of Montana is located in a town not to big nor small that fits my standards of a college town. The weather is perfect (coming from someone that lived in Arizona) and I love the atmosphere. I haven't been here long enough to come up with a suggestion of what needs to improve.
Freshman,4,"I'm only a month into my freshman year, but I am really enjoying it! Campus is beautiful, and everyone is so friendly.  The one thing I really like is how hard the professors try to make sure you are doing well!"
Freshman,4,"Love this place! Tuition is a little high, especially for out-of-state students, but the classes are phenomenal and faculty are always willing to help!"
Freshman,4,"University of Montana is a very personable university they will come and try their hardest to make sure you have everything you need. They don't just try to get you into the door, they also want to keep you happy while you are their. Incredibly friendly."
Graduate Student,4,"Most beautiful campus in America! Food is amazing. Professors are chill af. It doesn't matter who you are or what you are into, everyone chills together. Go hike the M."
Graduate Student,2,"I did not have to take very many online courses but my classes used our online platform, Moodle for scheduling, posting assignments, submitting assignments, etc. and honestly I hated it.  I prefer a face-to-face interaction for teaching and learning not only for the random questions that could arise but also for the insurance of having the question answered.  In my experience with online, 8/10 occurrences were not positive and there were heavy delays or lack of participation or 'classroom environment' that I just didn't like.  I do point out that even though Moodle is used through every course, it is not heavily used in every course so in coming to the UMT, the student's experience is more than likely face-to-face and very interactive."
Freshman,2,"The school buildings were dirty, they never reimbursed for any errors on their part and they double-charged quite a few people. The food was always undercooked and raw. Walking alone at night on campus gets to be scary because there are a lot of homeless people sleeping in the bushes."
Junior,2,"This school has potential, but it doesn't care about its students and has very poor administration. I feel like I am nothing more than a number at this University."
Senior,2,"The experience was pretty good. The professors were excited to be there which helped with the learning experience. The downside to this campus is the parking. If you were enrolled in the spring semester, the snow made it hard to get across the school. The advisors could use a little more experience when designing a schedule for incoming students."
Sophomore,2,"The state is poor and there is no opportunity outside of crappy retail and fast food restaurants. Montanans do not like outsiders. Its hard to meet people here. Missoula is poor with no character. If you enjoy nightlife, there are 3 decent bars (the rest suck). If you arent recreational, you will have nothing to do. Meth is a big problem. Theres homeless everywhere. UMT has a few great programs but its hard to transition into. There just arent enough resources. Instructors are bad about helping students outside of class, or even in class. They seem inconvenienced when students need help. Its like the profs live here so they can go do their granola thing rather trying to teach well. Its a pretty campus and my advisor is the best I have had. Outdoors are great. But the infrastructure, social scene, and entertainment are bad. Winters are VERY long (Oct.-May). Its negative temps. Wildfires in the summer pump smoke into the Missoula “bowl”. June is nice tho!"
Sophomore,2,"I like most about the university of Montana that it's located in the beautiful state and surrounded by mountains. I want to see some changes in this university. 
First of all, University should provide more scholarships for foreign students. Second, of all, they should finance more in education but not in sport."
College Senior,2,It's not really a big deal.
College Junior,2,"I do not have to live in them. Thankfully. Horrible, non-existant parking. Dirty, cramped, poor a/c and heating."
College Junior,2,"Very little is talked about for Greek events, no idea what ones we even have. Live far enough from campus that it's not rowdy. Mostly just sponsor stuff in the sport seasons and do not do tables during orientation."
College Junior,2,"Since I am in a major that is normally for someone trying to become a teacher, it is a lot harder for me to find anyone who can give advice other than just to become a teacher. There are a handful of internships, however, most of them want someone who is majoring in one or the other fields."
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of bad things that go on in the Greek scene at Montana. The guys and girls that are part of it are also usually just here to party and don't seem to pull great grades.
College Freshman,2,Lots of students do drugs with little to no effect on their academics.
College Freshman,2,Greek life doesn't do much for the community here and fundraisers/community service is sparse. Sororities are dry and often very stuck up and judgmental with the exception of Kappa Kappa Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta. The Frats party hard on weekends and from what I hear they get the answer keys to tests so that they can maintain the minimum GPA to stay Greek. Greek life is consistently on parole here.
College Freshman,2,"Diversity is almost non existent, it's a VERY white campus and mostly students from Montana or California. Very few international students, little ethnic diversity."
College Freshman,2,It's a mediocre school and is recognized as such. It'll prepare you for your field but you could definitely do so much better elsewhere.
College Freshman,2,"One professor out of five was relatively decent. The rest were pretty awful. My math professor barely knew what planet he was on though he was a nice enough guy. My chem professor was terrible, my Spanish professor was sweet but clueless about how to teach Americans, my bio professor was just plain crazy and not in a good way. Departments are severely lacking funding to hire enough teachers and provide a variety of classes. Be wary of Gen Eds, most professors won't give a crap and you'll just have to power through a painful semester."
College Freshman,2,"You get what you pay for (it's comparatively a very cheap school). Weird student body, few good professors, ridiculous parking, dorms are livable but a little gross, and the school is in a budget crisis so departments are losing funding fast. The only attractive thing about it is the town, which is wonderful and the hiking is amazing. School wise? Forget it."
College Freshman,2,Many girls on campus do not feel safe
College Freshman,2,Many funds are given to the egotistical football program. The players aren't out of jail long enough to win a championship.
College Sophomore,2,"Im not a partier, I just hang out with friends."
College Sophomore,2,The University is too lenient on their alcohol policy.
College Senior,2,Not to many advertisements for scholarships with the college and when they are advertised they go quick.
College Freshman,2,There is nothing for students who dont want to drink or be around alcohol.  There was nothing for Halloweeen on Campus
College Senior,2,I have had very minimal assistance from the financial aid office and have never received any scholarships.
College Senior,2,"There is too much focus on athletics at this school, there needs to be more attention paid to the college curriculum."
College Senior,2,"UM has a reputation of rapists in our athletic department, primarily the football team. It is a concern."
College Senior,2,"My professors do not meet with  me individually to discuss future career options. I have a good summer job working for the Forest Service, but they will not allow it to count towards my practicum because it is not up to their expectations for tourism."
College Senior,2,Classrooms are overloaded with students and professors do not have enough time to meed with students on an individual basis for feedback. The registration process is completed as a group and is not efficient.
College Junior,2,No real interaction with Greeks
College Sophomore,2,"This is a predominately white campus. There are pockets of international or ethnic students you can find but nothing to brag about in comparison to other schools. Montanans have this ""keep Montana local"" ideology that makes it difficult to be an out of stater sometimes. Montana has a generally low cost of living so students from a privileged financial background are sometimes mocked. I haven't noticed much respect towards women even by college standards, seeing as University of Montana is considered ""the rape capitol of college campuses."" There is also a decent amount of intolerance for gay and lesbian students because of some of the conservative and/or religious backgrounds of some students. Politics is pretty balanced, Missoula being liberal but Montana as a state being generally conservative"
College Student,2,Most students seem like they party and don't care about school so if you are in to that then this is the school for you. If you hate sitting in class next to a hung over college student that can only talk about the parties that happened last night then this is not a campus you want to go to
College Student,2,A lot of sexual assaults and rapes. Not a strong campus police presence
College Student,2,The night life is dangerous here with the highest amount of reported rapes in US.
College Junior,2,"There was a lot of complexes but even more people than rooms. Also, I found it cheaper to live off campus and find a place with friends for a lot cheaper than the University's price."
College Junior,2,"I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE! The only bad part is the cost to live here, transportation, and safety. I would really appreciate if the university could help a girl out by not putting tuition so high."
College Senior,2,"Ethnic diversity is terrible, but there is a lot of diversity of backgrounds (religion, sexual orientation, economic)"
College Freshman,2,The winter is awful. The winter lasts most of the school year but it is amazing in the summer!!
College Freshman,2,I live on campus so my car is always parked but the lots get fill very fast and its hard to find a spot.
College Freshman,2,Too much snow and too cold! It is much harder to get to class.
College Freshman,2,"Dorm life is definitely not something I enjoyed. The rooms are small and cramped, depending on which hall you reside in. The communal restrooms aren't too great, mostly because there are only a few showers and the heat is on 24/7 so going to the bathroom makes you feel like you are visiting a sauna. It is convenient being able to wake up late and still make it to class on time, but there is the problem of obnoxious, inconsiderate neighbors. Social life depends on who you know, somewhat like high school standards, so there are the annoying ""popular"" girls who stick to themselves and somewhat terrorize the ""lesser"" girls, who keep more to themselves. Making new friends in the dorms is almost impossible. "
College Junior,2,I never really noticed anything in relation to this.
College Junior,2,"No nightlife aside from bars. Some house parties, really, not not super hoppin."
College Junior,2,"It's still Montana. I'm white so I can't speak for racial acceptance, but it is a bad place to be a woman. Montana doesn't care that much about us. I'm also a lesbian, but I'm not super open about it so I do ok. Still, when I graduate, I'm moving elsewhere to a more liberal environment because I occasionally feel unsafe."
Recent Alumnus,2,"When talking to friends attending other colleges/universities, I felt that UM was no worse/better than any other campus, in term of drug and alcohol scenes. Personally, I am very against underage and illegal drug-use, so any presence is intolerable in my mind. Therefore, my rating might be harsh, but drugs are present and unfortunately common practice amongst most students. "
College Junior,2,"Parking is terrible. Even if you buy a pass, it is hard to find spots"
College Junior,2,Campus dining was a pain for me when I lived on campus because I suffer from Celiac's disease and a plethora of other food allergies and sensitivities. Finding foods that are safe for me to eat on campus is extremely difficult.
College Junior,2,"It costs 90 dollars per semester for a parking pass, which is relatively cheap (around a dollar a day for parking), but there aren't enough spots. Students are fined if they park near the football stadium during games, which is ridiculous."
College Junior,2,"There are fairly high rates for rape around campus. I've invested in pepper spray for my own safety. The campus police are available to escort people to and from places if they do need it, but the campus police could be more accessible. "
College Freshman,2,There aren't a lot of places that are walking distance from campus but if you have a car there are a lot of good options for whatever you feel like eating.
College Freshman,2,"This school is not very big on sororities and fraternities so there aren't a lot of preppy guys, but there are those certain few that are. I would say that a lot of the guys here are outdoorsy people. They like to hunt, fish, hike and camp, and that's why they came to Montana. Our sports are kind of a big deal here, we have die hard fans, so we have some pretty athletic guys on campus like football and basketball players."
College Freshman,2,"While living in the dorms, the rules are very strict. Quiet hours must be followed or you could get written up by your RA. Parking around campus is also very strict, I have seen so many people get tickets for being parked in the quick stop for too long or for not paying in the hourly pay lots. The campus police are very nice though, at football games they communicate well with the students and only get involved if someone is being way out of hand, otherwise they don't care if students are very drunk and rambunctious. "
College Freshman,2,There have been a few too many sexual assaults on campus in the last year or two. 
College Student,2,"The campus has had a lot of sexual assaults recently, and although they are trying to keep everyone safer, there is only so much they can do.  I don't really feel safe walking alone on campus."
College Junior,2,"I enjoy the program, though I wish there was a more specific direction for forensic science options. Most of the fields offered are medically-directed. Internships are available here, but are very competitive. Work would be better found out of state in larger cities."
College Junior,2,"As a student pursuing forensic science, it is difficult to find direct guidance. The biology degrees offered at the University of Montana are more medically-directed, and it is difficult for me to find both courses that are biology related and informed advisors who can direct me on the right path. Regardless of these hurdles, the courses offered are very in-depth and beneficial to any science student."
College Sophomore,2,"I'd say drinking is way more popular and out in the open at the University of Montana. Drug usage I feel like is a lot more ""hush hush"" and under the radar, even smoking."
College Senior,2,"Missoula claims to be diverse... which is probably true when you consider that it's in Montana.   But in comparison to any other city I've lived it, it is very white and pretty Christian.  There are groups on campus though, I spend a lot of time with the Black Student Union and if you take the right classes, you'll see minorities become the majority."
College Sophomore,2,There are bars for people that are 21. Other than that not a lot.
College Junior,2,"Mainly, they just want you to be safe. Don't be stupid, as in drinking or doing drugs in your dorm room and have a little respect, for your campus and the community at large. The general feeling here, as in other places and for the rest of your life, is 'don't be an asshole'."
College Freshman,2,"I had the worst experience my first semester dealing with financial aid. I accidentally filed something wrong, and they were not helpful and one lady would not listen to a word I had to say. I ended up having to have my parents get involved and everything worked out eventually."
Niche User,1,"I interviewed and got accepted into their cellular and molecular biology PhD program last year. Unfortunately, I could already tell that I really should not accept their offer during the on-campus interview session.
I felt like they were going through funding issues and were very disorganized. To make the matters worse, their research were mediocre and were all working on less popular areas. This can make it hard for us to develop our resume and further pursue careers as an outstanding research scientists in the future.
The only con is that they require students to do TA, but that I think would disturb us from concentrating on research and get publications out. Their classes would continue till the 3rd year, which is even worse due to there would be less time for us to work on research before graduating in 5-6 years (average graduation time for PhD). 
Everything seemed to be joke!"
Senior,1,"It seemed nice until the school showed it's true colors as it's cutting corners tactics resulted in a whole building of students, staff, and young children who attended daycare in the building were exposed to high level of asbestos for years. This school doesn't care about its students, if I could turn back time I would have picked any other school but now I get to spend the rest of my life worried I could develop lung cancer. Seriously don't attend school here, student safety is not a priority for the University of Montana."
Junior,1,"UMT is very unorganized. I had read terrible reviews before deciding to uproot my family from Michigan to Montana, but I chose to ignore them and give it a chance. Since starting classes at UMT, I have witnessed first hand the terrible communication that was detailed in those reviews. I have had countless issues with financial aid, the VET's office, Business services, and advising. Nobody answers emails or gets their job done. If anything, you are responded to with snarky attitude. It is my understanding that the school is in great financial turmoil, and perhaps does not know how to properly allocate what little resources it has. Enrollment numbers are down as well. I had great enthusiasm going into this, but so far it has not been smooth sailing. 
Missoula itself is a great town with a lot to do. The Bitterroot Valley also has a ton to offer. 
As for the University, BUYER BEWARE."
Graduate Student,1,"The University of Montana will constantly surprise you. I bet you didn't know that the leading researchers in carnivore ecology, sexual selection theory, avian aerodynamics, and the physiology of bird flight all hail from U of M. Faculty here at UM are some of the world's leading researchers in their fields. In Montana, of all places!!! In spite of that, it is still Montana, so it comes with its own suite of issues. If you're gay, lesbian or trans, you can expect to be mistreated here. If you're female, a POC, or non-Christian, you shouldn't be surprised when you get assaulted. So unless you're a white male, I would choose a different university."
Senior,1,"This university is absolutely terrible and I beg anyone reading this comment who wants to go to this university to seriously reconsider.You will frequently experience extremely LOUD , AVOIDABLE construction happening right outside your classroom or of the library during ""dead week"".I called to leave a formal complaint and was sent through a run-around of people and was eventually just able to leave a voicemail.I truly cannot express how debilitating this is and most of the time they could have thought ahead and scheduled it for a different time that wouldn't interfere with students learning.Expect to feel unsafe, given the run-around whenever you want something done, overcharged, unappreciated (they just changed graduation ceremony and even though so many people voiced against it all they did was send an email saying we know you are mad, but get over it), and just generally like you're education doesn't matter.Please, please, just go somewhere else and leave this campus to rot."
Niche User,1,"The library is filthy. There is poor ventilation, and dingy old carpet so every floor smells like stale couch farts. On top of that they keep the temperature around 75 degrees and it’s uncomfortably hot all the time.  I included photos of the front area and strongly urge you to go in there if you do a tour. Remember they will not show you the ugly parts of the campus only the nice. There are few comfortable spots to study and most common study spot are these green benches which I found awkward to study at.
My immunology class was held in the Forestry science building and the seats as well as the walls were disgusting. The seats were either broken or had years of stains on them and the walls have oil stains from people’s heads. Both of these things could be easily renovated but have not done despite the tens of thousands of dollars you will pay in tuition each year."
College Senior,1,Our sports teams have bad reputations. That seems to be the only thing that people know about the university.
College Senior,1,"I do not have any faculty support when it comes to a career after college. I have an opportunity with the Forest Service, but my professors do not allow my current seasonal job to count towards my required practicum hours."
College Senior,1,The classes are overloaded with students and professors do not care about helping students obtain good grades.
College Senior,1,Housing in Missoula is highly overpriced. Property management companies charge high fees for applications (student and pet applications) plus additional monthly rent if pets are included. The management companies are also not attentive to renters needs when it comes to maintenance requests.
College Student,1,There is never a place to park! you always have to hunt for a spot.
College Student,1,Parking is horrible and biking to school is dangerous for bikers drivers and pedestrians
College Junior,1,Not a lot of options and it's not the best.
College Junior,1,Missoula is awful at dining options. Food here is subpar.
College Junior,1,"Myself and friends killed ourselves, basically, trying to get finaid."
College Freshman,1,"The greek system is not that big of a deal on this campus. We only have a few of each and not that many people rush each year, so just about everybody who does rush gets in. The Greeks through a lot of parties and usually they only allow greeks in but sometimes they will let the non-greeks in as well."
College Sophomore,1,"There is little help for scholarships or grants. It is -go online and apply.
They are quick to tell you to go somewhere else, not advise you on areas to research yourself."
College Sophomore,1,It is very difficult to get an appointment for career and educational advisement. It is always-go to our website. I like to see someone one on one and get answers.
College Sophomore,1,"Actually I wanted the process to be harder. I am applying for a Media Arts degree and it was solely based on grades. No talent whatsoever. I understand that you need to get good grades, but at least look at my artwork too!"
College Sophomore,1,"Freaking terrible. It costs a lot and spots are hard to find. They also will tow your car during sports games if you do not remove it, to make spots for other people, regardless of the fact that you paid hundreds of dollars to park there with your parking permit."
College Senior,1,"The snow is light in comparison to other places in Montana and the lowest of the temperatures don't last for too long, but the real issue lately that I have noticed is the inversion that happens in the valley. Essentially it is terrible smog that doesn't leave the area and since everyone drives around here it only gets worse on bad inversion days. To be so close to majestic mountains is very nice but when they are hidden behind a haze on a sunny day the majesty can easily be lost."
College Senior,1,"The University of Montana doesn't want to always acknowledge the problems that it has with safety, especially when it comes to the 'student athletes.' It is in my opinion that the town suffers from a 'missing step' syndrome where when I first moved here things had to be explained like 'don't go there you will be beaten up, roofied, raped, etc.' So people had come to expect these things and as things were not being done to fix the problem the solution became to try and avoid places, times, etc."
College Sophomore,1,"Very little diversity, many white people from around Montana and bordering states"
College Freshman,1,"The University network is terrible. No Wi-Fi in dorms or the large lecture halls. Dorm room network bans, well, almost everything - even ping! Zero tolerance policy for student owned wireless routers/access points/switches/etc. High bandwidth, but slow in real world use with pages often failing to load."
College Sophomore,1,"Other than the foreign exchange students, most the people are Caucasian, with middle class economic backgrounds."
College Junior,1,"The parking has always been a weakness of the University, though because of the size of the campus, may not be nearly as bad as a larger school.  The school sells hundreds of parking passes (allowing you to park on campus without getting a ticket) over the amount of actual parking spots and the parking tickets can range from a common $25 to $100+.  One of the worst aspects of the parking is during the winter break when there is only a fraction of the students on campus, they are still ticketing people even when there are hundreds of open spots."
College Freshman,1,"The campus parking is horrible! If your class starts later than 9 am you'd better get there at least half an hour early and you'll probably have to park across campus by the athletic fields. The parking lot adjacent to the building where all my classes are located is full by 8:30 am. On top of that, cars that are in violation of parking rules get boots placed on them and then they sit in the parking lot sometimes for over a week taking up a valuable spot!"
College Sophomore,1,Good luck ever finding a spot unless you're on campus after 2PM
College Freshman,1,"Parking is limited, the permits are a little under 200 dollars a piece, and more often than not parking is hugely inconvenient due to the majority of spots taken up by on campus students. They are quick to enforce the rules here, too, so you will get a ticket if you park in a place requiring a permit without one."
College Sophomore,1,"I honestly have not had any kind of contact with any Greeks in my 3 semesters here. I never looked into joining, and have not ever noticed them. And I party and drink every weekend, which makes it even more surprising that I have not had any contact with any frats or sororities."
College Sophomore,1,"I did not receive any financial aid from UM, and it was making it really hard to pay for school. I didn't want to take out student loans, so I ended up taking a year as a part time student to get residency in Montana. Best decision my wallet and I have ever made."
College Sophomore,1,"Not a Big Presence on Campus – Greek life is lacking at UM. Many fraternities have lost their houses based on alcohol use or not having enough members. There are not very many options for joining a fraternity or sorority, but I have heard wonderful things from the students who choose to pledge."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Good Luck – I received no help. If they don't offer you a scholarship, don't get your hopes up"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Let Me Go Home – Dorm life is going to be bad regardless of which college you go to, but dorm life at UM is a horrendous experience. They often overbook the dorms, leaving kids to sleep on couches in lobbies until someone drops out and makes space. The RAs are two-faced and power-hungry, looking for any opportunity to write you up. Drinking in your dorm room will quickly become the most common and fun activity of your freshman year. Rooms are outdated and lack wi-fi. The campus claims to be tobacco free but you will still see countless people smoking everywhere. Walkways flood once snow melts, leaving you with the choice of soaked or muddy feet. Not a fun place to live"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Missoula is a fun place to live during the summer. And even at that it gets boring after a week.  If you aren't 21 you better get a fake I.D. if you want to have any fun downtown. The Farmers Market that takes place on the weekends in the summer is interesting but only because of the clientele. Once winter hits there is almost nothing to do unless you have the money to hit the slopes every weekend. The common saying around the city is ""Keep Missoula weird"" and they definitely have."
College Freshman,1,"Better to Park Your Car at Home – Because parking is limited, restricted and highly policed, it is better not to bring a car to college if you attend U of M. The proximity to a great public transportation that is free for students aleviates the need for having your own car that you have to find parking for on campus. Parking permits are oversold so odds are very high you will find yourself parking in an restricted or reserved area and receive a ticket, which can prevent you from registering if you ignore it. My first day on campus I received three tickets because I parked incorrectly. Better to park your car at home and take advantage of the stress free life and public transporation."
College Freshman,1,Its Very Cold – It gets very cold and icy. Sometimes you dont want to walk to class because the weather is so bad.
College Freshman,1,The only time you can find a good parking spot is when everybody is leaving for lunch. You can never find a parking spot when you need it. Its better to just keep your car parked.
College Freshman,1,"The majority of students both male and female, are white. As for dress, it seems trashy. Cut off/torn/dirty clothes seem to be the fashion for both male and female. Dreadlocks and other dirty habits can be seen frequently."
College Freshman,1,"Parking it the worst part about UofM. Yes, you can buy a $300 parking pass for campus but its hardly worth it when you can't find spots! You're better off not taking a car up there or utilizing the campus shuttles."
College Freshman,1,"The Biggest Downside – Parking! That makes many people here laugh. In order to get parking as an student, and parking pass must be purchased very early, and the pass doesn't even guarantee you a parking spot! Even my 30 year old co-workers have to get to campus at 8 a.m to compete for parking."
College Freshman,1,"The security here is horrible. THe university has many rules and the current one they started was to be a tobacco free campus, I don't believe I have ever walked on our campus with out being surrounded by people smoking. I have only seen one security vehicle on campus. Usually when you see our campus security they are sitting around eating and do not care what you are doing unless you are harming them."
College Freshman,1,"Fast Food – The only thing that is remotely close to campus, but not on campus are fast food restaurants. Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Taco Bell, and Burger King prey on college kids blindly packing on their ""freshman 15"". It's disgusting."
College Junior,1,"The financial aid process itself is not particularly bad per se, it's easy enough to apply. However, the school has a terrible track record for processing applications and distributing funds. Worse, they jumped in league with a dubious company to manage your money. This company, called OneAccount, pressures students to sign up for a pre-paid credit card scheme instead of getting their refund money in cash. To opt-out of the scheme you are required to wait longer for your money, even though the funds are already coming in to you late, and they force you to send an signed opt-out form via postal mail as well! As if they need such a thing when you are already signed up on their website. Many students have had issues actually getting their cards to work, if they don't opt-out, and there are tricky fees ranging from using atms to view your balance, to inactive account surcharges, that more reputable banks and co-ops would never consider adding. And while there may be a way to request your cash from OneAccount, the University requires that you let them handle your refund instead of opting out of the ordeal in the first place. Oh and if you need cash-in-hand after you agree to accept the card.. well there only option is to pay for the privelege or seek out one of their own ATMS, along with its withdrawal restrictions. So not worth it!"
College Freshman,1,"Dorm life can be a bit crazy. Lots of weed and alcohol busts. Be careful about people who are affiliated with the ""Stoop Kids"". The only perk is that the dorms are really close to your classes. Unless your in Aber. Don't ever live in Aber."
College Freshman,1,"Parking at, or near the University is terrible.  Don't sell the parking spots if you don't have them."
College Senior,1,Very Rough – The financial aid is poor the loan offers are alright.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Drugs Everywhere – This is part of the reason I left UM before graduating.  I had a roommate who had drug dealers coming to our dorm, walking on campus one would always see someone doing drugs of one sort or another.  It was distracting to the academic value of the university."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Don't Expect Much – The Financial Aid Office was for me completely useless. One year they canceled my aid because they confused me with someone else. It took 2 weeks to sort out. Scholarships are not easy to find, nor are people willing to help you. Furthermore, even though I received minimal assistance from my family, the amount of money I was offered in loans made it difficult to afford tuition until I turned 25, when they no longer consider your family income when determining your loan amount. The loans I was offered weren't sufficient to cover the cost of tuition let alone on-campus housing."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The University oversells parking permits, so there is great competition for spaces.  If you live in the dorms, a car isn't as essential due to the proximity of downtown and grocery stores.  If you do have a car and live in the dorms, try not to move your car.  It makes life much much easier.  There is a public transportation system in Missoula, but it seldom runs where and when you want it to, so having a car off-campus is almost a must.  Missoula has a pretty complete bike system, though, and bike parking on campus is seldom an issue.  If you are close, bicycling is really a good (and safe) alternative to driving.  If you live very far off campus and need to drive, however, be sure to get to campus EARLY to get a space. Hunting for a parking space can be a nightmare.  The meter-maids mean business when it comes to ticketting."
College Senior,1,"Not so satisfied. At this point, I feel as though I could do their job a bit more efficiently.  That's overacting though.  I just wish they wouldn't lose documents all of the time.  It's frustrating."
College Junior,1,Smoking Policy – People still smoke right outside of the building; it's annoying.
College Senior,1,"While finding a spot on or off campus is possible depending on the time of day, the management of parking of space is terrible."
College Junior,1,"All About Sports – I feel like my campus is all about sports.  The football team is given an excessive amount of money, and consists of felons cast out from other schools.  The recreation center is nice, which is nice for both students and students who are athletes alike.  However, the Liberal Arts, Music, and science buildings are very 1970s.  Not too mention, they smell funny.  This is disheartening as the University of Montana boasts excellent English, music and science departments.  Maybe the football team should share...."
College Junior,1,"Greek What? Greek life at the University of Montana is pretty bad. Not only is there a low number of Greek students, almost all of them are creepers."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Limited Access to the Aegean – Personally, I found it refreshing to go to school at a place where there is little Greek influence. I spent two years at the University of Kansas that has an overly strong Greek presence and did not like it. I found that they monopolized the social life and ""party scene""; if you will. Montana has a few fraternity and sorority houses, but I could not name them or tell you where they are, nor can I say that I knew anyone who was a member. The most Greek presence I ever saw on campus was the once or twice per semester that a group would table around the Grizzly on the Oval. I loved the Greek presence, or lack thereof at Montana."
College Sophomore,1,"The Police Ignores Anyone Who Plays Sports – Seriously. If you are in athletics the police will let you do whatever you want as far as drinking and drugs go.  If you are the average student drinking or on drugs, prepare to be arrested."
College Senior,1,"Poor and Unfair – The Food Zoo, the main dining hall, lacks both a creative and appealing menu. None of the main line meals are ever good and most students, at least the majority that I know, often complain of feeling sick after eating there. You are offered the choice between two meal plans: an all campus one for around $65 and a smaller one for $45, neither rollover into the following week. I do not know if that is a common practice among all colleges but it comes off as extremely unfair towards students. 

There are other establishments to use your meal plan at but none of them are rather appealing. The Food Court has places like Pizza Hut, two Asian places, Mexican, and a sandwich place. Yet all of them are high in cost and low in quality. There are two smoothie places, one in the UC, one in the gym but they are pricey as well. 

Since you MUST buy a meal plan, I'd recommend the smaller one and save your money for food you enjoy eating."
College Sophomore,1,"No Fun for 21 Under – The bars are huge pastime in Missoula and they're very strict at the door, so, if you're not 21 you're not getting in."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Except for one or two off-the-map spots, parking is almost impossible on campus. Take advantage of Missoula's fantastic bus system (free for students) and get a ride to campus."

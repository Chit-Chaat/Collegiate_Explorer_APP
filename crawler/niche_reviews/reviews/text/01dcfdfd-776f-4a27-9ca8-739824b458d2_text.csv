My first Chef was very experienced and knew exactly what he was doing. My current Chef is also amazing. He speaks a ton of different languages and has 40 plus years of experience. If there were one thing that I could change it would be the school campus hours. I would open Friday through Sunday giving students greater flexibility with their schedules. As is lab schedules are very flexible. You have the ability switch between the morning, afternoon, and evening labs. Just in case you are unable to attend your regular morning class you can choose between the other two time slots to accomodate your schedule for that day."

Niche User,4,"The Culinary Institute LeNotre is a very fun and professional school. All of the Chefs are very knowledgeable and experienced in their field, some even having experience from around the world in hospitality. Most of these Chefs are from France, so the accent is a little hard to understand at times, but they are all really nice and will be willing to repeat themselves and help you if needed. The teachers for academics are also very polite and friendly. The only issue I have had with the school is the financial department. I have had to go back a resign papers several times and a couple of other problems here and there, but overall, the school is a great Culinary Institute!"

Freshman,4,Culinary Institute Lenotre is a great culinary school that offers and teaches culinary arts highlighting french cuisine and technique. The institute is the only french owned culinary school in the U.S and is ranked as the number one culinary school according to Niche. Most if not all the chef instructors are french or have french influence with their skill and technique and all are highly qualified to teach students how to cook. The environment of the school is very relax but also stern which helps the learning process. The school is also very hands on in labs where students can learn baking and pastry or cuisine. The school offers both diplomas and AAS in culinary arts or baking and pastry.

I have completed Cuisine Level 1 and I look forward to the other levels and what the Culinary Institute of Lenotre has in store for me."
Alum,4,"The school has 20 years in the education area so they hire the best chefs to teach and practice, the installations are good; but some of the tools like pans, utensils are too old.
But the experience that you get during the laboratories are the best, he try to replicate the real life in a restaurant so can be prepare when you start working.
it is easy to get a job if you get your dimploma or degree from this school."
Freshman,4,"I love it here, financial aid doesnt aleays know whats going on though, they can never answer your question they ALWAYS have to ask someone else in the department."
Niche User,4,"Administration does a great job of helping out students. Teaching methods of chefs differ, and some don't stick to the recipe book at all, and instead use their own recipes and teaching methods. But it is a good way to learn about the hectic environment of a kitchen."
Sophomore,4,"I had a great experience at Culinary Institute LeNotre. I've met some great people, from the students, to the Chefs and other staff. The program itself for the Culinary side of things is very in depth and you learn a lot along the way. Although I do think there is room for improvement in how we are taught, and there is a lot of work to be done to improve the academic side of the school."
Senior,4,Being a student at the Culinary Institute LeNotre was very good. What i like most was actually having French Chefs to make the experience more real. Getting to try things out of my comfort zone. I would love to see if we get more breaks instead of all year round.
Freshman,4,Amazing school. At Culinary Institute LeNôtre you meet a lot of like minded people. There is nothing that I would really change about my experience so far.
College Junior,4,"At orientation, we were given our schedules. If there wasn't a class time scheduled for us that wasn't a great fit for us, we got to go to our advisors/counselors to get those fixed at orientation. Very helpful."
College Junior,4,"Again, one has to show interest. But overall, students here after graduation have an 88% of finding a job based on the Texas job reviewing for schools."

College Senior,4,"I understand that all students have to go through practicum, where we have a chance to work at a restaurant, bistro etc...  This is how we get experience in the real world.  The school has this service where students will be placed after they complete all classes."
College Senior,4,"Great professors!  I have learned so much since I've been here.   Chefs are very knowledgeable.,  very caring.   I enroll in the afternoon class, and the class ratio is great.   There are about 6, 7 students in my class.  However,  the morning class has too many students, 14,  15 students ."
College Senior,4,"I am enrolling in the Elite program, students learn the French classic way of cooking.  It's very intensive, but I love it."

College Junior,4,"I Feek like the workload is fair. Me personally, I would like to see more work study programs on campus. The facilities are great."
Recent Alumnus,4,Every one was different. Every one brought their own personalities to the table. It was a fun experience.
Recent Alumnus,4,Any time i wanted to look for a job or needed help with finding one there was a Job adviser who helped you either get a job after or during graduation or got you the job
Recent Alumnus,4,Majority of the work was easy i was able to do it in class most of the time and some not so much but all was great
Graduate Student,2,"Completed a Diploma in Patisserie at the school but found it too be outdated, school very disorganised and despite of the advertisement with great chefs as tutors I had horrible instructor, with odd behaviour, showing some sort of mental health issues - this for almost 6 months.

Freshman,2,Not a very helpful thing for people such as myself who are hands on learners. People who need to physically be in a classroom.
Freshman,2,The way things have been handled during this pandemic was very poor and still is looking forward to being that way.
Senior,2,I have been at the school for 2 years now and will probable re enroll. the area is not the best but most of the teachers actually want to see you succeed and go out their way to help you with whatever you need
College Senior,2,"Aside from the fact that my school is based on French cuisine and influence, I really do not think that their are any unique things about it."
College Senior,2,"I have had a good amount of complications with the financial aid department at my school. Everytime I talk to someone, they are never sure about payments, extra fees and such. I have to go back and double check there work."
Alum,1,"The school is very outdated. Most of the chef instructors are not personable people, It's their way or no way. Did not enjoy my 2 years there and would not recommend this school to anyone.  Money money money is all they care about. Word of advice...  watch Anthony Bourdain's video on Culinary school before calling admissions.  You'll be thankful you did!"
Senior,1,Bad no return on investment bad school didn’t like it won’t recommend staff not good teachers get help from students
Graduate Student,1,"An extremely unpleasant program. Do not waste your time or your money at this ""so called"" school. The only thing they care about is getting your money. The chefs in my opinion are very unqualified, the staff for the most part is unprofessional,  and the overall experience I had in the 2 years I was there was a joke. Please, please, please look around and take your money and your cooking passions elsewhere. Trust me, you'll be thankful you did!"
College Senior,1,"The library is completely outdated, there isn't enough resources for projects. The isn't any school spirit or excitement to continue going to this school, only once it has your money you are stuck to continue while being unhappy."

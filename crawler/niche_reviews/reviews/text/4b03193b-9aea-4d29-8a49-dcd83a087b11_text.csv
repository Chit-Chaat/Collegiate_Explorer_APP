Niche User,5,I took no classes at this school because I am only a sophomore in high school... ... I do be bored a lot tho...
Freshman,5,"Great campus atmosphere..Excelenct professors and personnel.

A lot of activities for the communers.. 

Love it"
Freshman,5,"Very competive the program..face to face with the professor and students.

Also a lot of work...same as we were in the campus"
Sophomore,5,"I love Seton Hill University from the small school environment to the friendly people. I'm so glad that I chose to attend the University not only for those reasons, but for many others."
Sophomore,5,I really love seton hill everyone is so happy to help and everyone is so friendly. I would like to see the professors have more understanding of the importance of sports because not all of them let students leave without giving them problems. I know classes are important but in some cases that is how students are paying for college in the first place.
Sophomore,5,"It is amazing! The school is fantastic, the professors care about the students and about getting them internships and jobs. The coaches are caring and take care of the  team!"
Freshman,5,I just completed my first semester at Seton Hill University. This school has been an excellent school so far. The teachers have been eager to help with assignments and to teach in general. The dorm halls are kept tidy and organized. The faculty is very nice and willing to give help if you need it. Overall it has been a great semester here and I am looking forward to the next one.
Niche User,5,"Seton Hill is a very beautiful University that I would like to attend in the near future. It is full of life, and once I stepped on the campus, I knew that I belonged there and could achieve my dreams and goals there."
Freshman,5,"I love being at Seton Hill, the community is so welcoming and there are so many different opportunities for everyone to get involved in."
Freshman,5,"Although I have only been here a month I have really enjoyed the campus and the classes I am taking.  Its a friendly atmosphere, with caring and helpful professors; personally recommend to any students that prefer smaller class sizes, a quiet, and laid back campus."
Sophomore,5,"Seton Hill is truly an amazing place to be and I get excited to go back every summer. The staff is amazing and knows most students, and are always willing to go out of their way to help out."
Niche User,5,"As an adult returning to college after many years, I found Seton Hill welcoming and encouraging. I would recommend Seton Hill for any adult returning to complete their degree."
Senior,5,"I owe a lot to Seton Hill University.  Of all the campuses I toured, Seton Hill was the friendliest and most helpful and the most eager to see me succeed.  The campus life probably isn't for everyone since the party scene is fairly poor and the buildings themselves are extremely old (though beautiful), but as someone who wasn't bothered by these things, it was a perfect fit."
Sophomore,5,"Overall I have had a good experience at Seton Hill University. I am studying Exercise Science and a member of the men's soccer team and have loved every moment on campus. I come from a small town in rural West Virginia and knew I wanted to go to a small school outside a big city. The atmosphere at Seton Hill University is different than anything I have been a part of before. The student diversity is from all over the world, and the students and faculty are really bring into making an impact in the community to help us want to help our communities back home and where ever we go after we graduate and make an impact on the world."
Freshman,5,"I loved how much there is to do on campus. Also, you can easily start a new club for anything you want. All of the students on campus are extremely friendly and welcoming. The professors truly care about you and want to see you succeed. At Seton Hill, you are given a individualized experience and are not just another one of thousands of students. I wish all of the dorms had A/C and did not how to take so many classes outside of those required for my major ."
Sophomore,5,Seton Hill is a very small and quaint school.  The professors are all so helpful and kind to work with.  I would highly recommend Seton Hill to anyone who is interested in a small university
Sophomore,5,I love it! Its a smaller university but the people there are all very welcoming and it isn't hard to make friends. The school has a great view of the town and the town itself is very nice. While some might be bored from time to time it isn't hard to find things to do.
Niche User,5,I loved Seton Hill the second I stepped foot on it. It has a great family atmosphere and I would not change anything about this university.
Niche User,5,I loved visiting here. It was a beautiful campus and I felt like I could really fit in with the people around me there.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school. From the minute I took a tour, I felt so welcomed and loved and I was still a high school senior. It is expensive but the education you are receiving is worth every penny. The Office of Residence Life works so hard to make the campus fun and lively for it's students. The sports team are so rigorous and dedicated to both the classroom and the field. There are parties that happen off campus so it doesn't interfere with those who dislike them. The class sizes are not very big which makes it the ideal learning experience and the professors actually know your name and will say hello to you in the halls. I highly recommend looking into this wonderful university. The only way is up!"
Freshman,5,"It's a fantastic liberal arts school an amazing staff and student body. I feel so welcome here. The community here is fantastic I feel at home while receiving a wonderful, well rounded education."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy every aspect about SHU. The faculty are great, the staff is really nice, the people are great, and overall it's a great place. The only thingI would change is that it is a bit small, but I don't mind it because it's very personal."
Sophomore,5,"I love seton hill. The arts program is wonderful. I’m being molded and guided by such well educated, talented, open minded humans and I’m very lucky to have such a great education experience."
Freshman,5,Seton Hill University is an excellent and well respected school for academics. Our school just ranked in the top 50 in 2019 as one of the Best Regional Universities in the North.
Graduate Student,5,I enjoyed being a student at SHU and hope to carry the knowledge that I learned into the my next chapter of life.
Freshman,5,"This upcoming fall I will be a freshman. Although I have not started my life at Seton Hill yet, many people have mentioned how they loved the university. I am looking forward to my years at Seton Hill University and cannot wait to see what the future holds."
Junior,5,My experience with Seton Hill University was very  excellent. The people on Seton Hill campus are very nice and welcoming making it a friendly environment to be in. You get an Ipad and a Macbook computer making your learning experience on the campus very efficient. Being around the historic buildings and just being on the campus in general is a privilege because it is just an awesome place to be around. The teachers here want to see you succeed and are very helpful to students across the campus. Students of Seton Hill are great in supporting the athletics here and make it great to be a Griffin.
Freshman,5,"I like the school and there is a wide variety of majors and minors. There are many classes and the professors are warm and friendly. It seems as though the professors love to teach and want their students to succeed. They provide open doors for anyone that needs help or even someone to talk to. They have many different resources, like advisors, a career center, a writing center, counselors, a nurse, tutors and they also work along side Blackburn center."
Freshman,5,"Seton Hill University is a one of a kind school. The four pillars (serving, celebrating, welcoming, and learning), are truly what this place is about. The minute you step on campus, you feel safe, welcomed, and celebrated."
Sophomore,5,"Professors = Incredible
Food = Best of any college in PA 
People = Wonderful diverse and accepting
Academics = Broad, challenging, but worth it
Return on investment? Definitely."
Freshman,5,"This school is amazing. Many I believe that even in my first semester I have grown as a person and will continue to grow these next four years. The people are amazing, and the school feels like home. It is disappointing when I have to leave."
Sophomore,5,"Great for small college atmosphere but also very diverse. Small town feel, the teachers really care about you and want to see you succeed."
Freshman,5,My experience with Seton Hill was always good. The people here are very nice and care about you. The professors will have smaller classes because of that professors will want to know you personally and build trust with their students. Not only are the professors nice so are the other students at the school. Everyone always says hi or hello or thank you to each other. You feel welcomed at the school.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Seton Hill University is that it isn't your ordinary college. The atmosphere is friendly and fun, and there is never any reason to feel alone here. Seton Hill teaches us it's fundamentals of connecting and learning within the first hour of being there. I enjoy my professors in the music department, and love how they teach. This school would be more fun if it were a bit bigger, but then again I wouldn't change that about it. The fact that it is a smaller school allows you to have more one on one time with your professors that you may desperately need or want. If the school were bigger, there wouldn't be a friendly attitude and overall love around the campus. I really wouldn't change anything about Seton Hill, I like it the way it is."
Freshman,5,"I love the entire atmosphere of the campus. The faculty and students are all very welcoming. The campus is small and cozy, perfect for a student coming from a small, rural high school. There are many opportunities to get involved on campus whether it be through sports, intramural, or clubs and organizations. Overall my experience at Seton Hill has been wonderful and I would recommend other students to go there."
Freshman,5,"My University is a very welcoming community. Everyone is friendly, you connect with the professors, and you get to network immediately. As an Education major, we immediately get put into the field to gain experience. Seton Hill University is more than just a college, it is my home.   "
College Freshman,5,"I love the classes and the professors. The professors care so much about each of us; I can go to them with literally whatever problems I've been having and they will offer advice or help. The classes are small which allows for a personal relationship with the professors, and to establish study groups with the students around you."
College Freshman,5,I believe my school is very safe. I have never felt unsafe while on campus.
College Freshman,5,My school was the perfect fit for me and I love almost everything about it.
College Freshman,5,There are so many way that students can begin their careers with help from people at Seton Hill.
College Freshman,5,I love my school so much and they have amazing faculty working there. My training is going very well and I have met some of my best friends there.
College Sophomore,5,"I find it a lot easier having smaller courses!! I recieve more one on one time with the professor and it is easy to work with other classmates. Since seton hill is a liberal arts school it is required to take a variety of classes on top of major classes! So we have to take religion, govt., fine arts, philosophy, and many more!!!"
College Sophomore,5,"I love my campus, professors, and peers!! It feels like home every day I'm here because everyone says hi even if you don't know them and it's just a really friendly safe environment! And I feel like I'm recieving the best education I possibly can!"
College Sophomore,5,this place is great. the teachers care and the people are kind.
College Sophomore,5,i have been here for two years and wouldn't change a thing.
College Junior,5,GREAT school if education is your primary concern!! The teachers are absolutely amazing and will help you and challenge you in ways you never imagined they would. The courses are also very good. Technology is implemented daily and you always learn something new!
College Freshman,5,I feel really safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,The Career Center on Campus is very helpful when it comes to getting a job or internship.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love Seton Hill! I feel so at home and everyone is so nice! It was really easy to settle into the swing of things. The professors are really passionate about the subjects they teach; it makes me get excited to learn! GO Weekend (Griffin Orientation Weekend) was definitely my favorite experience; there was so much to do and I met tons of new people.
College Freshman,5,Professors are great. Many majors offered.
College Freshman,5,Tiny campus which the state police often drive through just because it's part of their route. The state police barracks are close. Emergency buttons all over the place.
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone at Seton Hill is very welcoming and helpful. The campus provides a peaceful, light mood enviroment. if you have a question just about anything, they staff and faculty do what they can to help you find the answer."
College Sophomore,5,There are many restaurants surrounding the school.
College Sophomore,5,"Seton Hill is fairly strict with most topics, especially ones involving the wellness of students. The only complaint would be parking and how students that live on campus sometimes park closer to the buildings and the commuters have a hard time finding spots."
College Junior,5,"Great campus life style, needs more food choices"
College Sophomore,5,"I am a business marketing major, and I LOVE my program.  The professors are wonderful and very helpful!  Most of them have had real life experience with Fortune 500 companies and are very knowledgeable.  The workload is rigorous but we do lots of hand on applications and have speakers visit often."
College Sophomore,5,"We have numerous ""college town"" shops and restaurants.  There is a great little cafe called The White Rabbit that everyone goes too! SHU students get a 10-15% discount when they show their student id."
College Freshman,5,"I couldn't be happier with my decision to go to Seton Hill. I love the campus atmosphere and it is absolutely beautiful. My school is so unique from just driving onto campus.  The driveway is lined with the most beautiful trees and when you walk into the chapel on campus, your breath in taken away.  The education that I am getting is awesome and I couldn't be happier with my major and the program that they have here for it.  My favorite experience on campus is the Christmas on Hill dance and for every holiday the campus is decorated all out!"
College Freshman,5,I love the small class sizes and the professors are very helpful.  It feels good to be a student in a class where the teacher knows your name.  There is such a wide variety of classes offered on campus that will fit your major or minor.  We are also a liberal arts school so I enjoy taking the required classes that I would've never thought to take on my own.  It helps you learn about the world and prepares you for when you graduate.
College Freshman,5,"A degree from this school is of high value. So many graduates find jobs and internships with the help of Seton Hill and its education.  The alumni network is amazing and shows there support often on campus and at events.  There are job fairs on campus that employers will come to recruit which is a great opportunity to meet people and get your foot in the door.  The career center/services are always eager to help you with anything you need, from help with your resume to mock interviews and finding internships, it is an excellent place to get the help you need."
Freshman,4,"I went to Seton Hill for one semester. 
I enjoyed my time but found that the school was a bit too far from my home. 
Although I enjoyed, there of course were some things wrong with the school as is with any school.
One that was very difficult for me to understand was that they told me on the tour that our campus food was some of the best. I often struggled to find food that I liked for meals and found myself eating the same meals multiple days in a row.
I also was frustrated because, they only showed me the nicer of the dorms and I was put into the one they don't show you. That building only had 4 functioning washing machines and four functioning dryers. The wifi was always off and on. You didn't know which days it would cooperate with you. They also had low functioning AC and heat so when weather began to get crazy, I had to have a fan going 24/7.
I enjoyed the staff on campus and everyone I interacted with was very nice and the PAC staff are wonderful people!"
Freshman,4,I was put into quarantine my last 2 weeks of the semester. All of my professors were very helpful in getting me all of the materials i needed and were missing at the time. They helped me to not fall behind during this time.
Senior,4,"Fun as graphic design major, but the students definitely seem to have a stronger connection to their studies than to each other, so it's been difficult to make friends as a transfer student. Financial aid office is not always the most helpful, and they are probably doing the best that they can, but as a student it can be frustrating to experience."
Freshman,4,"Online schooling is very convenient and the professors are workable and understanding of complications. With obtaining a MacBook, SHU makes online schooling very convenient."
Senior,4,"The main thing that I loved about my time at Seton Hill University was the tight-knit community. It is a small school, so you get to know so many people. Sporting events are always well supported by students, faculty, and staff. The only thing that I would say is that the town is not your typical ""college town."" The city of Greensburg has a few hidden gems, and seems to be up and coming."
Freshman,4,I love my school it is just a little more expensive that I was hoping for when looking for colleges.
Junior,4,"For the most part, all of my professors have been very supportive. I love the small school environment and the fact that my professors all know me personally, and being familiar with a lot of the people in my classes is nice. I didn't have a great experience living in the dorms, but I'm much happier at my off-campus apartment now."
Junior,4,"Seton Hill University does everything they can to give back to their community.  The food is delicious, and the professors are excellent and want their students to succeed.  The new housing policy makes it a lot more expensive to attend school here, and they should offer more scholarships."
Freshman,4,I am currently slotted to start at Seton Hill this fall. I am going to play football for their team. Their football staff is amazing so I am hopeful that the professors and campus life is equally as good.
Sophomore,4,"Seton Hill is a smaller school, yet it is able to provide most of the academic amenities of larger schools. I have heard the on-campus living is a bit rough, but as I live of campus, I haven't had to deal with that.  I did have some issues with registration at one point, but it seemed to be a big misunderstanding so I don't hold it against them. Overall it is a quality academic experience, if not a bit overpriced especially related to the on campus activities and living."
Sophomore,4,"The campus itself is on the smaller side, which is great for people like me that don't want to feel as if they are in a large setting. The teachers are able to speak to us students one on one, which is great, because the class sizes are between 25 and 30 students. The overall atmosphere that surrounds The Hill is lovely, everything around is enjoyable and the people are very welcoming."
Junior,4,"I like that Seton Hill is a very small and close to downtown Greensburg. I do not like that the accounting major is going to be exclusively online in the future. There MBA in accounting is already online. In addition, their tuition keeps being raised every year without the scholarships being raised as well."
Junior,4,"College that is not too small or too large for students. Offers great opportunities to join clubs , be part of events and utilize all of their options from tutoring, computer help as well as offering traveling abroad. Great athletic programs and scholarship opportunities"
Junior,4,I enjoy the close-knit community of Seton Hill University. Everyone always says hello! I also enjoy the faculty and other campus workers. Everyone is invested in your academic and professional success. It feels like one large family and everyone is always rooting for each other.
Freshman,4,"Seton Hill is a rigorous school that rewards its students with rich opportunities for career and personal development.  It's abounding with engaging and intelligent professors who value their students' success.  There isn't as much of a social scene as one might find at a larger school; however, many students at this school are academically driven and, thus, spend much of their time working.  In my experience, the intimate friendships that form allow one to fulfill all of their social needs.  The food--or rather, the dining staff--is perhaps the single greatest part of this school.  They are extremely accommodating of any dietary restrictions or allergies.  Additionally, ANY student is able to walk directly into the kitchen and ask for something specific to be prepared if they can't find anything in the cafeteria that they would like to eat."
Sophomore,4,"The overall environment of the campus is very welcoming and comforting. I felt like I had found the right place for me when I had only been there for a few weeks. The people are kind and caring. The campus itself is extremely beautiful with the original buildings. While the price is a little high, almost all of the students receive some amount of scholarship money."
Sophomore,4,A somewhat academically stringent private Catholic school. It has great theology programs but lacking in philosophy. Most of the people I have met are here either for PA or therapy. A well renowned music school.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere. It always feels ""homey"" there. The professors are always helpful. I have had professors from previous semesters help with an assignment from the current semester. Everybody is pretty easy to contact. There is always a quiet place to get work done when needed too."
Sophomore,4,"I had transferred to Seton Hill from Carlow University, and I believe it is much better. I appreciate the students and professors who are engaged in class and concerned with students' lives. It is a great environment to be in."
Senior,4,"Great professors, fantastic environment. Small classrooms allow for close relationships with professors. People are generally very nice. Must seek out experiences doing research work- very little opportunity for lab experience if you aren't biology/pre-med."
Senior,4,Seton Hill has fantastic professors and staff! They are extremely accommodating and helpful in academic personal aspects of college.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love Seton Hill University. It is a quiet campus where everybody can truly get to know each other. The campus also has many activities and clubs that get students involved. While the campus can seem a bit small at times, the city of Greensburg has many places for students to spend free time and relax."
Senior,4,I choose Seton Hill because they have a program for adults who work and the classes are on Saturdays. One day a week from 8am to 4pm. This fit my schedule perfectly. I did not have to rearrange my schedule with work.
Junior,4,"I visited Seton Hill University during my high school senior year.  My visit included overnight lodging, meals, but most importantly inclusion in several classes I was interested in taking.  I decided this was the place I wanted to obtain my degree.  While I spent four semesters at community college, all of my credits transferred to Seton Hill.  My advisers have been very helpful in making decisions to class schedule and career choices.  This is an older campus with great atmosphere.  It was very to transition from community college to university.   I plan on obtaining an Art Education degree and am taking full advantage of a three year old arts building which contains not only art studios, but studios for dance.  I would strongly advise anybody to include Seton Hill University on their must see."
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at Seton Hill University and my first semester was complicated in aspects that were out of my hands but Seton Hill did their absolute best to help me with almond everything they could and made me feel welcomed as well.
Sophomore,4,Seton Hill University is a beautiful small campus with some of the kindest staff you could ever meet. Dorms may not be the best the community feeling makes up for it.
Freshman,4,"Seton Hill is a very good university. It is a very small school, but you are able to connect with professors and faculty very easily. My first semester has been really great! There is not much to do in the immediate area, but if you drive for a few minutes there are things to do!"
Niche User,4,I loved the buildings and the beautiful campus but the dorms were not that nice and dirty. I like the teacher to student ratio letting me be able to see my professor more easily.
Sophomore,4,"As a Sophomore at the University, I have seen a lot of change and a lot of people. The brand new cafe is great, as well as the athletic fields. I play softball here at the university, and the new field is amazing. All the people are a party and a half, and the diversity is a great atmosphere. Seton Hill looks like Hogwarts, and I love the feel. My family is Disney and Harry Potter fanatic, so it makes me feel like I'm right at home when I get home sick. I love the place and it feels just like home to me now."
Freshman,4,"The moment I made my way up the tree-lined driveway to Seton Hill, I knew this was going to be home. The welcoming atmosphere and kind people made me realize how close and special this college is."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love Seton Hill University. At the beginning of my freshman year I was concerned that this wasn't the place for me but now I have no doubt in my mind that this is where I should be. Because it is a small school, you are able to develop better relationships with your professors. These relationships are important when you need extra help, a reference, or even simple advice. The environment is very nice because it is close to Downtown Greensburg and Downtown Pittsburgh, but it remains secluded on the hill. There are many lounges and quiet places on campus to go study or just get out of your dorm. There are also endless resources and activities to help you accomplish nearly anything you want. Being involved in certain clubs has allowed me to extend my learning beyond the classroom as well as network with peers, professors, and professionals."
Alum,4,I really enjoyed the Seton Hill environment. The individuals who work there make the campus seem open and a lot like home. Everyone there cares for one another. My biggest problem with this school was the fact they tip toe around big issues like money. They also weren't very straightforward concerning the program I wanted to transfer into.
College Junior,4,It's a great school. I like going to class. My professors are all fun and easy to understand.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very helpful and having a liberal arts curriculum is beneficial.
College Sophomore,4,"I think the campus is pretty diverse, and people are generally accepting of everyone's differences."
College Sophomore,4,Athletics are a huge part of the school and many students are athletes. Many students also attend games.
College Sophomore,4,"The majority of the professors truly care about their students and are willing to help. It helps that the class sizes are small, so professors and students can get to know each other better."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus. I have never felt uncomfortable walking around campus at night, and was never worried about people stealing my stuff when I left my backpack unattended to go to the bathroom."
College Sophomore,4,"Within my major, the career prospects are really strong."
College Sophomore,4,"The teachers are great, as are the students!"
College Freshman,4,living on campus is great. made a lot of long time friends already
College Freshman,4,I am not an athlete so i am answering these questions as a student who watches games.  Athletics are a big part of our school but it is hard to attend some games because of my intense major
College Freshman,4,"For typical freshman housing it is pretty nice and totally livable. I am, however, looking forward to living in a suite next year!"
College Freshman,4,"I am not involved in athletics, but the people that are really seem to enjoy the programs."
College Sophomore,4,I feel that we are somewhat understaffed but they are always ready to help when it is needed!!
College Sophomore,4,I haven't personally experienced the carrer center yet because I am a sophomore but my friend who have have all found jobs and internships!!! My advisers constantly send us internship opportunities as well!!!
College Sophomore,4,Dorms are very nice on campus!!! They are clean and close to campus so it's easy to get to and from class! I haven't had any probables with my dorm experience!!
College Sophomore,4,good health facility and good support for those who have disabilities
College Sophomore,4,i really expect seton hill to prepare me for further education
College Freshman,4,"It""s very adoptable. Feels very comfortable. A suggestion is carpet in the two freshman dorms."
College Freshman,4,Academically it's a great student to teacher ratio which is great for my way of learning
College Junior,4,There is really no crime besides occasional theft. Everyone seems to be safe and feel safe. We have security on campus. The dorms are not accessible unless you have an ID card and live there. I feel very safe.
College Junior,4,I feel like I will definitely be able to get a job but I'm not sure how good of a job it will be.
College Junior,4,"Everyone is very friendly (although there are some very immature and obnoxious students) and willing to help when they can. The registrar, admissions, financial aid, student government, etc., everyone is easy to reach and willing to do what they can for you. I would probably choose this school again because it is close to home and I am receiving a great, technology-based education."
College Junior,4,Never had a problem with feeling safe and secure. Never had my safety compromised or jeopardized.
College Freshman,4,The professors are great and so was the registration process. The workload isn't too bad depending on the major.
College Freshman,4,All of the teachers are really helpful and passionate with their teaching. The courses are good in terms of variety.
College Freshman,4,I love the housing minus my noisy neighbors.
College Freshman,4,The athletes are really nice and everyone gets excited for the games and such. Most of the campus comes out to watch the games!
College Freshman,4,"Ok, I commute. Only on campus for classes"
Freshman,2,"Seton Hill, while the campus is very nice and inviting is a terrible school when thinking about the pricing. With no notability or diverse opportunities, you would not be getting a good investment. Also a lot of racially charged student and upper faculty."
Freshman,2,"Professors are nice, but if you are a resident don’t plan on bringing your car here. There’s virtually no parking and if there is you’ll have to walk a bit to it. So if you ever get a job here, have fun. They will ticket you for any reason they can find just to get some more money out of you. The dorms are always so hot because the buildings are super old. The only building that has central air is the honors building, Farrell. You can bring an air conditioner but you have to have a medical form to get it installed. Honestly I’m really sad that this is the only campus that had my specific undergrad degree because if they didn’t, I would definitely not come here. The students here are also really stuck up, so if you’re shy you will not make any friends."
College Freshman,2,"Campus housing is pretty bad. It's extremely overpriced, small, and the RAs really do not do much rule enforcing. The noise level in some of the freshman dorms is ridiculous, and it makes for a very poor study environment."
College Junior,2,I have really been strugglnig to find an internship and with a degree from a nobody college wont help.
College Junior,2,The housing rules and conditions are terrible especially in main building. The lottery is impossible and it's so easy to get screwed.
College Junior,2,The amount of racist encounters I have experienced at this university is unacceptable.
College Sophomore,2,"Very clique-ish. An athletes vs. non-athletes atmosphere. Absolutely nothing to do off campus and the little things they do provide on campus nobody goes to. Absolutely zero school spirit. The guys at this school are inappropriate and openly watch porn. Ironic considering it's a Roman Catholic school. It's a joke. Save time and money and literally go ANYWHERE but here. Even if you're an athlete (like myself), you still don't get treated any better which is what they pride themselves on. PLEASE PLEASE don't waste your time here. academics is a joke here too. I couldn't even tell you what I learned my first year. I think my IQ has dropped since attending here."
College Junior,2,"The Hill is a dry campus so unless you find a party in the dorm (which is dangerous) there aren't any visible parties on campus. Some students who live off of campus throw parties, especially those who live in sports houses and theater houses."
College Sophomore,2,"Sometimes it doesn't feel like I'm in College. With so much restrictions, I feel like I'm in a boarding school."
College Student,2,"Typical PA weather, one day you can wear short and then the next you have to wear your winter jacket."
College Freshman,2,"Seton Hill claims to have a lot of diversity. That is very false.

The majority of students are white.

The second biggest majority is African American.

And then occasionally you'll find someone from a different country. But rarely. These people are often recruited to play sports."
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do here. SHU constantly brags about how much they have going on every night. And it's almost true, they plan a variety of things every week. However, these activities are usually blatantly stupid, no one shows up and no one interacts with each other. At orientation, they made freshman participate in all these horrid activities that you might make middle schoolers engage in, that did nothing but piss off every student. 

We're located about a mile up the hill from the downtown area. There are plenty of tiny stores, but unless you want to spend the entire day or every day buying useless boutique items, homemade candies, and omelets, there's nothing else for you to do. If you want to go to the mall or the movies, you need a car to get there. 

SHU doesn't have a football field, so home games are played at the local high school. For some reason, the school doesn't offer transportation there unless you're on the team or band/cheerleading. What? It's too far to walk!

There are basketball and baseball games held on campus. I think lacrosse as well, but they're never advertised well and the outcome usually isn't very big.

Students are… generally not social! This came as a huge surprise to me. I have tried talking to people randomly, and everyone seems to just kind of shrug you off. Let's face it- if you didn't make friends at the beginning of the semester (like me. ugh.) you won't get them later. People are cliquey."
College Freshman,2,"The only option is the SHUttle around campus. It sucks! It is supposed to pick up students walking and transport them to different stops. (Especially in bad weather) It NEVER does, just drives around empty. What's the point???"
College Sophomore,2,Very few people attend sports. The only people who do either really love the sport or have a friend on the team. Or they're friends of a band member.
College Freshman,2,"The Campus Shuttle is okay, but it only goes to three places--the SHUVAC, the SHUPAC, and another area that I can't remember right now (it's very recent). Great for going to classes off of the hill, but terrible for going literally anywhere else--besides a few tiny overpriced shops, Greensburg's Shopping District doesn't hold much appeal. We have a bus and taxi system, but they both suck--they're very expensive and don't run often."
College Junior,2,good luck finding a parking space!
College Junior,2,Good luck getting places without your own car. Even the local transport is kindof a joke
College Freshman,2,"There are some very anti-college student laws and attitudes pertaining to apartments. It's very hard to find a place to live that a student can afford, a landlord is willing to rent to a student ""who parties all the time"" and is close enough to SHU (which, I might mention again, is at the top of a flipping hill). It's really not worth the effort."
College Junior,2,Our sports teams are a joke. The fans literally go just to throw tomatoes.
College Junior,2,"Its greensburg, for goddsakes! If you want some excitement, you have to drive for over an hour to Pittsburgh"
College Freshman,2,"We live on top of a giant hill with very few restaurants within walking distance. However, many restaurants--mostly pizza and chinese places--deliver, so that's nice. Other than that, any formal restaurant is too far away to go to without a car and the public transportation in Greensburg is spotty at best."
College Junior,2,Its sooo expensive they just want you to live on campus
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid is horrible. The school itself is so expensive also so it's rough
College Sophomore,2,We don't really have one so it's hard to rate this. There's only one on campus and it's for honors and hard to get into.
College Freshman,2,Not many things to choose from and some of the food isn't healthy and fresh.
College Freshman,2,Most major requirements offered every 2 years.
College Freshman,2,"Most professors are okay, some are better."
College Freshman,2,Aramark; same meals every week.
College Freshman,2,"Not enough parking spaces, lot frequently closed."
College Freshman,2,There's a reason only 69% of freshmen stay.
College Freshman,2,"If I stayed, I wouldn't graduate in 4 years."
College Freshman,2,Most major classes offered every two years.
College Junior,2,"I was a student at the college I will be transferring to in the Spring of 2014, so the program I am currently t was not a success for me. If I go back I would have just stayed put. I want to eventually enter the medical field and get my Master's, my priority goal is earning my degree and seeing my parents proud of me!"
College Sophomore,2,the cafeteria food could be more variatized and could be hotter then how they serve it. the cove food( which is our fast food restaurant) is worth spending your meals.
College Freshman,2,The food around campus isn't the best and the food you find on campus isn't that great. Your best bet is to either order out or make your own.
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do on the weekends. Honestly you have to find your own fun or go out to Pittsburgh.
College Sophomore,2,"About seventy percent of men at Seton Hill University are jocks who never go to class and are an absolute headache to deal with, however, there are about thirty percent of men that are nice normal guys (some jocks too) who work hard in their studies and are just genuine people. You can avoid the idiots pretty easily by populating areas such as the library or the performing arts center, and avoid areas like The Cove (late night snack bar area)."
College Sophomore,2,"If you are truly in need of financial aid, Seton Hill will try to help you. However, they can be a bit crabby and you have to keep on them. You must take an aggressive stance to get your money, you cannot be passive or they will do the bare minimum necessary to help you. There's a lot of unnecessary busywork and paperwork involved, but if you keep pushing through, they will eventually give you what you need."
Recent Alumnus,2,Greensburg has laws about where students may live off-campus. Landlords  must register and pay a fee to rent to students and each student house must be at least 500ft from the nearest one. Parking can be difficult because most of the street parking is by permit only and it is hard to get more than one permit per house even if there are multiple students living there. The cost is reasonable although landlords are charging more because of the hassle of renting to students. There are also some apartment buildings just outside of the city limits but within two miles of campus which are exempt from the requirements and have become popular with students.
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall has a few good meals, but usually they cook something that tastes horrible. The other option is the cove & everything is over priced & everything I've ever ate there has made me sick afterwards."
Senior,1,"Only go here if you have the time to stay more than four years and can financially pay for this school.  Registrar makes sure your financial aid gets screwed up every chance they get so you either can't afford to come back, or have to get a last minute high interest loan.  Every person I know that goes here, including myself, have had issues with advisors mistakenly forgetting to tell you that you either forgot to take a class and it went under their radar, or tell you you are on track to graduate on time but last minutely tell you you cannot."
Senior,1,"Professors are hard to get in contact with you, most of the time you have to add the dean of their program into your email for them to get back to you.  Zoom classes are not too bad, but are super easy and a joke compared to actual in person classes. Half of the time the professors do not even show up for their  zoom office hours, so they do not help you."
Freshman,1,"I would like to see a change in the housing area. When I was looking for a place to live, my group of 4 got split up and put in all different places. Some of us were in our single rooms and others were in the freshman dorms."
Sophomore,1,The only good thing about Seton Hill is the students who attend. I would not recommend this University to anybody. Very unorganized and the registrar/admissions offices are terrible at doing their job. If you decide on this University don’t expect to want to stay a full four years.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek life at seton hill
College Junior,1,"Very bad housing options. 6 people to a room in some dorms with one bathroom, or a whole floor shares a bathroom. Very old housing options. The heat does not work most of the time."
College Junior,1,"Since we do have Greek life at our school, many students result to joining at different campuses."
College Sophomore,1,No night life here. We're lucky if one of the sport teams throws a house party.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek Life at this institution. It is a Catholic University.
College Student,1,The people are rude and not really there to help you. They sometimes make life harder and school more stressful!
College Freshman,1,"SHU does not offer any assistance in finding off-campus housing.

You're on your own!"
College Freshman,1,It is a completely dry campus. If you want to find a party- you better meet people who live off campus.
College Junior,1,Hard to find any in a small town w/o transportation and the student services suck
College Freshman,1,I am 18 years old I do not go to bars.
College Freshman,1,Most places do not rent to students. School unhelpful.
College Freshman,1,The off-campus shuttle makes 2 stops... sometimes.
College Freshman,1,Most storefronts are empty and boarded up.
College Freshman,1,"No one leaves campus, there's no downtown."
College Junior,1,"Off-Campus housing is impossible!  I figured I'd find out why... at city hall.  There's that 500 foot from closest corner to closest corner, then if more than 1 student is in a home and not with immediate family it's considered student housing.  If the property doesn't have the student housing permit and inspection, the landlord is slapped with a $8,000 fine per student/incident.  Will I get kicked out? Crazy!  The school's great but, if I find off campus I'm going to jump on it before someone takes if from me!"
College Junior,1,"I planned on living off campus, couldn't find anywhere to explore. No website or newspaper listings. Ended up having to live in the dreadful dorms on campus."

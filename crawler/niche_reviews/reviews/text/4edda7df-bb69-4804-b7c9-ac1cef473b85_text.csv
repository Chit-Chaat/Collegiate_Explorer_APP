Alum,5,"I was lucky to have super friendly, motivated, and encouraging professors. I met a lot of interesting people including students, professors and other staff members. The community was always supportive and colaborative."
Graduate Student,5,"From the very beginning, the application process every person I spoke to was super helpful and extremely kind.  Their programs are great and flexible for the working student.  I would highly recommend Simmons University, hands down!  It’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made!"
Graduate Student,5,"All of my courses are done online for their FNP program until my Clinical's.  That makes it super flexible for me to be able to still work and continue my education.  Being a young widowed mother of twins,  I still need to be able to provide for my boys.  This program absolutely allows me that flexibility.  The Professors are approachable and easy to talk to.  I can’t say enough about this program!"
Alum,5,"I graduated in May, 2019 with a Bachelor of Arts in Women's and Gender Studies and a Minor in Public Policy. Simmons was the perfect place for me to discover my potential, both academically as well as professionally. I made friends by being a member of the Simmons University Dance Company, and by working in the Office of Undergraduate Advising as a Student Academic Mentor. The director of my Public Policy program suggested I apply for the University's Barbara Lee Family Foundation Fellowship Program, which would allow me to work at the Massachusetts State Legislature. I was accepted, and spent my senior year working in the office of Senator Harriette L. Chandler. Because of Simmons, I have the ability to take my career wherever I want."
Alum,5,Amazing school! The nursing program is wonderful and the online faculty are truly dedicated to teaching you exactly what you need to be well prepared to enter into practice.
Junior,5,I loved Simmons College beyond words. I immediately fell in love with Boston and the community. I have made quality friendships and had opportunities like no other.
Junior,5,Good school with caring professors and opportunities to do research and get jobs on and outside of campus.
Alum,5,"Beautiful Campus. Close-knit community. Located in a great area of Boston...go Sox! Near many of the top hospitals in the country which is great for med/nursing students who want to volunteer, do clinicals, etc!"
Graduate Student,5,Simmons has been an amazing college and very informative. The faculty have assisted me whenever I have questions and the professors are amazing!
Niche User,5,"Incredible campus, historical, amazing student life. Staff is great. Simmons offers many opportunities to it's students and goes above and beyond to accommodate them and their families."
Sophomore,5,"I liked that Simmons is a small campus because it is easy to get to know professors and you don’t have to worry about being late for classes if you’re in another building. Overall the school provides many opportunities for research, internships, and other connections. Although I feel the Nursing and PT program get the most funding, the sciences also are fortunate to have amazing professors and a wonderful location for jobs."
Freshman,5,"Simmons is great because there is a community for everyone. However, don't be fooled about what the institution tells you about diversity. It's not diverse, but both the students and faculty are working on to make that change."
Alum,5,"Simmons College is a welcoming and beautiful school. Their campus is a easy to follow layout in the city of Boston. Not only is Simmons striving to be a clean and resourceful school, but they have succeeded in forming a totally eco-friendly economics building, sitting in the center of their campus. Their students are welcoming and friendly with the incoming students, anyone would gladly show you the ways of the school with no problem. The library on campus is open all hours of the day, with complete access to the in- library textbooks as a way to save students money and back pain."
Niche User,5,I enjoyed visiting and I really wanna spend my college life here! Everyone is so nice and welcoming there and I felt at home!
Graduate Student,5,"I'm in Simmons online Social Work program, and I love it. The professors I've had have all been very knowledgable about the course material and excited to present it to class. I've had fabulous classmates who are just as interested in learning as I am. Class sizes are small, so people don't get overlooked and professors are able to help out individual students. Overall, I would recommend this program to anyone who has the resources to participate in it."
Sophomore,5,"I love Simmons, it honestly feels more like home than my actual home. Simmons is perfect for anyone that wants a small school but still wants to explore the city and live in beautiful Boston. I am honestly disappointed with all the other students that rated Simmons anything less than 4 stars. Some things with Simmons are a little below average, but it's also a VERY small school. Considering how small Simmons, it is AMAZING. Simmons isn't a party school because it's a prestigious and well-endowed school that can't have their students getting in trouble. BUT that doesn't mean you can't have a little get together in your dorm and drink, as long as you don't go screaming around campus. Also, you're in the middle of Boston, it is super easy to find fun people. Also, all of Simmons faculty give 110% when it comes to student. Even when we had that shooting scare, a cafe worker ran OUTSIDE to call students into the building and keep them safe. Simmons is amazing and definitely worth it."
Sophomore,5,i love the community so much. everyone is so supportive. financial aid office sucks tho tbh and they
Sophomore,5,"They give you a lot of resources a big school can not offer. The location is amazing and allows you to have a quiet night in your dorm or go out to the bars or other schools and party all night. The academics are interesting, challenge me, and allow me to succeed in them. Admissions is nice with scholarship money. I have found my home here."
Graduate Student,5,I loved this college. This college trulls sets their students up for success. The classes were easily accessible and the material was beneficial in completing a degree in social work. The professors were also always available and really cared about their students.
Freshman,5,I love my time at Simmons. I had met some great alumni and students. Due to its small tight-knit community connecting with alumni is enjoyable and easy.
Sophomore,5,Simmons has been going through a lot of changes recently and it is an exciting things. All of these changes makes it feel that my investment in education is worth it :)
Freshman,5,My time at Simmons has been a great one so far. The school has a nice relaxing atmosphere plus its in Boston so it is easy to go around places. Students can take classes in the Colleges of the Fenway (you will be missed Wheelock). Could do some more work on diversity.
Junior,5,"A cool little school, with cool professors, in a cool city. 
I love Simmons and its community.
The food needs some work though"
Junior,5,I love all of my professors in Simmons. The location in Boston is also great and I love the Simmons community
Freshman,5,"Overall very good. Great professors, students, and staff. Great community. 
Love the city of Boston and its location as well. Target, Star Market, etc... Everything is accessible around the campus."
Freshman,5,"Simmons is a great school if you are interested in learning, many opportunities in the city of Boston and from professors . Pretty Gay and open-minded."
Sophomore,5,"The community at Simmons is worthwhile to the College's experience: #WhoIsMaryBurke, the meme page, etc... And since the community is strong, the alumni network is also very dedicated to their alumna matter. 
One of the best women's colleges in America and in America's greatest college town. The school also takes advantage of the city of Boston itself: the Boston course, Isabella Gardener Museum, the MFA, and learning service.
The party scene on campus isn't large, however there are easy alternatives options such as frat parties from MIT or the machine. 
The professors are very knowledgeable and by word of mouth from the community you will know whose classes you should take. The professor overall do want you to succeed, so make the most out of your Simmons experience."
Freshman,5,"Simmons has been great to me so far, great location, faculty, students and academics. The women centered atmosphere is incredible and I can't recommend it enough."
Freshman,5,"I do not attend Simmons, but I got accepted there. Simmons is a phenomenal  school and has plenty of opportunities for its students."
Graduate Student,5,Simmons has been an excellent experience. I am taking grad classes online and the professors are easy to communicate with when help is needed. I feel like I am learning a lot in my degree area because their lessons are designed to provide a type of learning that is hands-on.
Alum,5,I love my time at Simmons.  Classes were small and professors cared. Dorm life was great. I’ve made friends for life and I graduated with a great job.
Freshman,5,"I love being a part of a women centered college! Simmons is a wonderful place for people who want small classes with lots of participation. The service learning projects give you the chance to do things in the Boston community that can be applied to future jobs and give you wonderful experiences. It is a small school so that limits some of what is available but the Colleges of the Fenway partnership of the colleges in the area gives students plenty of classes and activities to do right around the corner. You also can not beat the location, right in the heart of Fenway you have a wonderful area surrounding the school. As well as the T to get you any where else you might want to go."
Sophomore,5,"Simmons is located in the Fenway area of Boston. It has top notch professors who are always there to help. There are lots of athletic teams to get involved with. Alumni is very involved with networking for jobs and internships. The campus is beautiful. The dorms are basic and food isn't the greatest but the location, academics and athletics make up for it."
Freshman,5,"Simmons is a fantastic learning environment with professors that truly care about the students. Although some see the all-women environment as odd, it is really a great place to learn."
College Freshman,5,Simmons has a great reputation and a lot of connections in getting you a job.
College Freshman,5,Professors are awesome. They really care about your success and will really work with you. They accommodate everyone's learning styles and prepare you for exams. They always host/set up study groups and tutoring.
College Freshman,5,Our campus is very safe. The gates on Res campus look after 11 and everyone needs to swipe in. Campus police are everywhere and will do anything to help. Lots of education on being safe on campus and in the city is provided.
College Freshman,5,My hall is very clean and includes a very nice lounge area with a big tv and couches. Some floors have a full kitchen with cooking supplies to use. The dorm rooms are very spacious and bigger/nicer than most other schools.
College Freshman,5,"I love Simmons! Best choice I have made so far! Professors are very helpful and really care about your success. There's a real sense of community and the campus is very pretty. The location is awesome, there's always something to do!"
College Freshman,5,"So many people who have a degree from here are very successful, I am happy with my choice."
College Freshman,5,"So many people who have a degree from here are very successful, I am happy with my choice."
College Freshman,5,"I feel extremely safe on campus. Even when I have to walk to class, I see campus police all the time."
College Freshman,5,"I love my dorm, South Hall triple. Very Happy, AC and heat are provide."
College Freshman,5,My professors are so approachable and actually encourage it. They love when I have questions about class and homework and that I had the courage to ask. The teaching is very much interactive. The professors are involved in student organizations and events.
College Junior,5,Simmons is rated as one of the top nursing schools in the country.  It's location and it's clinical opportunities are outstanding.
College Freshman,5,"So far Simmons has been an amazing experience. I love the atmosphere, the support from professors and faculty, the beautiful campus and location (Boston is the best!!), and overall how accomodating the school is to everyone and their needs. I feel so connected with all of the girls and staff at my school and have never felt so welcome anywhere else. I could not imagine myself going anywhere else."
College Freshman,5,"We have awesome campus security and safety. Due to it being an all girls' college, Simmons dorms, residence quad, and bathrooms all feel much safer in general as many times there are no men in our buildings. Simmons is very much a dry campus so if you are looking to go out, it's easy to do so, but there is not much drugs or alcohol on campus. Campus security is great."
College Junior,5,Simmons has been a great experience so far!
College Junior,5,Campus is very safe overall. We get notifications if something is going on in the area.
College Junior,5,The overall experience at Simmons has been great!
College Sophomore,5,Class size is great. Professors are great.
College Sophomore,5,A nursing degree from Simmons is the best
College Sophomore,5,"I have so much love and pride for Simmons College. All of my professors have been absolutely amazing and I have learned so much in just two semesters. It is expensive, but you get what you pay for."
College Sophomore,5,We have really helpful and friendly officers who are there when you need it. You can catch them everywhere on campus
College Freshman,5,Can't wait to start school!
College Freshman,5,I have been very impressed with the academics on campus. The professors know their fields and the classes are both engaging and challenging.
College Freshman,5,I have not seen any drugs on campus while at Simmons. I have seen students smoke outside of the Residential Campus and Academic Campus but this is to be expected at all institutions.
College Sophomore,5,"I love the career and internship workshops that they have. In terms of resources there are so many people available to help students in any domain. the librarians are incredible as well when it comes to research. The teachers are there to help outside of the classroom and additionally there is a great academic advising team, the tutoring center. Every month there are many activities and events that they do to help students relieve stress, cope with new changes, educate them on taking care of themselves etc. I love my school!"
College Junior,5,"Many teachers at the school I work at are Simmons grads, which is a strong reason why I came here."
College Junior,5,The course work is suitable for my field of work and I believe it is preparing me to be an educator.  The class sizes are a good size and the professors are excellent.
Sophomore,4,"The switch to online learning was difficult in the Spring of 2020, but the professors were extremely understanding and offered a lot of leeway. However, for the 2020-2021 year, they froze tuition but took away scholarships that were awarded to students that previously formed. Obviously this isn't an option at this time, so a lot of people are having a difficult time affording this next year due to this scholarship being taken away."
Alum,4,A team of good professionals are always capable of adjusting to challenges and turning those challenges into new opportunities and areas to grow. The Simmons University does this!
Senior,4,I have never taken an online class at Simmons but the online graduate program seems to be very well designed and most undergraduate professors are very capable of utilizing online components for their classes.
Senior,4,"Simmons has institutional issues that come with any higher ed entity, but the student body is deeply passionate about advocacy and change. I've grown tremendously over my four years with them. Students are driven, smart and passionate about justice."
Junior,4,"Professors were very caring and understanding with deadlines and exams. It was a hard transition, but I was definitely able to keep up and passed with flying colors."
Junior,4,"Simmons is a school where if you put in work you get an equal amount of return. You have to take initiative and all lot of people here are not willing to do that, so they hate it. However, it is so easy to succeed here, you just need to put in effort, whether that is going to events, visiting teachers, joining student government, etc. The teachers are great and really care about you. The students are survivable. Food is edible. Living quarters are livable. It is an average school, but it has it's own charms. Tucked in an amazing location, I really reccomend Simmons if you are love Boston. It's a small school, take advantage of it. If you are a partier, do not worry NEU, Colleges of the Fenway, Boston University are so close. You get out what you make of it. A great learning lesson to prepare you for real life."
Freshman,4,"I would like to see more diversity in the student population at Simmons. Also, the food options can be expanded since I know students who dont eat food because of food accommodations."
Senior,4,"I thought my undergraduate education was very good. I learned a lot from intelligent professors and my program was well funded and well put together. I believe the Nutrition program here at Simmons along with being a student athlete was well worth the time here. The food here has gotten better over the past 4 years. However, lots of improvement needs to take place."
Niche User,4,My daughter has been going to Simmons for 3 years. Overall she has had a very good experience and you can’t beat the location. She will be graduating on time and has already networked a few offers. The cost is high. Hope the value is as advertised.
Graduate Student,4,"I am currently attending Simmons University's online program for my Master's of Social Work. When I was first accepted for a spot in their program, I was very impressed by their communication and how many members of their staff reached out to me in case I needed support. I also love how the program is clinically focused and prepares me to apply what we learn in the classroom in my life and career as a social worker. I think something that they could work on is changing up what we do in  class each session. Sometim"
Freshman,4,"I like being a part of my school's gymnastics team. As a commuter student, it's difficult to balance academia and a social life. However, it helps being part of a supportive team and I made some good friends since I started college."
Junior,4,Academics are great. I've loved all my professors. The social aspect is not great. Most students are really focused on school.
Freshman,4,"People are very friendly here and the staff are always happy to help with any difficulties . The workload and course difficulty is just enough to challenge you to learn. The campus is located in an area with access to many restaurants, stores, and transportation which is convenient. However, the dining options on campus can be repetitive and bland. There also isn't a lot of diversity in the student population."
Sophomore,4,"Simmons is a small college with big university benefits. The professors are incredible, and the classes offered for students are very tailored and unique to the population of the school. Apart from the incredible academics, you can't beat the location of the university. You can never be bored attending Simmons. For areas of improvement, I know that many students do not feel heard by administration, or that their concerns are dismissed once they are brought up to a higher level within the college. Many students are also fearing the cost of Simmons. Although many have fantastic scholarships, the college itself is still very hard to afford."
Junior,4,"Simmons University has one of the best nursing programs in the country. It prides itself on educating their students about diversity and inclusion and is a great women-centered school. It is smaller in size, but is located in the heart of Fenway - nothing is too far away. Surrounding the school are the other Colleges of the Fenway like Emmanuel, Wentworth, and MassArt. Even though it's a women centered school, there is no shortage of college students in the area. There aren't typically parties on campus, but that makes sleeping quieter and there are colleges surrounding us that have parties if you want to go."
Sophomore,4,"Simmons is a great school to go to and actually increase your knowledge. Campus life and the party scene are not the best aspects of Simmons, but if you find the right people and make the most of living in Boston it is a pretty good place to be."
Alum,4,"Simmons College changed my life and provided me opportunities that might be harder to find at other schools. Each class I took throughout the various departments challenged me and re-wired my way of thinking in the world. The Department of Public Health, which I belonged to, provided me many opportunities to do my own research and also helped me land my job once I graduated. I made life-long friends and life-long professors and Simmons was the best place for me."
Senior,4,Great and fun school. One of the top 10 women's colleges in the United States. Enjoyed my time at Simmons. A unique college experience compared to the traditional co-ed one
Junior,4,Small class size really allow you to interact with your professor and have a larger understanding of your major. Lots of opportunities in Boston for internships. A great school for a well-rounded education for the arts & sciences as well as professional programs.
Freshman,4,Simmons is challenging but worth it. Full of students who want to succeed and are passionate. Boston is a great location as well.
Sophomore,4,"Simmons is a great school. I think that it is underrated and a lot of changes are happening around the campus which is exciting to see. 
Had great experiences with professors and staff at Bartol.
The location of the campus is great as well. There is always something to do during the weekends.
Academically challenging and there are always opportunities from professors or the city of Boston itself. 
PLAN is alright, needs improvements."
Sophomore,4,I like the professors and how many opportunities I was given as a freshman.  Simmons has challenged me academically and has given me all the resources I need to succeed.
Freshman,4,"I love Simmons. I wish there was more to do, and I wish there were different admins, #whoIsMaryBurke but it’s a great community.  Wayyyy too liberal bubbly. Wish there was more a dissuasion."
Freshman,4,"Simmons college is a fun and exciting campus! A big bonus of Simmons is how inclusive that they are. There is always an activity, club, or organization for each and every student from all walks of life. It is also a totally pressure free campus meaning that you can be free to be whoever you are."
Freshman,4,"Simmons prides itself on Diversity, although there is very little at the actual school. Professors are typically very available, and seem to care a lot about the students. It feels like a very safe environment, and is in a really great location."
Graduate Student,4,"The Nursing@Simmons program is, by no means easy.  Do not make the mistake of thinking there will be an easy road because it's online.  I would rather work hard and pass the board 1st time out than to coast through and get all A's but struggle to enter the profession due to inability to pass boards.  

The professors are responsive to questions (for the most part).  Make sure you ask all the questions BEFORE entering the program!  It is EXPENSIVE.  But I don't regret the investment!"
Graduate Student,4,The online Nursing program is outstanding. Great professor's and curriculum.  Great program with clinical placememt for Family Nurse Practitioner students.
Sophomore,4,"It's not as bad as people think, but it definitely seems to be quite unique when compared to the college experiences of my friends from home. Being a women-centered college in the middle of a major city is pretty cool, because the academic environment is completely unique but I have the opportunity to meet people from all the other near by colleges."
Sophomore,4,"Simmons is a great school academically. There is a lack of diversity however in the community, but there is a strong sense of kinship between people of color on campus. The food is ok and the dining system is in the middle of changes, making it harder for some to eat on the academic campus. The resident campus looks very nice, however the dorm rooms are very small. The staff on the resident dining hall is fantastic."
Freshman,4,The class sizes are not massive so students have an opportunity to get to know their professors. The campus is small but has plenty of room for you spread out.
Senior,4,"The school is really small which means you get to know a lot of other students that attend as well as the professors that teach there. Often times you have the same professor more than once which really sets you up to know the expectations of the professor and therefore perform better in that class. The alums at Simmons are also incredible resources to all students that attend. All different majors have networking dinners each year where they bring in alums because the alums are notorious for helping current students get jobs and internships. Simmons has also created great relationships with many different businesses around Boston such as Brown Brothers Harriman that make a Simmons student more likely to get jobs there upon graduation. Overall, Simmons helps you obtain many incredible opportunities for internships and jobs."
Junior,4,"Simmons is a good school for any health-related field. not very diverse (60% are girls from Maine going to their parents' on the weekend). Not a party school. The area is nice though, so if you are looking to get experience at the hospitals/research centers, it might be a good choice. Food sucks, but you will get used to it."
Freshman,4,"Simmons is my dream school. Dedicated professors content with their jobs, a comfortable living situation, a beautiful campus, variety in curriculum and a strong program in my major. I couldn't be happier with this school, save for the high cost of tuition."
Freshman,4,"Simmons is an women's center college located in Boston! The community in Simmons is different compared to a co-ed higher learning institution! PLAN is alright, I thought the Simmons Explore part of PLAN was a waste of time, but the Boston Course is amazing. However some might have different views on the Boston Course. I really like the Boston Course because the class easily introduce me to the city with the few field trips we have. Which was very helpful for me, not being from Massachusetts. 
There is a lot to do and participate in and the classes are not that overwhelming. 
The students are very accepting for the most part! Republicans are a minority though so be watch out!
Not much of a party scene within the campus, but you can attend parties at other colleges if you know the right people. We also have Machine nearby with +18 nights on Fridays.
However, I feel that Simmons needs room for improvement which is why I give 4 stars."
Freshman,4,"The location of Simmons College couldn't be better! At first i was hesitant to go to a women's centered school, but after completing my first semester, i absolutely love the school and know it was the right choice for me. The classes aren't unbearably difficult, and I've made some really great friends.  Biggest recommendation- tour the school, do an interview before applying, and go to office hours/tutoring once you're in college. Wonderful school- I am very happy"
Sophomore,4,"Simmons is one of the most welcoming and empowering universities out there. The location is perfect for thriving minds with world renown medical facilities all around the area. The Nursing and PT programs are hard to apply into, but once in, the hard work pays off."
Freshman,4,"I like the homie feel, and split campus with a 5 minute walk from res to academic. It's nice separation. It is a very open atmosphere and many voices are heard."
College Freshman,4,"Simmons is a D3 school, but students who do sports enjoy them. There are nice fields and a great gym for students to use."
College Junior,4,As a nursing student my academics are already mapped out.  The professors are very knowledgeable and are willing to help us succeed.  The nursing courses are challenging  and are preparing me for my future.
College Junior,4,We have security on our and Emmanuel's campus and the emergency blue lights
College Junior,4,I am on the field hockey team and use the gym to workout in every day.
College Junior,4,I like my classes and I feel I am learning a lot.
College Freshman,4,"Job/internship prospects are great, if you really work with advisors and professors it is easy to find a quality internship or job in Boston, and to make connections. The alumni network is also very extensive and involved, and love finding Simmons recruits. The career center is also excellent and always willing to help students. Overall, Simmons isn't yet a well known school, however it has so many resources and people willing to help you if you put in the effort to take advantage of the opportunities available."
College Freshman,4,"Campus housing is awesome because all Simmons students live on the same res campus, and our dining hall is on res campus! The rooms are average dorm size and have a big, beautiful window that let a lot of sunshine and light in, making the room feel bigger. The rooms and dorms are very clean and the halls and lounges are spacious and updated! The quad in the residence campus is beautiful and so fun to study and just hang with friends at. It's also super convenient having the dining hall and athletic facility right next to my dorm. I also feel extremely safe on campus, always!"
College Freshman,4,"Athletics at Simmons are not the most important to students as we are a Division III school, however a lot of students enjoy participating in various intramurals and team sports at Simmons and at other schools in the Colleges of the Fenway consortium as a way to meet friends and stay active. The athletic facilities at Simmons are awesome and open to everyone, including students from other Colleges of the Fenway. Overall, team perfomance is not always the best, but teams are always very happy and supportive of one another."
College Freshman,4,"Immediately upon first meeting Simmons faculty and current students, I felt so welcomed and comfortable. Every staff member and professor truly wants all students to succeed and work hard to reach their full potential. Instead of being competitive with one another, all of the students treat each other as family. It is the most supportive and nurturing environment, open to anyone of any race, ethnicity, and sexuality. Everyone can be their true selves at Simmons. It is so easy to see why Simmons Alumni are so successful."
College Junior,4,Strict policies on drugs and alcohol.
College Junior,4,Application process went very smoothly.
College Junior,4,I heard from other people who live on campus that housing is great!
College Junior,4,Simmons College has great pride in their athletic teams!
College Sophomore,4,"For the most part, I've mostly been focus on academics since I was a transfer student so I haven't really checked out the sports facility."
College Sophomore,4,Simmons is very accepting and try to encourage everyone to work hard towards their goals
College Sophomore,4,Didnt really pay attention to sports
College Sophomore,4,The alumni network at Simmons is really strong. That was one of the main factors as to why I picked Simmons.
College Sophomore,4,"Our Res campus has gates that close at 11 every night and the only way on campus from then until 6 am is through a security office. Only people with Simmons students are allowed on campus. Walking between the campuses late at night can sometimes be scary, but you can call public safety and they will escort you to the other campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Simmons is different then other schools. The education here is great especially for students in the medical field. The campus is great because you are in the middle of Boston. There are so many opportunities to be taken advantage of. However, if you are looking for the normal ""college experience"" of partying on campus or tons of activities then Simmons is not the school for you. You can easily go off campus and experience which is why I love Simmons."
College Freshman,4,"Some people argue that Simmons is not a diverse campus. I think its very diverse in a number of factors, especially in religious, socioeconomic class, and sexual orientation. Although Simmons has students from all across the world, the majority of students are still from the New England Area."
College Junior,4,From what I have seen and heard it is good. The school has a good reputation even if it can be frustrating at times.
College Junior,4,The professors are passionate about the topics. Some could use some pointers on how to actually teach and be diverse in different learning styles.
College Junior,4,Every school has ups and downs. For the most part it has been good. I feel I am getting an education and building skills.
Senior,2,"Simmons is not very good for commuter students. The environment at Simmons is very unwelcoming, especially for people of color. The tuition is way too overpriced for what you get. The food on campus is also overpriced, and awful at that. Some of the professors are great, but most of them waste your money."
Senior,2,"Ehh forces you to take pointless classes on things you're not interested in. Pushes a super liberal agenda down everyones throats and completely ignores the fact that people may have differing opinions. No openness to differences. 

Nursing program is great though :)"
Senior,2,"This college is not for students of color, students with disabilities, or the LGBTQIA community. Our college priorities appearances over student support and our public safety office is not equipped to handle any kind of emergency as demonstrated last Thursday."
Sophomore,2,I loved the academics. What needs to improve is the atmosphere at Simmons College. It is not very diverse.
Freshman,2,"The OSLA office at Simmons does a good job of working with their budget to provide students with activities and treats at the beginning and end of the semester.  They also plan events to try and get their students involved. However, one thing that was very disappointing was how they made it sound like there were tons of clubs, but I came to realize that the majority were for LGBTQ, POC, and religious people. While I support these and think its great especially because there isn't a large POC population at simmons, there aren't a ton of options for me. In addition, the staff is very unaccommodating, has been known to not give help for students with disabilities, and advisors are just teachers that have no experience with advising and do not care to help, often not responding to your emails or concerns."
Freshman,2,Teachers don't seem like they know what they are doing. I am not paying $56k per year to have crappy teachers. 
College Sophomore,2,Simmons is too small to be expensive as it is.
College Senior,2,I have never heard of anyone going to a sports game if they were not already on the team.
College Freshman,2,There is no party scene at Simmons.
College Junior,2,"There are no in room kitchen like many other schools offer. Also, suites are mainly just for seniors. The price you pay to live in a two person room with a communal bathroom is the same price as renting a very nice apartment."
College Freshman,2,"Never any parties here, some parties at Harvard/MIT/Northeastern. Legal nightlife is only fun if you're 21. Nothing much else to do at night, otherwise."
College Freshman,2,"Simmons has no parties, and girls go off campus to party."
College Freshman,2,"Off-campus housing is bad in the sense that you are paying for way more than what you get.  Boston is an expensive city to live in, so even a tiny apartment will be more than it would be in another location.  The pros are that you save money by living off campus, and you will most likely be close to shops that you will use, but the cost is very high."
College Freshman,2,"I don't imagine myself ever living off campus simply because the cost is extremely high and the distance to campus isn't all that great. Most students who live off-campus are in the Mission Hill area, which isn't terribly far, but not terribly close either. I think that it's more cost-efficient to tough it out and live on-campus in the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"It is SO difficult to eat a healthy diet in the dining halls. I feel like I get the same food every single day from the Fens because there's rarely any changes to what's offered. The salad bar there also runs out of essentials a lot -- how am I supposed to have a salad without any lettuce? Bartol is just as bad; the food is barely cooked, and it's really difficult to find food that I feel safe eating -- I'm constantly worried about getting sick! Gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options are hard to come by, too."
College Freshman,2,Bartol is not good. I found a hair in my food once.
College Freshman,2,"Very small, but that's the city for ya. Almost impossible to get a single until senior year, unless you have medical problems."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot of support or advertisement for the events. Unless previously involved, there is little interest or access to these programs."
College Sophomore,2,Boring and generally pretty quiet. The girls in the undergraduate program tend not to be too crazy on the weekends.
Recent Alumnus,2,People like arts and crafts and movie marathons more than they like parties here. It works for them though.
College Freshman,2,Parking in the city in general is terrible. It's usually difficult to find a parking spot that doesn't cost you any money. The school has a parking garage but in order to park there you need a parking permit and it's not cheap at all. It's best to take public transportation to campus. But if you really need to drive to school then by all means get the expensive parking permit. 
College Freshman,2,"The cost. Living in the city is extremely expensive, and you're getting charged at a minimum $1000/month, and absolutely no parking. The perk is you'll live close to public transportation. But Simmons guarantees housing for students, so it's much more worthwhile to live on campus."
College Freshman,2,"You can park on academic campus in the garage, but if you don't validate (and being honest, it's difficult for parents to validate without students help), you'll be charged $50."
College Freshman,2,"There are no real parties here. Which is fine if parties aren't your thing. There are a lot of sports bars in our area because it's so close to Fenway, but those are busy, and sometimes you can't get any service if you're under 21. On Friday nights, the gay club ""Machine"" is 18+, which can be fun. Otherwise, look to go to BU, Northeastern, or Berklee for parties. Make sure they're within walking distance too, because the T shuts down around 12:30 on weekends."
College Sophomore,2,We only have two dining halls and both only have select options when it comes to dining
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are small and it's very difficult to get into the ""nicer"" housing. We don't have suite-style living until junior or senior year, and we aren't offered any apartment style living like most other schools"
College Sophomore,2,As a transfer student there is a maximum  scholarship that you can get that is very low. Financial aid is very hard to come by.
College Sophomore,2,This school is not very diverse at all. If you are looking for diversity this school is not for you.. :(
College Sophomore,2,There are no guys on campus since it is an all girls school. 
College Freshman,2,The printing prices sucks because we are already paying so much for tuition
College Freshman,2,"I go to an all girls school, so everyone has their own style and sense of humor"
College Senior,2,"I was very disappointed in my interaction with Financial Aid.  Emails went unanswered, it was like pulling teeth to get answers to my questions and I was left to really fend for myself when it came to figuring out how to get my full package."
College Sophomore,2,Very homogenous. It is a lot of the same kind of people everywhere without much diversity. 
College Freshman,2,Our school is in the middle of Boston so it is very hard to find parking. Most people use public transportation.
College Freshman,2,"Its a small enough school that you can tell who does what. security on campus is more concerned about your safety than they the use. however because it is part of there job if you have a joint, or alchohol in your hand they do enforce you dump it out and your get written up. On the flip side you can be noticably drunk and they'll drive you home and put you to bed no questions asked and it's a nice gesture of them."
College Freshman,2,Nothing really goes on at Simmons College for nightlife per say. We do host many activities and small events at Quadside. There are no boys at Simmons so to meet any boy you have to go out and meet them somewhere else. The Colleges of the Fenway do allow you to cross-register classes if you want to.
College Sophomore,2,Simmons is a small school and does not have any transportation. It wouldn't hurt to have transportation between residence campus and academic campus but it is not a very far walk.
College Senior,2,"Moving off campus never seemed worth it to me, considering how much money you can pay for a crappy apartment. Maybe people are okay with that, but I much prefer living on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Apparently we had a mild winter this year...it got into the teens during the day at the coldest and it's currently may and it's still hovering in the 50s.  The fall, however, was spectacular.  Very warm."
College Freshman,2,"Not Diverse – Coming from Atlanta, I was shocked to discover that many of the students here are from rural, primarily white parts of new england and felt that moving to boston was a 'culture shock' because of the diversity.  This blew me away, because Boston is probably one of the whitest placed I've ever been.  There are a lot of white people running around who are so afraid of BEING racist that they in turn ARE racist."
Niche User,1,I have little to say about the online learning experience considering that the online courses I took were emergency bandaid measures.
Niche User,1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AT THIS SCHOOL. There is nothing for you unless you're a nursing or PT major. The administration doesn't care about what the students actually need or want, especially when it comes to students and staff of color. The president is paid 670,000 dollars a year but the school laid off their dining staff (who are mostly Black and brown) during a pandemic with no pay. The PLAN and KCAs are a ludicrous waste of time. The dorms are falling apart and the place is full of rats. The student body is cold and cliquey. You'll pay 60,000 a year but won't be able to access basic mental health services. Absolutely not worth the piles of money you'd waste and the lifelong debt you'll accrue."
Sophomore,1,"If you are considering Simmons University, DO NOT come here unless you are in nursing or PT. The academics are subpar and facilities are lacking. Each year too many students are accepted, and the required courses take up so much time that many students have to do an extra semester or year. They have terrible financial aid, there are rats and cockroaches everywhere (including the kitchens), and the student body is unbelievably homogenous. It has the least responsive, least supportive administration and the disabilities office is a joke. No one takes part in the few extracurriculars available, and everyone is cold and unwelcoming. The only good part of Simmons is the academic advisors (who will help you transfer out of this hellhole), the adjunct professors, and the incredibly kind food services/facility staff. Don't come here, and if you are here, get out while you can."
Freshman,1,"this school is awful unless you want to be a nurse. they do not care about their students especially the students of color and pride themselves on being ""diverse"" but have no real understanding of what that means. none of their promises were met and when I addressed some of the issues I had faced as a student of color nothing was done because the school is so white they are unable to actually see a lot of the racial issues but they made no effort to gain that perspective. academics are boring and a lot of the classes are useless. the dorms are awful and so is the food. speaking of there are TONS of rats in the dining halls and dorms. they are also abnormally strict on alcohol and other substances. only good thing was the location"
Sophomore,1,i originally came to simmons bc they sold me on the location and the cof but when I got here it was totally nonexistent. there is like NO crossover between the schools and they make it really difficult to do anything. I feel bad bc the professors are really great but good luck getting anything from financial aid or the registrar bc they just ignore you. the dorms are falling apart and look like prison cells bc they are so old and there's nothing to do in the common areas. there's nothing to do on campus either there's no games to go to or parties to go to and everyone is constantly busy or going home on the weekend. I'm actually transferring out bc even tho they gave me good aid its literally not worth being miserable. ALSO its ranked as having LEAST HAPPY STUDENTS AND YES THATS TOTALLY TRUE. Would not recommend.
Alum,1,"This is just a horrible place.  The instructors have political agendas and look down on the students.  The administration makes errors and it can take upwards of a year for them to admit they are in the wrong.  THEY made a mistake on my tuition bill and held my transcripts for almost a year, so I could not transfer,  before figuring out THEY were in the wrong. It is all about MONEY and ultra-left-wing politics.  These are the people who believe they should run the world and are only seeking to indoctrinate young people into thinking the same."
Niche User,1,"This university calls itself diverse, when caring little for its actual minority students. I stayed for a whole year before transferring out. The academics are boring, mindless, and effortless. I did more work in high school than I did at this college. 

I had far too many bad experiences with professors who were strict in ways that didn't matter outside of their class. I felt like every class I took for my major (english/cs) was worthless, and the opportunities were far and few between. It felt impossible to make real friends, or any real connections. 

Reslife is awful and the dorms are too expensive for what you get, and the food options were miniscule. They try to promote their small school experience, but what you actually get is low quality half-assed academics that disguises itself as distinguished."
Alum,1,Simmons is just interested in squeezing as much money out of students and their families as possible.  This is particularly interesting since the political agenda on campus is to the left of Nicolas Maduro.
Freshman,1,"The school is so frustrating if you are a student of color. The air reeks of white feminism. Furthermore, the administration does not actually care about the student body. Drinan is more concerned about padding her pockets with our money than with improving day to day life for the students. And don't get me started about the state of the campus facilities. Disappointing"
Sophomore,1,"Simmons is NOT a great school I repeat NOT  a great school. Unless you want to do nursing do not come here. Their physics department consists of only two professors and I did not get anything out of their physics 1 and 2 class. The classes were not calculus base and did not prepare me for anything for higher up classes when I transferred. All the chemistry, biology, math, and physics classes level of hardness were well below other schools. You will be behind others when you graduate, especially if you plan to go to graduate school. They're not wealthy enough to hire full-time professor so you get adjuncts who can't teach at all. Simmons College is basically a fraud who takes your money and give it to the nursing or PT department. This school is honestly a scam to be honest. They're accepting more and more students every year because they know a lot of their students will transfer out after a semester or two."
Junior,1,"Professors are good, especially nursing program. Resident life, counseling services and staff in general are no help. Social life is weird and cliquey - either preppy girls or super introverts. No party scene whatsoever. Amazing location but nowhere to go if under 21. Parking is extremely inconvenient. Dorms are subpar and over crowded. Strict rules on drinking and smoke free campus."
Freshman,1,The staff are really hit or miss. Bartol staff is great but reslife is horrible. I would strongly advise against applying/attending.
Freshman,1,"There is only one multicultural room.  I declared Computer Science I was disappointed at the lack of sections offered for my cs classes and the mostly male faculty for the computer science department. Sometimes they don't offer certain languages for a certain academic year so you either have to cross register at Wentworth  or take community college classes in the Summer. 
The college is very hierarchical, disconnected in regards to forms and policies feels like I'm at a huge university. The required curriculum PLAN with KCAs is a joke and eats up a 1/4 of our schedule every semester instead of taking relevant courses to your major or actually getting transferable credits. My advisory mislead me saying that my first year Boston Course would count as literature but when I transferred it counted for nothing!! 
My PLAN courses did not transfer to my other institution and this is the case with many other people who transfer."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life
College Junior,1,"There are no parties here at Simmons College. If you have friends nearby, go to other school's parties."
College Junior,1,We do not have greek life here at school. Greek life is not allowed on campus.
College Freshman,1,I go to an all girls school. The school itself is a sorority.
College Freshman,1,"We never win games.

Athletes suck"
College Freshman,1,I am transferring next semester so I need the money to attend school
College Freshman,1,NONE. THERE IS NO PARTY LIFE. lots of alternative club programs though
College Freshman,1,There is no night life at school. there is some in boston but simmons itself is very quiet.
College Freshman,1,"Every year people try to bring greek life to campus, and every year it gets kick back and fails miserable."
College Freshman,1,"There are no parties on our campus because most people go home to go to other schools on the weekend.  You need to make friends with students at surrounding colleges to go out and have a good time.  Harvard and Mission Hill always have parties on the weekends, but you need to travel there."
College Freshman,1,"There is rarely a variety of options at Bartol, and most nights it is hard to even find something to eat.  At the fens, the food is better because of the variety but the prices cause you to run out of your points or meal swipes before the semester is over."
College Freshman,1,Nobody cares except the athletes. The gym is not nice at all.
College Freshman,1,"Literally NOTHING on campus. You have to go off campus to other schools frats, or to apartments. Typically youneed to know someone to get in."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The buildings are breaking down. The Residence Life Staff is unfriendly, combative, and doesn't really care about enforcing the rules (like when that girl left a mattress in the hall for three weeks). It's so expensive and a bad value for what you get. Also, the wireless Internet goes down frequently."
College Freshman,1,"Simmons is in top 20 sober schools. There are zero parties. Have to go off campus to BU or Cambridge. Most of the time, you will come back not finding a party."
College Freshman,1,Simmons is an all-women's college. They say you will see guys on campus and be able to meet guys. They lied. The only guys girls will meet would be hookups at parties.
College Freshman,1,The food suck! It's greasy. Few options. Had a friend bite into a raw chicken nugget. Everything looks like it came out of the freezer. Very nice people work there though.
College Freshman,1,"The Student Financial Services office is rude and unapproachable. I tried to talk to them about studying abroad, and they were not kind. They barely acknowledged my presence in the meeting. "
College Sophomore,1,There is not much of a nightlife at this school at all. If you want to go out and have fun you have to go to other schools campuses to do so
College Sophomore,1,This school is not some crazy party school. Its pretty quiet and unless its a small group of students pre-gaming. Most students go out to parties to other schools to drink
College Freshman,1,I did not get very much financial aid or any scholarships its not that fair of a process 
College Freshman,1,"They suck, sorry, i get food poisoning sometimes it sucks"
College Junior,1,"The drug scene at Simmons College is not big. Nobody really drinks on campus and if they do it is in their rooms. I have never been peer pressured, nor have I witnessed it. I have only seen one incident where people were caught drinking and the policy was greatly enforced by the RAs, public safety and administration."
College Freshman,1,"The dining, I hate to say, is awful. For the money we are spending to go to Simmons College does not show in the dining hall systems. There are not a lot of options, they are open at weird hours, do not have a good variety of food, and the food at the Bartol dining hall is absolutely terrible. The fens is expensive, and it gets old after a while. Simmons really needs to build new dining halls, or stores. Especially on residence campus."
College Freshman,1,"Ehh.. Not Good. The off campus selection is not very good at all. There are a lot of apartments available but thats if you want to spend 1000 or more a month. I know it is Boston and it is going to be expensive no matter what, but on a college students budget it is a pain. Simmons should provide off campus housing like other schools do."
College Junior,1,"Not Much – not much on campus, alcohol, some weed, not much more. pub safety is pretty strict"
College Sophomore,1,No Parties – there are no parties at simmons! if u want to go out u need to know people at other schools

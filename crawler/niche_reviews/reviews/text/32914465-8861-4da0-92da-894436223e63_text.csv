Alum,5,"Great covid accommodations from what I can tell. I marked myself as an alumni, so I'm unsure why niche is forcing me to type a review of at least 100 characters here before submitting."
Alum,5,"Illinois Wesleyan University is an excellent place to spend your undergraduate career. Wesleyan focuses on developing your critical thinking and communication skills in ways that cannot be accomplished at other universities.   Their biology and nursing programs have an excellent reputation among medical schools and hospitals in the midwest, particularly in Illinois. 
Pros: 
*Small class sizes and tough exams force you to apply and understand your course content in ways that will prepare you better for life beyond your education 
*Bloomington-Normal bars are second only to Champaign within the state 
*Financial aid will work with you to make your Wesleyan degree more affordable than competing offers you may have 
Cons:
* University leadership has been incredibly weak in recent years
*Greek life is abysmal compared to other schools in the state, with a university lead culture of keeping fraternities on probation for several semesters for offenses like beer consumption"
Junior,5,This school was my first choice as soon as I visited! The school has been amazing and is responding so well to COVID.
Junior,5,"I chose Illinois Wesleyan University because of its amazing and rigorous pre-medical program. I enjoyed my time with the biology professors who have helped me do well in my biology courses and get many good grades in all of them. They have a fair amount of office hours to come and meet with and discuss studying plans and studying habits. The track and field program is also one of the best in the nation in Division 3. I loved running ever since high school and decided to join the Track and field program to compete in the 400, 800, and mile runs. The school was very accommodating to any student with disabilities as well. The biology professors were extremely caring and willing to give me extra time and flexibility to take all my exams and be able to finish them on time. I would highly recommend this institution for studying in the physical sciences. I would like to see more diverse majors in the science track and also more professors to be able to help students with future studies."
Junior,5,"I have had a great experience in my first few months at IWU. As a transfer student, I found myself becoming jealous of those who have the opportunity to attend the school longer than the two years I am able to. I'm so confident in my choice to transfer here after community college and the faculty are so supportive of transfer students."
Senior,5,very impressed with the university.  The tour guide was very informative and even brought us to see a nursing lab which was very impressive.  Students were attending their class and we were able to take a sneak peek
Freshman,5,"I love this school. I am currently a freshman at IWU. I have made some amazing friends and the professors are very friendly and helpful. The student to professor ratio is perfect. You can get more individualized attention and help from your professor because it is a small school. I am incredibly grateful to have been accepted into the Nursing school here. Everyone is unique in their own way and I love it here! Although the food and dorms could be updated, the academics and student involvement on campus are quite amazing."
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity and the fact that it is a small university gives you the opportunity to have a more personal relationship with the teachers and staff. It is a university that has an excellent sense of accomplishment in the classroom and in extracurricular activities.
Freshman,5,It is a fun private school to attend with very high regards to academics. Athletics are also pretty good and every team seems to be able to compete at the highest level.
Senior,5,"It was a great fit for me. Met lots friends, received a fantastic education and exposed to different cultures. The location couldn’t be better, a real college town. Plenty of stores, theaters and restaurants."
Junior,5,Academic program is well developed and structured. IWU's Career Center is working really hard every day to help students to get a job and prepare students for their career path.
Niche User,5,"When I went to visit this campus I found that is was very calm. I loved that the dorms and classes felt safe and I felt very welcomed when I was on and off the campus itself. I plan on applying here for 4-years and do hope that when I do, I am enrolled and ready to spend the 4-years at this happy college."
Niche User,5,"Went for a campus visit.  Quite honestly, it was so much better than expected.  Gorgeous grounds.   Strong academics.  Nice people.   They’re focused on getting you done in four years.  Had a great vibe.  Someone said it’s in a bad neighborhood?  I didn’t see that at all.  From what I’m hearing and reading/ researching, one will get a very solid education here.  Love also that there’s great research opps. Couldn’t find anything negative about it.  Will definitely be applying."
Junior,5,"This school quickly becomes home. I would not be where I am without the guidance and support of my professors and peers. Though a difficult school academically, it is certainly worth every tough assignment and sleepless night. There must be a shift in diversity, this school is progressive in many senses but action is required to show commitment to diversity."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus, and everyone on campus was so friendly on our visit! They have a top-notch nursing program and are very reputable."
Freshman,5,"Being a student-athlete, I've had an amazing experience because being an athlete isn't a job, and people are able to do hard majors successfully."
Freshman,5,"I love IWU. The campus is stunning year-round, the food is consistently delicious, and my classes are incredible! My professors are very knowledgeable about the topics they teach, and they try to make class fun. Generally, they make themselves readily available to meet with students for any reason. The Ames Library is a great resource too, and the research librarians are more than happy to help you find anything you need for a class, a paper, or just general reading material. It's also easy to get involved on campus: there are RSOs for just about any interest, so it's easy to find people with common interests."
Senior,5,"I can't even begin to describe the amazing experience I've had here at Illinois Wesleyan University. Since the school only has about 2000 students, professors actually know your name and want to help you. I've never been in a class with more than 30 students. The Career Center is amazing, and has helped me in my search for internships and grad programs, as well as reviewing me resume. And because the school is for undergraduate studies only, you're never taught by grad students."
College Sophomore,5,"Our career center is extremely helpful when it comes to helping students find internships, scholarships, or to help them discover what their passion. The faculties will sit down with you to do a survey in order to help you find a major. They will also sit down with students and go over their resume and how to improve it. The career center also offer practice interviews with real employers and this is a great program. The employers give you honest feedbacks and their personal experience in order to help you grow. The alumni network is also very well developed, given that we have an Alumni Office that organizes a homecoming event each year for alumni reunion. Activities include a small festival and watching a game together."
College Sophomore,5,"I did not formally rushed during the fall and instead did informal rush during the spring. Ten other girls rushed along with me and it was amazing that we all got into the Kappa Delta Omicron chapter at IWU. When I was given a tour around the house as well as given an opportunity to speak with one of the members, I immediately knew that I wanted to be here. Despite it not being formal, the process was very insightful and I've gained ten new family members just like that and many more to come. Kappa Delta does a series of fundraisers and volunteering throughout the year to make sure all our members are actively involved in the community. Our chapter, along with the other houses, are very interconnected and we organize events together. One major event is Greek Week where all the houses fundraise as well as compete in a friendly contest to select Greek God and Goddess. Greek life is major in IWU and will only benefit you, especially when none of the houses are allowed to haze."
College Senior,5,"I love IWU. It is a smart, beautiful, homely, safe place to go to school. Professors are mostly top notch, especially those in my chosen area."
College Senior,5,"My school is completely unique. The friendships made at this school, not only among students but also between professors and between professors and students, is unlike anything else. At Illinois Wesleyan, we work together to push each other forward towards our goals. Our goals are often similar and so we can work together and come together in that.  Illinois Wesleyan is a goldmine of friendship, love, motivation, connections, and learning in the rough and cornfields of central Illinois. I would pick this school all over again if I could."
College Sophomore,5,"There are a lot of events offered to students for awareness or counseling to help with all kinds of problems. Generally, I believe the campus to be safe, regardless of a few accidents, that I believe were not caused by any of the students themselves. Students are generally trustworthy even if you don't know them."
College Sophomore,5,The opportunities offered to us students helps a lot in easing us into the real world and challenges us to do better and work harder to get what we want for a better future. The professors and people around make it worth while and I would never think of going anywhere else.
College Freshman,5,"I would say we have the best facility for what our school's budget can get us. IWU just got a new cardio section, which I am in love with!"
College Senior,5,90% of students either go on to grad programs or have a job 6 months after graduation.
College Senior,5,I believe my degree will prepare me for future graduate studies in my field.
College Senior,5,Greek life is a significant part of campus culture.
College Senior,5,Attending this university is the best choice I have ever made.
College Freshman,5,"Greek life is very popular on campus, but no one feels pressured to join. People will never treat you differently if you choose not to participate."
College Freshman,5,Everyone on campus uses the athletic center.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone at my school truly wants to see my succeed, students and faculty alike. I am in love with the BFA Acting program. I'm not only gaining the knowledge I need to succeed in my degree track, but I am learning the ins and outs of everything in theater."
College Freshman,5,I love Illinois Wesleyan I couldn't be happier!
College Freshman,5,Bloomington/Normal has some of the best restaurants in Illinois! Just yesterday I went to a vegan cafe and didn't even know it until we walked out. So good!
College Freshman,5,"Greek life in IWU is amazing, and they contribute to campus in such a positive way."
College Freshman,5,Admission was pretty straightforward. I didn't encounter much difficulty to get into pre-med.
College Freshman,5,Joining a fraternity was one of the best decisions I have made since starting college
College Freshman,5,"I'm in a frat so I may be biased, but I think the social life at IWU is great."
College Freshman,5,"I've lost my student ID twice now, I know it;s bad. Luckily I knew where to replace it, at the security office and they were very polite and helpful."
College Freshman,5,Greek life makes great contributions to the school and the community. Not to mention great parties.
College Junior,5,The academics at IWU are excellent! There are plenty of courses and majors to choose from and there are also many opportunities outside the classroom.
College Junior,5,My program is great. There are wonderful professors who really care about student progress and want you to succeed.
College Freshman,5,"As an accounting internship, I am practically guaranteed to have a 10 week internship the spring semester of my junior year. You make anywhere between $10,000 to $15,000 because you are paid an accountants salary. IWU does a great job of having internship fairs and helping construct resumes."
College Freshman,5,"I am in Tau Kappa Epsilon and I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else, but it by no means takes over my life. I have a ton of friends who arent in greek life or who are athletes or involved in other things and they don't judge me one bit."
College Freshman,5,"You don't have to go out and drink every night. Illinois Wesleyan offers a ton of great sober activities and events. Recently, I met the head writer of SNL, Colin Jost and the entire band of 3OH!3. They make it awesome. But if you want to go out and party, the frats are very open to who they let in. Not like what is commonly depicted on TV and in movies. They arent really douchebags."
College Freshman,5,Most of the students who attend receive some form of finical aid whether it is merit or need based.
College Freshman,5,"I really love living here, it's my second home. I never feel uncomfortable. For the most part, everyone is super friendly and it's pretty easy to get involved in anything."
College Sophomore,5,I've heard from a Medical School that our academics are on par with Northwestern University
College Freshman,5,"The local atmosphere is excellent! While there are no local sports teams, there are many restaurants, movie theaters, zoos, parks, and more in the surrounding Bloomington-Normal area. Illinois Wesleyan is within 2 miles of Illinois State University  and students interact closely with their students."
College Freshman,5,"Although students may bring cars their freshman year and parking is free, many students choose to leave their cars at home. There are on campus shuttles for commuting on campus late at night, buses which pick up on campus and commute students all over Bloomington-Normal for $1, and ca services which pick up and drop off anywhere on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Illinois Wesleyan University is among the best universities in the state of Illinois and prides itself in the prestige and rigor of its academics. While the workload is greater than many other schools and the curriculum is much more rigorous, the facilities are also much nicer and students are better prepared for graduate school and the work force to follow graduation."
College Freshman,5,"The biology program at Illinois Wesleyan is one of the best in the state. The professors have the highest degree in their fuel (PhD), there are state-of-the-art facilities, and students are challenged from day one. There is a reason why IWU has a 90% acceptance rate into medical school and biology graduate school."
College Freshman,5,I believe that the facilities are some of the best in the country for d3.
College Sophomore,5,The school is a small community everyone kind of know everyone . It's home.
College Sophomore,5,"The academics is great 
"
College Sophomore,5,Extremely helpful and went smoothly.
College Freshman,5,I have received more financial help than I thought. That is the reason I choose IWU.
College Freshman,5,LOVE Sunday brunch it is the best.  The choose of food is great. I am picky and can ALWAYS find something to eat. 
College Freshman,5,"We are given many luxuries that a lot of schools are not provided with. I do not need to pay for parking, printing, or laundry. The dining hall food is decent and there often is a variety of meals. The halls are clean. The campus is small and friendly. The professors are often times helpful. I love my school."
College Freshman,5,I love my professors and how helpful they are. The work is hard at times but that is because it is a good school. The one thing that is hard is the GPA scale because the plus and minuses count.
Junior,4,Some classes are difficult to complete while online.  The school is now giving every student a Zoom account to be able to easily complete the online classes.
Freshman,4,"I like the academics and the professors are really nice. I like how it is a small school and professors give you tips to succeed in their class. However they expect you to do the work and put in effort like you are supposed to. Classes can get hard depending which ones you take and how much time you invest in learning and studying. The students here are nice as well and very easy to approach. Overall, I do like this school and while the food might not be so great, having friends around make it a lot more worth-while."
Sophomore,4,"Illinois Wesleyan is a great place to get your undergraduate degree.  The campus is all very centralized with all academic buildings surrounding the main quad within a 5 minute walk from any on campus housing.  Professors are very likable, and love to teach.  They will know your name and make sure you stay on top of your work.  Class sizes are very small which makes your relationship with professors even better.  In terms of student life there are a ton of clubs and activities to get involved in.  I love going to all of the sports games, which Illinois Wesleyan has many highly ranked sports teams, although the attendance is not as high as I would hope.  The majority of students are very friendly, and it is very easy to find your group thanks to the intimate class, orientation activities, and other student life activities.  Overall, Illinois Wesleyan is a great place for an undergraduate education."
Junior,4,"President had no idea what he was doing, but considering he resigned hopefully  it gets better. Tuition is pretty steep but otherwise I think it's a great place to study."
Sophomore,4,"I loved my academic experience. The professors and the classes are amazing. However, there are many changes I would like to see. Primarily, in regards to diversity and return on investment."
Freshman,4,"There have been a few professors that have been unpleasant to deal with, but otherwise, I have enjoyed my experience at Illinois Wesleyan."
Freshman,4,Although I have only been  here for one year everything about it has been very nice. Professors are always willing to help you succeed. No matter what time of day is it I have always felt safe on campus. There are endless amount of things to do around campus keeping you entertained at all times.
Freshman,4,"I think I made the right decision joining Illinois Wesleyan University.  The university is small so the faculty to student ratio is very low, which means each individual student is given undivided attention and approach by the faculty and administration of the college."
Senior,4,"I love this school, it is just crazy expensive. The professors are great and they honestly make the experience that much more incredible because you know that you are getting a quality education. The only thing that is tough is how tuition continues to rise every year."
Freshman,4,"The campus is very nice and well laid-out. No matter where you are on campus, you only need five minutes to get to wherever you are going. Every morning you can leave your dorm five minutes before class starts and you will make it on time with time to spare."
Freshman,4,"First year in the music program has been great! I feel supported by my professors and my peers at all times, and the overall college experience has been great thus far."
Senior,4,"I really love the campus and the classes. The only drawbacks I have encountered are with course scheduling. Since Illinois Wesleyan is a small private school, sometimes classes are not available both semesters. For the most part, I have loved my experience!"
Sophomore,4,"A small school, but can be fun if you meet the right people. There is almost a high school feel as there are cliches. Everyone knows what others are up too."
Niche User,4,I liked the small campus feel and the safety of this college town. The small class size and internship opportunities are tremendous.
Niche User,4,Illinois Wesleyan is a beautiful campus with many great academic programs! I was very impressed with their environmental science program and the many different research opportunities they have for all of their students.
Alum,4,"I had an amazing time at IWU. Most of the professors were approachable and personable, and the courses were well-suited for my studies. However, they do not have good money management and some of the buildings were in desperate need of up-keeping."
Freshman,4,"I am a student-athlete at IWU. The science department where I am studying Nursing has top-notch professors with small lecture sizes. The nursing building just got refurbished and new technology. The food is ok, but Tommy's Grill is great. All of the sports teams have winning record and a proud history. Titan Green Over Everything."
Sophomore,4,"This is an amazing school for so many reasons. The professors wonderful, helpful, and above all, they truly want to see their students succeed. There are many resources for students, including multiple computer labs, free printing, and countless places to study. Other faculty, including ORL and the registrar, can answer questions quickly and usually painlessly. The major complaint I have about IWU is their housing system. I think they need more options for those who wish to not have a roommate, but other than that, I don't really have anything bad to say about the school. It is very expensive, but there are many opportunities for student employment at the school itself that work with class schedules."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are very experienced as well as available. They understand the subject they are teaching and tried to teach it in a way that students would understand. The class sizes ever exceed 120 or so students and the teaching styles differ based on professors. The courses are very detailed and you learn an extreme amount of information each week; therefore, time management will be your greatest friend. IWU also have a very wide range of courses going from the sciences to our excellent theater programs. It's not easy on big campus to meet people outside your major but at IWU, having a close friend who is an art major while you yourself is a biology major is an everyday phenomenon."
College Sophomore,4,"I rarely feel unsafe on campus. Around our campus, there are emergency posts set up that will ring up the security (who live one or two blocks away) and tell them our exact location if we were ever in danger or feeling threatened. Our campus also have a titan transport service that will accompany students to their dorm when they dialed. The campus is relatively small, so it never takes too long to get from one place to another so students never feel the need to call security. Students also like to walk in groups if they are traveling at night. Overall, the campus promote a safe environment."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing really varies. Students are required to stay on campus for three years and can request a single room due to medical reason (they are very flexible in this aspect). The roommate matches are accurate the majority of the time if you go through their random selection process. The staff actually go through all the surveys in order to match students with each other. The freshmen dorms (depending on where you live) is the average side that you'd imagine, some dorms have bigger rooms than others. If you are living in Greek Houses, it is generally cheaper and for sororities you get your own chef and will not need to rely on meal plans. Some students chip in for an apartment and those are popular if you want to save money and if you have a few best friends you don't mind living with. Overall, the housing is great and comes with all your basic needs (desk, beds, closet, drawer, etc)."
College Sophomore,4,"I am not actively involved in sports so I cannot say in details about the practices and what teams generally do. However, the sport team members are very tightly knit and supportive of the other teams. Almost every student go to games to either support their friends or to enjoy themselves and the gym is usually packed. Parents and others are welcomed as well. The teams practiced really hard because I know a few classmates who practiced at least four to five hours each day while still balancing school work. IWU has a very well-developed athletic department."
College Sophomore,4,"Illinois Wesleyan University excels in the education aspect. The professors are amazing and very engaging. They are experts in their fields and know exactly what they are teaching. The materials for biology, for example, are not easy to understand if you have to analyze the text by yourself. However, the professors tried their best to teach the materials in a way that students would understand and questions are welcome (I have yet to sit through a lecture without at least tens of questions). The professors are also readily available outside the classroom and I have never experienced major conflict when scheduling a talk with them. The professors are also extremely friendly and you'd be amazed at how fast you can connect with them. 

The social life aspect at IWU is also, for me personally, very ideal. The small campus allows you to actually meet and connect easily with your classmates and roommate(s). It's not hard to know the whole campus and make connections. At IWU no student is just a number and befriending someone is as easy as sitting down with them at the cafeteria. The sport teams and Greek houses are also extremely interconnected and I found myself having twenty new family members over at Kappa Delta.

Overall, IWU will give you a great, well-rounded college experience."
College Senior,4,A degree from this school will hopefully serve me well. The school is well thought of and popular.
College Senior,4,"This school is very safe. Campus crime is low to the point of being able to leave bags and computers unattended without worry. There have been a couple of occasions of threat near campus, but they have been efficiently taken care of and I personally feel safe on campus."
College Senior,4,"Housing is good, however the three year live-on-campus rule is inconvenient."
College Senior,4,"Our school has about 5 social fraternities and sororities, of which vary in their support for the school, fundraising, philanthropies, etc. We also have other greek life that is not social, which does quite amazing things for the community. I think what makes our school great is the three music fraternities. The music fraternities make it a point to bring people together for their love of music, as well as put on fundraising and philanthropic events and projects."
College Senior,4,"Our school has a wonderful mixture of Varsity (D1, I believe) sports, intramurals, classes, and workout/sports just for fun. We have quite a good school for sports; our football team does well, our women's track team has been consistently getting first place in its' division, and our other teams also do well. We have fun intramurals, such as softball and frisbee. Our athletic center was remodeled with an addition in the past year, so our facilities are new and larger. Our school spirit is large, especially among alumnae."
College Sophomore,4,"Definitely challenging, but that is what makes the students such hard-workers and more determined to get the best experience and results. The teachers are all different but very involved and passionate, which makes the class worth while. Classes are generally smaller, so it is nice to get more attention from the professors."
College Sophomore,4,"IWU is really involved and helpful to each student. I think that just by going to this school, it opens so many more opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,"Being part of a sorority myself, it is really down to earth and about so much more than what you see on tv. There are a lot of fundraisers and awareness events that help the philosophies, as well as the communities. Also, it is such a friendly environment that you even consider the girls that are not in the same sorority as sisters. Honestly, there is no impact on the non-Greeks and there is no pressure at all. With being such a small school, everyone knows everyone."
College Sophomore,4,"For a Division 3 school, I believe IWU does pretty well with having Track/ Cross Country, Softball, Baseball, Volleyball, and Football as our most recognized sports."
College Freshman,4,"In the sciences, the professors love to challenge the students so often they will try to sound intimidating. However, most of them in my experiences are very accommodating. I have had an issue with one professor in particular, but for the most part, the classes are challenging and the professors are helpful."
College Freshman,4,"There are always events going on involving job recruitments and alums coming to campus to meet with students. There are also several workshops offered for resume building assistance, mock job interviews, career counseling, etc."
College Freshman,4,"I am involved with greek life at my school and joined second semester of my freshman year so I saw both sides. Most students are indifferent about greek life. However, it is extremely noticeable that the fraternities/sororities are very active on campus and in the community."
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, I am glad that I came to this school. I am in plant science and while our biology program is quite extraordinary, it is mainly focused for students who want to go to medical school. This makes it hard for students like me who are just looking for plant science research opportunities."
College Freshman,4,There is security patrolling the campus to make sure we are safe.
College Freshman,4,I don't know much about this
College Freshman,4,The courses are challenging but very rewarding.
College Freshman,4,"Its good, but not the best."
College Freshman,4,The facilities are pretty nice.
College Freshman,4,I really like the school setting.
College Senior,4,The biology pre-med program is difficult but manageable. All the professors truly care about your progress.
College Senior,4,The only time I felt unsafe was an off-campus incident that was gang related
College Senior,4,Overall Wesleyan has been a great experience as a Biology Major - though extremely difficult.
College Senior,4,The surrounding community raises concerns for safety at times.
College Senior,4,The psychology department faculty is phenomenal. Class sizes are perfect.
College Senior,4,I met many lifelong friends during my time in a dormitory during my freshman year.
College Sophomore,4,People are generally more acceptable towards diverse cultures and ethnic backgrounds. There are lot of international students also in the school which makes it a much better experience for everybody
College Sophomore,4,"Because IWU has a small teacher to student ratio, I am able to get personal attention from the professor. The students and professors are pretty serious about academics."
College Sophomore,4,Coming here has truly been a life changing and rewarding experience. I have made a lot friends and feel like a different person now when I look back.
College Sophomore,4,IWU is well known liberal arts education college and it has a lot higher career prospects. The career center is pretty helpful and encouraging.
College Sophomore,4,The residential buildings are pretty decent but I would say that the rooms are pretty small in the first year dorms.
College Sophomore,4,I am an international student and coming here to Illinois Wesleyan University has truly been a great experience. The professors are great and there a lot of opportunities to learn. I feel more than just a number in the school and there are always some one to help me out when I feel confused. I love it here!
College Sophomore,4,"There have been some safety concerns this year nearby campus, but the campus itself is always very safe."
College Sophomore,4,"I have yet to utilize the career center, but I've heard it's very helpful."
College Sophomore,4,I've loved my professors thus far and have taken a variety of classes.
College Sophomore,4,The freshman dorms were smaller but perfectly fine and the dorm I'm currently living in is really nice.
College Sophomore,4,"Diversity leaves something to be desired, but in all, I love my school."
College Freshman,4,"I have no major complaints. I'm currently living in a freshman dorm, so it isn't the best, but it's also not bad."
Niche User,2,"Illinois Wesleyan University is a great school to go to for academics. However, the campus is small and located in a boring town. It's easy to feel like you're living in a bubble."
Junior,2,"Illinois Wesleyan is an overpriced joke of a school. Constantly trying to nickle and dime you without equal reward. Academics are great, but completely not worth the price. I regret not transferring after the first year."
Freshman,2,"There is no doubt about illinois wesleyan being one of the best colleges academically. Still, all the other aspects such as location, dorm, and campus food are horrible... I can never imagine myself living here more than a year and those facotrs makes a lot of the students depressed. Unless you are content for studying 24/7 with disgusting food, you should never come here."
College Senior,2,The dorms are old and expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"The frats are gross and boring after freshman year. If you're not 21, there's no where outside of campus to go."
College Sophomore,2,"No healthy options, and munch money only buys a limited span of unhealthy foods."
College Freshman,2,There are no transportation options
College Junior,2,"There are only five places to eat on campus, and if you are hungry after ten, you're ordering delivery. The food is mostly unhealthy and the dietary restriction meals are limited and rather gross. The meal exchange offers are standard, but those get tiring after about a month."
College Sophomore,2,"I'd say the strictness is pretty averge at Illinois Wesleyan. There are cops that bust underage people at bars, but as far as on-campus activities there isn't much trouble with the authorities. Unless you're acting completely irrational, the cops will leave you alone. The strictest part of the University is the grades system, and if you're struggling you better get help, or they won't keep you in school."
College Senior,2,"The drug scene at Wesleyan is bad compared to most schools. While there is evidence of illicit drug use its probably by less than half of the student body. Most kids drink if they use substances at all and are deathly afraid of anything more than the ganja. On the other hand, if you know where to look you can find anything you want since Wesleyan is only a stone's throw from Illinois State, one of the great party schools in Illinois."
College Sophomore,2,"We do not have easily accessible public transportation.  Your best bet is to use ISU's...luckily, it's a small campus and many have cars"
College Sophomore,2,"Two Opposites – While printing is free on campus and the labs are up to date and plentiful, there is no wifi in the residential halls. Super lame and behind on the times. The ethernet connection in the dorms is extremely slow and I can't even use skype on it."
College Sophomore,2,"Academics have been a frustrating experience for me. I feel that IWU has mislead me. Most professors don't give you that much attention, and have very limited office hours. In order to get their help, be prepared to do some brown nosing. Also most professors do not care about intellectual exploration; they grade you on how well you reiterate their ideas. I feel that I have learned very little during my first year at IWU; however there are some good professors out there, you just have to search for them."
College Sophomore,2,"Health Services is amazing; I just wish that their hours were more extensive. Security meanwhile sucks. I honestly have never seen any security walking or driving around. While this means you can get away with a lot, it also means that you're on your own to defend yourself."
College Sophomore,2,"Boring Farm Town – There's not much to do off campus for fun, especially for those under 21."
College Freshman,2,"While some campus policies are strictly enforced, it alld epends on who is around seeing the violation. IWU does allow students lots of freedom."
College Freshman,2,"Small Weight Room/Poor Cafeteria Food – I would like to see an expansion on the athletic center. The field house is big and there is plenty of room in the open area to play baseball and run on the track. But when it comes to the weight room, it is quite small. If one team in particular is in there lifting, it is almost impossible for anyone else to get in there and get a workout in. The weight room definitely needs to be expanded so it can accommodate for more people. As for the common dining area, the food is bland. There is always a sandwich bar, salad bar and pizza bar available and then there are 2 main meals that change every day. Once in a while there is a really good meal but most of the time the meals could be much better. Especially when students are paying almost $50,000 a year to attend this university."
College Freshman,2,"IWU is primarily white. There are students of various races, but it is an apparent minority. Hence, the reputation of being rich white kids."
College Sophomore,2,"Girls Get Better – Every year, the freshman class brings better looking girls than the original year.  Right now, we have a few lookers and the rest could possibly be men in drag."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is available for students in a few locations. Most desired parking is reserved for faculty and if a student parks in that lot, they are subject to fines and towing. The parking that is available is few and far between and it seems like a constant struggle to find an open parking spot."
College Senior,1,"The very few options we have have terrible service, low quality food, and the absolute worst hours. The latest you can eat on campus is 8:00 PM."
College Sophomore,1,"Suburbs of Chicago – The students of IWU are middle class white ""good"" students from the suburbs of Chicago. I'm from St. Louis, and people nearly lose their minds when they hear that."
College Sophomore,1,"The food here is terrible, and I typically like everything that is given to me. Saga has the potential to be good, but on most days it's gross. The dugout is your best bet for food, but ordering subs and burgers gets old. Tommys is okay, but overrated."
Recent Alumnus,1,"They Steal Your Money – I love this school and when I came in as a freshman I told everyone that I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. That being said, coming here is my only real regret in my 21 years. I have made life long friends and greatly enjoy the professors but the administration is awful. They try to get every dollar out of you that they can. They mislead you into thinking you can afford this school when you can't. All the free perks that they tell you about, you usually end up paying even more for. We now have to pay for May Term, the study abroad program which was supposed to be a unique set up to save you money so you can use your grants and scholarships actually cost me $7,000 more than anyone else in my program from other schools because of this set up, and they do not increase your financial aid as the tuition goes up, even when one of your parents becomes unemployed. This school is a rip off and is not worth the money. If you try to transfer, the classes rarely transfer so you are going to end up paying the same amount if you go somewhere else because you will have to stay in school for another year. When choosing between here and St. Olaf (a comparative school in MN which is a little more money) I thought the only difference would be distance. This was wrong. My brother ended up going there and although it is more money, we spend thousands less on his education and it is actually a more creditable school. If you are questioning being able to afford IWU, DO NOT go there; you will end up being extremely bitter toward the school because they just continue to add on costs and do nothing when you try to work with them about financial situations. That being said, I did receiver grants and scholarships coming in as a Freshman, so I would give IWU a grade of a D instead of an F."
College Sophomore,1,"Tuition, Room and Board TOO HIGH – There are lots of great alumni that offer lots of scholarships every year, but tuition and all other expenses are too high.  Food, books, etc.  If you really want to go to Wesleyan, you better find as many outside scholarships as possible to cover tuition, room and board costs so you can afford to spend it on all the overpriced coffee, snacks, and textbooks.  (Book for class from bookstore new: $214.  Off amazon.com brand new:$45)"
College Senior,1,"Not Much – Most students are from the same background, bringing little diversity to campus."
College Senior,1,"If you are looking for fun college sports, tailgating, and rivalry, do not come here. I have been to like one football game in all 3 years here and not a single basketball game and I am not out of the ordinary. I go to a lot of soccer games but that is because I know a lot of people of the teams and used to play myself. Sports are absolutely not a priority here unless you are actually on the team."
College Sophomore,1,"parking sucks! If you live in a dorm you are pretty much screwed most of the time.  If you live in a frat you have good parking relative to the amount of guys with cars, and soriorities aren't terrible."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't really know what this question means, but there is nothing really unique"
College Sophomore,1,"Not a diverse campus. In fact, I heard today that we are 75% white...soooo yea"
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks THINK They Are the School – Greek life at our school is, from the eyes of a non-member, a wasted effort. The frat parties are just bad places for people to be, whether its the bad beer that is served, or the fact that the music is simply horrible. Whats worse is how the greek studnets act around campus, as if they are the school. I try and avoid these people/places as much as I can."

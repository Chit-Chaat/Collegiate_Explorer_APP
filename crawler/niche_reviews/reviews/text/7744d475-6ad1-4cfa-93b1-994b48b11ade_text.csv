Freshman,5,"Hope College is an absolute gem, though it seems somewhat hidden because of it's small size and quaint location.  However, there is no doubt that this is a fantastic place to be educated.  I am a member of the dance department and I can speak on behalf of their excellent, top-notch training.  They always bring in various guest artists throughout the year (2 which each stay a full semester, even) and host plenty of performance opportunities and auditions.  Outside of dancing, the rest of the education at the school is phenomenal!  Each class is challenging and engaging, and the professors are very knowledgeable and wise.  Each of the staff on campus cares about YOU as an individual and wants to help you succeed in every way possible.  You are at an advantage in a smaller pond because you're not just a number, you're important and significant to everyone that you'll meet!  Hope has such a warm, friendly, and inviting environment with joy that is contagious!  Hope is the place to be :)"
Freshman,5,"Though learning online is not ideal for most students, especially those of us who are dancers, the Hope college professors and COVID-19 planning committee did a fantastic job of organizing materials and doing their best to continue offering their quality and notable education.  I was thoroughly impressed with ability to ""keep the hope"", even on a much more spread-out campus :)"
Sophomore,5,"Hope has been an amazing overall experience for me. Hope has a smaller campus which brings a family atmosphere to the community. Hope is a Christian college, yet professors don't force their religion on you, and chapel isn't mandatory. For division 3, our athletic teams and facilities are amazing, and there are many student body events for anyone to get involved."
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID-19, our last quarter of our Spring 2020 semester was moved to online classes. Our professors did a great job of giving people the time they needed to complete everything on line, while still creating professional class opportunities to prepare us for exams and for our future."
Alum,5,"Hope is a wonderful school. I not only received an excellent education, but also grew into adulthood. Hope educates the entire person mind, spirit and body. I also met my spouse at Hope."
Alum,5,"I graduated in 1996. There was no such thing as online learning when I went to Hope, but I’ve heard good things. My son will attend the campus in the fall."
Sophomore,5,"Hope College is exceptional! Professors and other staff really care about the individual and want you to succeed. They offer so many resources for the student from free tutoring, writing center, Boerigter Center for Calling and Career and so much more. They have rigorous classes to help you think critically and rise to your greatest potential and as a liberal arts college they help the student to be well rounded.. Hope is on the more pricy side as it is a private college but the campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"I love the Hope College community. It is unlike anywhere else. All of my professors genuinely care about us as people, not just as students. I am so grateful for all of the relationships that I have built and I am looking forward to continuing my education here."
Freshman,5,I am in love with Hope and the community here. This school really cares for its students and I’ve never felt that I belong somewhere as much as I do here. Coming to Hope has been one of my best decisions I’ve made.
Freshman,5,I love how it's right by Lake MI! I also love the staff at Hope college because they help prepare us for what the real world is going to be like and give us an excellent education.
Freshman,5,"Before I even applied to Hope College I knew they were genuinely interested in me as a person. My admission representative always kept in contact with me throughout the entire college selection process and was very helpful with anything my family needed. He met with us on multiple occasions across Illinois and Michigan. They set up tours, overnight hosting options, time inside the classroom and so much more for me. All of this was done before I ever committed and that shows how much they cared about me as a person. Overall my experience has been great here and I've met amazing people along the way."
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed the professors, the small classes make me feel seen and having the professors know my name and my goals. It is also easy to get involved in different things on campus, with many different activities for different students there is something for everyone. It is also a small enough campus where getting to know people is easy, you will often see familiar faces around campus and in classes. Getting to and from classes is easy with the campus being only a few blocks big you can get to class quickly and even though it is small they provide a campus shuttle to drive you where you need to go rain or shine. Hope college is a great place to be no matter what you are interested in and a great place if you like to be close to your professors and friends."
Sophomore,5,This is a great family community school. Everyone knows and loves Christ and want to pursue his plan for them.
Sophomore,5,"Wow Hope college is so amazing. Beautiful school with an abundance of resources. I would recommend this school to anyone. I would encourage you to take a visit and see the school for yourself. The professors truly care about you, the students are very encouraging and friendly. The aura around the school is beautiful. GO HOPE!"
Niche User,5,"I have been involved in many things at Hope College from their summer sports camps to one of their general-ed college courses.  No matter what it was I participated in, I always had a blast and loved it.  I have so many good memories that I have created at Hope.  The faculty is extremely friendly and the students are lovely.  The campus is beautiful and right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown Holland. Along with the beautiful campus, they do an excellent job keeping students feeling safe.  They have campus shuttles and they have campus safety that will bring you to any point on campus whenever you need it.  The small campus is a very big plus because it takes students less than 10 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other. The classrooms, dorms, dining halls, sports fields/courts/etc., and performing arts spaces are all in good shape and are being constantly improved.  Overall, Hope College is a beautiful school in the middle of a lively community."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Hope and have absolutely loved everything about this school! The teachers are incredible, they are so fun and they truly care about you as an individual!"
Niche User,5,"The Hope college experience was one of a kind. Never before had I received such a high level of personal commitment, care, and respect from a college before. From their hand-written letters to one on one emails with the faculty, the entire Hope community is there for your every need."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful Campus,  small enough to feel close with many and large enough to really explore.
Close to very nice Town of Holland and easy to get around."
Alum,5,Hope College has wonderful professors! They take the time to really get to know you and answer all of your questions. Hope is a wonderful place to spend 4 years learning and growing.
Alum,5,"Hope is an amazing place in which to grow, learn and make lifelong friends.  The Profs are dedicated to providing a quality education, and the size of the campus and student body makes for an intimate, safe college experience.  Loved my time at Hope!"
Junior,5,"Very easy to meet and connect with people as soon as you get to campus through things like the orientation groups, that help new students get acclimated to campus, to campus events like the pull or nykerk."
Sophomore,5,"What I loved most about Hope College was everyone makes you feel welcomed. The professors, students, coaches, everyone is friendly and makes you feel like you are at home!"
Sophomore,5,"Choosing Hope was one of the best decisions in my life. The campus is absolutely gorgeous, and everyone here feels more like family than just friends. Hope encourages you to step outside your comfort zone to learn more about yourself, your beliefs, and your goals. The classes at Hope are challenging, yet interesting, and the professors are incredibly kind and willing to give you all the help you need to succeed here. The traditions here, like Nykerk and the Pull are one of my favorite parts about being a student. There is always something fun going on around campus. Overall, these four years are undoubtedly going to be some of the most exciting, educational, and life-changing years of my life thanks to Hope College."
Senior,5,"My experience at Hope College has been nothing short of life changing. Between the community outside of Hope and campus life activities, you'll never run out of things to do! In terms of faith life, I've been in private school all my life, but the messages at Hope have truly drawn me closer to the Lord. I'm a double major, and my faculty advisors have coordinated and communicated with me so consistently, ensuring great options for graduate school. Hope College is WELL worth the investment. It was the perfect fit for me, and I don't think enough people about what an absolute treasure this community is!"
Sophomore,5,"Coming to Hope has been one of the best decisions of my life, and I can't imagine myself anywhere else!"
Sophomore,5,"I have had such a wonderful experience at Hope college, from the academics to the fun events, the environment is extremely welcoming. It is wonderful to always see friendly faces around and have professors  and faculty truly care about your well-being, mentally and academically."
Sophomore,5,"Hope is such a fun place to be.  Coming in not knowing anybody wasn't a problem at all and campus life was super easy to get used to.  It is so easy to make a ton of close friends and even if you're from far away, people always invite you over from holidays if you don't want to travel to get home.  Even the professors invite you over.  The professors are super personable and it is easy to get to know them and this will help your grades too.  The campus life offers so many things to do and has a small school feel with the resources and opportunities of a bigger school.  They are always adding new stuff to the campus for students and this is awesome because everything is updated."
Junior,5,"Hope has been the perfect college choice for me. The friends and professors that I have connected with have been incredible, and the college itself has provided a life-changing experience in every way. I wouldn't trade my years here for anything!"
Junior,5,"I showed up to Hope College not knowing a single soul or what kinds of activities that they offered here. What I found was a community that flourishes on people, interests, and activity. People are drawn to each other and they don't want to sit around and get nothing done. Hope students put their passions into action and it is a truly inspiring community to be a part of. Faculty and Staff are so invested in doing whatever they can to best help the students that they work with. I will live my life a better person because of my time at Hope College."
Freshman,5,I love being at Hope College. It is a great school with fantastic academics and opportunities to all kinds of people.
Sophomore,5,I love Hope College. The people are great and the professors are the best you can find. Holland is also an amazing area and the alumni are also very helpful. Hope has a very loving culture and you’re bound to make friendships that will last a lifetime.
Junior,5,"Hope College offers and excellent academic experience (including an extremely long list of study abroad options in both the academic year and over the summer) as well and inclusive student life. Professors show real care for their students and often go above what is necessary of a college professor. Classes are challenging but fulfilling. No two dorm buildings are the same, allowing for a proper fit for different personalities. There is a large selection of on campus groups that relate both to general interest and to your field of study. Optional chapels are three times a week and are absolutely wonderful!"
Freshman,5,"Hope College is a fantastic community, where I was pushed to grow as a student, as a member of the community, as a teammate, and most importantly as a person. 
One thing that I will say I would like to see continue to develop at Hope College however is the overall diversity of the community. In my opinion, the quality of education and well-rounded college experience that I am blessed enough to encounter should be more accessible to people who don't come from well-off, stable family backgrounds.  Therefore, in my opinion, the background diversity of the student population is the biggest area where I would like to see growth on Hope College's campus."
Freshman,5,"Hope College is a great school. The Academics are very good and it means something to potential employers that you go/went to Hope. Hope students stand out. Classes are very manageable, even for an athlete. The athletic facilities are the nicest you will find at a D3. Party Scene is good, but you pretty much need to rush or play a big sport to be involved in it."
Niche User,5,"Mant international students and international experiences available. The professors are very good and obviously, know their subjects. The campus is beautiful, and Holland is a lovely city, close to the beach and the downtown area is only a short walk away with nice coffee shops, great for studying."
Freshman,5,I’m only a freshman at Hope but my experience thus far is so much better than I could have ever hoped for! I love my school so much and I’m very glad I chose to go to Hope.
Freshman,5,"I like the fact that Hope college is a small college with big college benefits. It provides me with a high quality education while also providing me with opportunities to make myself a well rounded student. I personally like the hands on approach the professors take to insure that I am being taught in a way that best suits my needs, while also pushing me to move outside of my bounds into new experiences."
Sophomore,5,"I am an international student. In Hope College, it seems like they do really care whether or not you are in Hope College! The school tries to make your life and transition to USA comfortable and smooth. People are so nice here in Holland MI. Because it is a smaller school, there are lots of opportunity but still big enough to have connections and make networks. We have a great science department and our Chemistry is one of the best among the liberal arts college. There are lots of opportunity for research too. There is an open door policy for professors so you can go in and ask anytime! Also our school is a dry campus and we take pride in that!"
Junior,5,Hope college is a great school with good students and a staff that cares. Some times you will get staff that are less focused on teaching and more focused on research. I would change the meal plan system. It is limiting and if you miss a meal you get nothing not even a credit to your account to be able to buy a meal.
Freshman,5,"I love the welcoming, cheery atmosphere. The personal connection with professors is so special. The campus makes me feel at home and there is so much support that I never feel at jeopary."
Freshman,5,"HOPE IS DOPE. Seriously, haven't regretted coming here for a second. I absolutely love it here and can't imagine myself anywhere else. The academics and community here are exactly what I was looking for."
Niche User,5,Hope College is a great college with a very friendly and open atmosphere. The community and sense of belonging is really unique to Hope because everyone tries so hard to make sure everyone is involved and feels welcome. All of the professors are very good at teaching and they are very open to working with your schedule and making sure that you personally succeed in your classes and in life.
Senior,5,"Hope College is a community of thinkers and doers. Everyone there wants to see you succeed, and the relationships made both in and out of the classroom will be lifelong. Top notch academics and a Christ-centered atmosphere make this a college that changes lives."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love Hope College. The community is amazing and everyone is so friendly. I already have lots of friends and find my classes very interesting! They are installing heated sidewalks outside of my dorm which is a little annoying because I have to walk around the construction but it'll be great once they're done.
College Junior,5,I love Hope and the only thing I really have one thing to complain about is that the professor of one of my multicultural classes was assertive to the point of being unproffessional in shutting down the opinion of one of the other students that reverse racism does occur on historically black campuses. It's been amazing though!
College Freshman,5,"Hope College is fantastic! The students, professors, and support staff are all very friendly and helpful. The people who work in the registrar's office go above and beyond to help meet your needs."
College Junior,5,"I love Hope. I love the faculty and my classes. I have made friends in every single class I have had here because of the small class sizes and fantastic learning environment here. I wish there were more animal related classes, but besides that the classes are really great. Some classes have really worked to make the learning environment good for all types of learners. There are resources available for others that need help."
College Junior,5,"Hope College is a well known school around the community and nationally. It is a great school and I am never worried about not getting a job or getting into the program I want to go to after college. Professors, the academic success center, and Professional development really helps with all things related to future jobs, interviews, resumes, etc."
College Junior,5,"Compared to larger schools, Hope doesn't have that much crime. There are always petty things. Make sure to lock bikes or things you don't want stolen. But I always feel extremely safe walking around campus. I would make sure I have friends with me when walking around the edges of campus or off campus. But there is always Campus safety one call away and there is the shuttle that goes around campus at night if needed. There are also a few emergency call poles around campus that you can go to if you're having an emergency and need someone to come to you ASAP"
College Junior,5,I loved getting placed with my roommate. Housing does a great job to make sure students are comfortable. It is important to note that housing does what it can but can't always fix the issues. The residential life staff are really fantastic. They go through a great training program and they all really love what they are doing. I loved living in Lichty my freshman year as it was smaller and a lot less drama than other dorms can have. I loved the community that was present when I lived in Vorhees. The RD and RA's there were fantastic!
College Junior,5,"My school is extremely welcoming to new students. I loved the roommate that the school matched me with and the ways it pushes freshman to get involved. There are activity fairs and a great orientation program for incoming students. I love getting to know my professors and knowing that they really want me to succeed and will go above and beyond to work with me to achieve that. I have been able to get into research easily and work closely with a professor to answer my research questions. If I did it all over again, I would still pick my school."
College Sophomore,5,"One thing that makes Hope College unique is that there are no graduate students. As a result, professors who do research, particularly in the sciences look to us undergraduates to help with their research. Because of this, it is easy to start researching, even if its only your first year at school. I was also extremely lucky to take part in one of the Day 1 research programs which helped me get involved in research before classes even started. 

Another thing I love about Hope is that all the professors care. I have had some amazing professors who love their subjects and make other excited about their subject."
College Sophomore,5,"Lots of events held by the career center, information seminars, alumni networking is great."
College Sophomore,5,"Professors know their stuff. Really want you to learn material and be successful. Caring, understanding, enthusiastic, get to know you on a personal level."
College Sophomore,5,"I always know I can count on campus safety if I need a ride back or to come help me out whenever.

I never had anything stolen."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone here is so friendly and genuinely cares about each other (students, faculty, and professors). People are very smart and want to learn/teach. Great environment with lots of resources."
College Senior,5,The professors are the reason that I think that this is one of the best colleges in the country.
College Senior,5,I feel completely safe because I know that campus safety is running 24/7 and that they will be there if I just call them.
College Freshman,5,There is little to no crime on campus here. Students usually fell pretty safe walking around alone or at night.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. I go places alone everywhere and since it is such a small community if you go to a party there are guaranteed to be people there that want to look out for you.
Junior,4,I love the community atmosphere and everyone is super friendly. The campus is beautiful and most of the professors are super understanding and helpful.
Sophomore,4,"The academics are amazing. Campus life, not so much. I have had great opportunities in terms of internships and research."
Niche User,4,"I am a prospective student of Hope College. I love everything about it and especially the theatre. The only negative thing I have to say about Hope College is that it has a tuition more expensive than most schools, but this is because it is private college. I still feel that it is worth the price and a great place to be."
Niche User,4,"Hope has a beautiful campus and amazing facilities. I have been on campus multiple times and have enjoyed every second. Hope has exceptional faith communities that help support the students. Hope is my dream college, however the cost is something that makes me hesitate."
Sophomore,4,"Hope College is an amazing college with great academics and opportunities! I am glad that I chose this college academically. I have been connected with amazing professors, programs, research opportunities, and internship communities within the community- all before my sophomore year! The social scene is a little lacking, but a great great school academically. Also, it is not very diverse, unfortunately."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Hope College and it has been a very positive experience. There are many kind and friendly people. The academics are very good and all the professors really want connect with you about their class and how you are doing. There are many ways to get involved and it is not hard to belong here. Research is easy to get involved in, as the professors are more than willing to sit down with you and tell you about their research. The dorm I am in is small but it is a very close community. The local area is great because downtown Holland is a couple streets away and the beach is only a 10 minute drive. The campus food is good but I do enjoy going home for home cooked meals."
Freshman,4,I love the HOPE Culture! I feel very welcome here. I've made a lot of great friends. The athletic programs are solid with amazing coaches. I highly recommend HOPE College to others.
Junior,4,The faculty are truly there to support you and help you develop the skills you need to influence the world around you through whatever vocation you choose. Very approachable faculty and staff make it easy to get involved with on-campus and community organizations. Being a minority at Hope can be tough but the students and faculty of color (as well as many who are not minorities) support one another and are changing and improving the climate of Hope each and every day.
Sophomore,4,"I love Hope college. I feel like I have found my place and my people there. There are so many different aspects that make it awesome. They have good sport teams, Greek life, and theater and music programs as well."
Freshman,4,"Hope is a small school in a gorgeous part of Michigan about ten minutes from Lake Michigan. The dorms are pretty average but the community in the dorms is great. The food is not great on campus but there’s quite a few great restaurants within walking distance for when you need a break from campus food. The location, student life and academics make up for the lack of air conditioning in the dorms and the food."
Sophomore,4,It is a very good school with many great opportunities to succeed and find your self. The school builds community and relationships that are life long.
Sophomore,4,"Hope was the closest school to home that I considered as a senior in high school. I was dead convinced that I would never go to Hope, as my dad is an alumni, and a very proud one at that. When I visited, I just felt this overwhelming sense of peace and belonging. I knew Hope was exactly where I was supposed to be. Looking back, I think I ended up at Hope for a reason. The other schools I looked at would have been nowhere near as accommodating when I decided to change my major, or as helpful in getting me out in four years despite major changes. The staff and faculty are always helpful and friendly, and I get along well with most of my classmates and peers. Holland is a great place to live. It's close to the beach, has a wonderful downtown area, and my church has welcomed me with open arms. I am so glad I was led to Hope, and wouldn't change anything!"
Niche User,4,"I loved Hope. I visited a while ago, and i've never met nicer people. Holland, the town, is beautiful. The campus is beautiful. I would highly recommend to anyone!"
Senior,4,I loved the smaller class sizes. It gave me the chance to get to know my peers and my professors. Some things about the college that could change is disability access and how it treats its LGBTQ students.
Junior,4,Hope College has a unique community full of friendly faces. The smaller size of the college makes it easy for students to receive personalized attention and help with their studies.
Graduate Student,4,"Hope College is an a great college to attend if you are serious about your education and want the most out of a college experience. The professors are competent in their fields, and push you to be your best."
Junior,4,"Hope College is a great environment for learning, but its dorm life is very niche and needs to be updated."
Junior,4,"Hope College's campus is in a beautiful city with extraordinary people and opportunities. The faculty is always willing to go above and beyond for the students and community. The only negative depends on your religious background. For example, Holland and Hope College have a tendency to shove the Bible in your face. As a member of the Catholic community on Hope's campus, I even find it to be overwhelming at times."
Alum,4,"Hope has options for a rigorous academic workload, but sometimes campus life feels limited. The campus is home to a vibrant Christian community."
Sophomore,4,"Great academics and professors, lots of study-abroad opportunities, beautiful campus, lots of activities on campus, and lots of school pride. However, the student body is incredibly white (like 80-some percent). LGBT and PoC discrimination is not uncommon. Downtown Holland is cute and there are a lot of other stores and restaurants a bit farther away from the downtown, but you really need a car if you want to go to any of these places. Most Greek Life parties are closed (invite-only), but there are sometimes open sports team parties. Food in the dining halls is decent – really good some days, really bad other days."
Niche User,4,The atmosphere at Hope College is an amazing experience. Hope is a tight-knit family-oriented community. I think every student should at least take a look at this school. If you are looking for wonderful people from the top to the bottom and a Christian environment than Hope is the place for you. They also have a cute downtown and have a lake not too far away. If you like snow it is the best place to be also. They really do support students and the community embraces them as well. You can see them at all of the sporting events cheering the dutch on. Hope is a place where you will not be forgotten and will be nourished and grow as a student and a person.
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love it here, there are very minimal things that I would change at this school. The only main thing that I would change, would be the number of majors that they offer here."
Freshman,4,"This college is very helpful. The faculty cares for their students. If you seek help you will get it, even if it doesn’t have to do with school. The classes are a decent size most of the time for the professor to know who you are."
Junior,4,"So, I'm a Junior at Hope college currently and I've loved it so far. They try to promote diversity and inclusion while catering to their students needs. Yes, Hope is an expensive school, but believe me between the gym, psychological services, and academic services on campus it is very much worth it."
Freshman,4,"What I loved about Hope College is that it's a small campus so you are able to recognize the other undergrads in your class which makes it much easier to approach them outside of class because they know your face as well. It is a Christian School so it is a dry campus and the parties are off campus. I love how profesors care about you as an individual and about your success. I love how there is a program for incoming freshmen that helps promote diversity. Coming in as a minority, I wasn't sure I was going to be able to make friends because of my differences with other people but the Phelps Scholars Program helped me become friends with International students and people from all over the US."
Freshman,4,"Hope College is a great school. Although it is a small college,  the quality of its academic programs is comparable to that of some of the nation's top universities. Many great professors who care about students and setting each of them up for individual success."
Senior,4,"Hope College has an extremely welcoming college community.  The academic opportunities are immense and the staff members are more than willing to help you become to best version of yourself, personally and academically.  I feel as if Hope College has grown in many ways over the past three years, specifically in their attempts to make the community more accepting and respectful of all people and opinions."
Junior,4,"Hope College is an amazing school and I think it is a gem among the many colleges in this nation. There truly is a ""Hope difference"" and my time as a student here has been filled with unique, one of a kind opportunities that I truly could not have gotten anywhere else. This past semester, I was gravely ill, but everyone from the campus chef to my professor's wife came together and offered me support."
Sophomore,4,"Hope College is a very good college for someone that is really looking for peace a quiet with no distractions, and very helpful and supportive professors. The Center of Multicultural Life is very Supportive of Minority students by creating many fun events to promote diversity. However being a minority student, there are many times when the classroom diversity lacks greatly and in certain classes, certain discussions are uncomfortable. At hope there are many great things to do but one must find them and reach out."
Freshman,4,"The community at Hope is really great.  It didn't take long to meet people that I instantly felt comfortable with.  The professors are all really good and truly care about and get to know their students.  The only down sides are that the campus is not diverse at all and not many students attend the athletic events. So far, my overall experience as been pretty good and I'm glad I chose to come here."
Junior,4,"Hope is a great place where you really feel like your professors invest in your personal success.  The classroom sizes are small, and you are encouraged to participate and ask questions.  However, it is a small school.  You likely won't know everyone at the school, but by the end of your academic career, you will probably know a solid portion of the class, for better or worse."
Junior,4,"I love Hope's community. Because of the small classes, students can really get the one-on-one attention they need with their professors. Everyone is really friendly and it's a close-knit community. As an education major, the opportunities they provide us with in terms of experiences in the classroom is phenomenal. Really my only complaint is the price."
Sophomore,4,Hope is a great home away from home. The students and faculty are so welcoming and friendly. You feel right at home the second you walk on campus for the first time. All the professors care about your success and are more than willing to help you when you need it!
Freshman,4,"Hope College was my second choice last year when applying for colleges, but now that I have been here for a few months I don't know why it wasn't my first choice. Hope College is a great place to go and Holland Michigan is a beautiful place to spend time in all year round. When I visited last year, I automatically fell in love with the professors and the programs and classes Hope has to offer. I am also a lacrosse player. At Hope college sports are really important, but the coaches know that school is more important. This makes for a wonderful balance of school work and sports along with getting closer with your team mates because everyone is going through the same thing. When you strive to do great in both sports and your classes, there is a larger sense of success that is overwhelming. I am so grateful to be at Hope College.  "
Niche User,4,"I loved Hope! It was a beautiful campus, and conveniently placed next to downtown Holland. The dorms are a little out dated, however the campus makes up for it!"
College Junior,4,"Hope is a great school for students who thrive in a smaller setting. Because of the smaller student population, professors really get to know you and are always available for extra help."
College Junior,4,I've been told by numerous sources that graduate schools and employers love Hope for the diversity and intensity of learning and the character of students.
College Junior,4,Occasionally I hear of incidents where someone has a weapon on campus but campus safety and administration are quick to get the police involved. Rapes do happen here but the school is making an attempt to prevent occurrences.
College Junior,4,"I've really loved being a college student here. Sure, Hope isn't as diverse as anyone would like it to be but it is working towards becoming a diverse college. I'm pretty sure that moving forward and looking toward the future that progress is moving towards that makes it alright right now. The classes are usually super small but even in large classes the professors try and learn the names of their students and try to get to know them personally. I really love that about Hope."
College Sophomore,4,Small classes make the professor/student ratio really beneficial for your learning.
College Freshman,4,"Campus safety is pretty good. Campus Security sends out emails whenever something happens, and they try to stay in touch with students and keep them safe for the most part."
College Sophomore,4,I love Hope College because of the social atmosphere and how everyone is friendly.
College Sophomore,4,I feel like after college I will be prepared for a job and be able to get a job.
College Sophomore,4,I love the school because I have made a lot of friends through experiences like Nykerk.
College Junior,4,"There is a few greek houses here, but they are all local chapters. Non-Greek students often have friends in the Greek community, but of course the Greek students are very tightly knit."
College Junior,4,Fans love going to see the games. There is a huge amount of team spirit and support here for athletics.
College Sophomore,4,"All of my sciences classes have been fantastic. My classes are usually small. My largest class was probably accelerated general chemistry, but we didn't even fill up the entire lecture hall. Outside of the sciences, my courses have been good, with the possible exception of English 113."
College Sophomore,4,I was extremely lucky to be put into the freshman STEM dorm. Since everyone had similar classes it made it easy to study together and help one another. Our RAs and RD were extremely present and friendly which helped keep the hall together. We had a nice community.
College Sophomore,4,"Good RA selecting process, who really make a difference in dorm life.

Rooms are pretty small, but good facilities. Could update some older dorms/furniture though."
College Sophomore,4,The classes are generally small and one on one time with the professor is fairly easy to set up.
College Sophomore,4,There are great internship opportunities for students.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel completely safe walking around campus at night. As a girl, I am cautious, but it does not derail my life."
College Sophomore,4,I loved living in the dorms. Freshmen year was great because of the friends I made in Scott Hall. I would not trade them for anything.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the community at Hope. With such a small campus, students find it really easy to connect with one another."
College Senior,4,This school always has job fairs and things like that to really give us the best opportunities.
College Senior,4,"The rooms aren't that great, but I love that everything is situated in close proximity to everything else."
College Senior,4,The school is very involved with varsity sports and attending the games to support our team is strongly encouraged.
College Senior,4,I have never been in an academic environment like Hope College where the professors and faculty care about each student as an individual and are invested in their lives and in their future success.
College Freshman,4,Hope College helps graduating students get connected and find jobs after they finish up with their studies.
College Freshman,4,Professors show a genuine interest in the students overall success at school.
College Junior,2,When most people think about greek life they think about the many parties one hears whispers about. I've also heard about the hazing rituals. Even the better greek organizations have uncomfortable hazing rituals...
College Sophomore,2,I haven't been to many parties but the ones I did go to were not my scene.
College Sophomore,2,Hope wants to say that it has diversity but walk down any side walk and you will see fifteen white students for every one black student.
College Junior,2,They are not nationally based organizations and either are great or the worst thing for students.
College Freshman,2,There are a few cases of intolerance of race in campus.
College Senior,2,"Greek Life is there to participate if you want to. Second semester is when rush happens and when underclassmen are given offers to join sororities/fraternities. None of the greek life organizations on campus are ""national"" and present at other universities. These are just groups that were made up at Hope a long time ago. Greek Life is for some people and not for others. If you like to party, it is best to join greek life, but it is easy enough to meet friends joining other clubs and activities."
College Freshman,2,There are few minorities on campus
College Freshman,2,"The academics are not what I was looking for (much easier), and with the mix of people on campus I have a hard time fitting in -- aspects of the student body are rather homogenous. So far I am displeased with the school, especially the services offered. The professors are enthusiastic and seem to care about their students, though."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Many fraternities and sororities engage in several parties a week. These students are usually not particularly motivated in their academics, and the parties draw them further away from their studies as well as their faith."
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone is stuck in a 1950s mindset on this issue. There needs to be better healthcare for women (yes, we are adults and if I need reproductive care it is a staple need)."
College Junior,2,The dining services at Hope tries but they are still not good. The food at the underclassmen dining hall is awful and most people hate eating there.  The upperclassmen dining hall is a little better but expensive.  There is not a lot of varity and the meal plans are expensive.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of underage drinking and use of drugs.
College Junior,2,It's a small town so there is only so many choices.  The worst thing is that basically everything closes at 9pm sharp on weekdays except IHOP.
College Junior,2,It is a completely dry campus.  Alcohol is not allowed on campus at all.  The noise level rules are also enforced after dark.
College Freshman,2,The weather is fantastic from the beginning of the year until the end of September and after that begins the seemingly endless Michigan winter that is a real disadvantage on such a massive campus.
College Freshman,2,"Pretty much all of the ""cool"" social events consist of drugs and alcohol, which isn't very cool to me.  Police typically only step in when it's extreme."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life contributes to the parties that aren't supposed to happen, and, among girls, increases the drama during rush."
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few lots open to students and you lose some with the snow. Also, the parking allowed on some of the streets makes driving through them or crossing them scary."
College Junior,2,"There is nowhere to park off campus if you live on campus. On campus parking is very costly and typically far from the dorms. Cottages have good parking but permits are expensive. If you commute or live off campus, there are many places along the street to park but they fill up very quickly. "
College Junior,2,There are scholarships available based on high school GPA. They are typically for low dollar value however. There are also no returning student scholarships or scholarships based on intended field. Do not expect to get a lot of money from the school. 
College Sophomore,2,Greeks think they are special for being in Greeklife but no one else cares about them.
College Sophomore,2,It is very windy here and it snows and rains more than normal.
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not a fan of Greek Life. Some chapters work to help the community, but most are just there to party."
College Sophomore,2,For the most part as I said everyone on campus is very nice and are willing to help you out but there are some exceptions.
College Sophomore,2,There are some restaurants that are in walking distance but they all close early and the fast food restaurants are not that far away but you would have to cross an interstate.
College Sophomore,2,I would say that the shuttles to the supermarket are convenient but they are only available during a certain time frame and if you want to go else where like to buy close you have either have your own car or try to ask someone who does.
College Freshman,2,I do not pay attention to the athletic life on campus.
College Senior,2,"There are often spots available near campus buildings, but parking permits are expensive and you will pay the consequences without one. "
College Junior,2,The nursing school is extremely competitive and demanding!
College Junior,2,It snows SO much in Holland due to the lake effect.  We never have snow days which stinks but the school does a good job of keeping buildings heated and side walks clear.
College Junior,2,"There are three dining halls on campus: Phelps, Cook, and the Kletz.  Phelps is open to all students, but its food is only mediocre.  The main dishes on the menu can be pretty bland, but you can usually find a decent sandwich or salad.  Cook is open to upperclassmen and students in certain dorms, and it has a better reputation than Phelps.  It is smaller and offers fewer choices, but the food is of better quality.  The Kletz is more of a cafe style than a cafeteria.  All students can purchase food at the Kletz with cash or a pre-loaded debit card, but upperclassmen can use their meal plans there.  There are not a lot of choices and the service can be slow, but the food is very good."
College Sophomore,2,"I am not in Greek Life but many of my friends are. Can be a great way to meet people but a lot of hazing happens during pledging. The college tends to turn the other cheek when they know this occurs. There are certain rules frats/sororities are supposed to follow regarding this but do not. A lot of people I know would come home crying every night from being hazed. So, make your own decision before deciding to rush."
College Freshman,2,"Well even though this campus is very friendly and a christian community, there are still a majority of white students here.  It would be kind of difficult to locate students of a different ethnic group but it is not impossible."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Politaical and religious beliefs vary, but most religious beliefs are RCA, CRC, Catholic or Protestant.  Being a Christian college, few students are not this.  Also, the gay presence is not huge due to it being a Christian college, although I know many that have graduated.  Most students are white or black (more white), and a few other minorities with a larger Japanese population noted due to arrangements with a ""sister college"" in Japan."
College Freshman,2,"Hope is definitely primarily white, but is currently working at creating more diversity.  I have been surprised at how many international students there actually are."
College Freshman,2,"Hope transportation service say their always available; I called and they never picked me up twice. There are no 18+ clubs around Holland and the parties that occur off campus almost always get busted every weekend. Even though these few issues cause me to give a bad review, I still feel like  parties at Hope are not all that bad and they are usually filled with dancing and having a good time, which I like."
College Senior,2,"For a small campus, the parking matches. It's difficult to figure out where to park and when you do get a ticket it's for a terrible reason."
College Freshman,2,It tends to snow a lot in Michigan but classes rarely get cancelled due to weather
College Senior,2,Only Provided at Night – The only transportation provided happens at night and only on the designated route. While Hope's campus is rather small it is a little inconvenient that there is no transportation to off campus locations.
College Freshman,2,"Not Like Home – I can not say that campus food is as great as home. There are only two dining halls, and the school's mini restaurant. Most people, specifically freshmen and sophomores all eat together in one dining hall, where the food is some days average, and some days there is just nothing that seems good. The other places on campus, in terms of buying food, are way better, so I've heard. I like that when you get a certain number of credits, you can use your meal plan at the schools mini restaurant-thingy, or the better of the two dining halls, because being stuck to one would suck for the expanse of time one would stay here. However, I really think that one's mood affects it all too. If you don't feel good, or feel like eating, nothing will seem good."
Alum,1,"Hope has no diversity what so ever. The dorms are in poor condition, with a few expectations. They waste their money on things that they do not need. Their athletic facilities are lacking for sure. Only positive I experienced at hope college was the proximity to downtown Holland and the beach. That being said you can only experience these things for a limited time because of the climate. Unless you are going to be a nurse their are numerous better options in the state of Michigan alone, much less the United States. I would never pay that much for college to get so little back ever again."
Niche User,1,I do not know if I would recommend Hope to a friend. Do you feel safe at Hope? The rape rate is almost 3 times the national average in Holland.
Freshman,1,"As others have mentioned, Hope has many positive attributes from an outsiders perspective, but once you are thrown into the culture, it turns out to be shockingly antithetical. Applying, I saw an academically competitive, semi-diverse, open minded and welcoming college. Once I stepped in to life here I realized that the smiles and waves that everyone greets you with are really the farthest you will go in your relationships. I have never felt so alone, surrounded by so many people. As someone mentioned earlier, if you don't behave like a Christian camp counselor the ENTIRE time, you won't find your ""place"". This isn't the fault of any one person, but rather the result of an ignorant and unaccepting  culture that is caught in a bubble of pretentious attitudes. For such a prestigious institution they can be really d*** ignorant."
Freshman,1,"Being an international student adjusting to the American culture is hard enough, but adjusting to the culture of Holland, Michigan is something completely different. Even if you're an American, it'll make you FEEL like a foreigner. You'll visit this college once and think, ""Wow, everyone's so nice!"" because everyone says hi to you and smiles while you're touring. And it stays that way. This is as close as you'll ever feel to them. Making deep, complex relationships is almost impossible here. They'll try their hardest to make you feel so average and unimpressive, because that makes you easier to replace if they ever decide you're inconveniencing them. Individuality is a foreign concept here. If you don't act like a Christian camp counselor 24/7, this is not the place for you."
College Sophomore,1,"Please don't go here if you don't come from a close-minded background. I came here for an education and it has been a nightmare. The administration is terrible and pretend that the only people who exist are straight, white, middle class kids. We had a pastor speak who was for murdering homosexuals and you have to be referred by a psychologist at CAPS to join the LBGT group on campus (and it's not even a recognized group). Also, I had a teacher who used to treat black students like third rate students and would be very rude and curt to them. Everyone is friendly, but only because it helps them with their Jesus points. No one really cares about you until you follow their erratic behavior, which consists of going to church EVERY Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and then on Sunday. Also, differing opinions are strongly discouraged. If you even utter the words ""Obama"" or ""liberal"" people look at you funny. Also, the parties suck. Hope has been absolutely unbearable."
College Freshman,1,The financial aid is fine to set up with but Hope does not offer as many scholarships as other schools I looked at. I hate to say it but I got several thousand more in scholarships from Calvin College than from Hope.
College Junior,1,"Michigan weather sucks.  It's always cold, rainy, or snowing."
College Sophomore,1,There is way too much staff and faculty parking and there are never open parking spots for students. 
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't study, you usually end up studying.  "
College Sophomore,1,The technology at Hope College  is very outdated. 
College Sophomore,1,"Lack of diversity is a problem at Hope. The Phelps Scholars program certainly helps with diversity, but it doesn't solve the problem. We need to work to have a more ethnically, religiously, politically, sexually, and economically diverse campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at Hope College is the WORST. They really need to work on changing the system. Parking passes are extremely expensive, there are no available spots, and if there happens to be a spot available it is very far away from the dorms."
College Freshman,1,It rains almost everyday here. The weather is terrible.
College Sophomore,1,Hope is not a diverse school. Being a minority here is really rare. It's a majority white campus but they do have quite a few international students which is fun. Also they have a freshman program called Phelps Scholars. It's a diversity program on campus which is great because you live together so you don't have as big as a culture shock. As a minority you just have to get out there and enjoy all hope has to offer. Sometimes it's really hard and some people are ignorant about minorities but if you try to help them understand it's good. Most of the time I'm the only minority in my classes but it's not that terrible. But at Hope you can always find a place you belong and shouldnt feel uncomfortable.
College Sophomore,1,"The hazing was awful as my roommate told me, and all they do it have themed parties where they drink til they pass out. They don't have certain standards that they have to uphold to or things that they do to be active with the campus they just only party."
College Junior,1,"The RAs, when they do their jobs properly, can be strict, but most of them don't go out of the way to punish people (though it has happened before). The problem is that they have really stupid rules that they take really seriously (no opposite-gender visitors after midnight is the big one) and you can get written up for that (but no one ever gets caught). However, when there's really big problems with rules, such as LGBT bullying/discrimination, the college essentially looks away (because LGBT people aren't protected equally under the school's constitution), and when there's racial slurs or discrimination, they send out emails to students and staff to try and give a good PR image, but they really don't do anything to actively solve the problem."
College Junior,1,Hope is probably one of the worst places because they are so proud that according to a survey most of their students don't drink or do drugs.  But meanwhile in the Greek life system there is intense hazing (that i've experienced myself) and it's very unethical and Hope doesn't care at all.  I've even talked to authority figures and they never do anything about it. It's very corrupt.  But the alcohol policy is enforced greatly on campus.  It is very strict.
College Junior,1,"Hope College has has more than 2 incidences of outright racial slurs and racist posters in the past 2 years. Hope is outwardly disrespectful towards homosexual people, check the mission statement it is even addressed in there. I have never spoken to someone who is not either Christian or agnostic. Peoples that are not white are less than 100 at a school of 3200. They all live in the same hall for the international merit program and are not integrated into the community well."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Greek Life at Hope College seems to serve only one purpose - parties.  Relationship building is often stated as a reason for joining greek life at Hope, however, that seems to be less important than the social life/parties that it provides.  None of the organizations are nationally recognized, which means less accounatability and little involvement in the community."
College Sophomore,1,"Diversity is one of Hope's fatal flaws. There is plenty of subtle diversity within religion and race, but statistically most students are white and Christian, unfortunately."

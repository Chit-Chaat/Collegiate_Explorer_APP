Junior,5,"Transferring in from a community college as a junior, McDaniel has been one of the better institutions that I have attended. The professor's here are well accredited and are always willing to assist the students; the students are mostly friendly and seem to enjoy the school as well; and the environment here is just overall very positive. The school is so inclusive of any and everyone."
Junior,5,"I believe that these type of classes tend to be slightly more difficult compared to an in-person class since it is the students responsibility to make time for the course and attempt to garner the material being taught without the physical presence of a professor. The instructors that I have had for online courses so far are definitely willing to help the students when needed but it is up to the students to reach out and address their issues if they have any. There are so many ways that you can receive assistance through an online course here at McDaniel whether it be tutoring (sometimes free), a scheduled meeting with a professor, or reaching out to one of the fellow students in the course (via BlacKBoard or Microsoft Teams)."
Sophomore,5,"The professors I had did a pretty good job of adjusting to the change. They always let their students know that they were available, always updated assignments, and were always open to questions, no matter the amount. They added extra resources to help with some course work and added more content to their ""Blackboard"" sections to also help. If there was ever an issue with differentiating schedules they were accommodating and understanding. (This is subject to my personal experience)"
Freshman,5,"I was undecided which college I wanted to go to, but that all changed after I attended the McDaniel College’s Admitted Students Day Event. This event gave me a family like environment exposure from the campus atmosphere to the friendliness of the students and professors throughout the day. They had agendas that gave me an overview of school and campus life. The panels of students sharing their experience also allowed me to envision what student life on campus can be like away from home. I was able to meet professors’ of majors I was interested in studying and they discussed courses they teach, their teaching styles, and expectations.  They also discussed how the classes will prepare you in the future.  I also enjoyed hearing the alumni share their experience at McDaniel College and after graduating. This whole experience helped me solidify my decision to attend McDaniel College. This school does not limit what you can accomplish with the major or minor you pick."
Junior,5,"I love that there are small class sizes, I have cultivated great relationships with my professors and feel valued!"
Junior,5,"Due to my great relationships with professors, I was able to have a very productive online learning experience."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus vibe, how everyone wants to help each other succeed.  The professors are amazing, and want to help you achieve all of your goals"
Sophomore,5,"McDaniel has provided me with many opportunities on campus, faculty interested in your success, and amazing community. If you are interested in athletics, there are many D3 teams for the school as well as intermedial teams.  McDaniel also has a plethora of clubs to choose from for when not in a class, studying, or hanging out with other friends."
Freshman,5,"Everything was almost perfect. Teachers and roommates were so generous to help my study. During fall break, I and my classmates took research on a high school educating system. It was an amazing experience for my steps to make a change in education."
Freshman,5,Academics are very good and the professors are highly qualified and they are very good. Professors are always available to help and they want to see you succeed. The campus is very pretty and buildings are easy to find. The population is pretty diverse and everyone is able to find a good group of people that they fit with. The food is not that great but there are some other options. The freshman dorms are not super great but the on campus apartments are very nice. There are always activities that are going on so there is always something to do. The local town is pretty boring but you can still find things to do. Overall my first year has been great and I am happy at McDaniel.
Freshman,5,I love the overall vibe of the college.  I like how the college is not too big. I like how the school is small and too big. And how the mess hall is modern. I also love how the school is more biology oriented then most schools.
Freshman,5,I love the opportunites it has given me in freshman year. Its helped me find internships. I love the sports programs.
Freshman,5,There is always someone willing to help with whatever problem I have whether it’s teachers or other faculty which I appreciate and so really live the small class sizes
Niche User,5,"McDaniel had wonderful faculty, they made sure I was comfortable and had everything I needed in order to complete the college process. The students were extremely friendly and told me of their experiences at McDaniel. The campus was not too big but it was not too small. The dorms were a great size, pretty spacious. I like how my adviser continues to keep in contact with me. I also received plenty of scholarship money."
Niche User,5,"Thanks to Gail Hamilton in the registrar's office; she's  # 1 - so helpful and polite. She takes her time to assist, is a pleasure to speak with RE: class information, and an asset to the college."
Freshman,5,"Great campus, wonderful courses, outstanding staff. The student to teacher ratio is ideal, and the community feel is very warm."
Graduate Student,5,McDaniels programs and classes are great! they provide real world knowledge that is relevant to the applicable workforce field. They have a small campus rural feel and small class sizes!
Niche User,5,"I went on a college visit to McDaniel about a week ago. I liked the campus and the size of the school, but what I was most interested in was the football program. I feel like I can grow to become a better player in that environment."
Niche User,5,"McDaniel College offers a variety of student resources. The campus is very clean and everyone I've met there has been nothing but helpful to me. I want to continue my education at McDaniel not only because it is a liberal arts college, but because of the friendly environment it provides."
Sophomore,5,A welcoming atmosphere. Teachers are willing to work with students. There are many clubs and organizations to join.
Sophomore,5,"McDaniel College has a very small campus.  I like that we get to know each other because it is so small.  I wasn't interested in a large campus where people are complete strangers.  At McDaniel we come from all backgrounds, races, religions and it is very close knit."
Freshman,5,"McDaniel is absolutely incredible. The people are friendly and open, the professors are supportive and willing to help, the athletics are top notch. I've never been so happy in one place. It has everything I could have ever wished for and I know I picked the right place for me. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"As a freshman I was so very scared to move on campus. I was scared of classes, my roommates (I have a triple), making new friends, and being away from home. All of my fears have been resolved. To begin, my professors are all really sweet. My first year seminar professor and peer mentor are very helpful with both academics and more personal problems. The classes aren't impossible (fingers crossed) and the content is enjoyable. Next, my roommates were both nice. One of them actually moved rooms but my other roommate has become my best friend. Im so glad we met. Last, there are plenty of resources for students who get homesick, stressed, or depressed. Everyone on campus, students and staff alike, are super sweet and want to help you. Everyone is nice. The hill is my new home and I love it here."
Sophomore,5,I love how welcoming everybody on campus is. All the professors are quick to help. I have never had any issues getting a problem resolved. I just love the sense of community and the size of the campus helps a lot with that.
Sophomore,5,"I am enjoying my experience and have learned alot so far.  There really isn't much I would change. I am also enjoying playing football,  that is also teaching me alot about discipline and leadership. "
College Sophomore,5,They have many job fairs
College Sophomore,5,They care about lot about the students
College Junior,5,"Class size is wonderful, and there are many different course options."
College Junior,5,"The students show great pride in their school, and the athletic faculties are fantastic."
College Sophomore,5,"First, McDaniel College has a great Exercise Science program for undergraduates. Most of the professors are experts in their field. I love the advisors, peers and staff at McDaniel. A lot of people are helpful at this school. I feel safe and ready to learn at any time when I'm at McDaniel College."
College Freshman,5,Love it! Was an amazing choice
College Freshman,5,Bowl Stadium where everyone can attend.  Beautiful with new turf
College Freshman,5,This has been the most positive experience as a student.  I have learned so much after only completing a year there. Can not wait to go back.
College Sophomore,5,"As a member of one of the variety athletic teams, I can say it has been the best part about my college career thus far."
College Freshman,5,"Our campus safety does look out for us. They make sure people don't have to walk alone at night, and they send sick, drunk people to the hospital when need be. I respect them very much."
College Sophomore,5,"The safety and security on campus is excellent. The campus police make it their duty to resolve an issue the student has and or experiencing. When there is a crime an alert is sent out for students to remain in doors, but that happens only once in a blue moon. Overall, they do take special security measures to be on the safe side in case anything happens. I feel that I am very safe as long I am on campus."
College Freshman,5,"I love my school because the students are the priority, and advisors will do what they have to do to ensure the students' success. At bigger universities, there is not individualized attention. McDaniel provides individual attention. There are so may sources to make sure students are successful. They will make McDaniel affordable by working with the students. The campus is nice, and the freshmen dorms are spacious. I would not choose another school because without McDaniel, I would not have that attention. The people are cordial. People at McDaniel care and what the best for their students. They have places to facilitate anxiety.They make adjustments for those with disabilities. Mental health is also important to the school. There are places on campus to relieve stress such as the gym where I workout."
College Freshman,5,"McDaniel provided me with a lot of financial aid. Actually, when I originally received my financial aid letter, there was about $5,000 that wasn't covered from the full cost. I emailed the director of aid and explained to her that I was an independent student and neither of my parents had good enough credit to take out a loan, and she found another $4,000 for me to have. So I work under federal work study and full time in the summers and pay the remaining $1,000. Jobs on campus are awesome, by the way. I work for the Call Center and asa Writing Tutor, and it rocks.

I have heard multiple stories as well, where students get better financial aid at another school but they want to go to McDaniel, and they email Financial Aid with the aid from the other college, and McDaniel matches it. If they want you, they make a point to make the effort to get you to come here."
College Sophomore,5,Tons of financial aid and scholarships are available.
College Sophomore,5,The main road is 2 minutes from campus and literally has every food place you can want.
College Sophomore,5,Science professors at Mcdaniel College are great. They really love when students go to their office hours and they are super helpful. Many opportunities for internships.
College Junior,5,Many places close to campus to go eat.
College Sophomore,5,"Top 130 liberal arts schools in the nation. One of the best schools on the Northeast, the accolades continue"
College Senior,5,they offer the best entertainment and usually are the way you find out how to enjoy your friday or saturday night
College Sophomore,5,"I love the small campus and the fact that the teachers are so helpful. This school not only exceeds academically but also succeeds with providing students with an engaging student life. McDaniel offers inexpensive off-campus trips, a variety of on campus events and services (such as the shuttle, gym, convenient store, coffee shop and an IT help desk) to ensure students are well taken care of and can enjoy their time on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"We have ma and pa shops walking distance from the campus. There are a bunch of options. Also chain restaurants are found on route 140, which is the road our school is off of. Some of these restaurants are walking distance (if you like walking) but many require a car to get to. Many of the places around town offer a student discount."
College Sophomore,5,"We have plenty of computer labs so you don't necessarily have to bring a laptop; however, I enjoy having my own personal computer just in case. You get like 400 free prints a semester, which should be plenty. In the library with have a tech center, where you can go if your computer isn't working. The computers are all relatively new and work fine. The internet access is fine in my opinion, you have wireless access anywhere on campus. Each dorm room does come equipped with an Ethernet plug if you want a more secure connection."
College Sophomore,5,"The teachers really care and are super helpful! They each have office hours which are set apart as a time for students to come see them. Also, you can schedule appointments with them if their office hours don't work for you. The McDaniel Plan must be completed in addition to your major. It includes science courses, math, English, language, social studies, creative expression and textual analysis course. Some of these credits can be earned at the same time from one individual course. We have a campus in Budapest, Hungary and all credits and financial aid will transfer there."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm a psychology major and the department is great. There are plenty of opportunities to do research with your professors and psychology majors can continue on to a 5-year master's program, which will earn you a master's in psychology. The workload provides a good challenge to students."
College Sophomore,5,"Though we're a D3 school sports are still a very large part of our campus. Tailgating is very big at our school; in fact the weather channel rated us number 6 in the nation for best tailgating schools. A homecoming game can bring about 10000 people out, including community members, alumni, teachers, parents and students. Our football team isn't the greatest but our school pride is huge. There are 12 intramural sports and about half the student body participates in at least one of them. We have a weight room and new gym that includes a cardio area upstairs. Our gymnasium is the size of 3 college basketball courts and can seat 4000 people. We also have a relatively new football field, the Ravens used our field for training so its high quality turf."
College Junior,5,Its a genuine town. Its great that it hasn't been converted into a college town. The college kids stick to their dorms/campus and mostly leave the natives alone.
College Junior,5,"Getting off campus there are a hundred places to eat in Westminster, you just need a car."
College Freshman,5,"I'm in the mathematics and foreign language (French) programs here: they are both incredible.  Professors are there to help you and they will do whatever they can to help with anything.  Workload is manageable, curriculum is manageable, facilities are good.  Overall, I've been happy and impressed with my programs."
College Freshman,5,Football field was just redone within the past few years.  The fitness center is amazing.  Great places to exercise.
College Freshman,5,"Programs here are excellent.  Professors are awesome for helping with every step of the degree process, from deciding what your major is to mapping out your time here."
College Sophomore,5,This is probably one of the best places to study exercise science
College Sophomore,5,Exercise Science program here is outstanding
College Sophomore,5,"They really make sure that one is really educated in whatever their major is, so one can be successful in their career."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are very easy to talk to and reach, they are very easy to communicate with about academics, social life, and life in general."
College Sophomore,5,The campus police are great and very helpful to the students.
Sophomore,4,"McDaniel is very friendly and welcoming. Not only generous with scholarships, but always engaged with incoming and returning students, and they always try to put on some activities around campus to add more fun. I've met some great professors here that actually care about students. Of course every institution has some things to work on (such as- but not limited to- more awareness of diversity- addressing issues included) But with a better understanding of the minorities, the school would prosper 100%."
Sophomore,4,"I love college! They offer really good support systems and the professors care about your success. All though there is not a big party life every night, all of the students are really nice and supportive."
Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors were on top of it and kept us in communication when doing online. I had to talk to one professor about communicating with us, but for the most part, online learning was alright. I personally do not like online classes but I think the school did a good job when it came to it. The one thing I  would have liked to see was more communication from the college."
Niche User,4,"McDaniel has a strong value in treating its students as family members. The administration fully supports and guide every student by providing educational and emotional assistance for those students in need. The administration also has given students an educational and professional career plan that fully benefits the students' skills and experience. The facilities on the campus are very up to date, especially for students who major in kinesiology, business, etc. The campus is very safe and has a ""security"" watch for the campus."
Sophomore,4,"I like the campus size. The class size is nice because it is smaller so you feel more connected to your professors and peers, allowing you t have a better understanding."
Freshman,4,"I love the friendly nature of McDaniel but I feel it would be better if we were given more freedom during school orientation and had a choice as to what we wanted to learn about the school before we started. There are so many things I didn't know when we began classes but there were too many useless things that I was forced to learn. I feel I should've been shown where my classes were, taught more about understanding my schedule and the campus itself. Many of us felt as though we were in middle school again and were forced to do a few too many uneccesary things when we could've used that time in so many other ways. The food is also another problem, some days there are a few good things but most days the food is sloppy."
Senior,4,Overall I have enjoyed my time at McDaniel College. I joined a sorority which has gotten me very involved on campus and has brought new people into my life. The campus is small which is great for me because of the smaller class room sizes. You get to know your professors and they get to know you! There are constant changes occur such as the addition of the new Kinesiology section located in Gill which is amazing since that is my major and I really get to utilize it well.
Alum,4,"McDaniel College was certainly the best college for me. First and foremost, it offers its students very fairly well furnished merit scholarships, which is a great incentive to enroll wherever you go. Being a small private liberal arts college, the class sizes are small and the students often form close relationships with their professors. The downside is that they cut a number of programs for no reason, and there's a huge disconnect between the administration & students."
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience at McDaniel College has been solid for the most part. Being that it is a small school, it was easy to get acclimated to being able to find things and places. People are friendly and easy going for the most part and there aren't many problems going around campus. The learning experience is great but with it being a small school sometimes there isn't much to do for fun."
Freshman,4,Of course the meal plan is relatively expensive but the food options are not fantastic. The campus is great looking. Seems to be well kept. The should be a  regular shuttle for local venues. No way for for students to visit stores safety unless they walk or have a car. This year music curriculum is being taken away. This is part of why we enrolled.
Alum,4,"McDaniel College is a small close knit school. There is big emphasis on the athletic and sorority and fraternity life, it seems like everyone is a part of at least one. They have very excellent science and education programs, stay away from the business program though."
Niche User,4,"I like that the get the students busy. They offer so many things to do including clubs, study abroad, different trips on the weekend, and fun events."
Sophomore,4,Food in dining hall needs improvement.  Athletic teams and community atmosphere on campus is awesome.
Sophomore,4,"It is overall very good, but the food here really needs to change. they have us pay so much and yet we do not have hours that work very well and the food it not as well cooked as they make it out to be. The women in charge has been trying to do as little as possible."
Freshman,4,"I am a social work major, and I love the program. The professors in it are amazing. I definitely made the right choice by coming to Mcdaniel, but it isn't for everyone. The people here are generally very nice and helpful, and have a lot of hobbies. No one does just one thing. Despite the fact that the town of Westminster isn't that great, the school community will keep you busy. If you utilize your resources here, you will be very happy with all opportunities that come your way! The food was AWFUL the first semester this year, but after many many student complaints, they are now improving the overall food quality, so that's good. You definitely feel a sense of community at Mcdaniel, which is something I was really looking for in a school and have found here. It is really easy for you to find people you chick with! There is so much to be involved with. You will find organizations that match your views and hobbies, and classes that fit what you're looking for."
Junior,4,McDaniel College is a small but mighty liberal arts community of caring employees and a good student body. McDaniel soars in academia but its short comings are its amenities. McDaniel has plenty room for improvement when it comes to residence and dining halls but is relatively bearable when compared to other types of institutions.
Sophomore,4,"I greatly enjoy my time at McDaniel College. This is an institution that is undeniably more focused on turning a profit than education, and yet, recognizes that the best way to make a profit is to teach well. Its corps of competent professors, experienced and skilled both in their subject areas AND in teaching, make this for-profit institution a college worth attending."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently attending McDaniel College in my second semester of my sophomore year. I am majoring in Social Work, minoring in Spanish, and I am a collegiate softball player. While applying to McDaniel, they gave me the opportunity to tour the campus multiple times, sit in on a few classes, and meet advisors in my desired major. Those opportunities are what convinced me to attend McDaniel College. I was able to see how nice it would be for my family to be able to take a short drive to watch all of my softball games. I also saw how nice it was to have less than 20 people in every class because it allows me to have excellent relationships with the teachers and my fellow classmates. Lastly, my current advisors in the Social Work major have helped me map out my career path and have given me incredibly good advice. I now have a very clear idea of what my future looks like thanks to my awesome professors and advisors!"
Freshman,4,"The social scene, great academics, and strong support for the athletics programs have made me really enjoy my experience at McDaniel so far."
Junior,4,"I like that the staff has been very helpful.  I am always able to go in and ask questions and feel comfortable.  The school is 5 minutes from my home so I love to commute and stay with my family, friend and work."
Junior,4,"I have been a student at McDaniel College for one semester.  This is a small college in a small town, but close to Baltimore and Washington, D.C.  The campus is wonderful and the teachers have been very good.  I would highly recommend this college."
Junior,4,"I have had a good experience with McDaniel College. The professors are generally nice and care about what they are teaching. The class sizes are really small, I've never had a class with more than 20 people in it. The campus is beautiful, especially in the fall. The support for learning differences is top notch, I would no doubt give that an A+. If you want a place with good support, look no further, McDaniel is as good as it gets.

 On the other hand, the party scene is pretty awful, don't believe the B-, I would give it a D+. The food in the dining hall is really bad, get a place with a kitchen as soon as you can. I don't know where they are getting the numbers about payments but I am paying $45,000 for this coming school year, and full price is $56,000; nobody pays full price but keep that in mind if you're strapped for cash.

If you want a small school with good support, come here. If you want a party school, go somewhere else"
Alum,4,"I had a very positive experience at McDaniel College. I feel that the education I received was extensive enough to allow me to succeed in a variety of fields, even those outside of my major. The majority of professors I had were very knowledgeable, helpful, and interested in their students' individual needs. Classes were always small enough that you could get individual attention from instructors if needed. One thing I would have loved to see was a more diverse student body and more up-to-date housing for resident students."
Sophomore,4,I love how small McDaniel's classrooms are. The only recommended change is to have more security on campus at night.
Junior,4,"McDaniel is a great place to come to bond with the teachers and gain valuable learning experiences. On top of that, the campus is small for the purpose of not having to walk very far from the dorm room to the classes. The advisors at the school are very helpful and will keep a student on track as to where they want to go in their careers."
Sophomore,4,"I like the fact that everyone on campus is friendly to each other and very helpful. If I could change one thing about McDaniel College, it would be that the college would be a University. I feel as though more people would apply to come here if it was not a liberal arts school. The college is very good with academics and sports teams are making improvements."
Freshman,4,I love McDaniel College because it feels like home and everyone on campus help you with anything if you ever need help 
College Sophomore,4,They do great for the community
College Sophomore,4,I am not very involved in sports so I do not know.
College Sophomore,4,The education is great but it is very costly.
College Freshman,4,Even though competitive athletics is not a huge focus in the school the teams are loved by all and the games often draw HUGE crowds.
College Freshman,4,"A bit slow at times when responding to things such as financial aid, often not giving concrete dates."
College Junior,4,I've heard many good things about Greek life and housing that McDaniel offers.
College Junior,4,"I would pick McDaniel again if I had a choice. The campus is beautiful, the students are kind, and the professor are wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,"I like the options we have for internships. The alumni network is great, but it can better when giving lectures to the current students so we can expect what to see in the real world."
College Sophomore,4,There are professors that are experts in their courses. I loved the Exercise Science class I took my freshman year because it built a foundation of career building for the student interested in this field.
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe walking around on campus. We have many campus safety rules that prevent any problems from happening. We have many resources helping prevent sexual assault and alcohol abuse.
College Sophomore,4,I love living on campus because you really get the feel for the college life. I love having a roommate that you can get along with during your year at college. It's really convenient to live on campus when you don't have money to get a car and getting to class isn't a hassle at all.
College Junior,4,The teachers really want the students to take from the class and use it in everyday life.
College Junior,4,"From experience I witnessed first hand that you get a lot of people from different places you never heard of before, which is always fascinating to get know those people."
College Sophomore,4,everyone is so friendly and welcoming ands far it has a great experience when it comes to meeting new people
College Junior,4,"All of my friends that have graduated in the last two years have found work and went on to do amazing things such as study at M.I.T for their Master's, or were hand selected by companies like Google to undergo a rigorous interview process to be part of their technology development team. A degree from this school will take you as far as a liberal arts degree will in today's world, which I believe has grown to be quite far recently. The school also offers you the experience to learn how create opportunities for yourself so that when you're independent you can adapt and work effectively."
College Junior,4,"The class size is as you would expect for a small private school. There are times where classes I have taken only have around eight students in them. I eventually ended up taking my final Mandarin Chinese class by myself, so it became a one-on-one session twice a week with my professor (lots of fun there). The classroom is always open for questions in just about any disciple, and the variety of classes will keep students interested. The quality of the courses overall is average, but lacking in some programs like the Computer Science program. Some of the courses in the C.S. program are a bit dated in my opinion."
College Junior,4,"The residential community provides some safety issues as the campus lies along one of the more dangerous streets in the city, but Campus Safety patrols the campus diligently for 24 hours a day. The city police are also helpful at times, but I've only seen them called when the situation requires an ambulance or shutting down multiple/massive parties."
College Junior,4,"Though it isn't the best, attending McDaniel College has been one of the best experiences of my life so far. My time here has allowed me to make valuable connections with my peers and many of the faculty and staff members that work at the school. Securing a job at the school's Information Technology department has landed me several opportunities throughout my two academic school years and one summer of full-time work. Furthermore, I have gained valuable experience that may soon guarantee me a job right out of college by working either at the school or a private company. My choice to attend McDaniel has given me many gifts including the motivation to move forward in life and achieve personal goals."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Safety has been great. They are both helpful and reliable. I have yet to need any health services, so I cannot comment on that."
College Sophomore,4,It has been great so far.
College Sophomore,4,"My first year was just what you would expect as typical freshman housing, but my second year has been fantastic."
College Sophomore,4,"I love everything about my school. The people are great, the classes are challenging, and I am becoming who I want to be. If I had one complaint, it would be that we are not very close to many places where students can get off campus for an afternoon and do something enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, there are a few things to do, but with that being something I have come to realize I enjoy, a bit more variety would have been nice."
College Sophomore,4,our campus safety members are always out and helping individuals on campus at all times
College Sophomore,4,the professors really care about each student in their classes and do the best to help them outside of class with homework or questions. THey all want to see their students succeed and never let anyone fall behind.
College Sophomore,4,great! we have a 98% chance that you will get a job straight out of our college and we have lots of help with internships and more
College Sophomore,4,"i love to live on campus. everything is in the same area and is very easy to get to other buildings. cost seems to be the right amount for what we are offered. the housing process is a hassle and is very stressful, no one likes the housing process because sometimes you do not get what you want."
College Sophomore,4,"our athletics are very popular, our fans come to support all of the sports teams here and our school spirit is very big."
College Sophomore,4,"i love it, the school is very welcoming and helpful when i have questions or problems arise."
College Freshman,4,"I do love my school. Our community is friendly, genuine, and fun. Our campus is gorgeous with snow, Fall leaves, and the green of summer and spring. Our faculty cares about us - they are personal and kind. There are tons of activities and I overall am extremely happy here. My classes cap at 25, there is always a mix of lecture and discussion, and every professor is an expert in their field."
College Freshman,4,"Our CEO is super great - they help with Resume building, internship and job searches, interview prep, and more. There are also many work study positions, and our alumni are very much a part of our campus."
College Freshman,4,"I love our dorm - it is spacious, carpeted, and has great furniture. But more importantly, our dorm vibe is a great one. Our RA makes a lot of bonding activities and we are all good friends on our floor!"
College Freshman,4,"This school has wonderful faculty who are there to help. They are encouraging, intelligent, eloquent, and push us very hard. The campus safety is exceptional, the campus is absolutely beautiful in the fall, and students are usually welcoming and willing to help."
College Sophomore,4,All I can say is that there are various job/internship opportunities hosted by college to students who are interested.
Freshman,2,"My first year of college hasn't gone very well. I've had trouble adjusting to campus because it is so small so there isn't much to do if you don't have a car. The living arrangements aren't that good and the residence halls aren't very clean. The food here isn't good either, every time I eat it I end up getting sick because they always undercook their food. They are also very unorganized when it comes to financial aid and registration. One thing that was very disappointing is how many interesting classes they offer here but there isn't an available professor to teach it. However one good thing I could say about McDaniel is that they have an excellent science program."
Freshman,2,"Professors are great (for the most part), dorms are god awful. Party scene is intense so if you're not into that (like me - I thought a small, liberal arts, private college would be less into that than a larger public uni - which is why I chose here.) maybe look for a different place.  Athletics are a much bigger aspect than I thought they'd be - kinesiology is like the #1 major. I came here for academics and intellectuals but mostly its just party kids and jocks. It sucks bc I worked really hard to get here and it feels like most of these people are just here bc their parents payed for it., so they don't really take it seriously. It's disheartening for sure. I hope grad school will be better."
Freshman,2,If your not an athlete the school is very small and there is not much to do. It is small and sheltered from the real world.
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are very old and need renovations
College Junior,2,"To be frank, we don't exactly excel in college athletics. Our team performance is low the majority of the time, and we are still a D3 school in a small conference. I cannot vouch for how much school spirit is floating around campus because I personally don't have an interest in all of it. We spend far too much money on athletics in my opinion, and the return value is not worth as much either. I've only been to one single football game."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is right on Pennsylvania Avenue which is pretty dangerous, The town itself has some sketchy/dangerous citizens. There a few muggins and a shooting recently. Do not walk on that street without a group and knowledge of where you're going"
College Sophomore,2,"There are only three places with great dorms/housing. The upperclassmen apartments(Gardens,North Village), Blanche, Whiteford(Dorm), and one or two affinity/substance free housing. Thats it. The rest have small, dim litted rooms and halls."
College Senior,2,the psychology department is pretty bad. Professors are misguided and lack enthusiasm.
College Senior,2,i hope it gets better. the school is not very good for student life. bunch of weirdos and nerds.
College Senior,2,its pretty sucky and since the school cracked down on the parties its gotten worse.
College Junior,2,"Attendance? Why are we getting graded on this? This is college. Not high school. Cut the freaking umbilical cord to mom and dad. These kids are responsible for their own classwork and class attendance. If they don't show, thats their fault, teachers should not be a stand-in for mommy and daddy to these kids. They will never learn to grow up."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is absurd at such a small school. Its an excuse to drink and have sexual relations as a social event.
College Sophomore,2,"After seeing other college towns, Westminster does not compare. Public transportation is nonexistent and it take more than 45 minutes to get anywhere exciting."
College Sophomore,2,"Recently there have been shootings, theft, armed theft, attempted crimes, and vandalism. Not much has changed to decrease these on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Bars are crowded, crazy, and chaotic. They are not my scene."
College Freshman,2,Nothing to do after about 11
College Freshman,2,"Not much, must be a senior."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking off campus is pretty bad, and parking on campus can be very costly."
College Sophomore,2,"Maryland weather is not the best, especially living on a hill that closer to Pennsylvania. McDaniel may have their chilly days but it doesn't hurt to sit by the fire and enjoy some nice hot chocolate."
College Freshman,2,The campus shuttle will take you to a train station. That will then take you to D.C. or Baltimore. The campus can also take you to the mall in Westminster. There are little to no other locations to go to.
College Freshman,2,Maryland weather is very unpredictable and unneeded.
College Freshman,2,$100 for a parking permit per semester. The parking lots are usually packed.
College Freshman,2,"You will not be able to eat off-campus without a car. The food options off-campus is Chic Fil-a, Buffalo Wild Wings, Subway, a few small restaurants, and a Wawa. All of which, except for one restaurant and Subway, you need a car to get to."
College Freshman,2,The houses off-campus are not great houses. They are quite run-downed. There are a few that are above average
College Freshman,2,The town of Westminster is not a college-town. It is a fairly an older-quiet town. There is a non-existent night-life. Quite dangerous off-campus at night.
College Freshman,2,"The atmosphere is very ""small town"" type.  They have what you need: like pharmacies, food, grocery, etc. but not what you want: good shopping, night life, etc."
College Freshman,2,"I'm vegan. There's a bakery that has vegan cupcakes, but other than that I can't eat anything. Anywhere."
College Freshman,2,"The freshman dorms are a little above average, well Whiteford is. DMC and Rouzer are not good. The housing does not improve much for upperclassmen. The rooms become smaller. The only great thing is that alcohol is permitted in all upper classmen dorms. The campus provides apartments for upperclassmen, mainly seniors. They are extremely nice."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is noticeable because of parties and tailgating, but they don't dominate much of the campus. There is not a large selection of fraternities to join but a great number of sororities. It is a little lonely if you are not on a sports team nor apart of Greek life."
College Junior,2,"The school is strict on anything ""serious"", but alcohol use is a little more lenient. The honor code is definitely very strict. If you do not turn in someone that may be violating the honor code you are in violation and could get in trouble."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Police overall, is pretty on top of things. They walk and drive around campus especially, on the weekends to make sure students are safe. I feel much more secure knowing they are around because anything can happen of course. During orientation it is made very clear that alcohol use and drug use is not tolerated. I was very shocked to find out that so many students, underage freely drink..."
College Junior,2,"While campus security is wonderful and does their best for the students at mcdaniel my friends and I feel that the schools main focus is on money and not the personal well being of the students as myself and a few of my friends have had problems on campus that campus safety would have gladly taken care of but it ended up going through other processes. 
I feel like if there is an emergency and campus safety us to be there right away like walking someone who feels unsafe or someone locked themselves out at night they are great but with more serious matters the campus falls short because there are just too many hands in the pot."
College Freshman,2,"The main mode of transportation here is a van called the Pickle. Transportation is a bit disappointing because it's only offered on the weekends, so it's good if you know someone with a car. However, transportation is not a major concern since everything is relatively nearby."
College Sophomore,2,There are plenty of parking spots it would appear but as a commuter adult learner those spots fill up quickly and you have to wait for someone to leave to take their parking spot or park on a much lower level and walk up to the building.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms, excluding North Village, Gardens, and Whiteford are poorly kept. Laundry is $1.25 per load (which adds up and is the most expensive I've heard of)."
College Sophomore,2,There are really only two options on campus and they don't have the greatest hours. Englar Dining Hall (aka Glar) is the biggest and the main food venue. The quality of the food is pretty average for institutional food. The college has a contract with Sodexo so everything is run by them. So the combination of limited hours and slightly below average food leaves most students griping about the food.
College Junior,2,"There are usually plenty of computers available in the labs and you get 400 free prints per semester, which is really generous.  I've never run out - never even gotten close.  The reason for the low grade though is that the internet SUCKS.  The WiFi is spotty at best, you have to sign in to Cisco every single time you start your computer and even then it kicks you off sometimes.  Plus, be mindful of Update Tuesday (when Microsoft puts out all their patches) because if your security system isn't 100% up to date you can't get on the internet.  I think it IS important to have the most current version of security possible, it is a real problem if you have an essay due that morning!

I would recommend bringing a laptop, but you could function without one if you had to.  Real pain in the bum though.  As for your own printer, you really don't need one.  I have one and like having it for convenience's sake, but I went a year without one and it was totally fine.  Just make sure you leave yourself enough time to find a place to print before your paper is due (and remember, the law of technology is that the odds are NOT ever in your favor: Cisco will fail on the first one you try, the second one won't be connected to a printer, the third one will be connected to a out-of-toner printer, the fourth one will be in a locked lab...)"
College Freshman,2,Dining Hall just only provide good foods once a while.
College Junior,2,"The Dinning Hall was renewed not too long ago and it looks very pleasing. The food, however, is sometimes pretty good but a lot of the time is underwhelming. Not a lot of variety."
College Junior,2,Generally uncompetitive in the Centennial Conference. Athletes tend to socialize only with other athletes. Coaching staff is hit-or-miss.
Freshman,1,"N/A did not take any online classes how can i leave a review
N/A did not take any online classes how can i leave a review"
Freshman,1,Ms. Pat from the Bursar's office was unprofessional and rude. we have satisfied money owed and were calling to get the student account updated.  she claims there are additional charges which we do not see on the account. we wanted to clarification on where those additional charges. she kept saying you owe such amount when we asked where those addtional charge came from she failed to explain. whem we said how can we pay for such charge we do not see on the account she repeated and said you owe such amount without any explanation...we said that we are going to file a complaint she hung up the phone?!?!?!
Freshman,1,"Honestly, you should avoid this school. They sink money into renovating things that are brand new but can't find it in the budget to fix up those 60-year-old classrooms. The school in Westminster, Maryland is surrounded by just about nothing so good luck finding something to do if you are not an athlete. If you are considering taking the comp sci track definitely avoid at all costs, you are better off at another school, comp sci professors are borderline impossible to understand and on top of that, I'm not sure they knew what they were doing. This is not a school that challenges you, it holds your hand for about 60 thousand dollars a year. THE FINANCIAL AID DEPARTMENT IS BROKEN HERE they will offer you amazing aid and the next thing you know your account is blocked because you owe 10,000 dollars just beware. The classes fill up too fast and they do nothing about it so good luck graduating in 4 years if you arent in SASS."
Freshman,1,"Learning online was impossible, the professors didn't know what they were doing and they gave no refund for housing or tuition for non returning students when the switch happened."
Sophomore,1,"The dorms are run down and terrible. My first semester I was in a room was so bad. The fall was beyond hot that I couldn’t sleep. And the winter was so cold I was sick all the time. The laundry room was too small for the 150+ students that live in my dorm and most of the machines were out of order. The food is bad, I’ve gotten food that was still frozen, and have gotten food poisoning. The school is way over priced for what you get and is a waste of an investment."
Senior,1,"As a senior at McDaniel College, my years here have gotten progressively worse. Englar Dining Hall is the worst dining experience a college student can have. Student uproar has forced the administration to change the food provider, however there was no real improvement. The party scene is becoming non-existent. Campus safety and Westminster pd are actively threatening every off-campus house owner with criminal charges. On campus any attempt at a social gathering is shut down in less than 30 minutes, resulting in citations to all residents where the gathering took place. On an academic standpoint, I have had many professors who are disengaged and are unwillingly to work with students, student-athletes in particular. In conclusion, McDaniel College needs to figure it out. Administration needs to become more aware of the actual concerns of the student body. I do not recommend coming here within the next few years as the school has some major growing pains to get through."
Alum,1,"The dorms are run down and terrible. My first semester I was in a room with the heater behind one of the walls so it was always hot and in order to go to the laundry room I had to exit the building and go in another door. The food is bad, I’ve gotten food that was still frozen. I came here for the ASL program and was told it was a big program but ASL 3 got canceled because not enough people signed up for it. The town area is sketchy."
Alum,1,"McDaniels education grad programs are a cash cow at the expense of Maryland teachers. Teachers in most MD counties are obligated to earn a masters, and get a stipend to help reach that goal, but the stipend only pays upfront for McDaniel and Towson; since most teachers don't have the means to pay otherwise, that limits your options. So McDaniel hastily put together ""distance"" classes to take advantage of that stipend, where""Professors"" are local teachers who do care, but are working with no support; some got nothing from the college except books for us to buy. And in this setting you have to contend with McDaniels terrible website. And when you're done? If you want to be a school admin, get ready to leave MD, since so many teachers in the state also have a master's from McDaniel or Towson and all of you will be passed over for people with degrees from UVA, UMD, etc. Private sector? Be ready to settle for the same entry level position you probably could have gotten with your bachelors."
Junior,1,The assistant Tennis coach is great and the one friend I made is probably the only  positive thing I can say about this place.
College Freshman,1,"Our football team is not good. School spirit is lacking, and the students do not participate in the homecoming events."
College Freshman,1,"Just don't even bother. There aren't any houses off campus that are safe to stay it. It's safer to stay on campus. You aren't allowed to move off campus until your senior year either, and by that time you have enough seniority to snag an apartment with a kitchen on campus. It simply isn't worth the hassle or the extra cost or the extra distance."
College Sophomore,1,Westminster is not a very nice neighborhood so I would not recommend going off campus. Lots of drugs and shootings
College Sophomore,1,"Basically, its tough and rare, but you can live off campus. The school requires students to live on campus for three years. The cost and distance from the school is not worth it"
College Junior,1,"The costs are too high for parking, and the ticking is ridiculous. The parking places are all taken by resident students. The commuters that actually have to drive everyday get screwed because they have to walk the farthest, everyday, because the resident students get the best spots and leave their cars there for weeks at a time. They don't get ticketed for parking in the commuter lot and leaving their car there for a week, but commuters get ticketed for using the only spots available?"
College Junior,1,"If it snows, commuter students are screwed for parking. And they are then given parking violations with a fine if they use a space thats actually cleared. Even when the school issues a delay, the sidewalks, parking lots, and stairs are still icy and dangerous. Very poor."
College Junior,1,"There is very limited facilities for commuter students to use the gym. No readily available locker room or place to change into gym clothes or take a shower. NOT EVERYONE LIVES THERE, yet everyone assumes you do."
College Sophomore,1,"I did not qualify for financial aid because my parents income exceeds the requirements. I pay for my tuition, so it is not' fair nor appropriate to use my parents income for the financial aid process."
College Freshman,1,It is alright. They destroy the taste of food one can make at home easily. Their selection is never good. One basically ends up dealing with the food. The food is good on certain days at certain periods of the day.
College Freshman,1,"The main percentage of people are white. There are very few blacks, Hispanics, or Asians. Also, a large majority are high middle class. There a good amount who are not. The only diverse part of the college is the range of which people are from. There are people from connecticuit, Massachusetts, Montana, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi, Jersey, Pennsylvania. Above all, Maryland natives"
College Junior,1,"Its hard for someone like me with a lot of allergies to have food. The food is average, it is best on days where there are visitors. The best place to eat is the pub, but you only have so many meal exchanges. 
The meal plans are pretty expensive."

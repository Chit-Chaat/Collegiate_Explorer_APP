Sophomore,5,Online experience has been superb to other programs I’ve researched. You can get a top rated degree and professors cater to the online scene very well!
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful school. They accept nearly all credit for AP and Community courses. They are very hard on students who have the potential to be great, and have amazing opportunities that they will basically hand to you. I’m not crazy introverted, and it’s known for being an not so social school. Even so, there’s an amazing social aspect of this school that continues to amaze me as it continues to grow each year."
Alum,5,"South Dakota Mines is the best engineering school in the naiton for return on investment. In 2020 recent grads earn an average of $66,500 and it's an affordable school to attend. It's location in the Beautiful Black Hills and Badlands of South Dakota make it an amazing place for recreation.  The university just added a new campus police chief to increase safety. The campus office of Inclusion works to ensure people form all background and identities are welcome on campus.  The professors are top-tier and the small classes sizes and student- faculty ratio mean they accessible for help.  The student body is supportive of each other and the hands-on classes build teamwork skills essential for success in life."
Alum,5,"As an alumni, South Dakota Mines provided me with an affordable education and a huge return on investment.  It's location in the Black Hills and Badlands offered ample forms of recreation and fun."
Senior,5,"Online classes for South Dakota School of Mines and Technology were great considering how little time professors had to prepare for them. The professors were available as much as possible for students that were struggling. The tests and homework were a tad but harder due to not being able to ask questions face to face, but overall it was a good experience."
Senior,5,"South Dakota School of Mines and Technology is a smaller college. There are around 2000 students in attendance each year. This helps keep classroom sizes on the smaller side and helps students better connect with their professors. The professors are generally very helpful and encourage one on one help. The courses are designed to show students what they will be doing in their field. The tuition for the school is not expensive compared to other engineering schools. I know plenty of students (including myself) have received scholarships from the school which brings down the cost even more. The only con I have for the school is the location. The school is not located in the best part of town, but the surrounding area of the black hills makes it worth it."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the small class sizes at SDSMT and the opportunity to really connect and work closely with your professors. The support staff is incredibly accessible and always ready to help. It is an old and small campus however, so the dorms and social life could be improved upon."
Niche User,5,The school greatly challenges you to become your best and the options for food are pretty decent. The only thing bad but doesn't deserve one less star is that the students are not very social accept a few.
Niche User,5,"South Dakota School of Mines is set in beautiful Rapid City.  It is 30 minutes from Mt Rushmore, some of the best climbing and hiking.  There is excellent snow skiing 60 minutes away.  The food could be better."
Sophomore,5,"SDSMT is a school that pushes you to do more and is focused on engineering and science. If you are highly motivated and want to do something that matters, this school is for you."
Niche User,5,My son is accepted and hasn't attended yet but he is so excited to go! Every step of the application process has been met with genuine and caring people that are eager for our son to attend and excel. Looking forward to his future at Mines! During the process - we met a Senior that has 4 job offers - before he even graduates!!
Niche User,5,"I haven't visited the college yet, but I felt as if I'm already welcomed to the school as they have e-mailed, called, and mailed me information about the college and its opportunities."
Alum,5,"This is a great school that provided me some of the best experiences of my life. It has a wonderful group of professors, extra curricular activities, and return on investment."
Senior,5,"There are so many great things to say about the School of Mines. Located in beautiful Rapid City, Mines has so much to offer. There are a wide variety of extracurricular activities you can get involved in, making it easy to meet new people and make friends with other people who have similar interests. Neighboring towns provide a number of outdoor activities, from skiing in the Black hills, to fishing and hiking at Lake Pactola. I have loved my time at the School of Mines, and look forward to applying everything I have learned once I enter the real world as an engineer."
Senior,5,"Excellent hands-on teaching, high quality education, large school opportunities with a close knit small school community."
Freshman,5,"Hi There! 
So I'm a College Freshman majoring in Mechanical Engineering at SDSMT. I have had a fantastic experience with the School of Mines. I love the campus atmosphere - very friendly. The professors are great teachers and the students are super nice. I would highly recommend this school if you like a solid education with FANTASTIC return on investment. Worth it if you care about your future."
Freshman,5,"South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has an incredible reputation, and students can be guaranteed a job once they are finished with their schooling. The activities and clubs are well-rounded and fun, and students can feel safe in a welcoming environment that the school effortlessly provides."
Niche User,5,"Overall an excellent school. The academics are great and the return on investment is amazing. Although the food isn't the best, SDSM&T makes up for that in a beautiful campus. The Geology Museum is one of the best I've ever seen."
Freshman,5,"All of the students work to make the school grounds better, and to create a welcoming, fun environment. The teachers also make the subject matter relatable, or try for as close as they can, so that the students learn well, but still can understand it right away."
Junior,5,"Great community, small and intimate.  Teachers want you to succeed but you have to put in the effort."
Sophomore,5,The staff to student ratio is very good in most classes. The academics are challenging and the facilities are advanced; especially in the new chemistry building. I am a second year applied biological sciences major and I love the diversity of the community and the variety of courses available to me.
Graduate Student,5,"Professors at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology are unbeatable, outstanding, classy, and absolutely the BEST!"
Junior,5,"I have been blessed with many professors who have been truly interested in maximizing my potential in and beyond their class. Several professors have gone above and beyond to provide me with opportunities extending my learning and providing hands-on applications that most engineers will not see until they are in the field. Additionally, my adviser and professors have gone out of their way to ensure I was on track with my classes necessary for graduation. Furthermore, I have been prepared with mock interviews to assist me with interviewing for internships, as well as interviews for the working world. One professor, in particular, has set up labs specifically for me, so upon completion of all labs, he will go to the university to hopefully secure extra credits for me in his specialty field."
Freshman,5,"The School of Mines is one of the best education values you can get.  For women, they have 100% job placement and for men it's 98% before graduation."
Freshman,5,"The School of Mines is a great college. They focus on hands on work that prepares you for real world applications in their state of the art labs. Teachers are extremely knowledgeable, and know how to keep students working hard to pass the classes and succeed."
Sophomore,5,"The school is in the Small Town Of Rapid City ( pop. around 68,000) in the beautiful Black Hills. The crime rate is very low but so is the amount of things to do in the town. The City itself promotes drinking and allows public intoxication. The school's faculty is very polite and helpful. The professors are insightful and challenge you to learn. With Ellsworth Airforce Base not too far from the area as well as the school is very military friendly. I would highly recommend this school to the focused learner."
Freshman,5,SDSM&T is a great school requiring dedication to studies.  I am learning how to be a better student and person. The people are fun and great to be with.
College Sophomore,5,Mines has a 98% placement rate with an average of 60k salary. Mines is a great school and employers love hiring graduates. Mines offers lots of opportunities to meet with employers.
College Sophomore,5,"Classes are hard, but he professors are always available to help. You learn so much and get a lot out of your money. There is a wide range of classes you can take, not only in your major, but for electives as well."
College Sophomore,5,Greek life has been a major part of my life here at school. I m in a professional engineering sorority and it has helped me tremendously academically and has helped me grow professionally and personally. I have became a better person for joining Greek life.
College Sophomore,5,"South Dakota School of Mines is tough, but it has definitely taught me so much. They professors are incredible, the students are incredible. The experience has overall been incredible. I have learned so much and am excited to learn more."
Sophomore,5," Academically it is very vigorous, but it prepares you for the real world and that is what I like about it. If you want to be an engineer of any type, South Dakota School of Mines is the school for you!"
College Senior,5,The value of the degree that I'll get is top notch. When companies look at us they compare us to Harvard and MIT grads.
College Senior,5,I joined a fraternity my freshman year at my school and I absolutely love it. It's the only reason I am still at my school. It provides me with my own support network and a family away from my family.
College Junior,5,"Some courses you will love and some you will absolutely hate. But from what I can tell, if you put in the time and effort, you will definitely be satisfied with what you learned."
College Junior,5,This school has provided me with a job before I graduated. I am currently getting paid as if I were working full time without having to put in the hours.
College Junior,5,SD Mines is a small school where the professors get to really know the students they are teaching. There are numerous opportunities to learn through the various CAMP teams.
College Freshman,5,Quality of the knowledge thought.
College Freshman,5,I feel extremely safe on campus. Never heard of anything getting stolen on campus. If you leave something somewhere on accident you will find it where you left it.
College Junior,5,The academics are hard but worth it. The curriculum is pretty set for all majors and the registration for classes is easy. The workload can be either a lot or medium depending on how many credits you are taking for a specific semester. The professors are extremely helpful and want you to succeed.
College Junior,5,The career opportunities at this school are great! There is a 98% placement rate. This means that majority of the students graduate with a job offer. There is a career fair every semester which allows for students to get an internship/co-op/job very easily. We have over 200 well known companies come to recruit from our school as Mines graduates are highly sought after. The career center is also an amazing resource and will jump through hoops to help any student find a job or review resumes. We also have a program called Mines Advantage that our employers know about and allow our students to get jobs.
College Junior,5,The overall experience has been great! The class sizes are small and teachers are available and willing to help whenever. There are a lot of different classes offered until you get more into your major specific classes.
College Junior,5,The dorms are a fantastic aspect to campus life at this school. The cost is relatively low and allows you to make friends easily. The learning communities within the dorms also assure you make friends interested in the same things that you are. It is also nice to live in the dorms freshman year because they are so close to all the buildings on campus. As a sophomore you live in Rocker Square which is an apartment style living and is super nice and still on campus!
College Junior,5,"Greek life is very evident on campus even though there is not that many houses present. There are two sororities, four fraternities and a coed fraternity. The greeks do a lot of community service for the school and community and a lot of them are leaders within their houses and throughout campus."
College Junior,5,"The school is close knit and very academic focused. I have enjoyed being a leader on campus and getting to know majority of the undergrad students on campus. However, academics come first and it is evident in the staffs willingness to help and make sure you pass. It is also nice to have small class sizes to get to know people in your specific major."
College Sophomore,5,"Class sizes are very small for a college, the average size is about 30."
College Freshman,5,"majority of people will be able to get multiple internships, twice a year they host a huge career fair with over 100 employers looking for interns and graduates"
College Freshman,5,Love the school! Professors want nothing more than you to succeed and do well. School is very focused on making sure students do well and learn.
College Student,5,"I think it is a wonderful school, and all students are very accepting of you as a person. Classes are challenging, but not to hard."
College Senior,5,"There is a reason we get the jobs we do... We work for it. Between the internships and co-op opportunities, you will be guaranteed a job even before graduation."
College Freshman,5,It was a simple online process for first semester and automatic second.
College Student,5,"My campus does not have anything to do with dining, but it does have several vending machines around. There are several on floors 1 and 2 at both Admin and Science buildings. They are a life savor when you forget to bring a snack to class."
College Freshman,5,The local atmosphere is welcoming.  Very mid-west type feel.  Friendly.
College Freshman,5,"not much goes wrong on campus, it is very safe"
College Freshman,5,Its very nice everything is close and the people are friendly
College Freshman,5,The people here are very friendly and always are welcoming
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of work done to make students happy and safe throughout the whole campus.
College Sophomore,5,Dorms are secure. People are mostly nice
College Sophomore,5,Experts in teh field teach and listen.
College Sophomore,5,"Im doing around 20 credits, and its great"
Freshman,4,"Food is terrible dont get the unlimited plan. Frats are great and very accepting except one of them. Professors are great but some dorm halls suck. Connolly is the worst, Palmerton is 2nd best and peterson is the best hall for freshman."
Freshman,4,"Online experience is nice, professors understanding. Taking almost all online right now and i have good grades in all courses."
Niche User,4,I have been in contact with admission and financial aid counselors and it has all been a very good experience. I have not yet been up to visit campus but I am excited to do so as the contact I have already received has been so encouraging and friendly.
Sophomore,4,The School of Mines is amazing. The coursework is rigorous because the professor's want to supply the world with high-class engineers and scientists. The school is small which allows the faculty and staff to focus on the success of students. With name recognition within industry it is nearly impossible to not find a career after graduation. SD Mines is a wonderful and worthwhile investment in oneself.
Freshman,4,"Good program, plenty of reasources, it is hard to get notifications for events and information though."
Senior,4,"Great experience at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.  Small classes, good academic support.  Mechanical Eng a great dept."
Sophomore,4,"SDSMT is a one of kind type school. Coming from high school with more students than this college, the feeling of campus and campus life is still lively. After a month you already begin to know the friendly faces and majority of those in your major. It's a completely new experience and one I certainly enjoy."
Freshman,4,"The reason I rated SDSMT 4 stars is because the school itself isn't amazing, but the academics are very good, they have great job placement, and it all comes at a reasonable price for out of state tuition. The party life is mediocre and off campus, there isn't a lot to do besides getting food (they do have a surprising amount of great food in Rapid). All in all, if you know you want to do engineering and want to save money, this is a good school, but if you are not sure if you want to do engineering, then this may not be the school for you as they don't really have any other majors to switch into. Also, if you're a strong democrat, you probably won't like it out here, there is a lot of negative energy around liberals out here (not from me but just something I noticed being out here) coming from many of the Republican folks but there are also a lot of nice people so don't let that discourage you too much."
Junior,4,"Great school that will teach you the proper education to succeed in your career. The professors are willing to sit down and work with you, and have great teaching styles. The only downside is that for a tech school, the wifi is awful and the cafeteria is the worst."
Senior,4,"SDSMT has a forward thinking mindset and atmosphere on campus. Students there strive for excellence and don't accept anything but the best. 
Outside of academics, the rest of the school could use some improvement. There is little to no off-campus housing for upperclassmen. Every other college has AFFORDABLE off-campus housing nearby. SDSMT has neither. This wouldn't be such an immediate issue if there was more available parking. Not only does it take students 10+ minutes to get to campus due to the lack of nearby housing, but it then takes another 10 minutes just to find parking."
Freshman,4,Classes are hard but doable with hard work and dedication. Everyone is friendly and it feels like home here. I am glad I chose to come to South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.
Freshman,4,"First semester was rough (generals make for a boring class experience, and a majority of kids aren't social in the slightest) second semester? Awesome. Classes get more geared toward your area of study, which makes it easier to make friends. Course work os challenging but interesting; if you need help, theres a paramount of reaources you can go to and youll find answers guaranteed, just gotta ask. Class sizes are awesome for getting to know professors, lots of activities and organizations, heavy community involvement with the surrounding area, and everyone over all is shy but very friendly. My experience differs from several as I'm a girl (6 to 1 guy to girl ratio) and live off campus at home."
Freshman,4,"The courses are very challenging, but some could consider that a good thing. The students and faculty are nice and welcoming. It's a small, quaint campus with plenty activities and clubs."
Junior,4,South Dakota School of Mines and Technology is a great school especially because of the price. It provides a quality education with good prospects after graduation. It is on the same caliber as more expensive technology schools. The small class sizes allow for a closer relationship with professors.
Junior,4,"Good programs, sometimes a bit questionable as to how they spend their money. Parking Needs. To. Be. Fixed."
Sophomore,4,"If you are seeking a career in engineering this is a very good school to go to. Some courses are rigorous and challenging, but with that kind of risk comes high rewards. The dorms are pretty nice, the food could use some work, but overall I would definitely recommend this school. 8/10"
Senior,4,"Good engineering school, tough classes and takes most people 4.5 to 5 years to graduate. It’s a smaller school that’s male dominated."
Sophomore,4,"I will be beginning my sophomore year of college at SDSMT this fall of 2017. My freshman year was much better than expected. A majority of the professors were experienced in their fields, and were able to teach competently.  The campus is very beautiful, and the dorms, while small, are adequate for student life. Overall, I enjoy the campus and courses offered at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology."
Senior,4,"The South Dakota School of Mines has a good teacher-to-student ratio. Also, the faculty and staff do all that they can do to help students succeed. Mines Advantage is a bonus for the school."
Sophomore,4,"South Dakota School of Mines & Technology is a college where you really get out what you put into it. Although I have been very challenged by some of my courses, I find that I can handle it just fine if I really invest in my learning. Overall I have had a great experience with the faculty, athletics, and the campus atmosphere. I can say without a doubt that this is a quality education and I will be set up for a great future with this degree. This school is truly a perfect place for anyone pursuing engineering."
Junior,4,"The South Dakota School of Mines and Technology is a small university located in the beautiful Black Hills. On campus you will enjoy a family-like feel and will have the opportunity to get to know, and possible work right alongside, professors.  Each department is dedicated to helping their students succeed.  The placement for careers coming out of school is greater than 95%!"
College Sophomore,4,"Expensive, but worth it to live on campus. Dorms are kind of bad, but the Rocker building are pretty nice. All the RA's are helpful and the reslife office is easy to communicate with."
College Sophomore,4,"We are a D2 school I think and just moved up from D3 so we kind of are bad, but the games are always fun. There is a good gym available to students, but a lot of time sports have it filled."
College Sophomore,4,"Some professors go the extra mile for their students, some don't."
College Sophomore,4,"I like that I can have a member of campus security escort me if I don't feel safe, I also liked that the school offered a self defense class."
College Freshman,4,"The Greek system is available on campus, but not a huge deal. Greek activities are not as elite as on other campuses."
College Freshman,4,SDSMT is the ideal small school for students who don't want to get lost in the shuffle of a large university. The professors know you by name and the class sizes are small. I feel accepted and like I belong.
College Junior,4,I feel safe. I personally don't like walking by myself in the dark.... but who does?
College Freshman,4,I really love this school. The small class room sizes allow for a more personal relationship with classmates as well as professors. The only evasive thing I have to point out is the female to male ratio. Over the years it has increased and I hope it continues to do so.
College Freshman,4,"The classes are HARD! but you can be sure you are going to be ready for what's to come...lots of support form teachers, advisers and others."
College Freshman,4,So far the overall experience has been very good.
College Sophomore,4,I'd choose this school over any other if I could do it all again. The professors are excellent and the students are friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand. The campus is rather introverted bUt there is a definite sense of community stemming from everyone's involvement in difficult fields of study and mutual desire for success.
College Junior,4,The campus as a while is pretty accepting of diversity. There is a office for people who are considered a diversity to connect and talk with others or get help if needed.
College Junior,4,There is a very low crime rate on campus. Walking around campus at night I feel safe. To get into the buildings at night you need a student ID which makes me feel safe when I am up late studying. Campus safety is great and always available. They will give rides to cars at night if ever you feel unsafe also.
College Junior,4,"The students do their best to attend when not studying. There is a new pep club on campus to promote students attending sporting events. They host tailgating before every home football game and make t-shirts for the students to wear. School spirit is pretty high and students are proud to call SDSM&T their home team. There was recently a new weight room, small activity room, two gyms, and a bouldering wall added to the gym."
College Freshman,4,"feel very safe on campus, very little crime, students are well behaved and the campus security does an excellent job."
College Freshman,4,majority of classes are engineering orientated and most of the professors have a background in engineering so they provide excellent prospective both in school and future careers.
College Freshman,4,housing is convenient and close to all classes. easy enough to sign up for housing.
College Student,4,"SDSM&T works hard to keep you busy with plenty of activities every week. There are tons of ways to get involved if you can get your homework done first. This school is definitely difficult, but it is possible to graduate if you buckle down. Also all of the kids who took advanced classes in high school are doing fine here at college. The cafeteria is small but that's to be expected from a small school, overall I am happy with the food. All professors have office hours so that you can go talk to them and that helps makes classes more manageable if you have specific questions."
College Junior,4,"I love the small and connected feel of South Dakota School of Mines. The people I go to school with are very dedicated to their schoolwork. Each day I am happy to say that I go to a school where I have a close relationship with all of the faculty who each show an earnest commitment for my learning. Within the school, even the professional societies have a close, constructive relationship with the students to help advancement into their fields. My favorite experience thus far has been my summer semester when I met my favorite professor and made a 4.0 out of 4.0 for grades in my 12 summer credit courses. I was really inspired this last summer by my hard work and the great advice from the professor. I would not change anything about my situation in transferring to my current university."
College Sophomore,4,A ton of restaurants thanks to the Sturgist Rally make off-campus eating very nice.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of different options that are usually cheap and work pretty well for college students.
College Freshman,4,"The guys outnumber the girls by a lot, but most are nice so its not uncommon for a group of 1 girl and 5 guys to be hanging out. the guys complain about the ratio and that the girls wont date them but that's only because they're to shy to ask a girl out."
College Freshman,4,"off campus living is almost half the cost of living on campus, assuming you have roommates and accept its not gonna be a 5star hotel."
College Freshman,4,"The actual police do not patrol, only campus safety does. The only real problems are went drunk locals wander onto campus, but even then the police station is only a few blocks away."
College Freshman,4,"Mines lies in a decent location of rapid making a few main roads easily accessible and reasonably close. Each location will have at least a few food options most ranging for a meal to cost $7-$15. McDonald's and other fast food might result in slightly cheaper. Student discounts apply at some which usually includes a free drink which might now be advertised, so knowing ahead of time is beneficial. Downtown could be more expensive but it brings a variety of cultural foods such as Mexican, Italian and American."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't had to deal with campus safety very often, other than seeing whoever issue a few parking tickets. However, if I lived on campus I could be more susceptible to seeing them on duty. I'm not sure where the boundaries lie with noise levels, drinking and those sorts of things and how strict the rules are in the dorms."
College Freshman,4,"There's a lot of small restaurants around town, but most of them don't go along with the school meal plan"
College Freshman,4,"It's pretty good, but a bit expensive."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are pretty well designed. There are a few issues with the showers sometimes and the A/C doesn't always work. Everyone in the same dorm building are always social with each other and invite others from different dorms over for movie nights. The housing process is simple and fairly fast.
College Student,4,There aren't very many apartments very close to the University but most are within 15 miles.
College Student,4,The administration is great! The staff in the main office is nice and helpful when you need something.
College Student,4,"I currently attend the University Center with my classes transferring to South Dakota School of Mines and Technology so I do not live on campus yet. In 2016 however, I will be attending the school. The social atmosphere of the University is really great! Everyone is so kind and willing to work with you on anything you are struggling with. It has been a great, yet hard experience so far and I am looking forward to the future!"
College Sophomore,4,They do a good mix of being strict but fair
College Sophomore,4,"hard working, involved, committed, and outgoing"
College Freshman,4,I don't have a problem with security on campus.  I usually go in a group.
College Freshman,4,I'm very happy with the faculty and small student size of my major and there are many things I can go into as a career after I'm finished and would probably do it again.
College Freshman,4,"This is just a STEM school, so if that's not what you want to major in then you will have an issue, but otherwise it's a great school for stem majors"
College Freshman,4,"There is more here than where I'm from in Eastern Washington, so to me it's great!"
College Freshman,4,There are so many STEM options and there are amazing options for every student.
College Sophomore,2,We are an engineering school and we have mediocre sports teams.
College Freshman,2,The only people that care about the sports team are the members.
College Freshman,2,"The only financial aid I received was a scholarship when I applied at the school.  I did not receive any other financial aid besides loans.  At this rate, and the expense of tuition, I may not be able to finish my degree."
College Sophomore,2,The amount of parking is very limited across campus but a spot can usually be found even if it is a ways away.
Recent Alumnus,2,The parking is extremely expensive and they don't sell all the parking permits in the closest lot.
Recent Alumnus,2,The campus itself is small but if you need to get groceries you need to have a car or know someone with a car.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Rapid City, SD is not the town you want to go to school in if you are looking for an exciting nightlife."
College Sophomore,2,"It's an engineering school in Rapid City, SD."
College Sophomore,2,Rapid City needs to catch up with the rapid development of students moving to the area. The school attracts a lot of people. The city needs to provide a more prevalent transportation system that caters to students at SDSM&T.
College Sophomore,2,"Aarmark is the food caterer on campus. It's bad because the dining service is inconsistent with the quality of food they serve to students, they don't properly wash dishes, which is probably due to bad management."
College Freshman,2,"To get closer parking it reaches like 300 dollars. and they hand tickets out left and right, the appeal process is pointless. Parking could be WAY better."
College Freshman,2,"Campus safety is not effective. I see parking violations daily that are not addressed for days sometimes weeks at a time. Don't even get me started on the health care. Not only are the hours inconvenient, but is also poor in quality."
College Sophomore,2,"It's cold a lot. This year there was a huge snow storm. Classes were cancelled. The campus was closed, but everyone still got feed. "
College Sophomore,2,"There are a futurities, you don't hear too much about them. Its pretty low key. "
College Sophomore,2,It is good to have your own transportation in Rapid City. If you don't there are taxis and rapid ride.
College Freshman,2,Weather doesnt do much except the occasional snow day
College Freshman,2,"no busses, barely taxis, however it is close to the town center so its nice to walk there during fair weather months."
College Freshman,2,A lot of people complain of the niose levels and dont party. The drinking rules are super strict and the punishment is very high if your caught
College Sophomore,2,Alcohol and drugs are not allowed on campus. We are a dry campus.  We are also a smoke free campus.  This was enacted like 3 years ago I think.  It really depends on the RA how strict it is enforced. The hall directors in the dorms do not play around. If they find it you will be punished.  This also goes if you are caught illegally downloading something on a school tablet.
College Sophomore,2,If you are a guy at Mines you are kind of out of luck if you are looking for a girl. The number of girls at Mines is limited but that is good news for girls.
College Sophomore,1,"The male to female ration is 8 to 1. If you're looking for a good looking woman on campus, good luck!"
College Freshman,1,Unnecessary for education and unnecessary for social convention
College Sophomore,1,The is practically no night life in the Rapid City area.
College Sophomore,1,Not much for the guys to look at here. It's been said that you better find a girl before coming to Mines.
College Freshman,1,Food at the Hardrocker cafe is gross. They are limited on what they can serve so it gets very repetitive and boring. Students get sick often because the food isn't kept at the proper temperature or cooked correctly. I have yet to NOT find a hair in my eggs in the morning. You often have to check your plate to make sure its clean. Sometimes they have run out of a particular drink or food and fail to notice. You have to ask them if there is any more to get some. Often you will see employees standing around not doing anything productive. or you will see one person wiping down tables that students are sitting at when there are plenty of dirty empty tables. Overall I think they really need to step up their game to provide enough service for what you pay for. The miners shack is a little better about service. Java city is excellent and I have yet to find fault in their service.
College Freshman,1,Scholarships are easy to apply for however the money is disproportionate. All the minorities are focused on and leaves little for hard working people who may need it more. Plus the financial aid office is a tad slow in getting everything sorted out.
College Freshman,1,Food is always the same and it's never very good!
College Sophomore,1,"Night-Life... at an Engineering School? So here's the breakdown on SDSMT.

The courses and extracurricular activities keep the students so busy that a social life on campus does not exist.  Everyone walks about with their heads down to avoid socialization.  Fliers for important events around campus and town are placed on sidewalks and floors of the buildings rather than on walls.  If you should make a small group of friends, you'll be able to enjoy any of the twenty-some watering-holes around town to go dance / drink at, but larger events are very rare."
College Junior,1,"It's hard enough paying for a parking permit, but then it's really hard just to find a parking spot at times. Especially when campus events are going on."
College Senior,1,I Hate everything about the weather and this school!
College Freshman,1,"Not Many Options – There is a bus stop right outside of the school but the bus rarely stops there.  The campus isn't big enough to need transportation around it but the towns transportation is almost non existant, unless you want to call the taxi service, because you don't just hail a cab in Rapid City."

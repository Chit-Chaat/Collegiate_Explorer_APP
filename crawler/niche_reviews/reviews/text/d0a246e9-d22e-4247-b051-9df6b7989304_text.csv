Sophomore,5,"The majority of my classes are online or in a hybrid format. I really like the online format that the school uses, and for the most part, everything is graded promptly. Knowing where you stand throughout a class is extremely important to me, and I really appreciate this."
Sophomore,5,"So far, I think that they are handling the pandemic really well. I also feel that in the last year that I have attended that most of my professors are masters in their respective fields, with many achieving Doctoral degrees. I always had good, prompts communications between myself and all of the school offices."
Alum,5,"I completed my doctorate at GGU and it was an incredibly rewarding experience. The full-time faculty who run the program are passionate about what they do, offering students the opportunity to engage in significant personal growth and deep learning. I can heartily recommend GGU to anyone who seeks to improve their skills and advance their career through any of the University’s many degree and certificate programs."
Graduate Student,5,My perception is that GGU is truly focused on the student and works hard to make the journey easier and painless as possible. The support provided throughout the process (application to graduation) is extraordinary. Career support is also a highlight at GGU! Campus and party are not something that they worry about as the focus is on adult and working professional students.
Graduate Student,5,The university has a great academic program that fits the needs and careers of the Bay Area. The professors are well-known and provide a lot of support for students to find work during and after their program. The univeristy has well diverse and welcoming to all cultures and ethnicities.
Recent Alumnus,5,"It was great! I interned at WTAS (Now Anderson Tax). They paid good money, and people were very friendly, explained a lot of topics, had a lot of very useful training. I loved it there."
Recent Alumnus,5,they all looked good to me
Recent Alumnus,5,"very diverse, you can find someone from anywhere in the world here."
Recent Alumnus,5,"it was good, everything went smooth"
Recent Alumnus,5,There are a lot of different options. You can find any type of restaurant there.
Recent Alumnus,5,"San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. There is always something going on in the city. A lot of nice restaurants. If you don't have a lot of money, there is still a lot of good and inexpensive restaurant options available. Housing is expensive, but if you share your apartment with a frient, it becomes affordable. Public transportation is great. You don't need to buy a car. Overall, I think I had a great experience living and going to school in this city."
College Senior,5,There are no drugs on campus
College Senior,5,I will plan to get my Masters Degree
College Senior,5,Computer lab is very helpful
College Senior,5,Professors are great and the curriculum is the best.
College Junior,5,I haven't noticed any crimes or anyone getting in trouble on campus. I feel safe walking around.
College Junior,5,"Getting into my program was incredibly easy. The admissions counselor was incredibly helpful and kept me updated and walked me through every step of the process. I applied as a transfer student and the counselor told me everything I needed to submit (which wasn't much, just unofficial transcripts) in order for them to asses what courses I still need to take. If you have a GPA of 3.0 or higher it is very easy to get accepted. They also give a 35% discount on tuition if you are a first generation college student, which is fantastic. "
College Junior,5,The library is very big with a vast collection of books. It is a very relaxing environment to work on homework.
College Junior,5,"The city is very dirty and noisy, with a very high homeless population. The Yerba Buena park is a couple blocks away from the university and it's a great place to relax. There are plenty of cafes and dining options in close proximity to the school."
College Junior,5,I don't see any usage of drugs and alcohol on campus.
Senior,4,My experience as International student while pursuing  is satisfying. The location is very suitable. Professors are very cooperative and helpful. Library is excellent. Administrative staff is also very helpful.
Junior,4,"I started my first semester this Fall (2019) for online classes, so far so good!  Registration is a breeze, the advisors are all great and the online learning system seems very good.  All of the student support services are great as well, especially GGU Connect.  I even joined an on-campus club, even though I am an online student only.  I also signed up for the Student Success Coaching Program, which has been a life saver.  I’ve heard this school is great for military personnel as well.  They also accept transfer credits from Study.com, so that is a big plus.  I would definitely recommend."
Junior,4,"Golden Gate University offeres online courses.  I like this because I can finish my degree whereever I am.   My only negative is that GGU is very expensive.  Though they do offer payment plans , loans and grants the payment plans still do not help make it affordable."
Graduate Student,4,"I don't really have anything to compare with, but the location is decent and the faculty certainly know what they are doing. I will say that this a graduate school aimed at working professionals who want get into the field as quickly as possible."
College Sophomore,4,Professors are very engaging. The are easily accessible and from my experience have been very accommodating. Most of the faculty has professional experience and great energy.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many career and job fairs that go on each month. In addition, there is a great alumni network that exists."
College Sophomore,4,We are obligated to finish a sexual assault webinar before the beginning of each semester. There are weekly web articles that are emailed to students that provide us with updates on safety and student services.
College Sophomore,4,"After going back to school from a 7 year hiatus, I was nervous and worried that I won't be able to perform at my highest degree. Although after adjusting to school life and working with the programs the university offers, I have been able to function and perform at my best."
College Junior,4,Golden Gate University is very accepting of people from all backgrounds.
College Junior,4,Professors and advisers are very helpful and knowledgeable in helping students reach their goals.
College Junior,4,This school prepares students to further their careers and grow within the fields they study.
College Junior,4,Learning first-hand from professors who are working in the professions they are teaching about.
College Junior,4,I feel safe when I spend time at this campus.
College Junior,4,Golden Gate University is great for professionals.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Golden gate university in San Francisco has a really good class atmosphere. If you are working and need to improve yourself, this university is perfectly matched because they offer both in person and online class."
Recent Alumnus,4,"yes, I did enjoy accounting classes. ( I was in masters in Acc program) Some classes were very difficult, but it was worth it. I would like to believe that they made me a better entry level -profesional."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I think the experienced professors' contribution to the academia makes the school unique. Most of the professors are still working, and have amazing experience in the current business world."
Recent Alumnus,4,"alumni network is great. That is how i got my job. Career fairs are very helpful, and career advisors too. Resume advisors are also very helpful."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are some great professors like Tedd Mitchell. He has over 30 years of experience in Tax and is still working. You learn a lot from this kind of people. Majority of profesors have very good experience. But there are some very young ones too with some experience, but they are still good. You get a specific eduation here, not a general education."
Recent Alumnus,4,"You can get your degree faster here, and also, most of the classes are in the evening or online. So you have a lot of options. There are career events, bit you have to be proactive yourself. Nobody will find a job for you. No matter how proactive the career advisors are, you are the person who needs that damn job, or inernship, so you have to try hard. Moreover, SF is a very competitive place, you need to try even harder."
Recent Alumnus,4,"As I said before, this school is for working professionals, and people who are seeking to get their education in a fast track format. If you would like to enjoy parks, meal, you are welcome to explore the city that offers so much. You will be surrounded with people who are experienced (ex., peers), and who can advise, put you in the right direction, or at least give you a picture how it is to be in certain fields of work in real life. Staff is friendly, professors are experienced. Overall, I think I had a very good and satisfying experience there. Right after graduation I was offered an internship, and a full-time job a few months into my internship. 

The things that I would change is following:

1. More scholarship opportunities 

2. Career advisory events should be for everyone, not only for people who have certain GPA. I was invited to those events, but i felt sad that some of my peers were not. I am sure they had some things planned for them too, but I believe there should not be any discrimination. 

3. Accounting students are not invited to Tax Career events, and vice versa. The management should understand that some accounting students are actually interested in working as tax professionals. But that was not the case there. Some students sneaked into those career events where they wanted to try their luck, I heard."
Recent Alumnus,4,"application process was smooth, the program can be personally modified to anyone, you will just need to take more classes. For example, if you have no background in accounting, economics, math, etc, and you want to be in a masters in Finance program, you will be offered some basic finance, math, accounting, etc classes before you can join your peers in the actual program"
Recent Alumnus,4,"to me it was great, becuase i never had time for parties ( i used to work full-time while going to school). Even though GGU is not big in parties, I managed to miss a lot of them. Usually, there were small parties organized by clubs, but everyone would be invited anyways. No body would go crazy during those parties."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The campus is actually not that big. It consists of a few buildings in downtown San Francisco. So, there is no room for students to misbehave, in my opinion. Moreover, some students are working professionals, some already have families, some have jobs not related to the field of study they are pursuing - so, majority is very busy. And graduate level classes and some undergrad classes are in the evening, so it makes it very convenient for working people to attend, and after the classes everyone is headed his own direction."
Recent Alumnus,4,A deciding factor was the amount of financial assistance I was receiving and Golden Gate gave me the highest amount in scholarship money and options for additional assistance.
Recent Alumnus,4,The typical students are dressed in business attire and it's very modern city wear. Nobody is going to class in sweatpants.
Recent Alumnus,4,The building is secure and there is personnel easily accessible the moment you walk through the doors so I feel safe and welcome.
Recent Alumnus,4,They have a wonderful tax program. 
Recent Alumnus,4,I have no issue with the quality of my courses.
Recent Alumnus,4,I enjoy my course work.
Recent Alumnus,4,There are a lot of off campus options.
College Junior,4,"The Bart is on the same street as the school and it comes every 3 minutes. It is very cheap to ride and very fast as it is an underground train, so you avoid all traffic during rush hour."
College Junior,4,"I keep to myself most of the time, so I haven't encountered any strict policies that keep me from my schoolwork."
College Junior,4,There are many fast food and take-out restaurants that are relatively cheap. 
College Junior,4,Everyone is friendly and outgoing. A great majority of the student population are adults and are respectful and hard working.
College Junior,4,"I’m at Golden Gate University, LA campus pursing my masters in Taxation. I love the teachers and the format of the class. The knowledge of the teachers is top notch. They either are in the field or have many years of experience."
College Senior,4,The school is located in the Financial District of San Francisco and off campus housing is available all over the city and in the neighboring areas.  Public transportation is easily accessed and relatively reliable.
College Senior,4,The online program is convenient for job searching I can log on from anywhere.
Recent Alumnus,4,The Process Went Smoothly. The loans were received in a timely manner prior to the start of my Fall 2011 semester at GGU.
College Freshman,4,"Aparments Cost a Lot – Apartments around the school or few since it is in a business area, but living outside of San Francisco and commuting in works well"
Alum,2,"Golden Gate University is an okay college for undergraduate students. I liked their classrooms and the campus. However, once I graduated and entered their graduate program it all went downhill. There is a Professor, Leslie Swanson, she is basically the reason why I left GGU after two years. GGU does not care about their students. They don't care that I was treated unfairly by a Professor. Their disability department did not care to process my disability in a timely manner. GGU put me through a lot of stress during the first two semesters of my Master's program. I've heard a lot of other similar complaints from other students.I hope GGU finally realizes that Leslie Swanson is an unfit Professor. I'm not sure how many emails, bad reviews, and warnings it will take for them to take this horrible person off their staff.(Since they pride themselves on their high veteran student count and make a ton of MONEY from the VA because of them.) What a shame!"
College Junior,2,The L.A. campus is very small. Just a few classes. No campus life.
College Senior,2,"The daytime cohort program students are offered many more opportunities for networking and career development.  The evening students are not even told about the available programs and are not invited to participate.  Despite the fact that tuition is the same for both the day and evening programs, day time students are clearly given preferential treatment and opportunities to network and meet intimately with recruiters.  Evening students must jump through hoops to participate in the same programs, if they are even aware of them.  It is unlikely that the evening students know about the programs, because the school does an incredibly good job of hiding it from them.  It really truly feels as though the school deliberately hides these programs from their evening students.  Speaking with evening students and learning of their complete ignorance or anger and frustration proves this point very poignantly."
College Junior,2,"It is nice to be downtown but its a small campus . No athletic center, weak student center. library is ok. activities are lacking."
Graduate Student,1,"I regret every single penny I spent on that school. Most professors don’t really care about teaching and are lazy. They havent been in the market for years so they have no idea of what is going on it there. I’ve learned wrong concepts in the classroom because many professors are stopped in time and don’t study to keep themselves up to date. Not only the professors but also the staff take forever to respond to questions or requests. They have no motivation to do their job because of some buracratic reason, they can’t be fired. The library never has the material that the professors request and when I went to inquire about that they said that was my obligation to buy the material. If you are interested in an easy diploma, that’s the place for you. But if your goal is to learn and be challenged, go spend your money somewhere else."
Freshman,1,This school was not what I expected. The teachers were not involved with the students and graded essays unfairly.
College Junior,1,"There is no parking on campus, and the parking lots around the school are very expensive. I wouldn't trust leaving my car outside a parking garage; especially at night."
College Senior,1,There is no nightlife.  The school is but one and a half buildings.  There is no on-campus housing.  Most students are graduate students.

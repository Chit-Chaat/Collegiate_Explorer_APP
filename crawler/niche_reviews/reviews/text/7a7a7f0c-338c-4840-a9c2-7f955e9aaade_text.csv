Freshman,5,I personally loved the hospitality I received from all of the staff and administrators. They always try and get you involved in christian leadership activities in which I personally value. All of the students and staff are very understanding and are willing to sit down and talk with you in which I valued most about this school.
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any type of online classes, they have in class options everyday. The online course is state of the art using zoom call and many other compatible apps. They even assist with a full time library that has online courses to help with students 24-7."
Freshman,5,"The amazing staff and culture around the school is outstanding, my counselor assisted me every way through to help me get into to the college of my choosing. The athletic programs are so amazing they are some of the top in the nation. The football program is amazing and they have a drive to win every year. The campus is brand new and improving every year, even to making new dorms. The schools facility’s are brand new, which is used by most sports and some of the students allowed in the program. The housing is amazing and perfect for a freshman lifestyle, it makes the connection to the college easier. Having the freshman leave the dorm to explore the campus and make more friends. The food is amazing and has a 24-7 food chow hall to eat. Also having to-go option available. All in all the university is just outstanding and everybody should be available to go."
Junior,5,Sometimes learning online can be difficult but the professors are very willing to help as much as they can!
Junior,5,I absolutely love this school! The campus is great and so are the people! The professors are very willing to help when you need it!
Niche User,5,"I love the organization of the buildings, because it is not scattered apart, in fact all the buildings are close together. The students and faculty are amazing and thought-full people and they truly care about you. Although it is surrounded by a small town, their are many hidden jewels around the campus, like Jucy's Burgers. Finally, anyone who attends this university will grow tremendously in their faith in Christ, in academics, and life skills."
Freshman,5,"East Texas Baptist university is an amazing university with great facilities for students and staff along with great student to teacher connection, a lot of teachers at east Texas Baptist university give a lot of there time into there students to help them along in there journey to find a career"

Freshman,5,"It is exactly what I expected it to be- challenging and good. The faculty is overall very kind and have been extremely helpful. I have made many wonderful life-long friends among my peers. If you are even on the fence, just come and visit! The town can honestly be kinda sketch, but if you look you can always find the good things, and there are plenty to be had. The people here are so precious!"
Sophomore,5,I just finished my freshman year at East Texas Baptist University and I loved it! My first time touring the campus I knew I was going to go there! The campus is beautiful and the people are very nice. The professors are also great! They are always willing to help if you need it!
Freshman,5,"East Texas Baptist University makes an effort to instill and nurture a love for Christ in each of their students. They make chapel fun and exciting, they provide bible study opportunities, and encourage students to get involved in local churches. Having faculty and staff that love the Lord is an integral part of who they are as an institution. Each professor is passionate about what they teach and wants every student to learn as much as they can. They do their very best to show each student how they can honor God in whatever they are studying. No matter what environment you’re in on campus the people around you are there to be a light for Christ. They are there to serve the Lord and others."
Niche User,5,I had a wonderful campus visit and loved it . The mascot is a tiger just like my old dream school Louisiana State University. The football team is amazing and everyone have great spirit there. The staff and tour guide was outstanding and very loving to my family and I .
Niche User,5,"I have yet to attend the university itself however, from what I have heard and just talking to the administrators and coaches involved, they are such a caring and loving environment. I hope to attend their school come soon!"
Sophomore,5,I love ETBU because of the christian focus at this school. All teachers and staff members are focused on the Lord and what he has in store. They never fail or hesitate to speak about the Lord and what he has put on their heart. I truly this school has changed my life and is one of the best universities in Texas and really strives to give the best education to students while encouraging their spiritual life.
Junior,5,ETBU is a small private university with many opportunities to succeed. They have a great education program and are doing an exceptional job of ensuring students are graduating with a degree.
Sophomore,5,I feel very safe living on East Texas Baptist University's campus! It has a very kind and encouraging atmosphere! The professors help in all ways that they possibly can to prepare you for your career and in class. It is a beautiful campus with wonderful opportunities! I earned prize money for entering a creative writing contest! The friends I've made are for life. Several professors have their doctoral degrees! I could say several more things about this University.
Alum,5,I loved my time at ETBU.  Hands down the best part of this university is how much the Professors care about their students. Being a student with dyslexia school was hard for me but I graduated with the help of my amazing professors.
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my time at ETBU. I was able to achieve a degree in a timely manor and was completely prepared for the work force after graduation. Athletics is a huge part of the student life at ETBU (was an athlete) and there is always an event to attend on the weekends. If its a hockey game, baseball, concert, or CONEXUS there is always something to do! ETBU is a family and those connections can be found even after graduation. I had a great experience as a student and love how much the campus has continued to grow! They even have full size beds in the dorms! Crazy!"
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere at ETBU is like home.  The people are very friendly, and the education is excellent.  Professors are very helpful and want you to succeed."
Freshman,5,ETBU its great it has grew me into a better person but as well in my faith with God. I have met people I never thought i would meet. ETBU might not been my dream school at first but it definitely is now.
Freshman,5,I love ETBU. I knew on my first visit that this was where I wanted to go. The campus is beautiful. The people are great. It is a little expensive but I know it will all be worth it.
Alum,5,"Great campus and great school.  Very caring professors and workers.  Many opportunities for student to get involved.  Not a large campus but growing in size.  New buildings added in the last several years  and added football back to the school several years ago.  Academics are high standard.  Many classes require a research paper, even physical education classes.  The campus is small enough to enjoy the walks to and from class.  The quad in the middle is a gathering place for some activities.  The Alumni association is very active.   The students can enjoy sports as there are many on campus teams that are not associated with athletics.  The dorms are nice and safe.  You make friends for life here."
Freshman,5,"Everyone has been very friendly and helpful, so far. Located in Marshall, Texas, it is a beautiful campus."
Sophomore,5,"East Texas Baptist University is a diverse and well rounded institution, dedicated to academics, leadership, and faith. The entire student body and professional staff share a strong spiritual connection and place a strong emphasis on faith! Everyone is family here."
Alum,5,"ETBU was a fantastic school to go to. It is not a party school, nor is it one for students to go crazy at once they leave their homes. They truly stick to their name-East Texas BAPTIST University. They are not as strict as they used to be, but they do enforce good morals. There are places to eat around town and a Walmart about 2 miles from the school. 

The academics are top-notch. I felt that I went into a teaching job fully prepared for what was ahead. The professors truly care about their students and have kept in contact with me since graduation.

Overall, ETBU was a great experience and I will continue to recommend it to anyone who asks!"
Niche User,5,"My experience from visiting East Texas Baptist University was simply amazing. I started off really enjoying the Chapel Service. Everyone there has such an amazing spirit and is so kind. After the Service, I was able to go into a class that matched up with the major we want. I was in a Chemical Concepts class. The professors are all very nice and such great teachers. I really enjoy how the professors actually take the time to explain what you may have trouble on. It is also very beneficial that the classes are small. After the class, I got to see how the cafeteria was like. Their buffet was very delicious. After lunch, a student showed us around the dorms. I fell in love with the Centennial Hall. I also think that it is very awesome how you're able to fill out an housing application to room you with people you would most get along with. East Texas Baptist University is an amazing college and I honestly would not change anything about it."
College Student,5,The faculty are willing to help you succeed in any way on campus.
College Student,5,It's a very safe environment heavily secure by the campus police
College Student,5,They have the best athletic programs all sports can together as a team

College Freshman,5,I have a brand new athletic dorm room and I love it
College Freshman,5,"All of my professors are very nice and want to see me succeed. The class sizes are generally small, and all of my professors know me by name. Our professors not only teach us the course material, they also lead us spiritually, and help us to be the best that we can be."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love ETBU. Everyone is like a huge family. All of the professors want to see you succeed in whatever it is that you want to do. Being at ETBU is like having a huge support system that I know is going to be there when I need them the most.
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love East Texas Baptist University. I could not imagine myself at any other school. ETBU has provided me with so many opportunities as a student, from having concerts of big name bands, activities that appeal to every type of student. Most of all I am thankful for the staff in the theater department. They are like my family here, I have become more education about the field of study I wish to peruse."
College Sophomore,5,"Absolutely love the university and would trade the experience for anything else, cant wait to return."
College Freshman,5,The campus is really beautiful and the student body isn't too big so the teachers have time for you!
College Freshman,5,"East Texas Baptist University is truly my Home on the Hill. It's a nice, friendly atmosphere that has great activities to do everyday. Everyone on campus is friendly and we take care of each other like family. I am proud to be part of the ETBU Tiger family!"
College Freshman,5,The school gives out a lot of scholarship money and they are very lenient towards financial aid
College Freshman,5,Every administrative employee I have met have been very nice and the students respect what they have to say.
College Freshman,5,The financial aid options that ETBU are great and better than what I was offered at other schools.
College Freshman,5,"I consider it the best because there are minimal parties. I like this because as a student athlete, it gives you less distraction and more time to focus on my studies."
College Freshman,5,The food is great on campus. My favorite preference is the salad bar because they have a variety of options to put on your salad.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is so nice on campus and the living choices are excellent compared to other colleges.
Recent Alumnus,5,There are not many parties. The party scene definitely has a positive impact because all of the students are involved. It ends up being a fun experience.
Recent Alumnus,5,"There has been no campus crime, that I have heard of. I do feel pretty safe on campus. My roommates leave our door unlocked all the time. After midnight the housing gates are locked and closed and if they are opened an alarm goes off. I do feel safe on this campus."
College Junior,5,There are tons of social activities to get involved in almost every day but at least once a week. Everyone is kind and friendly for the most part. There's no curfews unless your in sports so within reason you can stay out as late as you'd like to.
College Junior,5,we prefer not to party
College Junior,5,There is always campus security around during the day and policemen on campus during the night
College Junior,5,I really like the social scene at ETBU. I like interacting with other Christians and being able to surround myself with each of them. There is always some sort of bible study or get together going on.
College Junior,5,I love East Texas Baptist University. I really like how the school has lots of events to attend. They really make it an enjoyable college experience.
College Freshman,5,love the professors!! we have tutoring and the workload is not over bearable..
College Freshman,5,Its a christian school so everyone here is nice and polite...
College Freshman,5,i have been here a year have not seen drugs or alcohol on campus
College Freshman,5,"Their is nothing like Texas weather, she keeps you guessing everyday!"
College Freshman,5,"I love the housing, i stay in married housing becasue i have kids"
Freshman,4,"I personally have not taken any classes online, but I have heard that everything ran smoothly. I heard the teachers responded well with their students over canvas and were able to publish assignments  fairly easily."
Sophomore,4,"As a whole, East Texas Baptist University has so far been a wonderful experience for someone like me who prefers a small-town feel in their college, as well as more Christ-focused learning. Simultaneously, the professors assist your education and faith, all whilst being generally friendly and accepting of whoever you may be. The classes can be a little difficult, though that honestly depends on your ability to adapt to the use of Canvas in all your classes, and the class in specific you are in. Even if you aren't doing the best, you only need to ask a fellow student or professor, and 9.5 times out of 10 you'll be sure to get the assistance you need. With some of the on-campus activities, namely pre-test study sessions the professors set up, asking for help usually isn't required. My only complaint would be the surrounding area, Marshal. I understand not everywhere in America is nice, however, Marshal and the campus contrast vastly in appearance and a feeling of safety."
Sophomore,4,"The latter half of my spring semester was forced online due to Covid-19, and all I have to say is that it was not a particularly great experience. In this case however I won't place blame on ETBU or the professors, as looking back they did their best, and their best was wonderful. Personally, however, online courses simply drain my motivation, which made utilizing Canvas (something all classes use) a drag. Again though, this was simply due to how I'm wired, ETBU did a fantastic job adapting, especially given the spontaneousness of the situation."
Senior,4,"I overall have enjoyed my experience at east Texas Baptist University very much. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved in campus in different organizations, and I am so glad that I made the choice to do that. I have developed a lot of leadership skills and confidence from my time on campus, and that is priceless to me. The professors overall are very good and genuinely care about the students, and the other employees on campus are wonderful as well (especially in the caf). There are a lot of sports and activities going on year-round, and there is a great Christ-Centered value system. There are some problems, as there are with any college, but I whole-heartedly recommend this school."
Freshman,4,I love it here. They have really nice laddies working in the cafeteria. The sports facilities are perfect. I love playing hockey here.
Junior,4,I love the atmosphere and professors. I love how much help we get and how understanding everyone is when it comes to the struggles of students. Great ratio of students to professors.
Freshman,4,"My experience at ETBU was good. A few things I liked was how small the campus was, teachers interacting with student and how much we get involved to help the community. I think helping the community is a very important. However, one thing I would like to see at ETBU is more organizations for example art club, so that student can express themselves."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love going to college at East Texas Baptist University. If you are looking for a very good Christian atmosphere then ETBU is they way to go. The faculty are amazing and they are wanting you to succeed to get your 4 year degree. They are willing to help you any way possible to get the grade that you want in the class. Also, they many tutoring sessions for any topic that you are struggling on and the sessions are taught by students that have excelled in that topic of study. Campus life they always have something going from events, tail gates, and even trips that you can go on during breaks. If you want to go to a school that is centered around Christ and has community of Christian believers then I would highly recommend going to ETBU."
Freshman,4,"Friendly campus environment. Not to big so you won't get lost, overall its a pretty good school. They offer a lot of help if you need it."
Junior,4,"As an incoming Junior, I have spent a fair share of time at East Texas Baptist and in my truthful opinion this is a great school depending on your purpose. If you want a school with some of the top education systems in the state, and a school that is going to care for you and not just deem you a number. A school that will push you to stay in line and focused on education without the distractions, then East Texas Baptist is a great school. Their is not a lot of opportunities to go and party and get into a lot of things at East Texas, but their is enough to still have a fun college experience. East Texas is a school that is focused on their education and giving you the opportunity to gain a relationship, if not a better relationship with God. This school is the great opportunity to become spiritually successful in life."
Alum,4,"East Texas Baptist University provides a fantastic education along with a set of dedicated staff that desire to see you do your best. The campus life is extremely supportive and feels like family. There was never a time where I felt like I was drowning in studies or loneliness because there were always encouragers, whether it be professor or fellow students."
Sophomore,4,I like that East Texas baptist University is a small school because I did not want to go to a school where there are 300 students in a class. I love the atmosphere and all the students and staff and professors are so welcoming and are willing to help you if you need it.
Senior,4,"My experience at East Texas Baptist University has been enjoyable and coming in as a transfer, they made me feel welcomed. Being in a small and a small campus everyone there is almost like one big family. The students and staff support us on athletic teams a lot and we really appreciate it. Most of all, the love of God and His presence is so abundant across campus."
Alum,4,"ETBU helped mold me into who I am today. During my time there, I had my ups and downs with the school and town but you will have people there that truly care about you. I met my best friend for life there and we still talk every week even though we are over 6 hours away. Dr. Franklin, the head of the communication department, was the best mentor I could have asked for. He cared about my education as well as my well being and pushed me to become my absolute best. I will never take my years at ETBU for granted."
College Student,4,The courses and professors are amazing I've seem I have build a good relationship with them
College Student,4,I love the campus housing it's amazing
College Freshman,4,Ive only visited once but it was a great experience. I cant wait for the fall
College Sophomore,4,Every class I have taken is directly connected to my degree and is needed. The professors are friendly and want to see you achieve. There are many courses offered for a variety of degrees and elective credits. Even in gen. ed. classes the size is about 20-25 students. Then as you get more into your degree there are less and less.
College Sophomore,4,"I live in the University Apartments and I love it here. I love the kitchen space, the big living room, and the rooms are a perfect size for me."
College Sophomore,4,I love the sense of community and that you really get to know your professors.
College Freshman,4,Many diverse groups on campus
College Freshman,4,All the classes are great for the most part. Some have lots of busy work just speeding on professor. Most are leaniate on late or make up work.
College Freshman,4,They try to help out students as much as they can to further their education
College Freshman,4,I like living in the dorms
College Freshman,4,Our athletics are pretty good for a D-2 school
College Freshman,4,A great school to get involved in many things.
College Freshman,4,I love the close knit environment of East Texas Baptist University. The small size makes it easier to get involved with multiple activities and make tons of new friends.
College Freshman,4,I love the sports here
College Freshman,4,I love the college Im attending and would recommend it to others
College Freshman,4,"The school works hard to keep us safe. We have police on patrol most of the time, and to get into a resident hall you must have a key card."
College Freshman,4,There are many different job opportunities on campus.
College Freshman,4,"As a Freshman you live in Centennial Hall, and it is so nice. You have your own room, a full size bed, you only share the bathroom with one other person, and there are Washers and Dryers on every floor. The lobby can get kind of crazy, but otherwise I have loved living in Centennial."
College Freshman,4,"At ETBU it is always a good day to be a tiger. School spirit is a big part of campus life. Even when our team isn't doing all that great, we support each other."
College Junior,4,I'm an Athletic Training major and this school provides the hands on experience I wanted as a student and the professors invest their time in us as students and really care about our success.
College Junior,4,Everything here is awesome. The only problem is that it is super small. I feel once I leave no one will trust my degree because they never heard of ETBU.
Recent Alumnus,4,The food has been pretty good. There are some days where there may not be enough of a variety or not that many healthy choices but for the most part everything tastes fine. Some foods lack flavor sometimes. If the cafeteria is not a good option for the day then the Sub Connect or Jazzman's Cafe are good spots to eat something.
Recent Alumnus,4,I have not seen any Greek life at this university.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is enough of a variety to choose from. You can find good restaurants with a reasonable cost. There are no student discounts that I have found. The best place I found to check out is called ""The Blue Frog Grill""."
Recent Alumnus,4,Living on campus is an easy process. You get everything you need.
Recent Alumnus,4,There are a good amount of students at athletic events showing their support. The teams play fairly well depending on which team is playing. We are prideful Tigers.
College Sophomore,4,ETBu has great party scenes and involves everyone.
College Freshman,4,Something every week to go to
College Junior,4,"I love being a psychology major.. The teachers, the curriculum,  etc."
College Junior,4,"I had no issues getting into the psychology department. I switched halfway through my freshman year from Biology to psychology and other than tons of forms to fill out, the overall experience was great :)"
College Junior,4,There are tons of majors to chose from. I'm not partial or anything but the psychology department is awesome! :)
College Junior,4,"The teachers are great, the classes are great, and with that being said, the teachers for the most part don't mind you coming to them with class issues or even personal issues if you feel comfortable with them. It doesn't seem like a teacher student relationship it's more like a mentor and mentoree relationship"
College Junior,4,There is pretty typical looks at school
College Junior,4,"Other than poor lighting in some areas, I have never felt uncomfortable around campus."
College Junior,4,it is diverse in some ways but not a lot
College Junior,4,love being in student foundation
College Junior,4,ETBU is a very safe place
College Junior,4,the people are great and truly care for eachother
College Junior,4,The campus is very safe and I always feel secure.
College Junior,4,We have great teams in every sport. There is also a lot of fan support.
College Junior,4,Everyone is typically very friendly.
College Junior,4,"School are always looking for athletic trainers to cover sporting events, especially with the recent spike in high school related sports deaths."
College Junior,4,Overall I have met some amazing professors who genuinely take an interest in personal educational experience.
College Junior,4,I love that we are a big family in my major.
College Junior,4,We have a great athletic center. I really like the student center and the greenery around campus. We have many traditions and each of them are unique.
College Junior,4,I really like almost all of the professors. The curriculum is challenging but not too difficult to overcome.
Sophomore,2,"As far as professors go, they are absolutely wonderful. Administration however, is a complete mess. They are so focused on making sure students pay for their crimes like visitation hours violations and being found with alcohol in their apartment, that they don't even have time to implement ways to help students enjoy their experience here on campus. I am a current student at ETBU, but I will ABSOLUTELY be transferring. The cafeteria food is horrible, it gave me food poisoning several times during my freshman year. There is nothing to do on campus, with the exception of bible studies. No tailgates, no Greek life, no parties allowed, no visitation with the opposite gender after midnight (10 PM for freshmen in Centennial). Overall, great professors, intensely strict, the kind of Christian atmosphere that shoves religion down the throats of the student body, very little school spirit, and very few returning students."
Freshman,2,"I would like to see change in the staff department's conduct. For an entire week, I had a fiasco with receiving my financial aid award and for the entire week, the financial aid department was not on one accord with my file. Therefore, I jumped through several hoops and went in several circles when the solution was simple from the get go. Then, today, I called the student affairs department to adjust my tuition plan, and the woman hung up in my face while I was in the middle of asking a question. I have not attended the university yet, but so far my experience has not been to pleasant."
College Freshman,2,We don't have Greek or if we do I don't know about it
College Freshman,2,The weight-room is small there are not enough free weights and there are mostly machines.
College Freshman,2,There are limited off campus housing options
College Freshman,2,"I feel like this school is still way too strict on many things. Visitation hours, there have been a few events for the entire year and we are paying $30,000 per year. They should fix that get all people involved"
College Freshman,2,"I am paying close to $2,000 per semester for mediocre food. If i could buy all of my food i would. The quality is bad in my opinion and they repeat a lot of meals"
Recent Alumnus,2,Not many students at this school live off-campus so I do not know what that process is like because I live on-campus.
College Sophomore,2,not much is offered considering its a college town
College Freshman,2,"They need a checklist, so the ""mom's"" can do each check point, it was 1 paper then another, then o wait another for like 4 months, then went to register and was told had everything, then filled out another paper. The whole thing was a pain."
College Freshman,2,"""Wellness check"" means they can go through your room when your not there and take anything they think is inappropriate, and then give you a warning."
College Junior,2,There is not a very big party scene at the school.
College Junior,2,"Marshall is stuck between Longview and Shreveport, we don't stand much of a chance"
College Junior,2,I like the majority of places to eat but it's nearly all the same cuisine
College Freshman,2,"There is not a lot of school spirit here for sports. Football games were very empty and boring, nobody would cheer for our team. The only sport that gets a lot of attention is the softball team, but that is only because they have won more games and won a national championship. Even if they have games on weekends, there are not a lot of fans who are students because everyone usually leaves on the weekend"
College Junior,2,Still have to get loans
College Sophomore,2,"For the most part the school is a good chose financially, but if you don't want to have to come out of pocket I would suggest applying for all types of scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,"the strictness of the school really depends how we act as a student body; but for the most part they're pretty lenient on visitation, and policies."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not many housing facilitates or options period. There are no off-campus options like other university's such as Sam Houston State, or University of Texas.  
Campus activities are improving thanks to our wonderful President, and they are becoming more ethnically diverse."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There really aren't many scholarships that you can receive at the university.  If that were one of the downfalls I could change it would be this:  There are no scholarships for academic excellence, only for transfers.
It is very hard to find other funds to pay for college here, if your financial aide does not fully cover it."
Alum,1,"Worst place to go. Has no values, professors could care less about you, they say they are a Christian school yet they have no ethics or morals nor does it represent Christ in any way. If you want to go to a school where the professors call you “ignorant, stupid, a failure, they don’t know why they let you into the program, worthless” and a place where a professor cussed you out then go ahead. 
They party WAYYY too hard. Athletes are valued more than anything and get away with too much. Respect and love is the last thing the campus has on their mind. Blackburn is trying to make it like DBU. My advice would be not to even apply. Not worth the student debt."
College Freshman,1,There is some to no sort of parties on campus. too strict
College Freshman,1,We haven't really talked much about so don't know what to really say
College Junior,1,My college does not have a greek life
College Student,1,off campus housing not allowed
College Junior,1,"There basically is no night life here, unless it's illegal most likely"
College Junior,1,"Drug use isn't the problem, it's alcohol consumption--practically unlimited amounts of students drink on a regular basis"
College Freshman,1,ETBU doesn't have transportation. The campus is walk able. if you need to go anywhere you can walk. If you need to go to town for groceries get your car or roommate. If you are injured and hurt they do provide someone to drive you around on a go-cart to get you to class on time. 
College Sophomore,1,"Guys at my school are mostly after one thing, you will find those select few that actually like you for your personality, instead of your body. Girls here are nice, but then you will find those ones who are just rude."
Recent Alumnus,1,No public transportation period. Usually have to hitch rides with friends or roommates who have cars on campus.
College Junior,1,"This campus is VERY STRICT. The opposite sex cannot be in your room after 10 during the week and after 11 on the weekends. They even check on you once an hour and you have to stay in the common room. There is a strict no alcohol, drug, sex, or smoking policy on campus and it could easily get you kicked out even if everyone in your room is 21. Rumors spread like wildfire and even when faculty hears about something you did while off campus, you are likely to get in trouble."
College Junior,1,There are only 2 greek organizations. They are both Christian and independent. I hope for more variety in that area in the future.
College Freshman,1,"The off campus dining options are just your basic fast food eating places and often times are not even open past 11. Therefore, your chances of getting a late night snack at the place of your choice is slim."
College Freshman,1,The Varsity sports at this school are not very good overall and the student body does not seem to be very interested in attending the events.
College Junior,1,There isn't much off-campus housing to choose from. And the housing that is here is terrible.
College Sophomore,1,Most guys are churchy and very religious or completely party jocks. Girls are either stuck-up or overly friendly. Not much steryotype veriation. Everyone is in a relationship and close-minded. Small town kids.

Junior,5,I love the fact that we have so many resources that we are able to utilize when we are in need of help. The diversity of students that attend SFSU is another reason why the school itself is amazing! I've met many friends thru the classes that I've taken since the beginning of my freshmen year in college. I have felt more than welcomed and comfortable enough to walk on campus.
Graduate Student,5,"University shifted quickly and perfectly to online learning during the pandemic, I didn't have so many online class experiences before, but now I can say it's probably useful with high quality. Professors engage you with classes and have interaction with students in the class."
Alum,5,My experience taking online courses was great overall. I took animal physiology online. My professor was quick to respond to my emails. Easy access to lectures and course material.
Junior,5,"This school has a lot of history, and if you're a fan of social justice and ethnic studies this is the best place to do that. For the size of the campus, the food is alright, however, since it is a commuter school you get to meet a lot of different people from different parts of California from being there. Most of the teachers are super nice and easy to talk to and Greek Life is inclusive. Wish tuition wasn't expensive though."
Senior,5,"I liked the every week there was something to do on campus. Also, all of the teachers I have had are dedicated to helping you."
Niche User,5,"The University of San Francisco is a private Jesuit university in San Francisco, California. The school's main campus is located on a 55-acre setting between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park."
Alum,5,"My online learning experience at SFSU was excellent, due in part to the lesson plans and accessibility from my professors and instructors. I was able to accommodate my work and school schedule efficiently, which resulted in earning some of top grades in the online courses."
Alum,5,"Its a great school. I love that the school is on the outskirts of San Francisco.
The lecturers are great. I got a fantastic education"
Junior,5,"The online learning experience at San Francisco State University is incredibly easy to access and easy to work. In the spring semester of 2019, when COVID 19 cases were increasing, students and faculty were forced to switch to online learning quickly so students wouldn’t fall behind in there studies. The switch to in person classes to online learning went smoothly because of my teachers."
Junior,5,What I like most about San Francisco State University is the diversity of cultures and the access of clubs there are to students. Students are always encouraged to be involved in the community and to be apart of change not only inside the university but also in the community of San Francisco.
Alum,5,"San Francisco State was a welcoming and diverse campus. The professors were passionate and focused on underrepresented voices in our culture. They were clear about their expectations from students, yet were willing to hear you out if you were struggling. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
Junior,5,SFSU uses iLearn to host their student portal. This website is pretty good. Easy to use albeit a bit old school concerning looks.
Junior,5,"I'm currently a student at SFSU. I like it a lot. The classes are flexible (which is important because I work full time), the teachers are awesome, and overall, I feel like the staff cares about its students."
Senior,5,go gators! go gators! go gators! go gators! go gators! go gators! go gators! go gators! go gators! go gators!
Alum,5,"My experience was great. I lived on campus/ near campus all 4 years of my undergrad career. I was very involved in student life which made the campus more intimate. Although it is a big commuter campus, getting involved on campus allowed for me to make more friends/connections. Sporting events weren't always the best but they were a free way to hang out with classmates/friends. The only downfall is that San Francisco is a very expensive city and this made housing a little unaffordable."
Alum,5,I truly enjoyed my time at SFSU. I loved how diverse it was and how there was a lot of guidance and workshops to help students prepare for college courses. I recommend this school to anyone who wants to be in a diverse environment and who love the Bay Area.
Alum,5,"SFSU is one of the most diverse colleges in the country. Fellow students are accepting of diversity and it is a thriving university. Recently remodeled, the university has a lot of services and recreational activities to offer students. Education is made easily accessible and professors are passionate about learning and their respective fields. Additionally, the university is set in arguable one of the most abundant and beautiful cities in the world."
Freshman,5,The lifestyle in San Francisco State University is unlike any other. There is always something to do and it is a place you will never get tired of due to the life you can feel the second you enter the campus.
Senior,5,"Gives what you put in. Doesn't have very many sporting activities but definitely makes up for it with the city not far away. Speaking from a senior finance major, the business school has tons of services and definitely gives ample instruction/opportunity."
Junior,5,"I like that my school is very diverse and celebrates that. Some of the teachers are also very nice and passionate about the topic that they are teaching. They have many student organizations that try to make students feel welcomed, especially those who do not live in San Francisco. However, some of the teachers are bad and I want them to be recognized because they can really ruin somebody’s grade."
Freshman,5,My experience is fantastic. We have the best faculty and the environment is super open-minded and friendly where you can be yourself and express your identity. It's an amazing experience.
Niche User,5,I liked how diverse the campus was and the classrooms were very good settings to learn in. My professors were very helpful and I'm so glad I chose this school.
Freshman,5,"For my first year of attending this school, the learning environment was very good. The teachers and students are very kind to one other and their teachings are on point. There was never a time where I left after a lecture and not understand something. If you ever feel like you're falling behind, there are some tutoring programs here that will help you. For my chemistry class, there was an additional tutoring class for 1 unit that don't give you any homework and only have to listen to reviews. I'm looking forward for my upcoming years at this university."
Senior,5,"As my first university, the services and overall programs they offer here have been one of the best. The school has a strong community presence and the faculty do seem to care a lot about the student body, during their enrollment, and after graduation."
Freshman,5,"I haven't started yet at SFSU but I will be starting in fall 2020, so far my experience with the school and the staff have been amazing. I'm super excited to soon be attending SFSU this year."
Sophomore,5,"SFSU has a lot of useful resources to help students to achieve their academic and career goals. Varies Financial aid and scholarships are applicable. There are many hiking/camping trips(decent price)you can sign up if you are interested in outdoor activities. As international student, the OIP office is very helpful as well. You can find all the information on the SFSU website, it is well organized as well."
Junior,5,"The campus is nice, I love the weather. The programs offered are awesome and professors are super helpful."
Niche User,5,I like the fashion and vibes of the city.  The value of the university is very unique.  I like that transportation is included in the ID.
Senior,5,"I like all the professors I had, there is a lot of people that complain too much and are not willing to put the work. All the classes I had taken have push me to be a better student."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student from College of the Desert in the Coachella Valley. New to the Bay Area and have been helped through my major (cinema) program through the process. The department has recommended courses and one on one advisors. As well as, up to date events within my major. The campus is wonderful and have found my way around its beautiful scenery of nature and the delicious food provided. I can surely focus more on campus with my studies than home. Especially with that cup of Joe located all over the campus is a real treat."
Freshman,5,"Being across The Bay from UC Berkeley, one of the most competitive California universities, San Francisco State is a great alternative to their stress-culture. It is a welcoming university that you get out what you put into it. If you want to just show up for classes and do your own thing, then it's perfect for you. But if you want to become more involved on campus, there are over 300 inviting clubs and organizations. I've really enjoyed my time at SFSU so far and I can't wait to learn more, meet new people, and ultimately graduate!"
Senior,5,"It is a really chill campus with a nice environment. The coolness of San Francisco is embodied by the campus. The food is alright, it would be nicer if there were different food options."
Niche User,5,"San Francisco State has a beautiful campus and just overall is such an amazing school.  I visited this campus one year ago and immediately fell in love with it, from the architecture to the very green grass, this college is just one big dream of mine."
Senior,5,I love where the school is located and its just close to family and stores to eat at I have many friends that already go there
Freshman,5,"My biggest dream since I knew what dreams were was to go to college. When I came to live in San Francisco California I never thought to stay for college in the city. I knew I wanted to go to college to get an education but I didn't want to stay at home. However, as soon as I saw the SFSU campus I immediately fell in love with it. I love the size of the campus and how diverse the school community is. Being a Hispanic student has at times made me feel like I don't belong but I don't feel like that at SF State. The campus is always vibrant with activities to do as well as being in an extremely beautiful neighborhood.  The academics are exemplary and the instructors are more than willing to help. I love how close it is to my house and how transportation is very easy to find both to downtown San Francisco and the surrounding cities. Definitely the best school I could have picked!"
Freshman,5,Great Campus and great community of students and clubs was easy to make friends. I love this campus and there is a library that's huge but can get quite full most of the time.
Sophomore,5,Has a very liberal political point of view which I expected since it is San Francisco. Very diverse so even though the classes are usually taught by liberal professors there are students from conservative backgrounds attending. The school is diverse with all kinds of people.
Freshman,5,"SFSU has a very beautiful campus and offers a nice slection of courses. The people here are friendly and tend to be more outgoing. There is not much of a night life, but there are some parties. People like to walk around at night and admire the surrondings of the school. Also most professors seem to be really chill and understanding."
Niche User,5,"I love the campus, the people here are so genuine nice and are very helpful. The professional are very easy to reach and are understanding. I love this university."
Sophomore,5,"SF State is a pretty great school. The parking situations is pretty difficult, and the campus is pretty much cold 99% of the time. Academics are good and they offer a ton of classes. Lots of majors. Lots of student orgs."
Sophomore,5,"very good school, and there is a lot of diversity found on campus and the city in general. everyone is so nice and willing to help you out if you ask for it."
Freshman,5,"Most of my professors were very understanding and made going to class worth it. The social aspect is very difficult if not in greek life due to being a commuter school, but overall, I enjoyed my first year at SFSU."
Alum,5,"Unique ""commuter school"" in the SF Bay Area. There are plenty of things to do on and off-campus. Their new Wellness Center is amazing!"
Freshman,5,"The campus is really nice, easy to follow. The orientations really gave a welcoming feeling and they really do help run through processes as long as you ask for help."
Freshman,5,Being from LA it was a little scary being far from home. I loved the campus and my overall experience. Its definitely not what I expected but I fell in love with city. My classes taught me a lot and loved the friendships I made. Im excited to go back and explore and learn more about my career.
Junior,5,"San Fransisco State had a very knowledgable staff, who were very helpful whenever I needed assistance. The campus is very spacious with a good touch of nature. Being in there Bay Area, it would get chilly sometimes, but it is expected. Every area is well kept and I would recommend this college to anyone I know, because it truly is beautiful."
Sophomore,5,I loved the diversity and how open students were. I liked that some of the professors did show that they cared about the students and emphasized that it was okay to go to office hours if they wanted to speak about anything. I liked that
Sophomore,5,"I love how accepting everyone is, especially the teachers. There are opportunities for every interest!"
Freshman,5,Love the city but dorms are expensive to stay I recommend to find your own apartment and everyone is nice. There is a mall close by less than 10 minutes away. Easy to get there with transportation. Hard to find parking and parking is expensive as well.
Freshman,5,Such a great campus with great student life! I feel so alive and involved when I visited and also a great place to adventure off into.
Junior,5,"My favorite thing about SFSU is its location. A lot of students come from across the bay using BART, bus or driving. This school is easily accessible. BART is right in front of the school. The bus system is entirely free if you're enrolled in as a student. The gym membership is all free as well. The academics is awesome, I haven't had a problem with anything since I transferred last year. I love this school!"
Sophomore,5,This college has many people who want to help you with anything. They are open to everyone and are very welcoming in all clubs on campus.
Freshman,5,SFSU is in a beautiful area of San Francisco! The surrounding neighborhood is peaceful and the school itself is so green and filled with great views of the city.
Niche User,5,I was only in sfsu for the sneak peak review but it was so easy to navigate the area and everyone was ready to help anyone who is lost. twas a great experience for me n I will be back by fall this year
Niche User,5,I am a senior in high school and San Francisco State University was one of the colleges that I applied to. They were my first acceptance and I was automatically in love. I have a friend who will also be attending and she has actually been to their campus. She describe the whole campus to me and the services they provide and I was excited to go. I went onto their website and took a quick virtual tour and the campus is beautiful. Their website is also easily accessible. Their tuition is not too costly and they provide multiple financial aid opportunities. I am looking forward on attending San Francisco State University.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love my campus because there is always somethjng that you can do. There are so many people that you can learn from and create fun memories during your time here. The professors genuinely love their career and life so that passion is obvious throughtout their lectures. The school has so much to offer and there is lots of opportunities to meet a group of people that you can hang out with everyday. Even if there was a time that you are bored, you can easily just hop on the muni and go anywhere within the city which is such a fun thing to do. I love how diverse this school is and the weather is amazing everyday if you love the cold."
Senior,5,"I love this college. It has opened my eyes to new perspectives in regarding ethnic studies and applying what I learn to how I can use it in the real world. Many of the classes I took had field trips where we got to do community service, explore classroom topics outside the university walls. All my classes have been enlightening and there was never a dull class. The teachers were exceptional! Definitely destroyed my fear of being a transfer student into a university. They made me feel like I have been going there since I was a Freshman in college."
Senior,5,San Francisco State has been a great experience of learning in an area of the city that is more quiet and near the beach.  I have never felt uncomfortable and always felt welcome in a learning environment.
Niche User,5,San Francisco State is an amazing university that any one from any background would feel welcome at.
Senior,5,"amazing study environment, also have some great professors who help me grow and learn a lot of good things.  Biochemistry department have a lot of good professors who help me get my degree in a short period of time. I was a transfer student from a community college and the deference in education quality was huge."
Junior,4,"The transition of in person learning to online learning has been such a smooth adjustment. Although it's harder to be motivated and be on top of weekly assignments, I've figured out a way to keep myself on track such as purchasing a planner. I miss being able to interact with my peers in class because I'm the type of learner that needs to communicate with others as well as being a hands on person."
Senior,4,"The classes I've taken that are strictly online have gone well. Before covid it hadn't been too confusing or difficult. However, it been a bit difficult now because the work load feels a lot heavier."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the diversity and the respect for different communities such as LGBTQ. The campus is really beautiful and facilitated. I like professors of design school, they're friendly and caring. The vibe is awesome and it has a great gym to work out after your class."
Junior,4,"Great campus! Great Faculty! Great City! COVID online classes since mid-spring 2020--not so great. Now, we hear spring 2021 will also be conducted online.
Despite this, the entire staff is keeping a brave face and ensuring all students we will receive every possible consideration regarding extenuating circumstances.
Overall, my experience with the campus is positive. Much has changed since I first attended SFSU in 1987-88. What has remained the same is the friendliness of the student body; the atmosphere of enlightenment; the trees in the quad.
When this COVID restriction is finally lifted, I look forward to revisiting the campus."
Junior,4,"My only issue is obtaining reliable WiFi service. I am awaiting a HotSpot provided by the university--it has been over three months since my initial inquiry. The first one mailed to me arrived with no SIM card.

Other than that, I am acclimating to Zoom and learning to keep abreast off all notifications in iLearn and Campus platforms."
Sophomore,4,"San Francisco State University is incredibly diverse. The campus is blooming with different clubs and activities. The staff however remains pretty similar in age and race, yet they are still appreciative of culture!"
Sophomore,4,"It has been a definite challenge to transfer to online schooling. Although I learn and zoom are very easy to be compatible with and teachers update regularly, there is a lack of understanding technology that infers with some classes."
Alum,4,"Loved my experience at SF State University overall! Great quality of education, qualified professors willing to help you, and diversity! Only thing I wish would improve was a stronger sense of community. Its perfect for anyone who wants to attend a ""commuter school."""
Junior,4,"Online classes have been a huge adjustment for me, being that I focus better in the classroom away form the distractions. However, the professors have made it easier for their students to transition smoothly to online learning. All my professors have been very active on email and has guided me through the distance learning patiently and have been considerate of living situations. They're also flexible."
Junior,4,Overall the online learning experience has been very good and I have no complaints. We use iLearn and it’s generally well organized and easy to navigate.
Junior,4,I like the way the counseling and advising staff are always checking in and making sure you have the help you need. I also like how much assistance is available for food insecurity and basic needs for students who are struggling financially. The only think I think isn’t great is the coffee in the cafeteria!
Alum,4,"I graduated with a BA in English and a MA is Speech in the early 70’s. The English department was unfortunately mediocre; however, the speech department was
exceptional with such professors like Nancy McDermid and Hank McGucken.  They taught skills in argumentation, scholarship, leadership, and what are often referred to as soft skills that are essential for success in the professional world.  Although I retired in 2009 from a community college where I used these skills to participate in faculty leadership roles, continually study ways to improve instruction, and create published research, I return to teach approximately 34 days each year in the college’s speech department, and this fall I will begin by 51st year of teaching.  The  SF State Speech Department provided me with  a solid academic training, and CSU tuition at that time was extremely affordable."
Senior,4,"All of the online classes I have had were but it depends on the teacher. Most teachers are understanding. Usually there are essays, quizzes and/or a few tests."
Senior,4,"everyone at the university is so kind, welcoming and helpful. i've made some of the best friends and memories here. however, it can sometimes be challenging to choose classes for a specific major, especially science, because we are not given insight on classes like prerequisetes. it is somewhat frustrating to be so behind and spend more time and money on school in the most expensive city when most of us are struggling to make it through school."
Senior,4,"it is difficult to go through online classes, the professors are still learning as well so it is a trying effort for everybody. I feel somewhat better in an online class because I can do things my own pace and I have many more resources than at the college, I also save money on rent and other necessities since I am now living at home."
Alum,4,"SFSU offered the major program that I had been interested in for years, it was a goal to graduate and pursue a career in my chosen field, and eventually continue my academic career in a graduate program, to carry on the education and experience I had from SFSU."
Graduate Student,4,"I transferred to SFSU and was there for about two and a half years. I found the orientation process to be very helpful and informative to new and transfer students. The campus is very beautiful, well kept, and not too far from the beach. The staff is very helpful but I would recommend checking in with at least two advisors when choosing your classes. The change I would like to see is more class sections to register in as getting into classes every semester was always a challenge because they filled up so quickly."
Senior,4,"I was a transfer student and pretty not about finishing school, but SFSU gave me the tools to finish. I was able to climb up to being an A student after"
Senior,4,"In the wake of COVID-19, the whole school went virtual. It was a rocky start but it still worked out."
Senior,4,My experience with online learning at school was fine. it was better than expected as a lot of professors seemed like they knew what they were doing
Senior,4,My experience with online learning at school was fine. it was better than expected as a lot of professors seemed like they knew what they were doing
Junior,4,"I am in love with SFSU's library. The fourth floor especially because it is the floor where it is very quiet and I've gotten so much work done there. I've had may professors that care about whether or not I am learning from them and they've made it clear they are here to help me. I haven't had too many bad experiences at college that weren't my own fault. I also like that our school makes sure to communicate to us what is going on. If there are any emergencies, we get emails right away and they keep us updated about what is going on on campus."
Junior,4,"I am a rising junior and have had a pretty decent experience with my school so far! I really appreciate and enjoy the ethnic studies department as it allows for students to learn about various cultures and complete their general education in light of said cultures and perspectives. The gym has been remodeled in the past few years and is easily accessible to students. There are therapy dogs, panels, campus events, and more to either bring awareness to certain topics or just bring more life and ""togetherness"" on campus. Personally, registering for classes has been fairly easy even without the help of a counselor; although scheduling meetings with counselors has not been difficult for me either. Dining hall food is mediocre, but depending on your meal plan, is always accessible! There are (pricey) options on campus as well. I think the dorms were my least favorite part as they are way too overpriced and dirty."
Junior,4,I only started taking online classes when campuses shut down due to COVID-19. My professors were very understanding and did their best to make remote learning accessible for all students while maintaining the substance of their lessons.
Alum,4,"Easy to get around, find classes, etc. 40-minute muni ride to downtown. Easy 10-minute walk to stones town shopping mall. I had great experiences with my teachers. Follow the roadmap for your major and classes will be easy to register."
Junior,4,"I love it !!!!! It's a quick train ride into the city and I love being immersed into the culture of San Francisco. Even though it's located in a big city, the campus is relatively safe. It's very homey and I really can't imagine being at any other school."
Junior,4,"I had to take all my spring 2020 classes online due to coronavirus, and most of my teachers did really good at moving over to an online classroom. One or two of my teachers had a tougher time which made it hard for learning, but it was probably due to the suddenness of having to move to a platform they didn't know much about. I have also taken two online classes (non-coronavirus related) and they were amazing!"
Senior,4,"Overall, I wish they had been more thoughtful and considerate of how their budget is distributed. Their priorities are tainted and their obsession with wanting to defund the Ethnic Studies program and starve the professors of a good salary is unhealthy."
Sophomore,4,"It was not as I expected it to be, but it was a good experience as I got to know so many different people and made some good connections."
Alum,4,"Online learning can be challenging, as it relies on the willingness of others to foster communication and discussion. The professors facilitated the course well, setting up assignments and discussions that encouraged discourse."
Freshman,4,"I truly loved my experience here at SF State, especially having moved from SoCal up north since the area was able to provide a diverse and unique experience that allowed me to grow and develop as a young adult. One of my biggest advice is to join as many organizations that interest you since finding a community here is beyond rewarding especially with the diverse amount of organizations available to join. One criticism I can give the school is the lack of communication from your academic advisor and an organized resource center for latino/a/x students."
Freshman,4,"I have had no previous learning experience here, as a incoming freshman this year. But I'm safe to say the welcoming atmosphere and diversity has really interested me to pursure a college career at this institution."
Senior,4,"I loved the diversity of campus, there is a group, community, club, place for everyone. It fostered a very welcoming environment for students"
Junior,4,"I am a commuter student, travel 40 minutes, and take classes twice a week. The amenities on campus are great like free parking, tutoring, and programs to help first-year students.  The first year I joined Metro, which is a program designed to help first-generation students. Diversity is a feature that I would consider the number one quality of this school and reflects throughout the classes offered here. This campus is welcoming to all and wants to see students succeed and learn as much as they can."
Senior,4,SFSU gave me the opportunities to connect with organizations and individuals that assisted in my development during my undergrad that have shaped my education and my pursuit of furthering it.
Freshman,4,"I just received admission to SFSU; however, from the information I’ve accumulated, I can say that it provides students with adequate resources through support systems such as faculty, advisors, and other campus mentors. The nursing program is quite selective as approximately 80 students are admitted out of 500-600 of applicants. I am excited to embark on the college journey, learning and making connections with my peers and professors. Some issues that have been common among students’ concerns are the dorms and housing. The process can be quite unorganized, and may not accommodate all undergrads. Overall, the school has a great atmosphere and beneficial opportunities for students (i.e. clubs, sorority/fraternity, other student held organizations)."
Alum,4,"Overall I enjoyed my experience. Yes it's located inside SF, but on the outskirts on the south side which is nice as it's close to the freeway, but right next to public transit lines to help get into the city. If you're ethnic, it's nice because the student population is very diverse and there are lots of clubs you can join if you need that support. A few downfalls: it's a huge commuter school, no large sports programs (i.e. football team) so the huge school pride deal isn't quite a thing here. There are lots of different classes you can take which reflect the diversity of the area. Also, since this is a public school, it's on the cheaper-ish side of the spectrum."
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed the tour at San Francisco. It was very nice to be welcomed by a lot of the faculty and students there. The area surrounding it was also very beautiful. There is plenty to keep one individual (and their friends) busy.
Freshman,4,"The education is great and the school is built around social justice, however the school isn't really big in the sports side and often times it's boring"
Freshman,4,It's a very cool university filled with great opportunities that you can choose from and you will find yourself having a great and educational experience. The campus has a great environment and students are learning the paths towards finding a career in their future.
Junior,4,"I have been attending San Francisco State for around three years now as a commuter living off-campus. My experience there has been mostly positive, and I do enjoy attending school."
Junior,4,"I love the professors; they are so nice and helpful. The classes are pretty interesting, and there is always something going on at campus even though we are a commuter school."
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed the environment but I do believe that the school needs an update. The school lacks control over their safety especially when it comes to dorm life. I believe as a commuter it’s a great school but as someone who lives on Campus it’s definitely a different lifestyle with several obstacles starting with the meal plan.
Senior,4,If they only had more funding and more classes they would be a superpower in the science field. The faulty in the college of science and engineering really care about their students and try their best to push them to seek research opportunities. They just need to make these resources more accessible to more students.
Alum,4,The professors at SFSU were really nice and helpful in teaching their courses and helping their students. SFSU's campus life was also vibrant and provided me a great experience overall.
Freshman,4,"The campus is fairly small which is great if you prefer have classes with less students. Most of the teachers I have encountered were approachable and willing to help in any way they could. I live in the dorms, so I believe the school could improve upon the food it serves in the dining hall. There could definitely be more options and better quality food."
Freshman,4,My time at San Francisco State University has been amazing so far. The teachers and staff on campus are very supportive of the students and wish the best for them. There is also a lot of diversity on the campus. The campus also makes financial aid easy and cost of attendance lower than most other campuses.
Freshman,4,"So far I'm happy with my experience at SFSU. The only suggestion I have, which is a pretty common issue for students, is getting the classes needed as well as a little more support from the academic advisors as far as knowing what classes are needed and support for declaring a major."
Freshman,4,"i love this college, I have met great people here and have really nice professors. I didn't know what to expect when I first started to attend here and I have to admit I was a little scared but once I got used to it I started loving this place and would highly recommend it to other people."
Alum,4,"SFSU is a great school if you consider being on a diverse campus. It provides affordable undergrad and grad programs as it has government fundings! Staffs and professors are mostly caring and friendly. You might not make close connections with your classmates, but it depends on how social are you. You can try a variety of food here as well! Also, if you want parking space, you might have to 15minutes up to holloway at the residential area where parking is all day long."
Junior,4,SFSU is the type of university that should be expected like another other state university. It doesn't seem to be any different from what I heard from my friends who attend other school. Everything is typical of a academic institution.
Junior,4,Transferring and I am Starting this month. Excited! looking forward to a great semester.its a big campus and I know there will be plenty of opportunity for me to make a better person of myself.
Freshman,4,"In this campus, I always felt so included given the diversity and the welcoming environment that San Francisco State University has offered me. There are a few flaws here and there but I would definitely say that my learning experience has benefited when I chose to go to this school."
Freshman,4,"San Francisco State so far has been a great experience. The people you meet are nice and many of the professors are very helpful in providing a great learning environment. One of the things that I would change is the communication between the students and the administration, as I had both financial and housing problems during the summer before I started my first semester."
Freshman,4,"So far, San Francisco State University has been a great overall experience! Not only is the campus very nice, but so are the teachers. No matter what there will always be that one professor you do not particularly like, however, I have had a positive experience with my professors. The classes are engaging and the school environment makes you want to go to school."
Alum,4,"The best highlights of SF State was the ability to communicate with the professors. I studied Biology and never found it difficult to setup a time to meet and discuss any questions or concerns I had in a class.

I would like to see an improvement in student run facilities and organizations. Many important resources are available but are not advertised enough for students."
Senior,4,"The school has such a great environment, the people are extremely welcoming. The buildings are not completely new yet they are very nice to work in. The library is a great place to study."
Senior,4,"I had a great experience taking cinema production classes, however they are very impacted and there are limited cinematography classes. It is difficult to find parties if you don't know people who throw parties and aren't in a sorority/frat. SFSU is a great school if you are interested in exploring the city; you will also spend a lot of time on public transit or in Ubers."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I like attending San Francisco State University. This school is quite diverse and people around campus are extremely nice. The professors I've had so far have been excellent."
Senior,4,The campus is an amazing place overall and you don't have to walk too far for classes. I wasn't too involved in campus life but there is always something happening.
Junior,2,Online is mediocre everyone is making the transition so I can't really fault them on this one. Not sure how well other students fared.
Sophomore,2,Professor teaching online was very bad. Or maybe I just had bad experiences but my classes were just recordings of teachers talking about a topic. And if you had any questions you had to email them  personally and are not able to ask them in class. Homework was very easy you did not have to put any effort into thinking about it.
Sophomore,2,"I went to SFSU last fall (fall of 2019) and this is what I can say about it. 

SFSU appeals to a lot of people for the following reasons: cost, acceptance, city life, diversity, culture, etc

This is what you will receive from SFSU. 
-Impaction: if you have 6 years to complete your major, by all means, go here. But don't think you can go here and figure it out later. Any resources you need will be up to you to find and it'll be pretty hard.
-Difficult Adjustment: this is one of the most painful adjustments ever, so many people drop out because of how hard it is, and how lonely it is. Making friends is really hard, and there is no campus solidarity or feel. you're alone until you find ""your people"" but it's tough.
-Cost: going here is a waste of Money. your meal plan only applies to city eats which is literally comparable to prison food (look it up) and everything is crazily overpriced for the lowest quality experience.

SFSU is nothing but an overpriced CC
- it's also crazy unsafe"
Freshman,2,"firstly, I come from a family where everyone goes to big colleges and I was really excited to start college. However, I'm pretty disappointed. No one is very social or outgoing or will start/engage in conversation, and I don't like campus life or the one event the school has per month that no one goes to. I like my teachers and classes, the location is pretty good, and thats about it. There is one dining hall everyone goes to and no other places that accept your meal plan. It's wack. Im transferring. I highly caution everyone attending if you don't live off campus in the city."
Freshman,2,"I didn't enjoy my time attending this school. The quality of life here at sfsu is terrible. If you do not have great social skills then this is not the school for you as a good percentage of the students are commuter and will be off campus. The dorms are a joke. The right elevator in the villages was always broken however I will admit that the college dorms feel safe. The campus food is a joke. There are some days where it's really good but often times meals can be hit or miss. Professors are also going to be a hit or miss. Most of my professors have been excellent, although have of mine have been online as I had to leave campus due to mental health issues. That being said, the school doesn't really help you with that either. Although they host a lot of events, a lot of students don't bother showing up to them. 
Really rethink going to this school. Although it may be for some people, it is definitely not for everyone."
Senior,2,"Hypocrisy and schadenfreude are usually the rule of law here. They speak of inclusion, but only if you are part of the preferred demographics. If you are gay, undocumented, or follow their own dictates, this is perfect for you. If not, SFSU is a new ring of Hell and too much like Trump University."
Junior,2,"I love the courses I’m taking. My main problem with the university is that the College of Ethnic Studies is always being threatened with budget cuts. If the College of Ethnic Studies is closed, where will all the Africana (myself included), Latin American, Asian American, & Native American students see themselves reflected? We have already been marginalized and have had to fight to get our own curriculums but the threat of it being taken away is constantly present."
Alum,2,"My counselor was unhelpful & hardly in her office, my professors in my major literally just talked at me for three hours each class & wrote the textbook verbatim on the board. A professor claimed I didn't turn in a paper & gave me an INC. When the professor finally found the paper a semester later it took me another semester to track her down. My counselor pretty much gave me a ""screw you this is your fault"" even though I was a good student with a 3.4 gpa. This professor was an hour late to each class & wouldn't email me back about her changing my grade even though she admitted she made a mistake. I have more stories of weird professors. I graduated but I can say it was the most inconvenient & annoying 4 years I have ever spent & I realized how much I hate the public education system. I used to be for public education, now I will be applying to private graduate programs although I'll have a massive amount of debt. I am not taking the chance of being inconvenienced multiple times."
College Sophomore,2,I lived in a small room with three other people while the other room only had 2. I paid almost 1400 for my portion of living and there was hardly any space. About 10 min to the farthest building and food is literally 5 minutes away or less.
College Junior,2,"I have very little knowledge of the greek life, other than that they are pretty typical stereotypes. Crappy toga parties, preying on freshman girls, and only letting attractive white people in."
College Sophomore,2,"If you love sports and the environment it creates, this isn't the place for you. Sports don't seem to be all that important to the average student. The facilities aren't the greatest either. The Basketball Gymnasium is smaller than my High Schools."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Too many sexual assults has taken place on the campus over

The years I've been at SFSU"
Recent Alumnus,2,Parking is horrible. Housing is expensive and outdated
College Sophomore,2,"I don't live on campus, but I have friends who live in the dorms and I hear it is very expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"DO NOT live on campus. It sucks. They require you to check in every guest and you can only have one guest at a time which to me is ridiculous considering some of us are paying as much as 1500 a month for these small apartments. I lived in the village, the biggest apartments on campus, and I got stuck in a room that was meant for a single person, except that I had a roommate. The room was not nearly large enough and made for some very difficult and uncomfortable situations. I hated it. If you do live on campus, go for the Marys where you will only have one roommate. You won't have a bathroom or living room but at least you will only have one person to deal with. Living in the village is awful because they squeezed WAY too many people into the rooms. If they kept it down to 4 per apartment MAYBE it would be alright but honestly I'd say just stick with the dorm-style apartments (Mary Park & Mary Ward). My RA was cute and quite nice though, but you can't even smoke in your room which is kind of irritating given the amount of money we're paying. Smoke in the bathroom with the door closed and the fan on and you will be just fine. You will figure out how to sneak guests in. And regardless of your choice, the noise will be unbearable so buy earplugs. OR JUST LIVE OFF CAMPUS like I WISH that I did. They also force you to have a meal plan with your housing which you can only use at the dining hall, which tastes AWFUL 98% of the time. Cook for yourself - its cheaper and tastier. I did the math and each swipe at the dining hall is $15."
College Freshman,2,I can't say I'm proud to go to this school. I can't represent
College Freshman,2,I'm saying it's bad because I have had such a bad experience so far.
Recent Alumnus,2,I don't know what good drug safety even looks like to contrast
Recent Alumnus,2,It's a step above it's the worst because we actually have a greek system I assume there's schools that don't have one at all but if you're not in one the people in one will silently judge you and the frat boys have groupies that sometimes aren't even in greek life and some sorority girls are too good to talk to you if you're not in one. A lot of people are just commuters and are oblivious to it. At the beginning of semesters there out there in the quad advertising for it. In Sf there'a rule that their not allowed to have frat houses though they do rent and room together at a couple of places it's not like SJSU or USC frat row. Frats from this school regularly meet with other schools and have socials together. Overall it's overpriced crap
College Sophomore,2,"I hardly ever hear people talk about sports. We don't have a football team, and our baseball team isn't very good. From what I have seen, sports events aren't a priority and school spirit is lacking."
College Freshman,2,it is unsafe no security
College Freshman,2,"When I worked on campus, I had issues receiving my checks for working."
College Freshman,2,I wish our school had a football team. That would get all the students pumped up.
College Freshman,2,Not too happy with this school. Many people plan to transfer out at the end of their sophomore year.
College Freshman,2,It's not that great because nearly everyone comutes
College Freshman,2,The safety and security on campus is getting tighter by the months. At first there were a few assaults that happened last semester.
College Freshman,2,"For me personally, since I have no idea what I'm doing, no one can guide me where I could be."
College Freshman,2,"It was not too safe, I would get constant emails about a robbery or assault on campus every few days."
College Freshman,2,I think a degree from this school would look good on a resume because of the location not the quality of the school.
College Freshman,2,"i found that not many course were available. If the times did not work with you, you would not being taking the course. There were not very many student help centers ANYWHERE!"
College Freshman,2,I think there are only 3 soroities to choose from and they're not worth your money
College Sophomore,2,I dont know where the career center on campus is. I do all of my internship and job seeking on my own. When I asked my major adviser for advice on an internship she could only provide me with names of places that she knows are popular internships among the students. There is a career fair that takes place on the quad once in a while. But I have never checked it out because I am an art major and those fairs usually dont apply to me.
College Sophomore,2,SFSU doesn't have a football team. That alone tells you that sports are not important to the university. I personally have participated in intramural soccer (indoor and outdoor) and I have made many friends by playing soccer on the artificial turfed and brightly lit field available for the primary use of non-athletes and the community. But intramural sports and school athletics are not popular.
College Junior,2,"I have not heard a single thing about athletics. I'm sure they exist, but I don't hear anything about them."
College Junior,2,"Every week, I seem to get a new sexual assault or robbery email from campus police. I'm not sure what is going on, but evidently security measures and Patrol are not a high premium at this campus"
College Junior,2,"A majority of teachers seem to just phone the lectures in. A lot of them don't seem like they want to be there and just want to get the class over with so they can get to whatever they have going on outside of their teaching lives. That is not to say they are all like this, there have been a few who seem to take an interest in students but I have not been lucky enough to have them as instructors. Even some administrators and school staff seemed like they just can't be bothered."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is not very appealing to incoming students. There is no Greek life housing and therefore Greek life is not taken seriously or given the respect it deserves which is extremely unfortunate and brings a negative stigma to our campus.
College Freshman,2,i love the social scene at the dorms and RAs are usually pretty chill but my one big complaint is that my bed has bed bugs its really bad
Recent Alumnus,2,"Too bloody expensive to live in San Francisco in general, but the on campus and close to campus housing costs so much that you could own a home in most other areas for what you pay in rent for four years here. If you don't have an income of $100,000+/year, your application will probably not even get looked at. This is obscene and must change."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The instructors are fine, but the administration defies description that excludes profanity. Though there is a diverse group of students on campus, there appears to be a version of ""Reverse Apartheid"" inflicted on White Heterosexual Males. This is not an appropriate institution unless you are Asian, Hispanic, African-American, or LGBT. If you fall into those groups, this is the place for you; if not, you are treated like a leper by the administration."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not much to review regarding athletics because it is generally an ignored feature. I have absolutely no idea how SFSU ranks in any league sports, and the individual sports are rarely covered by any media. Either you are part of the sport, or are left out of the entire thing."
College Junior,2,"Received  several ""alert messages from University"" almost every week"
College Junior,2,Simply not interesting to get in. Not a mainstream culture in my University since it is a commuter school.
College Junior,2,It is very difficult to get classes especially core classes needed in order to take upper division courses depending on your major. Impacted majors have the hardest time enrolling into such classes and thus are delayed another semester or year to graduate.
College Junior,2,"When I first got to SFSU, the security and safety was good. But now there is at least one email a week about someone who got attacked or threatened on campus, which is scary especially walking home after a night class. I've definitely become more paranoid and aware these past few years here."
College Junior,2,I lived on campus in the Towers my first semester here as a freshmen. I moved out by October due to bedbugs. The school was INCREDIBLY unhelpful when handling the situation and they weren't even going to move me out of the infested dorm at first. My mom and I called the school and housing department countless times and they didn't do anything until we threatened to call the Health Department of SF. It was bad.
College Sophomore,2,"You will not get a regular college experience at SFSU, there is no school pride due to the lack of a Football team and a division I basketball team. SFSU is also a huge commuter school. No active parties or anything lively for that matter, it becomes repetitive after a little while. Its pretty much an expensive CC"
College Freshman,2,"This is a commuter school, so places to hang out involve you being social and knowing people personally (which is more fun anyways)."
College Freshman,2,Very expensive and no variety!
College Freshman,2,"The housing options for SF, in general, is scarce."
College Sophomore,2,Not a place to be at if you're really into sports or intramurals.
College Freshman,2,I had so many issues with financial aid.
College Freshman,2,Some days city eats which is the buffet type of place is good but other days especially on the weekends it can be bad. Also the only places that are open on the weekends is City Eats and Bricks. Bricks is only open from Sunday- Thursday.
College Freshman,2,Parties? What parties? Get a fake and go to the bars and clubs or you probably won't have fun here.
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive the full aid I needed for school because of strict requirement they set.
College Freshman,2,"Our school is more of a ""commuter school"" so with no one living on campus it is pretty dead on weekends. Bars and Frat parties are usually the only thing going on unless you throw a little get together with your friends. NOTHING on campus though, the RA's are extremely strict."
College Freshman,2,Unless you have a car there aren't many off campus dining options
College Freshman,2,It's hard to find parties if you don't know the right people.
College Freshman,2,We really don't have much Greek life... It's there but not really very popular.
College Freshman,2,SFSU isn't really a party school. There are parties on the weekends but they're pretty bad.
Alum,1,"There was no online instruction when I was a student.  Therefore, my entire review may be relevant for today’s student population. However, the City is a great place to go to college."
Junior,1,"DO NOT COME HERE. Absolute waste of money. Many of the professors are less educated than the students with egos twice as big. The admin are generally terrible human beings with little empathy or care about student well being. Go to a community college, save your money, then apply for a real school.  The only programs maybe worth coming here are their preforming arts but at that dealing with the bureaucratic BS makes it not worth. Myself, as well as friends have had issues with the school falsely charging my account or 'misplacing' funds, making it difficult to enroll in classes. The school is also extremely impacted meaning good luck getting a spot in classes and graduating in a timely manner."
Senior,1,"No idea why sophomores and juniors have an earlier enrollment date than a last semester senior does. Don't expect a four-year graduate, it's just a slogan because those ""VIP"" students will take your spot."
Junior,1,"When I first attended SF State, I was super excited about the dorms and making  friends but on move-in day I found out that the school dropped me from all of my classes for no reason causing me to try to attend all the leftover classes. Also the school isn't good at giving the students a heads up on what happens on campus like a power outage or someone getting killed on campus ... I wouldn't recommend anybody to go to this school."
Freshman,1,"SFSU sucks. It's a community college with a higher price tag. The buildings are somewhat run down. None of them have air conditioning so if its warm you're screwed. There are many people in your classes that are in their late 20s and 30s, reenforcing that it feels like community college. The location is bad. It is EXTREMELY boring around the school. Its a pretty long train ride just to hit something cool. The dorms that are called The Village are awesome. Its like a little apartment. That is the best part about the school. The school is filled with losers, especially frats and sororities. Don't go here."
Alum,1,"Commuter school in the southwestern part of SF. Usually pretty cold and foggy. Geography Dept. is great; others hit and miss. No real reason to stick around campus; Btw... SF State is listed as one of the 10 most AntiSemitic  colleges in the US. If you are outwardly Jewish or show support towards Israel, just remember, diversity does not mean acceptance in this case. You won't feel comfortable here."
Freshman,1,"SFSU is a glorified community college. It definitely lives up to its ""commuter school"" status, and campus becomes an absolute ghost town by mid-afternoon every Friday. If you want to go to a party, you have to know people who know people who know people. Academics are moderately challenging, but some professors are definitely easier than others. Student activities can be pretty difficult to join. The newspaper won't allow you to join unless you've taken 3 (!!!) prerequisite classes on news reporting and writing. Despite being located so close to a major city, the campus is surrounded by a pretty dangerous suburb. I was almost assaulted by a man on State's MUNI station, students were mugged in front of my dorm, and there was a dead body found in a mall next to campus. I recommend saving your money for a better school and spend a year or two at a local community college instead of being here."
College Junior,1,Lol sports are 0% paid attention to here. We don't have a football team and school spirit comes more from successful alumni
College Sophomore,1,"There are intramural clubs for track and ultimate frisbee and football and soccer, but there is no football team. There is a basketball team but nobody goes to the games - they end up having to beg people to come by offering free shirts. If you're looking for a sports-oriented school SFSU is about as far away from that as possible."
College Freshman,1,"I feel so unsafe at SF State, anything can happen"
College Freshman,1,"Professors seem uninterested in what they teach. Students are paying so much yet we get treated like slaves and are told to do tedious work that won'y even help us in life. I've encountered so many mean professors and they bury us in homework and then ask us if we did anything fun for the weekend, it's like no I was doing your homework. I've gotten way too much stress."
College Freshman,1,You have to do everything on your own. no one helps
College Freshman,1,It's way too expensive and it's old
College Freshman,1,I'm not aware of the greek life on campus
College Junior,1,I persoally do not participat any many of their activities and social functions.
Recent Alumnus,1,It's straight up trash. Even the club and bar scene in SF is surprisingly s***ty too
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's pretty bad, I'm a large individual so I don't have problems but if I wasn't I wouldn't know what to do/think"
Recent Alumnus,1,IT'S AS BAD AS IT GETS. It don't get worst than that.
College Freshman,1,The amount of money you pay to live in the tiny and poorly managed dorm rooms are not even comparable
College Freshman,1,Not many sports are offered nor are the teams good
College Freshman,1,I would not recommend this school for anyone who is looking for the true University experience. The school is known as a commuter's campus and does not provide many extracurricular activities for their students.
College Junior,1,There is a lack of facilities to promote optimal fan support and school spirit.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Junior,1,"No football team, don't a good basketball team. I never hear much of any good sports coverage by any team."
College Freshman,1,This is not typically a party school. Parties end early in Park Merced because of the neighborhood and many police patrolling.
College Freshman,1,hardest things to do is find something off campus.
College Sophomore,1,"I currently live with my father who has been permanently disabled from the neck down for the past 15 years now, but has enough mobility in his arms and upper torso to work two jobs and earn a little over $120,000 a year. There are 7 individuals that live at our home that he accommodates for, he has is medical bills from emergency room visits and or surgical procedures a few times a year, and household expenses on top of all of that. When I need FAFSA and or scholarships to have my back where my dad can't support me, I am met with loan offers only, and my dad ends up feeling the stress and financial pain of college expenses and we're forced to cut back and save every penny possible. Two years ago I received $200 in aid money, and never again was able to get anything no matter where I applied for merit based scholarships since I don't demonstrate financial need on paper despite the story behind the number. Thousands of dollars are already going into my education, so it would just be nice if the load was lightened a bit. So my search continues despite the lack of financial opportunity."
College Freshman,1,"We can't use our meal pans at the Chavez Center. It'd be nice because one can only take so much Bricks, BonMi and Dining Center."
College Freshman,1,It's not that great. Parties get shut down before midnight and they are hard to find. Frats are known for date rape.
College Sophomore,1,Everything about it is horrible but I'm a picky eater so I don't like most places.
College Sophomore,1,I was put into the normal dorms where I was paying around 1200 dollars a month to live in a small box with another person.  Very old buildings and bathroom was way down the hall.  The dorms here suck.
College Junior,1,"NO PARKING, ALL IN LAWS, AND VERY EXSPENSIVE"
College Junior,1,Not crackin here at SFSU
College Freshman,1,"Greek life isn't big at all here, it's almost as if it doesn't exist."
College Freshman,1,Food is horrible. They have many vegan/vegetarian options but nothing is particularly appetizing. You can wait up to 30 minutes for a sandwich in City Eats.
College Freshman,1,"School isn't particularly challenging; students aren't really motivated. Many programs are impacted. Considering transferring at the semester,"
College Freshman,1,I feel as if many students aren't motivated. I wish I had gone to a different school.
College Freshman,1,No merit scholarships and didn't receive financial aid means we have to pay the full amount.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I definitely regret not paying attention to how much loans I would accept through my past 4 years in college, but I feel like I have wasted my time taking a large amount of general education classes when I should have focused more on getting my perquisites and major classes over with. I think having a limit on loans is ridiculous because it becomes a hassle in trying to find other ways of paying off school. I feel like school has not done its job in providing enough money for students that need it the most. I also think its wrong that students who have parents that aren't working at all, but receive pensions yet their AGI remains high do not get the chance in receiving federal grants."
College Freshman,1,"Getting the financial aid was not the hard part, it was talking to the Financial Aid office that was. With the influx of students to all state schools in California, the schools simply cannot help every kid who needs help. People have been put on hold for 3+ hours just trying to figure out if they were going to get the money they deserved and so desperately needed. To add on to that the SFSU website is not helpful when it comes to finical aid, it does not give you the most important step in completing your finical aid."
College Junior,1,"Campus life really sucks, The rooms are so small and you're paying too much to live with another person. I rather live off campus it's a lot cheaper"
College Junior,1,"The food here really sucks, It's like they don't care about students"
College Freshman,1,Nobody goes to the events. We don't even have football.
College Freshman,1,"My major is impacted. Only 80 out of 600 are accepted into the nursing program, and it is usually transfers."
College Sophomore,1,"No parking. Everything is timed so you constantly are moving your car to avoid a ticket. Parking garage is a joke, over priced and no spots. Cars get hit all the time in there so avoid it"
College Sophomore,1,some people don't even know we have sports. its bad
College Sophomore,1,"Most of the parking is only two hours max, and if you're not there exactly on time you'll get a ticket for 65$ or more! The other option is pay the meters which can be costly or try to find free timeless parking on 19th street, which is usually packed, with no space available."
College Senior,1,"Baaad quality housing, poor health and safety and extremely expensive."
College Junior,1,not a large selection to choose from
College Junior,1,"very expensive, limited, difficult process"
College Freshman,1,I really wanted to bring my car up but the parking is ridiculously far for the freshmen and the permits are ridiculously expensive so it wasn't worth bringing.
College Freshman,1,I got a lot of financial aid but it wasn't enough to cover everything I needed so I had to get loans and I get worried that loans won't even be enough. That is why I'm making an effort in applying to scholarships.
College Freshman,1,I could not figure out how to get help. Fafsa didn't approve me because of my fathers financial status not my own. It was overall an awful experience that lead me to have to have 2 jobs within my first year of college.
College Freshman,1,"San Francisco State University does not advertise sports events very well. It is is hard to support the teams because students are not informed of sport schedules. The University has a football field, but does not have a football team. Also, there are not many sports ran by the school, but there are clubs that are available."
College Freshman,1,"The greek scene here is not very big, I personally rushed a fraternity but did not join it because i didn't find it very fun or worth the money. They do not affect the atmosphere on campus, and no greek students don't really care. "
College Senior,1,"Because it is a commuter school, there is not a strong ""school community"" feeling. "
College Senior,1,"Although it is in San Francisco, the campus itself is on the outskirts closer to Daly City and there is nothing to do walking distance from the campus itself. There Muni bus line stops at the campus and can be taken downtown, however it is sometimes unreliable. To get to downtown SF takes about 20 minutes on M-line. As a commuter, I can not speak for the dorm life. "
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is horrible and overpriced, and don't forget to move your car when the time comes because you will be immediately fined."
College Sophomore,1,No one really cares here.
College Freshman,1,Terribly difficult and a headache.

Sophomore,5,"Incredible. Fantastic, eye opening academics with small class sizes and unique learning methods. An immense amount of opportunities to get engaged through clubs, rec sports, and social gatherings. Really beautiful campus with a fun social scene. The food is GREAT."
Junior,5,I love being a student at Scripps College. I have learnt so much in my time here and I feel like it has shaped me into the best version of myself.
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a Freshman but I'm loving scripps and the 5Cs as a whole so much! Professors are knowledgable and willing to help, food is great, social life could be better as there isn't much dorm culture but other than that people are friendly and clubs are great."
Freshman,5,"I can't imagine being at any school besides Scripps. I don't fit the profile of a typical Scripps student, as I am fairly religious and not as liberal as some of my classmates, but I still feel welcomed here. Just like many other liberal arts colleges, Scripps' small size is a great advantage; I have gotten to know not only my professors but also several of the deans and even the president herself. Also, just like many other women's colleges, Scripps is empowering, with a strong sense of sisterhood. 

But here's what makes Scripps different from every other women's liberal arts college in the country: the consortium. Although the colleges all have their own personalities, sometimes Claremont feels like one school. We share many resources, such as clubs, Honnold-Mudd library, and even some academic departments. Most students also take classes off campus, eat at the other schools' dining halls, and participate in the 5C social scene (there is usually one 5C party per weekend)."
Alum,5,I loved attending Scripps. Beautiful location with a small student body and variation within the Claremont consortium
Senior,5,"I loved my college experience. Professors were, for the most part, knowledgeable and extremely accessible. The culture there is not heavily competitive and many students share an easy going attitude. Overall, I have had a great 4 years at Scripps."
Alum,5,"I loved attending Scripps! An excellent environment in which to develop my whole self, intellectually, emotionally, and socially. As an alum, I am grateful every day for my time there."
Freshman,5,The administration staff and students were friendly and welcoming to parents and applicants. The campus is cozy.
Sophomore,5,"The food is great and lots of inspiring women! Scripps is a beautiful campus, it’s like going to school at a resort."
Niche User,5,"I love the people, they make it so welcoming and its a great school!  I recently went into a lecture and it was amazing! :)"
Niche User,5,"My experience with Scripps was one I'll always remember. I stayed there for two weeks over the summer and they took very good care of me. The campus is beautiful. The professors were also very helpful in rewriting my assignments. I felt very close to the people there. All in all, it is a wonderful place that I hope everyone knows about. I wouldn't change a thing."
Niche User,5,"I loved visiting Scripps College. It is such a beautiful campus. There is a lemon tree right outside of the admissions office. It is in beautiful, sunny California. All of the buildings are beautiful as well. Scripps is part of a consortium including 5 other schools all within a square mile. There are so many opportunities for women at Scripps. I hope to attend one day."
College Junior,5,Classes are pretty tough and hard to get used to but it's an excellent education.
College Junior,5,People go on to do amazing things.  The name of the school carries weight and people are supremely smart and motivated.  Career Services do a really good job but even then compared to like CMC it's not as amazing.
College Junior,5,"Honestly I love Scripps.  I can get frustrated over the requirements or being treated like a minority as a STEM student (even though A TON of Scripps students are STEM majors) or the lack of dorm life but the overall experience is really excellent.  I've met the best people of my life here, the school is gorgeous, and I'm getting a fantastic education."
College Junior,5,I feel very safe here.  The colleges use Campus Safety rather than actual police which is really great.  They're much more concerned with keeping people safe than getting people in trouble.
College Junior,5,the rooms here are amazing!  Stressful to pick housing though because each dorm room is different so you need to know what you want. I really wish there was more dorm culture though :( It's more like apartments so you smile and know your neighbors but don't really talk.  I really wish that was different.
College Junior,5,"Honestly I am so happy that I chose Scripps for a school.  The people here and at the 5Cs in general are honestly what make it.  Everyone is so motivated or passionate about something and everyone is here for the academics so you meet a lot of like-minded people.  Of course, like every school, there are things that I wish I could change about Scripps.  I wish we had more of a dorm culture and I wish that Scripps had a better alcohol policy that didn't encourage unsafe practices in fear of being caught or only being allowed to party off-campus.  Some of my favorite things about Scripps is how connected I feel to the school.  There are constantly events for just Scripps students and because it's such a small school there are so, so many ways to get involved.  The women here are wonderful and although we all groan about Core the first semester really does teach you a lot.  Scripps is pretty humanities-focused so sometimes as a STEM student you can feel like you're not as appreciated or celebrated.  But Keck is rather good at what it does and the 5Cs really only hire PhD's so most professors are here because they like to teach and want to be in a small classroom environment.  The housing here can be really amazing or only ok and room selection each year is incredibly stressful.  Always lots to do on the weekends (and weekdays if you want to) and parties are usually school-sponsored (I know it's weird but it's cool) so everyone is invited.  They're almost all dance parties and then you'll pregame before or go to kickbacks afterward.  The career center, imo, does a really great job and are available for any and all questions relating to internships, future jobs, etc.  Going to a 5C really does students a solid for future careers because if people know the schools they really carry a great reputation.  People do amazing things here.  The stereotypes about each school are equally true and untrue and you'll meet all types of people.  Dining hall food is honestly really good"
College Freshman,5,"It's a small college, campus safety is always there for you. The only safety hazard are those guys at cmc"
College Junior,5,"I love the classes as Scripps! Small, discussion-based classes with engaged professors in general."
College Junior,5,"Scripps is an amazing community of intelligent, diverse women who support each other in life and academic pursuits."
College Freshman,5,"Our career planning and resources center has great resources and helps find opportunities that fit your needs. All career fairs are open to the 5cs, so finding employers is never a problem."
College Freshman,5,"Scripps college has been exceptional and exceeded most of my expectations. It is a supportive environment that really helps you grow. I have absolutely no regrets about coming here, and am truly grateful to be able to attend such an amazing school."
College Freshman,5,"Scripps housing is seriously amazing. You will be satisfied no matter where you end up. Some of the older dorms may not have A/C, but it shouldn't be a problem after a few weeks into the semester. The college is in the process of renovating older dorms and creating a new dorm, so housing should be even better than it already is in the upcoming years."
College Freshman,5,"Scripps College is wonderful environment to learn and grow. The campus, housing, and food, are exceptional and professors and staff are there to support you."
College Freshman,5,"Campus security is usually everywhere you turn...in a good way. They are always around in case you need them or a call away through the Scripps App, your phone contact or the emergency pole things. There is rarely any campus crimes, the gravest being a bike theft. We have swipe in cards to all of our facilities and dorms and an escort policy where men are not allowed in the dorms unless accompanied by a Scrippsie. I feel pretty safe at school since we are tucked away in the center of the 5C community."
College Freshman,5,"In our science department, our professors are researching extraordinary things. If you reach out to any professor there is the ability to work with them over the summer for an internship. There are also alumni networks available to find summer or post-graduate internships at the CP&R center on campus or online. I have found internships mostly through word of mouth because it is such a close and communicative community. Scripps degrees are valued almost as markers of holistic scholarly value."
College Freshman,5,"All the professors whether it was on Scripps campus or at CMC have been supportive, carrying, and want you to get the most out of your schooling. They are very thoughtful and get to know most students, many of my professors reach out to me when they see me struggling on a certain section or topic and do the best they can to help me understand the concepts/materials."
College Freshman,5,I live in the newest building GJW and I love it! Though one of the more spacious and accessible dorms (for those with accessibility needs) I also love the most historical buildings for their style and architecture.
College Freshman,5,I love the Tiernan field house if I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by classes or need a little break I can just walk over and get a little energy out either in the pool or on any of the machines. The health and wellness center is always busy with Scrippsies!
College Sophomore,5,I could not have picked a better school for myself
College Senior,5,I love going to an all-women college and it has made me really appreciate being a woman.
College Sophomore,5,"99% of the time it's great. Worst case scenario, if there's nothing else you like for a day, there's always really good salad bar"
College Freshman,5,"So many parties all the time! There is pretty much always something going on Thursday-Saturday (and Sun, Mon, and Wed too if you can find it) whether you want a larger party, somewhere to dance, low-key hangouts, whatever! It's also pretty non-exclusionary from what I've found so most parties are 5C, so if you want to go out you don't have to worry about knowing someone to get in.  Overall, if you wanted to constantly have fun you probably could but everyone obviously balances social life with academics."
College Sophomore,5,very good assortment and love that you can take classes off campus
College Sophomore,5,dorms are the absolute best... you will likely get a single as an upperclassman
College Junior,5,"Claremont is super cute, and LA isn't too far away"
College Junior,5,"Claremont has really great food options, and LA isn't too far away"
College Junior,5,Small Classes. Teachers care. You're a face not a number.
College Junior,5,Campus security is great. Always around if you need them but not there to get you in trouble.
College Junior,5,Scripps has UNREAL amazing food. Some of the best dining hall food in the country.
College Junior,5,The Claremont social scene is so fun. Always something to do - you get to pick and choose between events on all of the colleges which create a great variety. LA is also super close!
College Freshman,5,Scripps has by far the best housing in all the 5C. The dorms are beautiful and spacious and I really feel taken care of.
College Freshman,5,"I am never bored at night. There are always parties going on everywhere, and me and my friends have an endless amount of possibilities."
College Freshman,5,"I love that the 5C is willing to pay for your trip as long as you get at least 12 students to go with you (ie. Disneyland, LA or even the beach). I don't have to worry about cars because I can always rent one out on campus. The 5C's even let you rent out bicycles for either a quarter or a semester so I don't have to bring mine."
College Freshman,5,There is such a DIVERSE scene at Scripps. There are clubs for different ethnicities and international groups. I love when I'm in class and I hear multiple perspectives on a matter from someone else because they come from a different background and it's always refreshing to listen to. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and different perspectives are often encouraged here at Scripps.
College Freshman,5,"I LOVE the food at the 5C. Scripps has a really good cafeteria and I love when they have cookies. There is always something really delicious to eat and I am never bored. There are plenty of themes for each cafeteria depending on the night, for instance Sushi Friday, Korean Taco Night, or Spaghetti Night."
College Freshman,5,I have loved every minute at Scripps and if I could I would do it all over again.
College Freshman,5,"The academic programs are amazing. I love my school because it really makes every subject interdisciplinary and connects all sets of topics and knowledge with one another. It's a private liberal arts school that individualizes its attention to you as a student. I really have that one to one relationship with my professors and we've never had to have a T.A. Professors are required to come and teach every class while still doing research on the side. I love this because their attention is focused on teaching students rather than cranking out research papers. This being said there are A LOT of research opportunities for students. Professors seek out students to help them conduct research for their papers and students can get a research grant over the summer (they get paid by the school to conduct research). Besides these wonderful academic opportunities the social scene is GREAT. There are over hundreds of clubs to join, intramural sports to join and activities to go support your fellow peers at! There are parties for whatever your passions are; whether its bollywood dancing, cycling or even video games there is a place for everyone here."
College Freshman,5,There are plenty of cafes and student life centers for everyone to hang out at. Each one has it's own scene and is open to all students. My campus is beautiful and looks like a spanish courtyard in the country side; it is very peaceful and I love it.
College Sophomore,5,It's almost always sunny and beautiful. It tends to stay in the 70s or 80s.
College Sophomore,5,"Can't complain about sunny and 70s-80s. Well done, SoCal."
College Sophomore,5,No issues here -- health center and campus safety are great.
College Sophomore,5,Downtown Claremont has great restaurants + some lower key places.
College Sophomore,5,"No admission into any majors. Majoring off campus requires getting into off-campus classes, but that shouldn't be an issue, especially for major classes."
College Sophomore,5,"The academics are challenging, thought-provoking, and high-quality. Small class sizes, dedicated professors. It's a good set-up. We can also take classes at the other 5Cs (Harvey Mudd, Pitzer, Claremont McKenna, Pomona)."
College Sophomore,5,"Great options: we have the ""old dorms"" -- old, obviously, with beautiful spanish architecture, and the ""new dorms"" -- also nice + air conditioning. All the dorms have kitchens, printers/computers, wifi, nice cleaning service. After freshman year you can choose your dorm, and most people live on campus happily all four years."
College Freshman,5,"The Southern California weather is sunny and delightful. It is easy to study outside, hang out with friends outside, and tan in the sun."
College Freshman,5,"You can get a parking permit with ease. There isn't much street parking, so it can be difficult to find a spot. There isn't much need for a car on campus-- you can probably find a friend with one if you want to go to a store."
College Freshman,5,"Amazing weather. Almost always extremely sunny. Its SoCal, after all."
Alum,4,"Your experience at Scripps will be what you make of it to some extent. If you become more involved on campus and fully integrate yourself within the community it'll likely be more enjoyable. I personally felt the people at Scripps were the best part of the experience. I loved being surrounded by such intelligent and thoughtful individuals. My peers were hard workers, but I personally never felt a pressure to compete with them, per se. I also loved a lot of my Scripps professors and enjoyed the classes where we were able to have discussions in small groups. The campus itself is probably the prettiest of the 5Cs and has one of the best dining halls. The bad parts: bureaucracy and the administration over looking student needs. I felt a lot of the times students would voice their opinions only to be shut down by those in the admin. It can also be a high stress environment, and the school itself lacks resources to fully assist all students, leading to greater inequity."
Niche User,4,I visited Scripps this past year and was very impressed with the programs offered and enjoyed the feel of a bigger school with the amenities and opportunities of a smaller one.
Sophomore,4,"There are tons of club and activities to join, and there is always at least one event to go to. There are multiple research opportunities with professors, and the chance to build very close ties to individual professors and staff."
Alum,4,"Kind of cliquey.  Love the campus life, campus culture, classes, math department, gym facilities, food... everything else is great 

There is a kind of exclusive activist culture here that is common in leftist/liberal college campus spaces currently. it's very toxic but also very possible to avoid."
Sophomore,4,"Scripps is very academically challenging and a lot is expected of the students. That being said, if you are willing to rise to the challenge, there are tons of amazing things Scripps has to offer. While the party scene isn't super happening at Scripps and RA's are very strict, it's easy to find parties at the other 5C's. The dorms are beautiful and sizable, but lack a sense of community. The campus is gorgeous and the facilities are fantastic. Definitely a very niche school--I've seen people love it and I've seen people hate it."
Sophomore,4,"Great academic programs that are also very flexible. Diversity in the student body is getting better, overall a supportive academic and living community!"
College Junior,4,"Lots of stuff to do almost all the time, not a lot off campus though"
College Junior,4,"Lots of stuff to do, almost all the time"
College Freshman,4,"Classes are generally good, professors are always there for you. The number and variety of courses might be below expectation since it's a small liberal art college after all( even combine the 5c together), but all the classes should be fun and engaging. Professors are expecting you to talk, and students be the main voice of the class."
Sophomore,4,"Certain major programs are not clearly defined on the school website, so make sure to check with multiple sets of advisors to get a clear picture of what classes are actually required,especially for programs like 3-2 engineering"
College Sophomore,4,"Many of the professors I've taken are extraordinary. Some here definitely need work, but in my experience I love a lot of the faculty and staff here.  The work load is definitely a lot, that's undeniable.  But the experience of each case class I've taken has been rewarding."
College Sophomore,4,I've lucked out on housing so far.  Knock on wood.
College Sophomore,4,"Parties are easy to find, but mostly occur at the other 4Cs."
College Sophomore,4,"Parties are easy to find, but mostly occur at the other 4Cs. Many, if not most, are school sponsored meaning anyone at the 5Cs can go and they are non exclusive. The other schools even pay for alcohol for students. You will definitely hear about the upcoming parties through on campus fliers, and facebook. Generally, there is at least one big party every weekend."
College Sophomore,4,"Scripps itself has limited departments, but thankfully we can enroll in any class in the 5C community. This opens up a ton of options and endless varieties of classes. Classes stay fairly small, but in bigger intro level classes (General Chemistry, etc) there can be around 50 students enrolled at once. Professors, for the most part, are friendly and willing to work with you."
College Sophomore,4,"Crime is relatively low in Claremont but some of the surrounding cities (Montclair, Pomona, Upland) can get sketchy at night. On campus walking alone at night I feel fairly safe. Scripps utilizes the blue light system, and you can always call campus security who will escort you back to your dorm on a golf cart. They are very good about sending emails if there are threats in the surrounding area. Sexual assault is taken very seriously here."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a toss-up when it comes to housing. Some dorms are modern and spacious, while others are old-style and cramped. If you're a freshman, you get assigned to a dorm randomly (usually a triple, sometimes a double) because of the housing crunch. I was lucky and got a great room my first year. Once you are not a freshman and can participate in the housing draw, it's up to luck what number you pull and what options are left.

The best dorm is widely considered to be GJW because it's modern but still has the traditional Scripps charm many of the older dorms have. For the other dorms, you basically have to choose between beauty (old dorms) or amenities like air conditioning (new dorms). Socially, the dorms have no culture; people rarely leave their doors open to socialize. Scripps is currently building a brand new dorm ready to open in Fall 2016, which will alleviate the housing crunch."
College Junior,4,"The alumni network is amazing--Scripps alums always want to help out other Scripps alums! Our career center is amazing, but it can still be hard to find internships and jobs because there is so much competition these days."
College Junior,4,"I love the homey, cozy old dorms. Could have more of a sense of community in dorms."
College Freshman,4,We share facilities with cmc and Harvey Mudd. Scripps gym is nice and relaxing and cmc just built a brand new athletic facility which is also great for athletes and people who like to work out.
College Freshman,4,"I think Scripps is a pretty good school especially since we have access to the other four Claremont Colleges. I feel that some GEs aren't necessary but whatever. We have access to great resources and support and the small class sizes means you get a lot of attention from your teacher which is great. Access to LA mean there's lots to do but transportation can be tricky sometimes. Overall, I thinkScripps was a great choice."
College Freshman,4,"Scripps college does a good job of informing people about sexual assault. However, if a student is assaulted on a different campus, they must abide by the rules of that college, which may not be the most supportive."
College Freshman,4,"The gym is pretty great! Clean, good equipment and amazing pool! Just wish the hours were a little bit better. The gym usually closes at 10 pm."
College Freshman,4,"Scripps is an amazing place to be. I'm so happy that I chose to go to a school where interdisciplinary thinking is encouraged, and where intelligent women are the sole focus. I made my decision to come to Scripps after realizing that at Scripps, women are always, and will always be first. Every club, every organization, and every society is made up of women and run by women. It's empowering to see my peers holding their own in a variety of fields. 

But as much as I love Scripps, prospies should be very aware of the problems on campus. First, the atmosphere is super  liberal. Politically and socially... As in, you introduce your self by your personal gender pronouns and state your access needs. There are actual discussions going on right now regarding how triggering dining halls are for students with social anxiety. People will correct you for using gendered terms. I've never grown up with any of that, so it was a little bit of a culture shock to be completely immersed into the world of PC language and attitude. On one hand, I understand that PC culture is aimed at creating an environment in which all kinds of people can participate and have a voice. But also, it's absolutely crazy and exhausting at times.

Second, the dorms are really not great. Sure, in my senior and junior years, I could potentially get a single, or share a suite with my friends... But right now, I'm living in a converted double (used to be a single, now houses two people). Scripps claims that these rooms were always intended to be doubles, but my neighbors have the exact same blueprint but are one person to a room. There's one closet, one sink. Again, to be honest, the room is very similar to something you might get at another college or university. If we really tried, my roommate and I could hold hands while sleeping in our own beds. Construction noises start at 7 am, gardening at 7:30. If you're a light sleeper, you will wake up."
College Freshman,4,"My first semester has been self-awareness mostly, engaging within myself through the courses taken first semester. The courses are eye opening and get me thinking about how I may or may not want to contribute to society through certain approaches that we learn in our Core I course. I have made friends and acquaintances with a  wide variety of backgrounds and experiences, it is an enriching learning community, intellectually, socially, and interpersonally."
College Sophomore,4,"I've never known anyone to choose off-campus living, but those who do not get on-campus housing (or on-partner college's campus housing) , then get an apartment just a street across from Mudd campus for the same price as living in a dorm."
College Sophomore,4,"With the consortium, we can easily just move onto another campus if we want to be under different rules for alcohol and such"
College Sophomore,4,"On scholarship, grant money, and workstudy. It brought it down to a decent price. Also, students from California can take out an interest-free loan for $4000/yr that you don't have to pay back until 6 months after graduation"
College Sophomore,4,"Sober Saturdays and NSP events are nice if you just want to relax. Actual partying is on the other campuses, which is just as convenient."
College Sophomore,4,"Beautiful dorms, but a bit cramped and not all of them have air conditioning yet (they're working on it though)"
College Freshman,4,"Very easy to take classes at the other schools as well as major in majors offered at the other schools, so within the consortium there's a pretty good variety."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, and Camp Sec really isn't trying to get you in trouble, they're just there to keep things from getting out of control. All the schools also have the blue lights everywhere that you can use if you ever don't feel safe walking back by yourself.  Crime is usually limited to bike theft, but we have heard of one sexual assault incident.  However, students are always alerted of any crimes or assaults that occur and the schools take the incidents very seriously."
College Freshman,4,"Scripps works that if you don't get financial aid you will most likely get a scholarship, so I really don't know anyone who didn't receive either.  That being said, the college is still very expensive, so no matter how much aid you receive, you will still probably be paying quite a bit."
College Freshman,4,"The Village has lots of great eating spots, and prices range from very expensive to not that bad."
College Freshman,4,"Overall I think administration is here to help us and not hinder us, so I think they do a pretty good job of that"
College Freshman,4,"The actual town of Claremont is adorable with lots of cute shops and eateries to go to (though expensive sometimes, but still a great place to walk around) and the city of Claremont offers the other elements that you want that aren't available in the town of Claremont.  So we have a Target and Trader Joes and other larger retailers but also smaller places so it's a very good mix and all is either walking distance (for the village and Trader Joes) or short drive by car."
College Sophomore,4,"close to LA, but a car is necessary to access it.."
College Sophomore,4,the biggest issues are bike theft and sexual assault
College Sophomore,4,"administration is pretty good, they are fair when needed"
College Junior,4,The Claremont school's make an interesting dynamic in terms of relationships. Scripps is all women - but there are plenty of guys at the other Claremont schools.
College Junior,4,"A lot of students are on aid, and it's not a hard process to go through."
College Junior,4,"Professors care about their students, and classes are generally challenging and engaging."
College Junior,4,"CP&R works really hard at Scripps to create connections, and they are super helpful."
College Junior,4,"Campus is incredibly safe, I have never felt uncomfortable."
College Junior,4,The Claremont college's proximity allows for cross registration which increases the variety for classes by a lot!
College Junior,4,"You can major in what you want to major in, there's not really an application process."
College Junior,4,"I love being a Neuroscience major, Scripps is fantastic for resources and the classes are great."
College Junior,4,"Varsity sports foster strong community, intramurals are fun, but athletics aren't too big of a deal!"
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are a major part of some people's experience, but I am not too concerned."
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my time at Scripps a lot so far!
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty good! Gets boring, like any dining hall, though. Pitzer is the best, though."
College Sophomore,4,I am getting a great education.
College Sophomore,4,All the teachers in the physics department I've had are great.
College Sophomore,4,There's an effort to make everyone comfortable.
College Sophomore,4,They really try to make it safe.
College Freshman,4,The rules that are placed at Scripps are pretty reasonable. They aren't made just to prevent fun for students. I have never found myself nor my friends in trouble with campus strictness because it's not something that gets in the way of our daily routine.
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe on Campus. At the beginning of the year Scripps even gave its girls rape whistles. There are always people on campus and I never feel alone.
College Freshman,4,It's a lot better than any of the other schools' I received financial aid from. I still need more aid but it's definitely manageable.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is gorgeous. Students know how to dress (being that it is California) and everyone is really nice to one another. I love that everyone looks so good and yet at the same time are really nice human beings.
College Freshman,4,There is great food everywhere! Whether its vegan food to international cuisine everyone can find something that they enjoy!
College Sophomore,2,claremont doesn't have very many options for a college budget.
College Sophomore,2,"The students at Scripps are predominantly white, upper-middle class and able-bodied. I think Scripps can do a way better job in regards to diversity."
College Sophomore,2,"We aren't very into our sports. (CMS is our team -- Claremont McKenna + Harvey Mudd + Scripps.) However, there are definitely spectators at the games (seems like mostly CMC people) and you can have a good time watching. :) Intramurals are also a fun possibility that people definitely partake in. I believe these are usually 5C."
College Freshman,2,It is possible but difficult to get around without a car.
College Sophomore,2,"You get tickets randomly and can never find a place to park. Just don't bring a car, really. it is just a pain. "
College Sophomore,2,"Internships are plentiful in LA....when you can get to them. Unfortunately, that is difficult because most students don't have a car. You have a tendency to feel stranded in the big city because public transportation is so awful and so expensive. "
College Sophomore,2,"While my school offers decent scholarships to those who are seeking need-based assistance, it offers very few merit-based scholarships. If a student does not win one of the three merit-based awards their incoming year, they receive no financial assistance despite any remarkable academic achievement while at the school. It is very frustrating for hardworking students who could greatly benefit from a small amount of assistance. "
College Freshman,2,"Scripps isn't very diverse, but it's quite accepting. There is a group for what feels like every ethnic group and sexual orientation. There are several services for different religions at the religious center, and a republican and democrat club. "
College Freshman,2,"The freshman dorms are a nightmare. Scripps is in a housing crunch which means that they are making nice doubles into cramped triples and making singles into cramped doubles. If you're an incoming freshman, get ready for a bunk-bed and sharing a bathroom five other people."
College Senior,2,"If You Know Where to Look – The drug scene varies by college. Drinking is pretty popular on all 5 of the campuses, Scripps is one of the colleges with less drinking on campus due to our different party policies, but Scripps students are always welcome at parties across the 5Cs. I have heard that Cocaine is the drug of choice for Scrippsies but I do not know anyone who actually partakes so this may be a rumor. Pot is fairly common across the campuses as well but its something that is done behind closed doors, never out in the open. Basically alcohol is the most common and visible drug of choice and there definitely seems to be some relationship with the colleges and peer pressure to drink on some of the other campuses, again Scripps has very little visibility of any drugs or even alcohol in comparison."
College Senior,2,"Needs Improvement – As a Hispanic women, I can say that there is a lack of diversity on the Claremont Colleges in general. The majority of the students are Caucasian, now that isn't to say that the students aren't all from different backgrounds, because they are, but the percentage of ethnic minorities on the colleges is still small in comparison to larger universities. But the groups of students on campus who are part of different cultures and races are pretty close and have events and clubs that anyone can join. Even though diversity is lacking, I've never personally seen anyone belittled or discriminated at for their race."
College Sophomore,2,"If You Are Really Into It, This Is Probably Not the Place – I don't have any particular interest in Athletics so I never cared about that factor when I was choosing colleges. I don't know much but I do know that there are two intercollegiate teams. Scripps is part of CMS - Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College and Scripps College. And the other intercollegiate team is PP - Pomona and Pitzer College. There are wide variety of teams and sports to play here but the fan support is pretty low, it's pretty much your friends who will go to your games and the handful of people from the colleges who love that particular sport. Football does get crowded though because there is homecoming and what not. Facility wise, I think the athletic facilities are great because I have never heard anyone complaining about it. However, if you want to go to a college for a great sports scene, I suggest you tour Scripps and ask around and check out the type of sports scene we have because I think it's not that exciting."
College Sophomore,2,"Drinking Is More Popular – the drug scene around campus is not really big, although there are times where you will smell marijuana around campus. drinking however is common and there is little to no inforcement."
College Freshman,2,"Tough Luck Getting Money – Scripps awarded me NO need-based financial aid. Given, my parents have sufficient salaries, but they are also paying for three college tuitions at once, and Scripps costs over $50,000 a year. Also, Scripps only awards a handful of merit scholarships and the competition for these few scholarships is tight. Since I really wanted to go to Scripps, I contacted the financial aid office, asking if they could give me any money, and their only suggestion was to take out loans. The financial aid office is not very helpful if you don't demonstrate enough need."
Senior,1,"Do not come to Scripps if you wish to grow as a person and an academic; come to Scripps if you want to pay an ungodly amount of money for the brand name prestige on your resume and have peers that posses middle school social skills. Terribly cliquey social scene that thrives on cancel culture. No dorm culture. Incredibly bureaucratic administration. Excessively expensive across the board. Core sequence is a marketing sham to sell students on a sequence of generic and poorly-taught humanities classes that are nowhere near interdisciplinary. Senior thesis is also a marketing sham to make academics seem rigorous and unique at the expense of real learning. Majority of the professors across all of the 5Cs do not care about actually having students learn. CMC almost always refuses to allow cross-enrollment despite what the brochures say the consortium benefits. Small class sizes, yet there is no personalized feedback on assignments, group discussions, or hands-on learning experiences."
Alum,1,"My experience was very poor.  This college is so PC and racist in many ways.  The administration is spineless and does not have any regard for the students,  the trustees are also clueless.  Beautiful campus with no soul."
College Sophomore,1,I'm very unhappy and I don't get along with students. I am transferring for junior year. 
College Sophomore,1,There is almost no off campus option and certainly none that are economically wise. Just live on campus. It isn't great but it beats the off campus options. 
College Sophomore,1,"Everybody drinks and if you don't, there is nothing to do. Getting black out is very common, and recreational drugs are very visible. If you aren't interested in these things, Claremont is not the place for you. "
College Sophomore,1,"I didn't expect Claremont to be a big party school but it is. If you don't like to drink and go out 3+ times a week to a EDM party, you aren't going to have much fun. There are school sponsored parties just about every weekend, as well as weekly things like PUB and TNC. Some people love it, but if drinking a lot and grinding isn't your thing, there isn't much to do AT ALL. "
College Sophomore,1,"there is very little parking around campus and the parks are very close and small, as well as often in ackward positions. the parking structure helps but has odd hours that are often unhelpful. life is easier with a car but the school does not make it easy to have one"
College Freshman,1,"There is no official Greek life at Scripps or the other Claremont Colleges. Since the schools are so small they are like frats and sororities themselves. The schools have stereotypes themselves. As for social atmoshpere, we have great social atmoshpere because the schools are so intertwined and the parties that go on are usually open to all of the students from ay school. There are a few unofficial frats that throw parties as well but no one views them differently because they are ""greek"" life. It is all pretty cohesive at Scripps and the Claremont Colleges"

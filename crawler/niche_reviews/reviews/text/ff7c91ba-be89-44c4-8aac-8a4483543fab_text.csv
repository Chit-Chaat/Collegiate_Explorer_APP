Junior,5,"Very amazing university!  The  Professors and staff are there for the student and will help them will all things not just their education.  Classes are small and there is more one on one with the student and professors, which make the education you get a better quality. The education is very affordable and you are getting a very great quality education as well."
Sophomore,5,Great environment! Everyone cares about what you are doing and there is lots of support not only for what youare studying but for what you are planning to do in your life after your studies.
College Freshman,5,The professors love their job! They actually are apsis are about what they are teaching and the small classes make it easier to interact with one another.
College Freshman,5,"The dorms contain restrooms, kitchen, living room, and 4 big bedrooms. The area patrolled by security during the night and day. The area is private so it is gated. It is approximately 1 mile away form the university so it makes it easy to save gas and just walk to school."
College Freshman,5,We don't have that many sport but the one that we do have are amazing. The soccer team never lost one single game this season. They won state.
College Freshman,5,Baptist University of the Americas is greatly filled with life changing experiences. We gather twice a week at Chapel for the propose of worship. We are strong in our faith and believe in only one God. BUA's objective is to gather and transform students into great courageous leaders that work for Christ.
College Sophomore,5,Great transitional experience and adaptation.
College Sophomore,5,"BUA has a great and organized administration. You know who to go to for a specific need or suggestion. Because the school is small, we know which authority is in charge of a certain position. BUA has soriritual end emotional counselors within the staff members that can be approached by students in times of stress or trouble. All the processes are easy and guided correcky by the administration. If someone is not doing the job right, the students may speak up to complain or suggest new ideas."
College Sophomore,5,"BUA offers many scholarship applications and financial aid office gives a great service to the students, sending them emails about available scholarships and job opportunities."
College Senior,5,BUA is one of the best schools I've known. There is always pom for improvement but the school officials strive and work hard so that all the students will continue their education and go on to receive a higher education in their field of interest. I fell comfortable here. I am welcome and I don't suffer from peer pressure from anybody. It is a great place to be at.
College Junior,5,"I have never had any problem while here in this campus, we dont hear nothing about robberies or campus crime. I feel safe being here it is a good environment it is a strictly drug free campus including drinking."
College Sophomore,5,There is not a strictness around here becasue it is a christian environment so there is no drinking around or smoking. no drugs are allowed.
College Sophomore,5,There is a lot of stores and restaurants around us where everybody can go to buy their personal stuff. it is not far way pretty much you can walk anywhere.
College Freshman,5,We have a team that is not real good but this semester we just a new coach from Germany and he has great plans for us. Another thing I like about this team is that they always callaborate toghether and never give up.
College Freshman,5,Bernards is one of the best creole foods we have at Baptist University of the Americas. They serve the best and treat you how a customer is to be treated.
College Freshman,5,parking space is available for everybody and it doesnt cost much.

College Freshman,4,Security guards roam around campus and at the dorms all the time.
College Sophomore,4,"What you learn in BUA, you will not learn it anywhere else."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are great as we'll s the quality of the classes. If you are a Chistian, remember that If God brings you to BUA, he will help you with the money and your responsibility is to study hard. if you are a good student, teachers till notice you and recommend you to different opportunities. Focus is essential here."
College Sophomore,4,"Around BUA a student can find restaurants like Chick-Fil-A, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Mama Margie's, many others and the HEB to buy food and groceries. The students can walk, but it would be a but far. Usually students give each other rides to the Market or a restaurant. Downtown is about 10 to15 minutes away, but the dinning options are definitely much higher."
College Sophomore,4,"BUA housing is comfortable. The process to live in the apartments is not complicated at all for single students. In the campus, there is not much entertainment, but the school is close to streets that have much to offer. The dorms are not the best quality anymore because of all the students that have lived there, but they are still in good condition."
College Senior,4,Always more room for improvement. I believe more students would benefit from a gym.

College Senior,4,"Tex-Mex is a big thing in San Antonio. However, you can fins Italian, Steak houses, Mediterranean, Chinese, Indian, other hispanic cuisines, etc. There is great variety. "
College Senior,4,"Dorm life is like any other College dorm life. It's fun and you make life-long friends. The internet could be better. Other than that, each housing facility has it's kitchen and living/dining area and two bathrooms per dorm (4 bedrooms, up to 8 people maximum per dorm). The housing team continues to strive to make housing assignment painless. "
College Senior,4,"I have been able to apply for Financial Aid and I get help each time. Had it not been for FAFSA, I would not be able to continue my education. The Financial Aid office is always helpful in this area. "

College Sophomore,4,Off Campus â€“ Everything is good you dont have to worry about anything it is at a fair price  and if you encounter a problem everybody is willing to help you.
College Senior,2,"The school is on the South-side of San Antonio. Unfortunately, it is one of the least best sides of the city. Houses and apartments aren't at their best. A little run down."
College Senior,2,"I believe it could be better. As of now, there is a soccer team that won the ACASA Fall 2013 championship. There is much potential there. However, I believe that there needs to be more push towards sports programs."

Alum,5,"This school paved the way for my future career.   The connections I made with instructors were lifelong. Additionally, this information (programs, etc) is quite outdated. UTTC is a community."
Alum,5,Online classes were great! I learned more than when I took classes at both u of Mary and bsc. Great school for an affordable cost.
Freshman,5,"I am a first time student, so I have not had the privilege to do campus classes yet. I did do two online classes in summer and I enjoyed it a lot. The teachers where very helpful and were hands on with students. And I enjoyed my experience"
Freshman,5,I enjoyed my classes online and the teachers where not hesitant to answer questions. I loved it. I learned
Sophomore,5,I liked that United Tribes Technical College provided the tools I needed to graduate. They had friendly staff that helped me with scholarships and to providing information to go when I was in a crisis from losing my apartment. They were there for me. The only change I would say is provide more bachelors program.
Freshman,5,"United Tribes Technical College is a great college. The college seems to be underrated compared to a lot of other colleges in North Dakota. In reality the college is amazing along with the instructors. There is not one instructor on campus that sets a student up for failure. Everyone is very positive and caring.  The college offers a lot of out of school activities. Everybody and anybody can attend the activities and they are free! I really enjoy going to college here. The instructors and my peers were very welcoming, which made college be a little less scary and stressful."
Freshman,5,"I love how helpful staff is! Whether it comes to personal, financial, educational or really any other things you might need help with, they always find a solution!"
Freshman,5,So far my experience at UTTC has been amazing and I am loving going to College! Everyone is very helpful and if I am struggling and in need of help they make sure I get it. I respect my professors rules and regulations in the class rooms. The environment makes you feel at home and safe!

Freshman,4,This is my first semester attending UTTC. I have to say that my experience so far has been very good. My teachers are all very helpful and want to make sure I succeed. They also have a tobacco/alcohol/drug free campus. There are very good athletes who attend college here and the staff is very helpful and friendly.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshmen here and I absolutely love my experience so far. My classes are smaller so I feel that I get more one on one with my instructors. I also feel like my instructors care about me and my education. Love the fact that this is a drug/tobacco free campus. I also enjoy the cultural diversity that this college has. 

New student registration was a bit confusing. It seemed somewhat unorganized as we were not given much information before hand on what to expect or a schedule. I will say that the staff was very helpful though in helping me figure out where I needed to go and be.  

I would recommend this college to anyone looking for a smaller school atmosphere and cultural diversity."
Freshman,4,I felt my pick to attend UTTC for my first year away from school was a good choice.  It is a small family environment.  It was a good start to learning my way around a campus.
Senior,4,The instructors are dedicated to helping the students succeed.  One on one time for help with homework.
College Senior,4,i believe we come to this school to learn an we leave knowing absolutely everything we need to!

College Junior,4,its good and i like my school
College Junior,4,This school is great and the instructors are very helpful. The environment here feels like I'm at home in a way. The campus is small which for me is great also. The classes are some what challenging which also makes me happy because we all need a challenge in school. My school is unique because most of the students here are all Native American and we are all working to better our future. It's great to see so many Native Americans that want to change their lives and go on in school learning. I'd choose this school again and again if I could after I'm done. It's so nice and the people here are very very helpful and want you to do just as good. They help you in every way possible. They want you to finish and get a good job when you achieve your degree.
College Junior,4,I learn so much from my professors
College Junior,4,My professors are very helpful and understanding
College Junior,4,The whole school environment has been welcoming.

College Junior,4,The place and people are very friendly and welcoming.

College Freshman,4,But there could be more scholorships aviaible for this career
College Freshman,4,They have gave my options and there have been department managers that have came to speak  and offered to assist with finding internships and jobs.
College Senior,4,"Working with the advisers in the Nutrition and Food Service Vocation was awesome compared to the Nursing Advisors. They were nice, caring and understanding. President of vocation gave me a lot of confidence to get to know the students and show them what the vocation was all about. Our vocation is like a little family, never a dull moment. I am also doing my practicum and it is set up at a nice assisted facilities and i am learning a lot through it."
College Junior,4,"Its small and easier to get to know people.  The staff is helpful.  Campus life consists of people helping each other out, assisting with transportation, and just lending a hand.  "
College Junior,4,"Its school. Some day's are harder than others, but you just need to suck it up and move ahead.  If help is needed, there is tutoring available and you can always go to your teachers or advisors and talk with them."
College Junior,4,Classes are required before graduating! 
College Junior,4,"I am a Nursing major, and feel that the advisors, staff, and faculty are behind me. I feel I could talk with any of them if I had an issue or problem arise. The workload, for me, is minimal and easy to carry. The work is hard but I can always ask question or for help if I need to."
College Junior,4,We have a wide range of students at our school. It is very diverse and this is very acceptable. Everybody is here for the education and aren't treated any different.
College Junior,4,There are many computer labs set up throughout campus and also a lab that is open on the weekend. Printers are also available when needed.
College Junior,4,I enjoy my classes here at UTTC. Most of the teachers are very knowledgeable in the subjects they are teaching. My workload is minimal and I don't have a hard time keeping up. I have time to study and get work completed. There are many study options available as well as tutors. The teachers try to help as much as they can and will work with you to getting your goals accomplished.
College Junior,4,"Ive never had a problem dealing with my financial aid. When I do, they are very helpful and try to get me answers to my questions when I visit with them."
College Junior,4,"I do not work so my schedule works for me. My youngest son goes to the daycare on campus, so that is a plus, not having to go into town for daycare. My oldest son get home by 4:00 and I am usually home by the time he gets back. This is also a plus because spending time with my children matters."

College Senior,4,"I know that other nationality's can go to the college but because it is a Native American school I feel more comfortable.  I also love how they have an elementry school for the students, knowing you can just go down the road to check on your kids is very convenient.  I think that sets it apart for the Native American students.  I like how the school always has activities with the students and the children."
College Senior,4,"I like that the college has everything a student needs.  The student center is comfortable to visit or do the assignments.  I love how the school does a lot with the students and the kids, the campus activities focuses on the Native American culture and has a lot of fun activies for everyone to enjoy.  The only thing I think would need improvement would be the library, even though the librarian does a good job the library itself is very small and looks cluttered."
College Senior,4,"The college I am currently attending ""UTTC"" has a really good computer lab, not only that but the college also has wireless access throughout the college campus.  The computer classes are always easy to access during school hours and they hardly ever have any issues."
College Junior,4,It took a while for th4e other school to transfer my credits but one my new school got them they were on top of it and i was enrolled quickly.
College Junior,4,"When i first started college. They were very disorganized and the administrators weren't very nice or helpful, but since that time it has improved a lot you get more things finished and accomplished with. They have new faculty that care."
College Senior,4,All classes have to deal with my major. Time spent in the lab and projects emphasizes what the book is teaching. The course also gives an opportunity to practice professionally with money making projects to learn adequately while earning a few dollars for the quality of work done. If some students aren't caught up then groups are interchanged to spread the variety of ideas so we all get the ideal experience and learning out of our time invested.
College Junior,4,"There is a library, newer wellness center, mail room, security dept, and lots of scheduled activities."
College Junior,4,"Teachers are very involved with students and their success, but they don't cater to those who don't help themselves. The curriculum is clear and concise, and the college really tries to accept transfer credits the best they can. So far, I've only had one class that was unproductive, but everything else has been a great learning experience"
College Junior,4,"Good, the knowledge i gain will help me in my life"
College Junior,4,"First college I've attended, and i really am happy to have come to this college"
College Junior,4,the school is fairly cheap and gives you tons of scholarship opportunities
College Freshman,4,"Fun on Campus – They're a lot of things to keep you from being bored on campus. Like friends you meet. Teachers who are willing to get to know you and talk with you. Also, there is basketball and other activities to keep your mind and body busy."
College Senior,4,Online classes creates an opportunity to meet new people from all over the net. The only negative is not meeting individuals in person.
College Senior,4,"Early Childhood Education – UTTC has amazing professors, curriculum, and programs to help a person learn about current topics as well as opening up a persons mind to new subjects."
College Junior,4,Career Development – They have a nice Licensed Practical Nursing Program. There is no waiting list. So that is amazing. I looked at many others and there waiting list was very long. They started a bachelors program this year and it is turning out great for those who want higher education.
College Junior,4,Life at Tribes – They have two nice computer labs that are available all day. Our campus is huge with recycling so when you have a power point that is very long they would like for you to print 6 to a page. It is a very good system. The computer aren't too old. They try to keep them updated. Also the Wireless connection is everywhere on-campus so it helps for those that like to type there notes during class.
College Sophomore,4,"Meet Deadlines, You'll Be Fine – There are plenty of resources for scholarships and grants offered through financial aid. They even release a packet of scholarship information, local and nationwide, that can help/pertains to many different students (specialty majors, gender-based, merit-based, and ethnic-based) so all students can apply for something. The financial aid office also offers it's own ""Johnson Scholarship,"" open to many business students who attend UTTC."
College Junior,4,"At United Tribes Technical college, I have no issues with the academic part.  Others I see that somem teachers give alot of space and thats good for people like me but bad for others."
Sophomore,2,"If you don't have family contributing to your education. Find a different school. You cannot receive Student Loans here, and the administration does a horrible job of making sure students can afford to go to school. They have a tuition waiver for Native Americans but that only goes so far when you've already settled into life and have bills to pay. Might as well work and make school 2nd on your list. Some people who have worked before or are married also don't qualify for PELL grant. Your better off finding a different school to attend."
College Junior,2,"Financial aid dispersant is made twice in a semester, instead of given all in one lump sum.  "
College Junior,2,Class registration sucks! Advisors are the ones who enroll students.
College Senior,2,everything is OK you could say
College Junior,2,my credits weren't transferred. the work and assignments are good
College Junior,2,"I have attended college in  Oregon, so this college is small and not as helpful.. I like it but it could be better, they have everyone mixed up together, such as the elementary school eats and everything else with the college students and it jus feels like high school.. I think the facility could be updated and more resources could be provided.. they are under staffed for child care. it could use improvement, but passes because its still useable"
College Sophomore,2,basically do what you can to keep active or busy when you dont have class or on the weekends
College Sophomore,2,no computer access on the weekends and during the school days wifi is some what jumpy
College Senior,2,Its Ok for What You Pay – i met alot of people and how some fun it was nice to learn a new culture but its not the college life you think its gonna be at tribes
College Junior,2,Well Its Not as Good as It Sounds Like – United Tribes is a good college people here are very friendly and welcoming.
College Sophomore,1,"its horrible here, tuition and meal plan is crazy here and not to mention the dorm rent and food"
College Senior,1,They Try – not that many sources but people try to help you to where to get the best help but only one computer lab at the school and only a few computers on the dorms so just if you can bring your computer
College Senior,1,Needs Some Diversity – its not diverse at all its a native school but black stundents do go most of them dont have issues and get along with majority of stundents but sometimes there will be someone stupid that says something but i think its just due to the area
College Senior,1,Uttc Needs to Pick It up – the school is super cheap but there curfews and the resources at tribes is not that good and stundent life is rather boring tribes just needs to pick it up and catch up to othe average colleges life style and get out od=f the old set ways they know from the 70's

Sophomore,5,this college has given me so much and its been the best 1 and a half years of my life so far! the professors are always willing to meet with you and help with any academic struggles you may have! the party scene is also low key but very fun!
Senior,5,Academically challenging but rewarding. Professors are dedicated to student growth academically and personally. Excellent connections to internship and job opportunities in various fields.
Junior,5,I love the small community. I love the professors. I love the academics. I have excelled during my time here.
Sophomore,5,Centre College has been the best decision of my life. I have grown exponentially since my first day of class and I credit that to Centre College. The professors truly care and make an effort to help you figure out your best path in life and achieve it. The students are friendly and diverse. Our athletics cannot be beat for a D3 school and our study abroad program can revile anyone in the nation. So many  opportunities have opened to me through Centre College.
Freshman,5,Centre gives me a very exciting and new opportunity. It allows me to meet so many new people and gain so much knowledge while playing football and giving myself the best college experience possible.
Freshman,5,"As soon as I stepped on campus for the first time, I knew I belonged at Centre College. The campus is clean, the people are friendly, and everyone at the college wants you to be successful. I have already made so many friends from my short time being at Centre."
Freshman,5,"Centre College is a very inclusive school. As an international student, I was afraid of being part of this school, since the ratio of international students is pretty low. However, everyone here is very nice and knows each other very well. The best part of this school is its professors. They are not only good at teaching, but they are also great mentors of the students' lives and I can really see that they love to teach us."
Senior,5,"Centre College is the best decision I have made to date.  With a family-like community with students and professors, as well as world class academics, you can't beat it."
Freshman,5,"Centre College, being a small campus, offers a friendly atmosphere and personal connections with other students and professors. The classes are challenging, but you will find more than enough resources and support to ensure your success. Centre also offers a myriad of extracurricular and service opportunities, and if something doesn't fit your interest, pursuing your own ideas is highly encouraged!"
Freshman,5,"I'm really liking my first year at Centre! It is for sure the most challenging school in Kentucky, but it's also SO MUCH FUN! I love the academics and professors but I also really like the ""work hard play hard"" attitude that we have here"
Freshman,5,"Centre College has provided me with many opportunities to expand my learning such as summer research experience and presenting at the Kentucky Academy of Science. The professors encourage students to do their best, be their best, with no regrets."
Alum,5,"An incredible institution. If you work hard and invest yourself for all four years, you're guaranteed to set yourself up for a successful future. People that come to Centre and do not take their academic life seriously will very quickly fall behind and fail, which is easier to do than you think because of the great student life."
Freshman,5,"Centre College is awesome. I am so glad I chose to go here. First, a couple negatives: 1) diversity is low. Lots of people from Kentucky, fewer people from out of state 2) Danville is tiny. Not much to do off campus, although there are decent hiking opportunities. A few positives: 1) for a small liberal arts college, the education is excellent. The faculty, all very experienced in their fields (I have yet to have a professor who isn't a doctor. My German teacher lives in Germany periodically, my Chemistry teacher came straight from the industry. Very practical knowledge and connections, even at a general chemistry level) are very accessible and helpful. 2) The community is so, so amazing. Everyone wants to be here and enjoys it, which makes all the difference."
Freshman,5,"Amazing! The teachers are wonderful, the people are so nice, and everything on campus is very clean and pretty. The food is also great except for on the weekends."
College Freshman,5,"Centre is great, the best thing about it is the community created, how inclusive it is. You aren't just a number, or someone in a crowd of 100+ students in a lecture hall, where your teachers actually know your name."
College Senior,5,"I love how interesting all my classes are! The best part is most of my peers feel the same too, so class generally includes participation on part of the students. The professors, of course, are great. They have lots of office hours, and usually try to work with the students- including athletes who have to miss every now and then."
College Freshman,5,It's great because the Centre Mafia is very real and does indeed exist.
College Freshman,5,Greek life here is so diverse especially considering the size of our campus. Everyone is welcoming whether or not you are greek or they are greek. Greek life has allowed me to meet so many great women and I love it so far.
College Freshman,5,DPS is everywhere at all times. They appear within seconds when there is an emergency and are not afraid to shut down any nonsense that is occurring. They also do not hesitate to call the actual police when necessary.
College Freshman,5,The value of a Centre College degree is extremely high. Centre alumni are very well respected and are in major positions doing big things all across the globe. Having a degree from here is definitely an advantage that no one should pass up if given the opportunity.
College Freshman,5,"Professors here are AMAZING. They love their jobs, love their students, love having office hours and more. You know that you can always go and talk to them because their doors are always open. They care about your overall success."
College Freshman,5,I love the housing here at Centre. It makes me feel safe and at home. The rooms are just the right size as well.
College Freshman,5,"Centre College is a wonderful, intriguing place, full of people who want to learn and want to help you learn. Centre does not have one single mean human being and they make you feel at home. The professors love their jobs and love helping students and it is easy to become connected to different members of the community. I would never have had any of the opportunities I have had if I had not come to Centre. Any other college would not have made me feel so at home. If I had to do it all again, I would pick Centre in a heartbeat."
College Junior,5,I have complete confidence in my degree's ability to get me a job after graduation.
College Junior,5,I wouldn't go anywhere else. Simply the best school in Kentucky and one of the best in the southeast.
College Junior,5,"My time at Centre has been wonderful. However, my time away from Centre has been even better. I traveled to Spain to hike the Camino de Santiago and spent a semester in Strasbourg, France. I'm now preparing to study museums in Amsterdam, Ghent, and Vienna. Study abroad is a must."
College Sophomore,5,"Centre is a challenging school, but it offers an enriching environment for students where they are able to learn from the best professors around. The school community is friendly and supportive, always encouraging students to do their best and be their best."
College Freshman,5,Professors are distinguished and focused on aiding students. Campus atmosphere is very accepting.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school and so many of the people I've met there. My roommate is my best friend and we're very close with our RA and many of her friends are now our friends as well. My professors are all wonderful and approachable and class is challenging, but not overwhelming."
College Junior,5,Centre is an amazing school and they truly care about each and every student.
College Sophomore,5,"Very challenging academically, teachers are extremely knowledgeable and approachable, and a great fit for anyone wanting to simply better themselves as an individual. The students are serious about academics, but also know how to have a good time."
College Junior,5,Crushing it every weekend. and winesdays.
College Junior,5,Variety of places to live and they are all very good quality
Recent Alumnus,5,"Dorms at Centre are actually amazing for college dorms. The freshman dorms are pretty standard and bad. Once you get to be a junior or senior, the housing options are better than most schools. The best options are Pearl, which is a hotel-style building, with suite-style rooms. Brockman Commons is the best option, set up like an apartment for four people: two stories, your own kitchenette, two bathrooms."
College Freshman,5,"If frat parties aren't your thing, you can find a chiller experience in Hillside or a middle ground at the Brockmans. And if those types of parties aren't your thing at all, there is a significant number of people that simply get together every weekend and hang out without alcohol or drugs, which is an encouraging thought."
College Sophomore,5,"The administration is not overbearing. As long as you aren't being stupid, they will pretty much leave you alone."
College Sophomore,5,I did not have to apply for my scholarship. The school automatically considered me for it.
College Senior,5,"Yes, Centre has strong academics. Yes, you will have an internship and study abroad. The showers are fine. 

I've loved Centre because it introduced me to people, ideas and parts of myself I probably wouldn't have found otherwise. Centre has been life a ""halfway house"" between childhood and adulthood, and I'm really, really grateful for the experience."
College Senior,5,"I'm about to graduate and I'm really, really sad about it. I grew so much here. My professors, classes and friends all pushed me to be a better student and person. Can you marry a whole school?"
College Freshman,5,Centre is academically rigorous and extremely thorough in its teachings.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Personal Education, Extraordinary Success.

its the whole package, at a discount from attending a school in the upper northeast - and without the Snobbiness"
College Sophomore,5,"The classes are difficult and time consuming, but everyone on campus is under the same workload and is understanding of stress. The professors are very accessible and there are plenty of places to study all over campus that vary in atmosphere."
College Sophomore,5,"I am an international studies major, and the workload is challenging, but the professors are the best you can find. The study abroad programs are superb, as almost every student gets the chance to travel abroad for a semester if they so desire."
College Sophomore,5,"The overall quality of the classes, professors, people and social life fits me as an individual perfectly."
College Sophomore,5,The atmosphere is very welcoming and the administration is very understanding of mistakes made by students.
College Senior,5,"Academics are amazing here. It's tough, but that's because we learn a lot. Our professors are awesome, and once you get your time management skills down the work is manageable. I get to take classes about the sociology of health and illness, poverty and homelessness, and family life. It's amazing. My professors are the best."
College Freshman,5,"I love my classes and teachers. I've found the classes to be engaging and challenging, and my teachers to be approachable."
College Freshman,5,"I love how diverse campus is when it comes to Greek life. I feel no pressure to join a sorority/fraternity in order to feel accepted, yet I have found the chapters to be inviting and beneficial to Centre's personality."
College Junior,5,There are some that walks around the campus that you would not notice. Which is good.
College Junior,5,did not have to wait long.
College Junior,5,"Danville is a tiny, charming town."
College Junior,5,"Some students drink, some do not. I haven't heard of anyone using hard drugs on campus."
College Junior,5,Centre is known for giving plenty of financial aid.
College Sophomore,5,I believe that school's value isn't so much in its diploma but in the experience that one gains there.  There is so much there for me.
College Sophomore,5,"Quaint is the best way to do it.  Danville has one ""best small town in America"" several times.
"
College Sophomore,5,"I have never felt unsafe at Centre. Crime is practically unheard of and DPS does nightly rounds around campus to check for creeps. People leave their doors unlocked a lot because they know nobody is going to take their stuff. It's even common for people to leave their laptops sitting at a table in the library or somewhere if they need to run to print something out, get food etc. It'll still be sitting there when they get back. You can also call DPS at any time if you feel unsafe walking around campus and they will pick you up and drive you to your dorm if you really want them to. I have a friend who called them so she could talk to them on her way back from the frats because she didn't like walking alone and they were more than happy to stay on the phone with her."
College Senior,5,"The classes are challenging, yet fulfilling. Professors take a genuine interest in their teaching and their students."
College Sophomore,5,"The academic courseload can be rigorous, but it is rewarding. Make sure to use your professors as a resource and not just talking heads."
College Freshman,5,There from what I have experienced is a culture of responsabillity on behalf of the students here.  There is a no open container rule that is strictly adheared to.  Anthing that is illegal in they eyes of the federal government and the commonwealth of Kentucky is also not ok to Centre but they don't go any further.  Other than that I have found things leneant as long as I have been responsable.
College Freshman,5,I recieved a ludicrious amout of financial aid from Centre.  I totaly thought that I was undeserving of that.  As expensive as the school is they seem to give a lot of that money back.  There are lots of different hire academic scholerships for those who stand out.  There are also different scholerships for language scholers and people who are good with music or are into theatre.
Sophomore,4,The entire student body consists of people who are bitter about no getting accepted somewhere more prestigious; I fit right in.
Sophomore,4,"Seeing my Classical Studies professor, who still uses a pocket watch and a flip phone, attempt to give online lectures was amusing to say the least."
Sophomore,4,"Centre is a great small liberal arts college with a beautiful campus. There is a very small student to professor ratio which allows for a much more personal education. Centre has so many amazing study abroad opportunities and also offers an interesting three-week period where you take one class in Janurary called ""Centreterm."""
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed touring the campus. The people were very nice and the campus was beautiful. My only concern is the price. I was told ""Do not let the sticker price scare you,""  the administration office has many scholarships available. The campus athletic programs were top notch. Each locker room was secured with a code that only that specific team knows. The security in the dorm rooms was great, you used a key made for you to get into buildings."
Junior,4,I transferred into Centre as a sophomore and my experience so far has been incredibly pleasant. The profs at this college really shine and actually enjoy getting to know students on a one on one basis.
Freshman,4,"The academics are challenging, but in a good way if you are genuinely interested in learning and education. I find the people here really nice and friendly. There is a party scene, which is nice if you are into that, but it is not overwhelming if you are not. The college is in a small town, and there is not a whole lot to do if in the town itself."
Niche User,4,"Graduation in four years,a study abroad, an internship  or research  opportunity .Average of 97 percent of students  employed  or pursuing advanced study  within a year of graduation.  85 percent  study abroad,  87 percent participate in an internship  and or undergraduate research. Since 2001, its all been part of what they call the centre commitment. Students  at centre collge aim to make a meaningful impact for good and they do so in high numbers in an increasingly global  way. They have an awesome art exhibit and theatrical way of life! Junior, senior housing are large and inviting .They have wonderful variety of food favorites. Close community and health care on campus. A commitment,  guaranteed."
Sophomore,4,"It’s not a school for everyone, but if you’re looking for a small school experience where you can form intimate relationships with your professors and fellow students, then there’s no better place."
Alum,4,"It was a really great school and i wouldnt have traded my experience for the world, but a lot of the students are all kind of the same people. The lack of diversity was really dissappointing."
Freshman,4,"Centre is one of the best small colleges in the South. It is reknowned for the study abroad program which is boasted as the #1 study abroad program amidst colleges in the United States. The professors are driven to give every student individual attention and would love to give assistance on any issue. Relationships with teachers transcend much more than just the classroom, and they can become valuable mentors and friends as one makes their journey through Centre. Food is mediocre and the local area is a nice quiet town but there isn't much to see other than that. Regardless, Centre is a great place to study, make connections, and to solidify your career in."
Freshman,4,"It's been awesome! I would recommend. Well-known Kentucky school. I have fun, I'm just not a party person. 4.0s are highly unlikely."
Senior,4,I am current senior at Centre College. I have absolutely loved my experience at Centre. Although it does feel small at times you can truly build relations with a variety of people and professors.
College Freshman,4,i always feel safe here and have never had an issue.
College Freshman,4,"i'm only personally involved in club athletics (ultimate frisbee), and that has been great. Varsity sports don't dominate life here but are a big part of the experience for many students."
College Senior,4,"I feel extremely safe on campus. The only time I become uncomfortable would be walking to speedway late at night alone or certain fridges of campus where there is low-income housing. I have not had or been aware of any issues with sexual assault, but some friends feel strongly that Centre could improve their approach to this concern."
College Senior,4,"It's great if you win the promised lottery as I did. I do have a few senior friends who got stuck with underclassmen housing, but most seniors have really nice housing."
College Senior,4,"I am not involved with Greek life other than the occasional party, but many of my friends are. They are involved on campus and the community, and all-around great girls/guys."
College Senior,4,"Centre draws talented staff and students, and athletics is no different. We have competitive programs. For instance, while i've been at the school many of the programs have been NCAA competitive. I remember attending the Men's basketball game when they hosted the first round of the NCAA tournament. My own program (Women's soccer) has won conference and attended the NCAA tournament every year- including making the Elite 8 and Final 4 two of the three years. In addition, the coaches are involved on campus and with their athletes. Many are mentors or friends to their players, and act as an additional resource. The various programs work together to build up each other's programs through school support campaigns or designing as a team the athletic facility renovations."
College Senior,4,"Centre in many ways is exactly what I needed in a school. Originally it was low on my list of schools I was considering because it was in my back yard, but over and over it ranked highest on all my criteria. Academics, excellent. Athletics, NCAA competitive. Study abroad? Centre's forte. It was a small school too, and the professor's were rumored to be accessible. I knew these facts going into school as a freshman, but it was not until I actually was in the middle of the semester that I could pause to realize that Centre was all this and more. It is amazing how involved and committed all the students are; as a freshman I was impressed with what the students were doing with their lives. The academics and athletics at the school were stellar. I love the commitment to excellence that Centre has. 

I have two arenas of my Centre life that exemplify this commitment to excellence: GEMS and Centre Women's Soccer. GEMS stands for Girls in Engineering, Math, and Science. What is it? An outreach club initiated by I and fellow friends where young women from the college mentor middle school girls. We had such success in our first year we branched out to include the local elementary school as well. We want to address stereotypes and obstacles which prevent many young women from pursuing careers in STEM. 

As for the soccer program, I love to take any opportunity to brag about this team. I am a starting outside back who is very proud of what we have accomplished. My sophomore year we went to the Elite 8 in the NCAA tournament. My junior year, the Final Four. Every year I have been a part of the program we have won our conference tournament. This team shows me more than any other the commitment to do one's very best as a part of Centre College. 

My experience at Centre has been about becoming the best all-around person I can whilst using my own skills to impact others and the school."
College Freshman,4,The professors here are great. Not very diverse but almost all are willing to work with you to help you succeed.
College Freshman,4,They are very inclusive and love getting new members. They also contribute a lot in the community service area.
College Freshman,4,"They could give a little more attention to some of the recreation teams, but Centre's athletics are still very passionate about what they do. Our teams are very successful and everyone loves what they do."
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on campus. However, the Department of Public Safety sometimes is more of a fun police than a force to keep students safe."
College Junior,4,I've never had a problem with my housing. The underclassmen offerings aren't 5 star but the upperclassmen living areas are really nice.
College Junior,4,The Greek organizations themselves are great. The Greek Life Office is one of the worst I've ever seen.
College Freshman,4,"Since the campus is pretty small, I usually feel safe anytime of the day that I have to travel on campus. I know a lot of my fellow students, so it's easy to notice if someone is on campus who should not be."
College Freshman,4,"The classes are pretty difficult; however, most of the teachers are willing to help when a student is confused. Although, some of the professors tend to choose favorites in the class and openly show it which is discouraging to fellow students."
College Freshman,4,My brother attended college here and he received great scholarships for his PhD program because of the quality of Centre's connections. It is very difficult to talk to the career center before I declare my major officially because they don't believe that I know what I want to do yet.
College Junior,4,"Excellent classes and professors, but the work is rigorous. I have opportunities to receive job offers, training, and internships because of Centre. For that, I'm very grateful."
College Freshman,4,"Centre College is a place where I felt at home the first time I visited. People care about each other there, and not in the cheesy way. Centre College is full of genuine people who give a hoot about your education and future."
College Junior,4,Don't be dumb and you'll be fine
College Junior,4,"I got a decent amount of money without applying for anything, but the school is expensive. That's why I'm filling out this survey for scholarship entries."
College Freshman,4,"The great thing is that it is a small campus so it is only about a five minute to walk to classes, allowing you to maximize your time to sleep in!"
College Freshman,4,"While the process is somewhat difficult to get the financial aid, the college is very generous with the financial aid that it gives to students."
College Sophomore,4,"For a small town, Danville has some pretty good options for dining if you know where you are looking. A lot of local restaurants are better than you think."
College Sophomore,4,"The parties are all safe, and the school doesn't overdo it with rules. There are even a mixture of types of parties that are thrown."
College Sophomore,4,"For cafeteria food, Cowan really isn't that bad. It has good and bad days. Sandella's and The Grill are decent, but can get old with time."
College Sophomore,4,"Everywhere you live is pretty standard until Junior year. The rooms are all decent, though."
College Senior,4,"Danville is beautiful, safe, and cheap. There aren't many museums or bars, but what exists is high-quality. For nightlife, I love the Beer Engine! Wish the food was more ethnically diverse, but . . . it's Kentucky. We are way meaner to the ""townies"" than they ever are to us. Most people seem to like Centre kids just fine.

For sports and shopping, consider Lexington, which is about a 45 minute drive. A lot of kids will get together and go to a UK basketball game or spend the day at the Fayette Mall."
College Senior,4,"Centre's Career Services office cares SO MUCH what happens to you, even years after you've graduated. If you're looking for jobs in Kentucky, you're basically set -- we joke about the ""Centre Mafia,"" but it's real. If you're an out-of-state student, it will neither help nor hurt you to have a Centre degree. Your coursework and extracurricular experiences will be much more helpful to you there. But Centre will make sure those things are strong, too!"
College Senior,4,"The sororities do great community and fundraising work; the fraternities throw great parties. There isn't much tension between Greeks and non-Greeks, and it's easy to be friends with people across affiliations. Each organization has its ""reputation,"" but it's pretty easy to get a bid from one or another if you go through Formal Recruitment. I think Greek life improves the campus atmosphere and is a great way to get to know people who share your values. Was pleasantly surprised!"
College Senior,4,"Most teams do really well in our division every year, but unless you're an athlete or your friends are athletes, you probably don't know anything about Centre athletics. The gym is high-quality and well-maintained, but athletes do have to share the space with other students. They seem to manage okay, though, 'cause as a school, we perform! I'm proud of all my athlete friends but have only been to one football game ever."
College Senior,4,"Centre prides itself on being enormously residential, and doesn't like to let people move off-campus. That said, if you wrangle permission, the off-campus housing is pretty good. It's all close to campus, safe, and clean. There's a really good community of students even off-campus. Sometimes students say it's ""sketchy,"" but that just means that there are Danville residents around sometimes. And they're not going to bother you."
College Senior,4,"There aren't many restaurants in downtown Danville, but the ones that exist are all really good and reasonably priced. I wish things stayed open a little later (your choices are pretty much Speedway or Speedway after 11PM), but I've had great experiences in Danville."
College Senior,4,"The ""zero-tolerance"" drug policy is a sticking point for most students, even the ones who don't do drugs, because being caught with any classified substance (whether on campus by public safety or at home by police) = an automatic suspension or even expulsion. And students who are permitted back on campus and commit a second offense are often simply turned over to the police. Attendance records are well-maintained and you can face penalties for missing class/suspension if you miss a LOT of class. Academic dishonesty will earn you a suspension.

Other than that, Centre's pretty happy to let you make your own choices. If you're underage, put your drink in a solo cup and don't be belligerent; if you're hosting a party, keep the noise at a respectful volume; if you want to stay overnight in somebody else's room, use the appropriately gendered bathroom in the morning and be considerate of the roommate. Many students drink, party and cohabit (even for semesters or years) without getting in trouble. And even if you get caught, the fines aren't absurd. I think Centre just wants us to learn about choices and consequences, which is not such a bad thing."
College Senior,4,"I've always loved living on campus, possibly because I never had to live in Nevin. Even as a sophomore, when I had to live in the dreaded ""Old Quad"" (my roommate and I had the BOTTOM lottery number), I had a good experience. Some buildings are better/newer/quieter/cleaner than others, but you're going to be fine no matter where you end up, and you'll always be close to classes, dining and friends."
College Freshman,4,"There were no special applications, but for my major (BNS) there are many prerequisites that a student has to take early on in order to fit everything in."
College Freshman,4,"I love the school because I'm not limited to classes in my major. I can branch out, allowing myself to double major with a minor, rather than being stuck in science."
College Freshman,4,"Just like a stereotypical college, plenty of different ethnicies, looks, and sexual orientations."
College Freshman,4,"We have a great on-campus police force, and Danville is a safe area in general."
College Freshman,4,"It's not overwhelmingly large, alcohol is not a necessity, and parties rarely get out of hand."
College Freshman,4,"There are always large fan turnouts at varsity sporting events, and intramural teams make sports accessible to everyone."
College Junior,4,The Greek system is good. Well incorporated into campus life and the only source of night life without running the risk of obscene fines.
College Junior,4,I love BMB. The professors are great and it is preparing very well for a medical career. There are also ample research opportunities if you pursue them.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Most people are ""like me"". Despite the schools push for more diversity the student body remains fairly affluent, mainly White, and more often than not Catholic/Christian and Straight."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I've been helped by Several centre Alumni since graduation.  While i ahem yet to land the ""dream job"" i've been ushered along the way by people who care and share the same values I have learned at Centre.  I have a powerful degree which is recognized by nearly everyone in my state and many outside the state (those that know) - as a sales professional I gain a certain level of respect from others when that information comes to light"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Liberal Arts prepares students for a life in professional school or a life outside the classroom,  an extremely well rounded education"
Recent Alumnus,4,Class size made indepth- and personal discussion possible in upper level classes.  This help extrapolate on ideas/theories.topics.  Students truly learn and most importantly understand the concepts that they are taught at Centre.
Recent Alumnus,4,Small but proud.  a large percentage of Centre Students are student-athetis participating in one if not more than one varsity sport.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The College allowed me to use my summer internships to create a ""private study"" course and receive college credit.  a hug help and huge incentive for students - after all college is about preparation for the ""real world""

many people in KY often refer to centre and the ""Centre Mafia"" which is an extremely tight network of Centre Alums.  they consist of the movers and shakers within KY (aside from many other states/countries) and will often time seek Centre Students to bring into there companies, etc. in order to help facilitate the school-work transition."
Junior,2,If I could transfer I would. Centre College makes it so you can’t transfer after the first year unless you are okay with starting over. Would not recommend this college to anyone.
College Freshman,2,"Freshman dorms are pretty small and dingy. But it's okay, because it kind of encourages people to get out and do stuff."
College Freshman,2,"I feel like the Greek community causes a lot of mayhem on campus with the excessive parties. I do not have any interest in participating in parties or Greek life, but I know many people who love it."
College Freshman,2,The only things off campus that are considered ethnic are some bad-tasting Mexican cuisine restaurants and some fast food chains.
College Freshman,2,"There is a lack of a variety of places to go eat, even with your flex dollars. The official cafeteria on campus, Cowan, severely lacks variety and even decent food on a daily basis."
College Junior,2,Not much surrounding Centre; very rarely is there a reason to leave campus with the exception of going out to eat or to Walmart.
Recent Alumnus,2,Not a lot of options.  Not very nice.  Not very easy
Recent Alumnus,2,"Danville KY is known as being a food dessert. The only options being chain, low end fast food restaurants, and several Mexican joints.  There aren't even higher end chain options. Lexington KY and Louisville KY are short commutes away and they offer the diversity some may be looking for when it comes to food and night life activities (unique and craft restaurants/bars)"
College Senior,2,"There is absolutely not enough parking on north side. By JVAC there's plenty, but we gotta get more behind Pearl."
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty silly if you ask me... which you are asking me. It's like every first-year girl but me gazes with awed expressions at sorority girls and, before even identifying them by name, say, ""ooo she's a tri-delt,"" or ""yeah she's a theta.""

I didn't move away from my parents, go to college by myself, and pay a hefty sum to be expected to act like the hypocritical, overly-religious, condescending girls who pay to be in a club and conform. I don't want to be labelled. It makes me genuinely sad to see people pay for their friends.

Frat guys, while sometimes a big box of tools, are generally a lot more lax--at least I don't see them posting a new picture of themselves throwing up their Greek letter sign every week on facebook."
College Freshman,2,There aren't a whole lot of options.
College Freshman,2,If you want to venture outside of Centre it's very difficult to do so. You have to have a car.
College Freshman,2,I feel like I got no Aid. 
College Freshman,2,Not too many parking spots.
College Junior,2,"Some of the professors are absolutely incredible, and unlike any others you will ever have. But, there is always the chance that the new professors (which are usually brought in and taken out within a year or two) may be much less than ideal. Just being honest."
College Senior,2,"The ""nightlife"" is pretty much non-existent, given Centre's location."
College Freshman,2,"About 90% of students are white, though there are several international students and students of different backgrounds."
College Junior,2,"Mostly White – Most people here are upper middle class, however when Centre attempts to bring in diversity, most of those students are not really qualified to go here and fall behind. Most people segregate themselves into groups of their own race."
Freshman,1,Way overrated from what I've seen so far. Academics nothing great but OK. Boring to be here on campus.
Senior,1,"It has an extremely racist environment. By racist I do not mean explicit aggression on non-white group, although they do exist widely under the surface on campus, I mean implicit bias and stereotypes. It is a disgusting environment to be in for four years, I regretted every day that I choose this school. They made you take those humanity courses your freshman year, and many meaningless, stupid gen-ed, so that you won't have enough credit to transfer to other school.
Professors are stupid and arrogant. My  professor don't even know the formula of adding a series of consequential number is N(N+1)/2, and hated me because I pointed that his answer is N(N-1)/2 in class, and gave me unexcused absence when I did not arrive in the classroom early, which heavily affected my grade. 
Centre College is a hell, it is terrible."
Senior,1,Study abroad programs and faculty are great. Admin does not care about students. Rampant racism and allowance of sexual assault. Dorms falling apart.
College Junior,1,All party life depends on your personal friend group. And good luck trying to have a good time without being cited for it.
College Junior,1,"Centre students and professors are INCREDIBLY accepting, and encourage others to be who they are. With that being said, the campus is not racially diverse. It's predominantly white, but Admissions is working to change this (in a very proactive way). Also, there are international students from Spain, England, China, Japan, and other countries. "
College Sophomore,1,"Nobody really does drugs at all, if they do then I don't notice it. The only thing most people do is alcohol."
College Freshman,1,Centre College requires all students to live on campus. There are only a few rare occasions in which you would be allowed to live off campus and one of which would be because you're married. Other than that it's not much of an option.
College Freshman,1,No public transportation. You either bring your own car or rely on peers.
Recent Alumnus,1,"While I love Centre through and through, I hated the food.  It's provided by Sodexho, and their service to Centre is faulty at best. Repetitive and tasteless (unless you love salt).  Further, campus dining does not heed student and faculty requests. A considerably strong movement has been underway for a few years now to get local and organic food, but little change has been made.  Get the smallest meal plan possible (the one with the most flex dollars), and buy groceries instead. You'll save your appetite and your health."
College Freshman,1,"It's very hard to find a spot as many people bring cars to school and there just aren't enough spaces for people. The permit costs are ridiculous, causing most people to take a chance and not even pay for a permit. And you will want a car on campus because there is absolutely nothing to do. You will want to drive off campus many, many times whether it's to get food or to go party somewhere else. One good thing though is that all parking is relatively close to where you need to go, due to how small the campus is obviously."
College Freshman,1,No One Lives Off Campus – Very few people live off campus at Centre. This isn't a huge problem but it would be nice to have some places to go for fun with your friends that aren't on campus. But you're going to have a very hard time doing so.

Freshman,5,"Northwestern Michigan College is an amazing place. It truly feels like home!  Everyone is so kind and accepting. They’re so many available resources for you. Also, never be afraid to ask for help, because everyone will go out of their way to make sure you understand what your doing!"
Freshman,5,"Fall semester I will be taking online classes. I’m not nervous at all, because I know I will have resources available if I need help."
Sophomore,5,I love that the class sizes are small and the professor will actually remember your name. Being able to have conversations and receive feedback specific to your needs makes a huge difference.
Junior,5,Classes are small. You are able to get more one on one time with your professors. Asking questions never is an issue.
Junior,5,"I'm currently finishing up my prerequisites for pre-nursing  program. I've been accepted into the 2020 fall ADN program and I could not be more happy! NMC also helped me find a concurrent program through Davenport to help me receive my BSN during the summers while working toward my ADN during the fall and winter. NMC has been great for me, it's helped me financially, the area is close to home and familiar, the staff is wonderful and fun, they do a lot to help the students be their best and feel their best. There's so many options as to where you can study, hang out, receive academic help, etc.  As of right now, NMC is everything I'd hoped it to be and wouldn't recommend changing anything."
Sophomore,5,"NMC is located in the beautiful city of Traverse City, Michigan. It is home to one of the countries first degrees in Freshwater Science and the first bachelors program in Marine Technology. Main Campus is just a few blocks away from Lake Michigan and the Great Lakes Campus offers views of Grand Traverse Bay. NMC has hosted several conferences that offer great opportunities for networking in your prospective career path."
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed the tour,  staff friendly,  informative. Information on campus options for dorms. Options explained for food plans. Small campus, small class sizes for learning."
Freshman,5,"Northwestern Michigan College is an excellent college to start your college career.  I am 51 years old and just started in 2018, this is my first time attending college and I am glad I chose Northwestern.  The Professors are amazing, always available, and more than willing to go the extra mile to make sure you understand what you need to do.  The Academic Success coaches are always there to lend a helping hand.  Everyone here is just wonderful, kind, and helpful.  I love my college!"
Freshman,5,"NMC is a great place for me to start college, as a local I love the easily accessible campus and option to live at home. I have heard great things about most of the professors and staff. The only problem I have with the school is parking and the website being slightly confusing."
Junior,5,NMC has provided me with a ton of opportunities. All the instructors are very helpful and encourage students to innovate new ideas.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the community of innovation at the Parson Stulen building. I would like to see more bachelor programs here.
Sophomore,5,Northwestern Michigan College is a gem tucked in the beautiful city of Traverse City. I had no idea that a community college could contain so much. Rarely could one obtain a nursing degree as well as maritime training at a community college. My fellow students already have jobs lined up for them after they graduate.
Sophomore,5,I truly enjoyed my first year at NMC. It was easy to meet new people and even build relationships with professors.
Sophomore,5,"What I really love about Northwestern Michigan College is how caring the teachers are. I myself someday want to become a teacher so when I see a helpful and compassionate teacher I take notice. Since NMC is a smaller college most all of the teachers get to know there students and will not move on in class till they know each student is understanding the material, this is something you do not typically see at the college level. NMC also offers so many opportunities to seek out tutoring and help if you are struggling. Teachers and staff really want to see you succeed and that to me is priceless."
Works Here,5,I have taken classes at the college and I am now an adjunct instructor for a new degree program that the college has began in conjunction with our Local Hospital system. The diversity of degree programs that the college offers is outstanding for a small college. It is also very Military/Veteran friendly.
Junior,5,"My experience at NMC was very positive. The campus is pretty small so getting around is very easy and the professors that I had were very nice and professional. overall, I feel like I received an outstanding education for my general courses."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely LOVE Northwestern Michigan College.  I am currently enrolled in ENG 111/11 and it is so amazing how my instructor makes the class challenging, exciting, and yes, fun.  I have learned so much from him, as well as the advisers and other staff members.  My course goal is to receive my Associate's Degree in Accounting."
Alum,5,NMC was one of the best experiences I had. I learned so much in my time there. The faculty is outstanding and the college environment is above average!
Freshman,5,northwestern is a cute college right next to Traverse city. the college is full of great opportunities and great people.
Junior,5,"Great classes, wonderful teachers, and is affordable.
The students here are pretty young.
A lot of dual enrolled."
Senior,5,"Northwestern Michigan College is a great community college. I actually think I received a better education and had better professors here than I did at a University I attended years ago. There Medical programs in general are very good. The classes for the medical programs such as Anatomy and Physiology, math, and chemistry are  tough but after passing them with flying colors ( because I basically dedicated my life to school), I realized how much I learned because of how focused and dedicated I had to be to pass them. The professors are very well educated and take the time to really let the students grasp the material in the courses. You can tell the professors enjoy their jobs and enjoy watching students learn the material. I would recommend NMC (Northwestern Michigan College) to anyone wanting to pursue an education in Traverse City, Michigan. Another perk is living in Traverse City as well. Sooo beautiful!"
Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed my college experience here. It's a small school with a good education. The classes are small so you get the opportunity to make friends and get to know your professors.
Sophomore,5,I like the many different opportunities that NMC has to offer. They'll help you if you ask for help. There are a lot of scholarship opportunities. One thing that could be changed is the transferability. I was told I had to take certain classes for my degree in order to transfer and I took them because I though I needed them done by the time I got my associates. I could have started to go to my university a lot earlier but I didn't know I could. Now I have to take 62 credits from my university and a lot of them will be classes I don't need.
Niche User,5,I love Northwestern Michigan College it has an awesome Culinary arts program. That is why I choose to go to The Great Lakes Culinary Institute at Northwestern Michigan Community College next fall.
Sophomore,5,I have attended NMC for 2 years.  It is a great transition step for those not sure about their major.  I grew and learned much about myself and graduated with an associates degree.  I will now be moving on to a 4 year university but will always have fond memories of NMC.  I would highly recommend it!
Sophomore,5,So far I have really enjoyed attending classes at NMC. It has been a great way to get a lot of my credits for my business degree at a much more reasonable price. I was also able to stay closer to my family this way. I have had no complaints so far.
Sophomore,5,"NMC is so inviting, the teachers are smart and knowledgeable. I transferred here from Central Michigan University and I regret nothing. I love it here, and it is so affordable. There are so many resources to help you both with your school but also your financial and social situations. Professors care, the class sizes are small, its all around a great school and I would recommend it to anyone."
Sophomore,5,"NMC faculty does an excellent job investing into students. The School is very open and friendly making all students feel welcomed. In addition, the college has been improving its campus by adding new facilities including brand new dorms for student life."
Freshman,5,"As I continue my education here at nmc, I have yet to find a professor who doesn't seem to enjoy their field. It makes learning at this college quite enjoyable for myself. I will ultimately be transferring out of the school, but I believe NMC is a great place to start."
Freshman,5,"I love it here, there's help for everything you could need. The staff and Professors are all very nice and are ready to help you in classes, including any problems  you might have."
Sophomore,5,"The campus at Northwestern Michigan College is beautiful and small. I have gone to this college from the year 2014 until 2017 and the improvement they have made, like building new dorms, have been great. The only complaint I have is parking. It is tough to find a parking spot near the main buildings. The professors here are spectacular and are dedicated to student success. 

The college does have a gym and workout room with student discounts. Population on campus is fairly diverse, I have met people from India, China, and numerous other locations. There are one main food court and two mini food areas. Traverse City is a beautiful town and has many events going on thoughout the year. Overall I give the college a 9/10"
Sophomore,5,"It's a small college that allows students the opportunity to grow academically. They offer an array of courses, degrees, and transfer opportunities. The faculty is helpful and available, while the professors are extraordinary. The college offers a math center and an English center along with tutors that are available to students which offer a great way for students to get extra help when they need it. The Professors truly seem to care about the student's success and make themselves available to answer questions and get help whenever it is needed. Overall, I had a great experience with this institution."
Freshman,5,"Everyone is really friendly and they wont make you feel like you don't belong. They have a lot of clubs for you to join and not only that but if you are interested in volleyball, like I am, you have a chance of joining a group and making fun memories with them. They also have a open and beautiful campus full of trees and an open yard."
Junior,5,Excellent administration and faculty. Professors and instructors seem to genuinely care about their students and their success. Almost not worth going to another university.
College Senior,5,I take a lot of online classes because they're easier and very informative.
College Senior,5,"All of my professors have been enthusiastic about the subjects they teach and more than willing to help those who have questions or want more learning opportunities. Most provide chances for service learning or work that goes beyond the classroom, which helps to make the quality of their teaching much richer. The classes vary in size, but all of the ones I've taken so far have a maximum of 30 people, making it very easy to get help when you need it. Professors know their students by name, their face, and even writing style, and pay attention to the success of their students."
College Junior,5,The courses and professors are amazing. You learn so much that sticks with you.
College Freshman,5,"It's a great school with so much to offer. The students are wonderful, out-going and easy to talk to- not to mention SMART and so are the professors. The professors are wonderful and good at what they do. They care about you and your work ethic and you can make a one on one experience with them since the class sizes are small enough. There are about 24-30 in a class; great size. I LOVE the cafeteria and all the study places; not to mention the gorgeous views on campus as you walk to class."
College Sophomore,5,Such a great overall experience.
College Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience here. Great professors and courses.
College Sophomore,5,We have a fantastic student body! Fun and smart!
College Sophomore,5,We have the best professors. They really care.
College Sophomore,5,We have many campus activities.
College Junior,5,The classes are great and engaging and the professors are there for you and want to see you succeed
College Junior,5,The process to becoming a pilot is not for anyone who doesn't really want it. There is a lot of work involved but it is also a lot of fun too.
College Junior,5,People address each other on a first name basis
College Junior,5,I'm excited to start a job as a pilot
College Junior,5,"The people here, both past and present have a great sense of humor, and are amazing over all. Everyone I've spoken to has been just wonderful and awesome. I've asked so many people for directions and help and they're all so friendly and helpful. I'm terrified of leaving my tiny home town and going to a bigger school in a city that I've been in maybe five times in my entire life. But knowing that the people on campus are friendly and are wiling to accept me as me, is really helpful. I hope that I can be as accepting of them, as they are of me."
College Junior,5,"I haven't gotten to see everything on campus, but I have friends who have, and from what I've seen NMC's campus is AMAZING!!! from the lawn golf course, to the library, to east hall (dorms). its beautiful. I couldn't have hoped for a better campus close to home like NMC is."
College Senior,5,I have multiple friends that I see between and after classes. I do not feel out of place. I have a sense of security at the school.
College Senior,5,"There is a lot of diversity, students from different countries."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone you talk to are very helpful.  The campus is easy to get around and find classes
College Sophomore,5,"I love being back in school. I honestly had forgotten how much i enjoyed learning in high school. I love the idea of learning and knowing things that many of my peers do not know. When I am in school I feel that I am setting a good example for my children and that I am working hard to provide a better quality of life for my family. Even though I have not been in college for more than a year, NMC has really helped me to feel accomplished."
College Junior,5,"I am fortunate to attend one of the top 10 ranked culinary schools in the U.S. our facility is top notch. My major consists of a constant hands on Curriculum it was more difficult then i had imagined, a lot of history involved but i find it very fascinating. The program is always full of surprises. Internship opportunities are fairly easy to come by in the hospitality industry.   "
College Junior,5,Class registration process was very well thought out and very organized as a new student also even as a returning student I was couched by my academic advisory for all my remaining classes. 
College Junior,5,"This school is very well organized, helpful and caring. Staff is always eager to assist students. Teachers have been very helpful even outside of class. Parking could use some improvement. I'm so happy with the major I selected Great staff in that department."
College Sophomore,5,"The culinary program has amazing teachers, amazing students, and they teach you everything you need to know. "
College Sophomore,5,I never have any trouble with the curriculum or transfer of credits.
College Sophomore,5,I've had so much fun at this school i've learned so much and have met so many wonderful people
College Junior,5,"You can join the ACF as a student, and the monthly meetings help you network."
Freshman,4,For this year the instructors had to use online tools like Zoom for classes which made it easy for some people like me to do schooling from home.
Freshman,4,I liked how the instructors made the classes seem fun and they didn't feel boring at all. They also answered all the questions I had and were able to help me anytime I needed help.
Freshman,4,"Professors are awesome, they care about you. Class sizes are small so you actually get to know your peers and engage with them."
Niche User,4,"At NMC I absolutely loved the education I was receiving.Great for the price.  The classrooms were smaller sized which made it very easy to make relationships with peers as well as with the professors. The campus is small which makes everything very accessible. Only down side that I would think of is the smaller community that it has, If you are looking for a ""college experience"", this is not the place for you. However, there are still plenty of relationships to be made."
Sophomore,4,"I was very nervous beginning college, but I have loved it! I think it is important as a student to learn things the college offers you, so you can take advantage of all of the opportunities! Things like the writing center, or tutors! I would suggest taking morning classes because I didn't as a freshman! I have loved college and I can't wait to keep continuing!"
Sophomore,4,I  love how Northwestern Michigan college actually cares about their students. I see them bend over backwards to help people succeed everyday.
Niche User,4,"I'm a dual-enrolled student and I don't plan to continue at Northwestern Michigan College after high school. Because it's a community college, it's very affordable. It also has some outstanding programs such as the Great Lakes Naval Academy. The staff are welcoming and accommodating to a multitude of life circumstances. The only issue I have with the college is that it doesn't offer the rigor or programs I want in my university experience, but that's not the goal of the college. NMC aims to provide the community with quality education, and I think it does a wonderful job overall."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the art department art NMC, the professors are mazing, friendly and personable. I really love the fact that they value keeping art alive and in the community."
Sophomore,4,"My time at Northwestern Michigan College so far has been incredible. I enjoy the teachers and academics greatly, but some areas such as athletics and the campus food are lacking."
Freshman,4,"I haven't attended school there yet, but I have gone to visit on a couple different occasions. I love the dedication to helping students with the struggles to come with class. They have tutoring centers all over the campus, as well as computer labs everywhere in order to make sure you succeed. I can't wait to start there."
Freshman,4,"One of my professors goes through the topics a bit fast, but I have never had a problem at NMC. If you need help setting up your classes or any kind of technical help, they are there to walk you through it."
Niche User,4,"Although I have officially started attending, I have visited the campus and taken an online class for NMC. I enjoyed both! The atmosphere is great, the staff and professors are nice and helpful. Finally, I felt like I belonged. Even though I wasn't even a student yet, NMC made me feel like I was one and that I was welcomed. That's what I look for in a college and I am glad to have that at NMC."
Sophomore,4,"NMC is a cozy campus, and the faculty is extremely helpful and friendly. There isn't a wide diversity of people, seeing as it Northern Michigan, and there isn't a lot of groups to choose from."
Niche User,4,"It is a small college that can host high school students, international students, 4 year degree students and adults looking to go back to school."
Niche User,4,"I attend NMC as a dual-enrolled high school student. They seem to have lots of academic support, and it's a comfortable small campus where you can get to know your professors easily. You can easily walk anywhere on the main campus, and there are plenty of quiet places to study, whether it be in the fresh outdoors (there's lots of greenery), student enclaves, or the library. Being in northern Michigan, there isn't much diversity, but Traverse City is a neat place to explore-- there are lots of cool restaurants and shops downtown, and you can taste different types of beer, wine, and more from local breweries and the like."
Junior,4,I was excited when they paired with the University Center to offer the program for me to gain my bachelors degree.
Junior,4,"I love NMC, because it's an absolutely beautiful gem of a college in a beautiful town. The programs have been fantastic, taught by passionate and respectable tutors who really care about their students and being great teachers. I have loved the three years I have spent this far at NMC."
Niche User,4,Some classes are better orchestrated than others. Oddly enough it seems like some of the instructors/professors lack confidence in being front and center to teach a class. But otherwise it was a decent experience.
Freshman,4,"All staff is very helpful, your best interest and success is their number one priority. There is always someone to turn to to answer any question or solve any issue you may be having. The library is an exceptional place to do studying and projects."
Niche User,4,"I would definetly like to see more diversity within and throughout the school. I feel like that more diversity you have the easier it is to learn to get a long with different cultures, in the long run creating less and less hate"
Freshman,4,"The campus is small and quiet, perfect for relaxing and studying. The Professors are very good and understanding of circumstances and varying levels of skill. Overall NMC has been a great college."
Freshman,4,"Had a bad experience with a certain professor lying about how the math department grades, but otherwise, it has been very good! So glad I started my education here."
Sophomore,4,Northwestern Michigan college is a very nice small college in a beautiful city. The professors are great and for a small school there's a lot of majors to choose from.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small, local environment, and the engaging learning experience the teachers create there."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently attending Northwestern Michigan College. The facilities are excellent along with the campus. Compared to big universities the campus main Campus which I attend is very small but also very beautiful. Northwestern Michigan College technically has four campuses: the main campus, the Maritime Academy, its campus where it holds all its trades and the University Center. I have visited all of them and was very impressed. Along with their excellent facilities it has great faculty and staff to match. Just about every professor will help you if your struggling and we have three different tutoring centers if you need more guidance."
Sophomore,4,"Its ok but the faculty don't seem open to change. They have a tendency to not want to help their student groups, and when they help their groups its usually some feminist group. Its kind of a joke."
Sophomore,4,Northwestern Michigan College is a wonderful school to attend if you are looking for a small college. Instructors are all very professional and extremely helpful.
Alum,4,"The NMC campus is a beautiful, park-like atmosphere.  Professors are typically helpful, and approachable.  It was a great starting point for my higher education."
Freshman,4,NMC is a great college to get started with and they offer many resources to make sure that you're successful. However since NMC is just a community college not many of their credits transfer to larger universities.
Alum,4,Northwestern Michigan College is a great community college that recent high school graduates can attend before going to a University. All the teachers and staff there are very nice and helpful and will help guide you on a good path to success. One problem of it is that sometimes there are not enough class options to make a class schedule work perfectly but there is always a way to figure it out and the tuition is over twice the amount per credit hour if you do not live in Grand Traverse County. But overall it is a great school and a great stepping stone to a University.
Freshman,4,This is a great school.  The Traverse seeen is amazing and beautiful through all the seasons. I attended the Great Lakes Culinary Instatute and it is the best Culinary school. The instructors are some of the best.  They have the best admissions team I have ever dealt with.
Freshman,4,I've had a great first semester experiance at Northwestern. My professors were wonderful and so were the staff members. I am excited for this up coming semester to begin.
Freshman,4,"I have had an excellent, although relatively limited, experience with the college. The student financial and academic services are accessible and knowledgeable. I attend the Great Lakes  Maritime Academy campus, and the instructors are both very intelligent and engaging."
College Sophomore,4,There are many options for class scheduling so you can get almost any schedule that you want
College Sophomore,4,The aviation program is one of the best in the state. Many employers come to the aviation campus to meet students and present employment opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone here is very nice, people smile and say hi when they pass you in the halls. The professors have all been wonderful and very knowledgeable at what they teach. I wouldn't recommend the dorms due to cost and unreasonable restrictions about visitors and what is allowed in the rooms."
College Junior,4,"Different than lecture classes, but you have more time to do assignments and it's flexible hours. Professors get back to you asap."
College Junior,4,"The classes are different, some professors have unique lesson ways, where they would have a lecture and then you have to discuss with groups to answer questions. The classes are small, sometimes only 20 people. The courses offered is a difficult part because some are only offered during certain semesters."
College Junior,4,"It's my first college I've ever attended, but it is great because there are many areas you can sit down and study, inside and outside. Most of the professors are nice and willing to work with you if you need help. I would say the school is unique because it's small, but has multiple campuses and the main campus is the most relaxing place because of the nature feel. I would choose NMC over again if I could do it all over."
College Senior,4,"I haven't yet transferred, but I've been told NMC is one of the most transferable colleges in the state of Michigan."
College Senior,4,"The professors are funny, easy going, and really care about what they're teaching. They help in any way they can and classes are small so it's easy one on one time."
College Senior,4,As I said before Northwestern Michigan College gives great opportunities and works with you to get you an internship or job experience in your field. I feel that I have gained valuable information and experience for my future.
College Senior,4,I'm an accounting business major and twice a year they have a business fair for internships and work experience for all different business majors! NMC really helps you get your foot in the door!
College Senior,4,"Northwestern Michigan College was a great opportunity for me! It's opened new doors and helped me choose my major, I think it's a great choice for affordable college."
College Freshman,4,My experience with NMC is always good. I enjoy the workforce there and all the support they offer. You just have to use it.
College Freshman,4,I do not know for sure. I do not participate in any activities nor take advantage of the programs they offer.
College Freshman,4,"I not only live in the town of NMC but love it. NMC has reasonable size classes, your not overwhelmed with people. They offer plenty of small community programs and activities to bring us together. All areas of resources there are very helpful and the people are very friendly and patient"
College Senior,4,Northwestern is a great school at a great price. The staff is very caring and it is easy to transistion from the highschool life to the college life with this small community college.
College Senior,4,"I live outside of town, which I explained to my advisor before registering for classes. He helped me create a schedule that worked around my availability, making it so I only had to go to class 2 days a week, which has worked excellently as far as letting me manage my schedule."
College Senior,4,"Not all of the online classes are worth 1 or 2 credits; there are quite a few which count for as many as 4 or more credits, which is helpful for trying to get the maximum amount of credits possible prior to transferring."
College Senior,4,"NMC provides a huge variety of classes, considering its size, and taking some of these has given me a well-rounded foundation for pursuing my degree."
College Senior,4,"I enjoy this college because it's small and cheap, making it easier to transition into college life. I wouldn't give it 5 stars only because it's very small, and serves either as a preparation for a 4-year institution or a way to complete your education with only an Associate's."
College Junior,4,I think many people care to better themselves and want to be there
College Junior,4,You truly learn here. It's not just a thjng you get by to get a paper. They teach you in a way that it sticks with you.
College Junior,4,Love NMC! It's a school in proud to be at.
College Freshman,4,The professors know what they are teaching and strive for their students to learn the curriculum and willing to help those who are having a harder time to learn it.
College Sophomore,4,Courses and professors here are top notch!
College Sophomore,4,Getting a degree from this college looks so good and is so worth it.
College Sophomore,4,Online courses are truly amazing.
College Sophomore,4,We have a very fair tuition and financial aid.
Junior,2,"Overall,  it isn’t a bad school.  Issues I came across were transferring credits- taking 300 level English classes and I had to retake English 112.   Tuition rates seem rediculously high for “out of district” students.  I live 20 minutes away from the school and I have to pay out of district rates which is double of what in district students pay."
College Sophomore,2,its a pain and its a lot of money for tuition
College Student,2,"Very intermittent, but the library is always fine."
College Junior,2,"Professors do not care and it shows with attitudes and overall interaction with students. It is not all teachers that have this attitude, some have been more than willing to help however others are not true to their word nor their jobs it seems..."
College Junior,2,"This is mostly a school where people go to transfer out. Unless you know someone after you graduate here, it seems your degree is useless."
College Sophomore,2,"The Financial Aid office is a little slow working with people who are out of area.  I have had to wait weeks to find out what is going on with my Financial Aid with no word, and it made me miss Spring registration, putting my education off another semester.  The tuition is somewhat high for people who are out of area also."
College Junior,2,"It's not that they are doing a bad job. Its just when students are looking online on the financial aid page, it too confusing. It tells you an amount on one page.... but when you go onto another page, its a different amount."
College Sophomore,2,"Okay Experience – My experience at NMC has been okay. I have had a few great teachers, a few mediocre teachers, and a few terrible teachers. The student services, cashier, and other departments are horrible to their students. They're completely unorganized and not very helpful. I wouldn't recommend NMC to anyone, I would say go to Baker College in Cadillac if you can."
College Senior,2,"Not the Same – I always seem to find myself not putting as much effort into my online classes compared to ones on campus. Yes they are convieniant but my problem with them is that I do better when I actually have to be some place at a specific time. The workload for these classes is usually less than others and you really don't have to study because most of the time you can use the book. I really like being able to associate with my peers about topics that are discussed in class face to face, not through a discussion board."
College Senior,2,"Minor Inconvieniances – Parking is a big problem on this campus, but I assume it is like that at many places. Another problem is that many of the classes are only offered at certain times and there can be some major conflicts towards then end of achieving a degree."
College Freshman,1,It's been pretty bad but that is mainly due to my situation.
College Freshman,1,"In my dorm at least, I, along with others, have had trouble connecting to the internet."
College Junior,1,I live not far from the college but because I'm accross county lines I have to pay double the price as someone living in the county.
College Sophomore,1,"I have been attending here for two years now, and the first year i went here i had just about million problems with my financial aid. also once again my second here i am having problems again. i cant get enough financial aid to pay for school. so where is the amount due on my account going to come from. i work a minimum wage job, how does the school expect me to pay for the rest of my balance it just ridiculous. the first year i went here i didn't have to pay any extra fees or have a remaining balance on my account and now this semester i do. i don't know where ill come up with that."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no career center or alumni network. They hold a job fair once a year, but it is not for a CAREER, it's more for summer jobs."

Niche User,5,I have several relatives that attended Bennett College for Women and they are very successful and only say great things about Bennett. I was on the campus at a graduation and the campus and the dorms are beautiful.
Sophomore,5,"I have seen first hand the dedication from our esteemed President, faculty and those that work so tirelessly to ensure that everyone that comes here is afforded the opportunity to thrive.  The legacy on which I stand is phenomenal.  I am excited to follow in the footsteps of great women that have already paved the way.  There is no other place that I wish to make my make as a college student.  I am honored to be at this establishment."
Junior,5,"my experience at Bennett College for Women is very great. I have been enrolled into Bennett since my freshman year and have met great fiends and have had many wonderful opportunities. the professors are great and they really care about you its not like many other colleges where they will drop you from the class, the professors here will make sure you get your work done will check up on you and also make sure you are passing the staff and faculty really is like a second family here i really enjoy being an Bennett Belle and i always will"
Sophomore,5,Amazing sisterhood. Definitely a place to learn who you truly are as a woman and learn sisterhood. Teaches how to adjust to different or rough conditions.
Freshman,5,"I am about to go there and I am very excited and intrigued about the experiences coming my way. Being a Bennett Belle will be a huge and significant part of my life. I intend to work hard and smart, but to also grow as a young black woman in this society."
Freshman,5,"I hope to be a future Bennett Belle, I have been accepted to the school and will possibly be a upcoming freshman. The school gives so much support and love to the students."
College Sophomore,5,"Bennett belles go on to become doctors,lawyers,writers and so much more. Bennett has provided so much opportunites for african american women."
College Sophomore,5,terrific! my professors really showed me that they cared about me. they were willing to met with me after class hours in their office. The courses were tricky but not really hard. only hard if you didn't study.
College Freshman,5,I think any school helps students look for a job or internship in their field.
College Freshman,5,I'm not sure if there are any stories of incidents taking place at Bennett but to me I feel like I would be able to sleep knowing nothing is going to happen to me. I think if there was an issue where something serious of that nature was to come up there will be support and help provided to handle the issue. But with the type of security at the school an issue like that wouldn't take place.
College Freshman,5,From what I've heard the room aren't that bad the the college experience is wonderful. Staying on campus is a life learning experience and good for those who are coming into in-dependency. Bennett college dorm life is a great way to obtain structure in the students life and provides safety.
College Freshman,5,I would say it's the best because to me any greek life is fascinating to me. I like watching others have fun and dance and pledge it's a family once you become apart of the sororities. I think it could be a wonderful experience if a incoming student was interested in greek life.
College Freshman,5,"I applause career services because they are consistent and willing to help everyone if students are willing to be consistent too. There are employers recruiting opportunities which I like, spot on interviews. The quality of alumni network could be amazing, I've met a few alumni and they really have influence me to maintain goals and keep moving forward through my journey. I think alumni advice is so important."
College Freshman,5,Our campus is very safe and secure. Since being here we've only had one crime related incident which wasn't too serious.
College Junior,5,"Bennett College has mentoring programs, as well as tutoring services to ensure academic success."
College Junior,5,There is security cameras as well as safety guards on duty at all times on campus.
College Junior,5,"Bennett College provides safe housing environment for all students. As a former resident assistant of player hall at Bennett College, I can testify to safe clean housing."
College Junior,5,"I was given the opportunity to continue my education at Bennett College and for this I am truly grateful. Bennett College has not only provided a safe learning environment for students, but has opened doors for students who wanted to expand their horizon to study abroad, wonderful internships and Methodist Church exposure to help young girls be mentally and spiritually ready for the world. Bennett College also provides a Big sister & little sister mentoring program for every freshwoman.  These big sister and little sister program creates lifelong relationships with their sisters. When its all said and done, there is no place like Bennett College."
College Freshman,5,yesssss take out and surrounding places are the best
College Freshman,5,"There have been no reports or rumors about sexual assault on our campus, thankfully."

College Junior,5,The club life is very fun. Im not much of one but when i do go out i do have a good time.
College Sophomore,5,Public Safety does a wonderful job keeping us Bennett Belles Safe at all times. US as Belles may think they over due their job but if you look at it in a positive way its all to keep us out of harms way especially the freshwomen.
College Freshman,5,"There is always things to do weather its school related activities or going out with friends. I took alot of time out going to explore there is alot of things to do such as movies, laser tagging, bowling, clubs, house parties, and kick backs"
College Freshman,5,"Bennett College has the best security on campus. These men secure this campus 24/7. Every time I turn around there is a guard around. I always feel safe on this campus. At night time when I am walking across campus, there is always a guard there to give me a lift on the Golf-cart to my dorm."
College Junior,5,Bennett College has a strict policy on being a dry campus as well as there being no boys on the campus. They try to provide a safe environment for there students.
College Sophomore,5,Exclusive Girls – knowing that my school is an all girls school it is extremely fasicating to meet woman coming from all walks of life. We have woman from the virgin islands to hawaii. Each woman comes with a story and listening and learning from each one helps build my character and helps me grow as a woman. The fasion is amazing yet unique. The bonds that are built between one another grows and turns into friendships that end up lasting a lifetime. All the females have there own personalities and make that school spontaneous and full of life.
College Senior,5,Greek Takeover – it is very huge. if your Greek then you are more than likely popular. there are no Greek houses.
College Student,5,Clean and Healthy – The environment was very clean and healthy... Grounds stayed spotless.
College Senior,5,"College Housing Throughout the Greensboro Community – Greensboro is a college city, therefore they have college housing throughout the community. The housing is affordable for college students and many come with washers/dryers. For example my apartments have a washer/dryer. I only have to worry about rent. Also the apartments that I live in are surrounded are other college apartments all of which are in walking distance to Bennett."
College Sophomore,5,"My Major – My goal is to be an international business executive. I am majoring in business with a concentration in marketing and a minor in global studies. I found that my advisors and professor are very willing help me make any decision I have questions about. They all want me to succeed, day or night they are avaliable. They tell me about any avaliable opportunity bthey think will help me succeed."
College Sophomore,5,"Yes, like most institutions we have greek life. However on our campus it does not define who we are. Yes my sisters are proud of their sororities but they are sisters before their colors. Unless they are wearing parafenalia some you would have never guessed are greek because we treat each other with the same respect, loyalty, and kindness on a day to day basis."
College Sophomore,5,"the facilities at Bennett Colege for Women are very good considering how small of an institution is is. verything a teache needs to feul their classroom is provided. There is a gym, pool, track, a chapel, recreational lounge and a beautiful quad if you would like to simply sit under a tree. The library is fully stocked including highly effecien workes who are always willing to help. In addition to that there is an art museum on campus."
College Junior,5,"Down Town!! The Restaurants in Downtown Greensboro are very friendly to students, but the scenery downtown is Gorgeous beyond words. You can always take a stroll downtown and feel safe while having a great time"
College Junior,5,"Cultural Attraction – The Museum downtown, Woolworths, is a historical counter where four NC A&T students sat to receive service, but was denied. The history that is shared is amazing and very accurate."
College Freshman,5,"Getting Admitted – The process of getting into Bennett was difficult for me becuase i didnt think i would actually get int. I also was a transfer student and didnt do well at that school, but they accepted me and entered me in a program to help me with anythign academically."
College Junior,5,"Students use Greensboro's public transit systems. Our campus is small enough to walk to every building without having to use motor vehicles. We have two bus stops located 20 feet from campus. One on East Washington Street, the other on Gorrell Street."
College Junior,5,The professor in our field expect a lot from their students. The work load for upper level mathematics classes are challenging. They demand a lot from their students but pose great opportunities for us to succeed.
College Sophomore,5,They have great wifi and computers in each dorm and buildings along with printers you can use anytime :-) 
Alum,4,"Due to the Corona virus pandemic, my senior year was completed at home. It was sad to say goodbye to all of my belle sisters, and the staff also professors that I built a close relationship with. Still, it was for our safety. Honestly, I was not too fond of zoom way before the pandemic, but then I grasped the hang of using it like a pro who had used it for years. We would meet according to our schedules, sometimes the full-time length or other times shorter. Graduation was held virtually, and all of us within the Class of 2020 wondered how this would be possible, but Bennett gave us a memorable virtual ceremony."
Alum,4,"As an Education major during the Fall of 2018, Bennett College's Department of Education allowed me to work with kids in a classroom during a practicum process. I did mine with third graders at Washington Montessori Elementary School in Greensboro, NC. In the spring of 2018, I switched majors to Interdisciplinary Studies with a concentration in History. Thus far, the area of study has helped me think critically and develop lesson plans and activities for my future students in the classroom environment and overcome my fear of public speaking. However, it is still a working progress. With the practice in the past from being an Education major and my internship as an Interdisciplinary Studies Major, it has given me the chance to work with different age groups of children. Therefore, my degree, Interdisciplinary Studies that I received during my undergraduate years  has prepared me for the leadership of becoming a teacher."
Freshman,4,The over all experience for me has been great. The staff and members at Bennett College have been very helpful with the admission process. Also I received fast responses to any questions or concern that I had. The staff are very helpful and kind.
Freshman,4,I have not experience online learning  with Bennett college yet . But I have been inform that online classes will be virtue and very engaging in class.
Senior,4,Bennett College is a good school or a student who wants to be on a close net campus. and get personal times with professors to make your grades and education experience better.
Sophomore,4,"I love my school! Sisterhood 4 Life! Bennett is a really good college, at first I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. But overtime I grew to love it. Bennett has some room for improvement in some areas and needs to work some problems out. Overall, I think Bennett is great and every women should experience the Sisterhood of Bennett College."
Freshman,4,Bennett is at times hard...but you will leave out if it feeling like you won a Grammy. You have to deal with alit but it will make you appreciate the history and Sisterhood of the college and alumni. Some of my best memories are in this school and I pray that it will be here forevermore.
Senior,4,"Though imperfect, as most institutions, Bennett College for Women is a place dedicated to the matriculation of Black women and women of color. Bennett provides good education, supportive faculty, and incredible opportunities."
Junior,4,"What Bennett lacks in funding and prompt administration, they make up for with caring, professors and staff, and a supportive environment. Walking on campus each day fills me with joy. Though there is work to do, I love this school and encourage any young, black woman to consider what this school has to offer."
Freshman,4,"Bennett is an Institution that makes it their duty to provide their students with the upmost possibilities and opportunities. They mold you into the successful young woman you may aspire to be. You may not be to keen on this college as your first choice, but once you get here you will feel at home."
Freshman,4,I love that Bennett is built on sisterhood and follows the traditions it started on from the beginning.
Freshman,4,"well I like that it is a small campus and they offer so much support for you to do better things , throughout your college years ."
Freshman,4,Bennett College is an interesting mix of young women who are there to provide themselves with the fundamentals to have a bright future. Bennett is a small HBCU but what it lacks in size it makes up for ten fold. Bennett is very big on sisterhood and that is evident in the way your fellow Bennett Belles greet you every morning. You will always be greeted with a smile when on the campus of the school. I personally love going to Bennett College because there is always something new happening on campus.
Freshman,4,"My personal experience with Bennett College I would say that it has been a very fair but good experience so far. I am a freshwoman and so far my classes are going very good and smooth. The teachers will work with you, they are very understanding and try their hardest not to let no one fail. But it is also up to you as a student to make sure you stay on top of your work and classes. The students here are very helpful, friendly, and caring. Not only that they treat their incoming class like everyone else. They tell you so many do's and don'ts of college experience that some people may not know about. Its a very small campus but its very welcoming, my RD for my hall is like a second mother away from home. One thing that I would like to change about my school would have to be my resident hall , I would say they have small rooms and upgrade our living conditions."
College Sophomore,4,It was great! I love the sisterhood
College Freshman,4,"So far I like the school, it hasn't given me a reason not to like it or enjoy my time at the university"
College Freshman,4,"My classes have been great, I sat in front of all my classes. I think it's important that the professors are aware that some students are here to be attentive and respectful. However sittibg in the front can be annoying when others are talking out of turn, but overall professors are equally respectful. The class sizes are great, makes class very engaging & brings in more effort from the students. Courses offered could be better because I know many students that have to go else where for something Bennett doesn't offer."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus nothing has happened from my knowledge. From my experiences of walking when it's late I've been safe, but I think more lighting around the campus would be good too."
College Freshman,4,Career prospects at this school are great. We are offered a lot of opportunities here.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is very secretive, like any other campus."
College Freshman,4,My teachers are very passionate about their field of work.

College Freshman,4,Bennett often has career fairs that offer you more information on what career you may want to pursue.
College Freshman,4,"Overall, Bennett is a great institution there are just a few things they need to update and I feel as though they should listen to their students more because we are paying a lot of money to attend this school."
College Freshman,4,Bennett College for Women needs to be completely renovated but I know that this will cost a lot of money.
College Freshman,4,"When I first arrived at Bennett College for Women I did not like the change at all. That was only because I was away from home and sometimes began to feel alone. However; after I became used to the changes around me, I realized how much I really love my HBCU!"
College Junior,4,"I feel my college experience is like no other because I transferred to Bennett College and I love it. The culture and emphasis on sisterhood is great. When one sister is down, we hold each other up. Bennett College is a women's college which represent the South as a trademark school because it promotes characteristics of a Southern Belle and in order to be a Bennett Belle you must be poised and represent yourself as a brand. I am my own brand and as I continue to be my own brand, Bennett College gives me the opportunity to be the women I am. I encourage you to come visit our campus which is small and very open to visitors."
College Sophomore,4,Campus housing is great. I feel safe and secure everyday I am there.
College Freshman,4,its all girls the campus security protect us
College Freshman,4,Greensboro is a small little city the locals are country but excited about the melting pot the surrounding colleges create like Bennett Uncg and Ncat

College Freshman,4,"I'm not eligible to be in a sorority due to me freshwomen status, but the greeks have nothing but positive thoughts about their greek experience."
College Sophomore,4,I would like to do an internship overseas to see what type of welfare system they have in place if any.
College Sophomore,4,it's a big family atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,On campus life is cool.
College Sophomore,4,"Our school is an all-female college, so it's pretty different."
College Sophomore,4,"At first, I wasn't excited about coming to Bennett, but it's the best decision I've ever made."
College Freshman,4,"The policy is highly enforced which is great and peer pressure is alive, but there are people you can talk to on campus about it. I haven't really seen that many people using drug or alcohol and that is a great sign to me. I feel safer knowing that my peers have respect for the campus because I feel that way that will also respect me."
Recent Alumnus,4,the safety man are on the clock twenty-four seven.
College Sophomore,4,You have plenty of resources to use the computer
College Sophomore,4,Bennett is very strict on incoming fresh woman for they can learn the area of greensboro 
College Junior,4,The work load isnt alot you just need to really study and KNOW the material that they are giving you.
College Junior,4,We all believe in something on this campus. I know that for sure.
College Junior,4,I havent had a intership but their is this summer reseach i want to apply for this december. Im hoping i get in because i really want to do it.
College Junior,4,The process for this reseach is just writing a paper to why you want to do the summer reseach.
College Freshman,4,"During my weekend orientation at Bennett college for women I felt right at home. Every young lady around me gave off amazing energy, and everyone was smiling and laughing and conversing like we had all known each other for years. Bennett college for women is really like a new found sisterhood. I am so ready to move on campus August 9th and finally be a Freshwomen."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is all girls, and its like a huge sisterhood. I love all my bennett belles."
College Sophomore,4,I love my major at school. The department is so hands on and helpful. I know psychology is the career path im prepared to take.
College Sophomore,4,Academics is great at Bennett. I learned alot my freshman year and I feel like my high school prepared me so much.
College Sophomore,4,"Nightlife is decent. I have fun almost every weekend. Clubs are free before 12 so thats great, and all house parties are free as well."
College Sophomore,4,Greensboro is a huge college town with tons of things to do. I'm never bored on weekends. My school has such HBCU pride its crazy. Just across the street is North Carolina A&T and downt the street is UNC-Greensboro.
College Sophomore,4,for me academics if great. all i do is put my most important priorites first and stay ahead of the game.
College Senior,4,"Since Bennett is located right on the edge of downtown, there are plenty of restaurant options very close by. Even if you don't want to eat at a sit-down type of place, we also have Summit just a bus ride away where there's Cookout, Burger King, McDonald's, Subway, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life at Bennett is pretty interesting. They try different activities, do things for the youth in our community, and also do things for the community. We don't have greek housing at Bennett."
Freshman,2,"I liked the classes. The classes were relatively small and the professor for the most part are good. Bennet needs to work on the housing, food, communication and organization in funding. And the traditions need to be updated."
Freshman,2,"I'd give my school a 2/5 overall simply because it is very unorganized. A lot of the activities would have better outcomes if they were better organized. I also feel it needs to be more modernized. A lot of the requirements and standards are from the past. I believe there is a way to keep tradition but perform these tasks in a more modern way. I do like the unity and sisterhood here at Bennett. Everyone truly does look out for one another. If you prefer a small school, this isn't a bad idea. I also like that it's fairly easy to make friends here. Most people are open and there aren't really any clicks. My main concern is that I feel I don't get my money's worth. Maybe if this school was private and less money it would attract more people."
Freshman,2,"My experience at Bennett College was totally unexpected. There are no food options other than the cafe which the food there is not very good, and Sandella's Flatbread and Starbucks. The staff is not trained properly to make coffee at Starbucks its full off milk with no coffee. The dorms need major reservations other than the newest dorm ""Honors Hall"". The rest of the dorms need remodeling. They ignore the mold in some of the rooms and the bathroom. My overall experience at Bennett College is not so great."
College Freshman,2,There are not many housing options. Buildings are old and need to be updated.
College Freshman,2,Everyone either smokes marijuana or drinks.
College Freshman,2,Bennett barely has party scene if so they shut it down.
College Freshman,2,Anybody can walk on campus if they  wanted. We have students working at public safety. Public safety are  rage in there late 40's and is not in shape
College Freshman,2,The building are very old and falling apart
College Freshman,2,"I am not getting my money worth. The technolgy is horrible , the building are falling apart, during the winter the heat rarely come on and its mold in the showers."
College Sophomore,2,I did not like living on campus because the dorms are very old so I live off campus now.
College Sophomore,2,"I feel scared when I get out of class at 7 waiting at the bus stop for my bus because it is very dark out, there are not enough lights and no one around in case of a emergency."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are very old and need to be updated. There really isn't school spirit. My schools seems very low budget, there are not any sports. The food is nasty there is not much of a variety."
College Freshman,2,There are no athletics on this campus due to financial costs.
College Sophomore,2,"We can't have male visitors in our dorms, and they have to go through airport security just to be on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Overall Bennett College For Women is a great school for certain majors. if you're interested in JMS or Education majors then by all means attend Bennett College, however if your a Biology major this may not be the school for you for the simple fact of there are limited programs for us.... Also most of the girls here are all about drama and they judge you. The school is in need of a MAJOR RENOVATION!!!! "
Recent Alumnus,2,the ladies are very dirty and they don't think about others
Recent Alumnus,2,my financial is not helping me because i have to still pay money
College Sophomore,2,I have to major in biology into a minor into nursing because they do not have a nursing program.
College Sophomore,2,The bus are always running late
College Sophomore,2,Every one has their different styles and it all girl school so you have so many different attitudes
College Junior,2,60 for Permit = Parking in messed up ground.
College Sophomore,2,Bennett has different sports but it really depends on what you like or love to do. if bennet doesnt have a sport or activity u like or love you have always start something of your own.
College Freshman,2,"I like the school, the sisterhood.  I just think there are things that can be better for a small school like Bennett.  Like the communication with the offices and the food in the cafe."
College Freshman,2,The facilities often dont have a good way to communicate with the students
College Senior,2,"All the dorms need remodeling on the inside, except for Honors (which is the newest dorm). They aren't the best dorms that they could be. The bathrooms are the first places that should be remodeled."
College Senior,2,"Being in such a small school, the students don't get many scholarships from within the school. We have to look for some ourselves. The financial aid process is like hell. Long lines and frustration is only the start of what many students have to go through. Everything's last minute!"
College Senior,2,"Greek life is there for parties and sporadic event all around campus, but it's not the number one priority. Being in a small school, the non-Greeks get invited different sorority parties around the community."
College Freshman,2,I received a decent amount but it is not possible to be awarded a full scholarship
College Junior,2,it not too much different fromn other schools but it different for me .
College Freshman,2,Bi- Polar! It will be hot one day and cold the next. Global Warming is real!
College Freshman,2,Parking is usually available without issues unless there is an event on campus
College Junior,2,There have been many instances on campus where my safety has been compromised. I think Bennett needs better campus security. Preferably some younger officers who can react to situations more quickly than the oneshey have now.
College Junior,2,Greek life at bennett is very finikey. I wont say much because I have yet to become a part of it and dont want to ruin my chances by expressing my opinion on what its like as of right now.
College Sophomore,2,"High Tuition With Little Support – I was disappointed to find out that I didn't receive as much money this year than last year. As much as people do on campus, you think they want to reward us somehow, but that's not always the case."
College Sophomore,2,"In Need of a Better Variety – Attending a small college has its pros and cons especially with the food choices. After a while, you start to get tired of what they offer. The food is good at times, but then it's not. I might not eat there as much this year."
College Sophomore,2,"The rest of the campus is in need of better computers and printers for all students and the library has good computers, though need to update the printers."
College Senior,2,All Women No Division – Bennett is not a place to come to if you are into competitive sports.
College Senior,2,"The weather is all over the place. in one week it rains, then its extremely hot, then cold."
College Junior,2,"Although I received an okay amount of Financial assistant, My mother was not allowed to put more of the loans on me instead of her end. If you have a question or concern, you are told to call, but if no one will answer the phones or respond back in a timely manner, how are we suppose to get assistance? If you have any concerns or questions, I would advise you to educate yourself on financial aid before asking your school financial aid office, so that you may have a little knowledge on what and how to complete your Aid."
College Freshman,2,None of That – Bennett College displays an image of being a belle. Belles represent positive role models. With that being said Bennett Belles are very head-strong and not very effected by peer pressure with substances.
College Freshman,1,"Very small, dusty and broken down."
College Freshman,1,There is little to no diversity.
College Freshman,1,There were no precautions or new rules set in  place after my friend was stalked on campus.
College Freshman,1,"Barge, Player and Jones are in the WORST condition."
College Freshman,1,There are no sports on campus. AT ALL.
College Freshman,1,Bennett does not have a athletics department. No sports at all. They said they  do to bring students in but once you get here they do not. Bennett has lied.
College Sophomore,1,my school does not have athletics. I signed up for volley ball but they never found a coach.
College Freshman,1,the buildings are basically falling apart
College Freshman,1,we don't have any sports which is sad and boring
College Freshman,1,the showers are dirty the rooms have bugs no cell service .. all calls drop are you don't get them
College Freshman,1,"I took out 19,500 in loans my efc was 0"
College Freshman,1,we don't have any teams
College Sophomore,1,My school is women only.
College Freshman,1,"I desperately need a car to get around campus and other areas I need to go. However, the problem is that the parking on campus is terrible. There is very limited parking space."
College Sophomore,1,Stress me out a lot and still looking for scholarship everyday to pay for this school.. Can not register for my class so it streesful
College Sophomore,1,One day it's cold the next day hot..
College Sophomore,1,You can tell when people go out at night and then come back.. You can smell it sometimes when someone smoke or drink

College Freshman,1,There is nothing here for athletes. The only sport here is basketball.
College Freshman,1,Old and Out of Date. We are a historic institution but the buildings are not very well kept.
College Freshman,1,Outside of the Journalism and Media Studies building the computers are only and out of date
College Freshman,1,"There is very little to do on campus, the library is small and out of date, and the gym does not have any workout equipment."
College Junior,1,The financial aid process at bennet is not for the faint at heart. Dealing with financial aid is like taking care of a child. ou constantly have to stay on the fin. aid staff in order to get things done. And NEVER give them anything without MAKING A COPY first because I gurantee you they'll email you 2 wkws later saying they haven't received it.
College Freshman,1,"Crowded, Unavailable or Broken – If the computers are not all taken by off campus students or students who computers are being fixed by IT then people who generally do not have a computer are out of luck. Sometimes computer labs are unavailable when the classroom buildings are closed. The main issues are about the computer labs within the dorms that are broken for a whole semester. This throws students off balance and they began to stray from their work because they have no where to complete it."
College Freshman,1,"Every student i have encountered on Campus is African-American, or Some sort of Black. The school is an HBCU, there are a few Hispanic students. Everyone is very accepting of exchange students."
College Freshman,1,"Computers on campus are usually slow, and lack printer access. We do have printer access at kiosks on campus, but it isnt free."
College Freshman,1,"you are not allowed to park close to your hall. the student parking is far from your room, and when it's cold the walk back seems longer."
College Freshman,1,"Though They Try extremely Hard To Have Us Updated with New Technology, If I Didnt Have My Own computer and Printer, Id Probably Go Out To Univ. North Carolina Greensboro or North Carolina A&T State Univ."
College Freshman,1,Lock Down! Freshwomen have curfew 11 p.m. Sunday-Thursday and 12 p.m on Friday-Saturday
College Freshman,1,"Cafe Food – The dinning options for students attending Bennett College is horriable.  They don't have any options except for cafe food.  Your meal plan is includedinto your tution, which means if you dont have anything to eat in your room you are left with that horriable food.  It's like feeding a dog scraps from the trash."
College Freshman,1,I rarely see scholarship opportunities posted anywhere.
College Freshman,1,Bus System – Bus system around here sucks the buses never come on time.

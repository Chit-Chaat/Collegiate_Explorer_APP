Sophomore,5,Taking courses online was beneficial to me due to a heavy work schedule. My professors have always been accessible and assistance was provided whenever the need arose.
Alum,5,Learning online during my summer course back in 2018 was a breeze. It definitely depends on the subjects you are taking.
Alum,5,A great and cheap school to receive a college degree from! The professors in the Cheyenne campus were all pleasant to learn from.
Alum,5,The teacher's are very understanding and try their best to make you succeed. They are very open to answering questions and make time for office hours if a student needs help.
Alum,5,They transitioned very well and were able to make learning online easier than I thought. They managed to have everything ready on time and have a schedule prepared that isn't overwhelming and still enables learning.
Sophomore,5,"Online school is pretty tough for anybody; no matter the school your attending. Luckily, CSN professors have made it easy for students to be on their work!"
Sophomore,5,CSN has treated me pretty well. I have had sat through very informational lectures taught by some of the best teachers. I'm glad that I got to experience classes on campus at West Charleston. The facility is very clean and the library is extremely beautiful.
Niche User,5,"They communicated with me about my college plan. The teachers are nice and helpful. Overall, a nice college to go to."
Niche User,5,"The professors are very understanding and have made it easy to learn. They will check up on you and make sure you understand the work. Overall, very nice and not too difficult."
Niche User,5,I've thoroughly enjoyed all the classes that I have taken at the college of southern Nevada. All teachers were nice and concerned for their students.
Niche User,5,I took most of my classes online once the covid outbreak happened and there was a very quick adjustment that was easy for the students.
Freshman,5,"I have been doing online for about two semesters now, and it is an amazing opportunity due to the fact that I now have schooling that works around my schedule and not vice versa."
Freshman,5,It's an amazing environment with loads of fellow students and teachers all doing their best to make it further in the world. And it all starts there.
Senior,5,"The College of Southern Nevada Cheyenne Campus had a great community that I felt connected to. I have had many great experiences in my 3 years attending. Most of my favorite teachers have been professors I met in my experience. College of Southern Nevada is a great way to get started on your academic career. It is affordable and allows you to prepare for transferring to university where it really matters. It saddens me that I can no longer take the rest of my classes in person and had to switch to online. I always enjoyed going to the cheyenne campus, whether it was to study, connect with classmates, friends and teachers, or  to use the CSN gym to workout. So far CSN has gotten me to a great start on my academic career and I recommend this as an option to any and all who decide to strive for academic growth affordably."
Freshman,5,"I am currently taking all of my classes online at College of Southern Nevada. Taking online courses have not been as bad as I would have thought, the classes are oragnized and the professors update the work weekly. The professors thoroughly explain the assignments and include extra resources for help on the course."
Freshman,5,"My experience at College of Southern Nevada has been so far, a great experience. The professors never fail to provide helpful feedback when needed, and they are passionate about what they do. On top of that, CSN also provides many resources for students that are attending. They send out weekly reminders of clubs and organizations--including discussions that any student can attend."
Senior,5,College of Southern Nevada is great. It is a small community college which makes it great. You really get to know your professors and fellow students. They offer a variety of help from tutors to online resources to office hours. The staff is always so nice in the Registrars office. They encourage higher education in whatever stage in your life you are at.
Senior,5,I had a good time doing some of my classes online. Most professors are there to help you at whatever hour. Most of the online classes are easy if you manage your time properly!
Freshman,5,But I like about CSN is they are very diverse. They push academics a lot so if you were in athletics they do what they can to help you succeed no matter what.
Niche User,5,I've seen this campus. There are a lot of friendly people and lots of people attend this school. They have many majors you can choose from. They should have made this campus more noticeable because the building is a school that not a lot of people see on while driving.
Freshman,5,"This college gives me a new opportunity to grow as a person. Also, they many programs, and amazing teachers. I can't wait to start a new career path."
Freshman,5,"The online classes are a good way to have more one on one with your teachers. Canvas is a easy website to do their classes, and learn more about the teachers. I prefer online classes than in person classes because, you can focus more on the classes at your pace. While, in person classes is more face paced than online classes, and that will affect some of the students that have problems. I feel better on the online classes than in person classes. I hope you choose well."
Senior,5,"Canvas and myCSN are very user friendly, the teachers recently started putting voice memos in their power points making understanding the material easier."
Senior,5,"The staff at CSN are amazing at helping you keep on track. Classes are not too long, some classes do require a lot of time to get a decent grade but totally worth it."
Freshman,5,"Class sizes are perfect my classes have typically been between 14 to 20 students.  The professors really get to know you, many are even willing to stay late to help you if you're struggling with a concept. 
Campus food is great too, but location is key and there are plenty of spots to eat at around the West Charleston campus as well.  If you do not have a car no worries their campuses are on the bus line, so you can easily get to campus even if you do not have a vehicle."
Freshman,5,"Professors treat you like adults, many will give you the syllabus so that you can do the weekly assignments or even work ahead.  Time management is key it gets easy to not do your course work then before you know it you're two, three, four weeks behind.
Just like when you're in a classroom setting, professors do their best to answer any questions you may have regarding the material.  You can e-mail the professor directly or ask your question in a public discussion, so that if others are having the same issue can see the professor solution."
Sophomore,5,"From my experiences, CSN online classes are incredibly easy and really well structured. Professors are really easy to get ahold of and are great at explaining things, even through a screen, due to the nature of the class. I find that the workload is manageable and easy! Highly recommend their online classes!"
Sophomore,5,A lot of help and resources during the pandemic and even well before it. The professors I had went above and beyond to make sure all students could succeed
Niche User,5,The online classes are very understanding. Professors are very good about making sure that every student is on the right track.
Junior,5,Easy access and teachers are very thorough about what is expected. When Covid 19 hit teachers were very helpful and informative during this crucial time.
Junior,5,I personally only ever took one class online and it was great overall. The professor I had that semester always answered any emails students had right away or at least tried his best too. Professors need time to try and get to everybody as well but they did an amazing job.
Niche User,5,they have an amazing support system especially for those who aren't financially able to afford things such as tutring.they have amazing free tutoring available. they have amazing proffers as well as amazing staff.
Niche User,5,i am about to take my freshman year their i am doing a program where I take highschool as well as college courses. i think from the help I have received is really great. As i was really confused at first about the registration process they really helped to guide me through it
Graduate Student,5,"My online experience was great I took a few online classes at CSN. The professors were always helpful and divided the classes in a way that we could work and not get behind. They made it as easy as possible for us to understand. Although in the end, we all had to transition to online classes they worked hard to make things better for us and provided a variety of platforms and resources we could use."
Graduate Student,5,"I was nervous about starting college because I was homeschooled since the sixth grade. However, when I started at the College of Southern Nevada (CSN) I immediately felt welcome and comfortable. I felt that way because the professors were all helpful and cared about my education. They answered any question I had within a timely matter and helped me get used to the in-person classes. Also, CSN provides a safe environment for all students. There was a lot of diversity and friendliness. I can only say it was a great experience and it was an important part of my education."
Sophomore,5,"College of Southern Nevada is not only a spectacular eye opening opportunity but, the programs for all aspiring students make it not only easy as well affordable to engage in a magnificent hire education learning experience. I am a student that had difficulty getting through not only school but making friends in anti environment csn gave me that opportunity to express myself without feeling judge. And all the workers, professors care about each student safety physically and emotionally, I am glad I enrolled to become a College of Southern Nevada Coyote to prosper and grow as an individual and to help my community!!"
Sophomore,5,I like the campus of college of southern Nevada or CSN because it is a very good campus. the professors are very good there and seem very nice. they will help you in anyway they can. everything there is amazing in my opinion
Sophomore,5,I've never really been in an online class but with this covid situation i felt like i knew what i was doing.
Junior,5,Online classes have been very helpful. They help me learn just as much if not more than the in-person classes.
Junior,5,I like all of the professors. Everyone is very helpful and they want you to succeed. Multiple campuses allow students from different areas to take classes closer to home.
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience has been very good, communication with teachers is easy and they always answer very fast."
Sophomore,5,"College of Southern Nevada is a great school, it's very diverse with many amazing teachers who are very passionate about what they do. I feel very welcome and comfortable at school and always enjoy my time there."
Sophomore,5,Its a good school environment. Everyone on campus is so nice and friendly.  I really like going here its very chill and relaxed. Faculty members of the school are really friendly and help you out with what it is you need.
Sophomore,5,Its very easy and self explanatory to navigate the online learning resources. Even just contacting your professors is really easy and simple to understand.
Graduate Student,5,"I took on line and campus classes. The professors were great, prepared  and know exactly how to help us also during this pandemic. Very good but also u have to study very much"
Graduate Student,5,Very good great professors...easy to found very gentle. The professor are super good. The structure it's new and very friendly
Sophomore,5,Eventhough CSN is a community college they are very much helpful in what they do for their students. CSN is now turning into a 4 year college but before they were such a good school to help students get where they need to. Its very affordable and the staff is very caring for people that need help financially and educationally. They help you understand where you want to go further on in your career and education even if its after the 2 years at the community. I've never disliked a professor once in the 2 years I've been there. If you're willing to put in the work you'll get the help and grade you deserve.
Sophomore,5,My experience with csn has be great so far all the professors are great and I could tell they really care for the students and want them to succeed. However I do wish there were more activities to do on campus
Sophomore,5,Teachers are alway there when you need them. they answer emails as soon as possible and are clear on what is expected of students
Freshman,5,Perfect college and very clean. College of southern Nevada was the perfect place for me to transition back to college after taking 2 years off after highschool.
Freshman,5,"What I love about my college is that many of the advisors are very hands on, and welcoming. The teachers and tutors are steadfast at helping us understand our work better."
Sophomore,5,"I didn’t take my classes online but my professors do make use of an online platform called Canvas. Where we turn in assignments, take quizzes, or have presentations available from lecture."
Sophomore,5,In this college I have had an overall good experience. First of all because the campus feels safe and clean. The professors are easy to get along with. And there are a lot of resources in campus to help you out if you’re struggling in class.
Freshman,5,"I love how big the campus is, every building is new. It’s hard to get lost on this campus. Everything is so clean, students and faculty make this place great. The school is spaced out perfectly. The parking is absolutely free, I love it. The professors are top of the line"
Niche User,5,"What I liked about the College of Southern Nevada is the possibility of becoming a better student. With my experience class size was your average high school classroom. The teacher was excellent and provided many different viewpoints on today's society as well as give us insight into some past authors. With each course that was taken, I felt I was getting more than I signed up for. This campus, in particular, is located around many different food chains which is great when you want a snack or a meal. Making it easier to hang out with friends whether it may be catching up or helping on another on a class. Not to mention what it feels like finally taking your steps toward your future and your career. The staff is so nice and they are very friendly when they help you out with whatever you need. They make it easier to understand what is going on and what will happen, which is great because they give you an insight into what to expect."
Freshman,5,Very invested in their students success. Going back to college didn’t seem so overwhelming when the college staff were helping me every step of the way. I even called the help desk at 9pm and someone answered to help me with my tech problems. Super impressed.
Freshman,5,"As a current student at College of Southern Nevada, I must say the experience collectively has been extremely positive. Although I have been taking all of my courses online, the academic experience, both with professors and my peers has been fantastic. Truthfully, it's as if I am getting my version of a perfect college experience from the comfort of my home. One of the college's strengths, in my opinion, is the professors. You can tell that they genuinely care about your success, as well as your input when moving forward within the courses. On top of this, the learning material provided in my experience has been a major deciding factor in continuing to take online classes; they're both perfect for general learning, but also for studying purposes. Furthermore, CSN does a great job in bringing the campus together; hosting many events throughout the year to create a sense of community. If I'm being the most honest, I wouldn't say there's many things that CSN should change to improve."
Freshman,5,"I have not started my year yet at CSN yet but seeing the help I have been getting and all my questions have been answered in a timely manner. I have been getting guidance on which classes to take to achieve my degree, and overall my experience has been good so far."
Freshman,5,My experience at College of Southern Nevada has been excellent. The college is constantly growing and the staff are super amazing. I have been able to grow my personally and be able to express who I am. Professors are super helpful and give great resources especially at this time.
Freshman,5,"What I love about CSN are the amazing professors they have. Every professor I've had has been very nice and understanding of every student's background. They take time out of their lecture to check-in with everyone to make sure their questions are answered and to see how the class is doing overall. Especially with the Coronavirus pandemic. My professors have been very accommodating to everyone's home/work situation, some are even giving extra credit to help their students grades improve. One thing that I would change about CSN, is having more clubs and events dedicated to People of Color. Living in Nevada, where there's not much diversity, it'd be great to learn about other people's cultures, beliefs, and values."
Freshman,4,"Administrators provide excellent resources to students interested in clubs, tutoring, and counseling."
Freshman,4,4-week classes are very difficult to complete with a full time job. 8-week classes are more of a moderate speed and more convenient than 16- week classes.
Sophomore,4,"I'm a returning student after over 20 years. CSN has made it possible for me to have a flexible schedule, educational resources and support to assist with overcoming the anxiety of if I would make it through."
Senior,4,"I have had to take a few online classes in college. Normally I prefer to take college classes in person as I feel it's a more fulfilling experience. The classes I have taken have ranged from okay to great. Sometimes, taking an online class creates a disconnect from the professor and student. This I do not enjoy. I preferred having an in person experience because I feel closer to my professor.  Even though, Professors at school most of the time do a good job to stay connected when online to the best of their ability. They make the guidelines of whats expected clear besides a few exceptions. If they are not clear I find I can mostly receive the clarification I need. I personally would rather take classes in person but in light of covid we have all been forced into the online platform. This has however, made it easier for me to work around my full-time work schedule. Being able to work and go to school is the biggest upside doing online school. This has taught me self-discipline."
Freshman,4,My online experience was very good. My professors do a good job of grading assignments quickly and updating grades and doing weekly announcements. There really good on if you have questions they are there to answer
Niche User,4,I cannot rate this part because i have not attended the school. I did hear that they have nice professors and work is mainly on the work you are dedicated to work on.
Freshman,4,My experience as a new student at CSN was pleasing. I decide to enroll at CSN during the Covid-19 pandemic. I felt the school did a very good job on adapting and having online resources for existing and new students.
Freshman,4,I took online classes Summer term of 2020. It was very user friendly and was always able to get a hold of someone if I had any questions.
Freshman,4,All but one professor was ready and organized for the online experience. There is a variance on what platforms are used online.
Freshman,4,"So far all of the professors have been very willing to adapt to exclusive online learning, and they have been kind. However, their website and registration is sort of convoluted at first and takes a while to get used to."
Freshman,4,I am a new student and the staff has been very helpful. They have different options to learn which is useful especially in the current pandemic.
Senior,4,"love this school. only problem i had, ever, was with a couple of the advisors. they were unaware of classes that were going during the summer and told me to take the teas test years before i needed to."
Senior,4,there will be the odd bad teacher at any school. but i would say 90% of my teachers have been good. the new teachers are usually the ones who are hard to get used to their teaching style. especially if they are from the east coast and or different countries.
Sophomore,4,Professors are pretty flexible and managed the transition from in person to online due to COVID pretty well.
Sophomore,4,"Flexibility. Could use a little more infrastructure but overall, it’s been a pretty good experience so far."
Niche User,4,My experience with the online programs at CSN was good. I was able to get a lot done while working a full time job.
Niche User,4,I am currently dual enrolled in the college of southern Nevada. I am a senior in high school and their program has been very compliant with my schedule. My brother is also enrolled there and he is doing amazing as well.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed CSN! The tuition is very reasonable and you get a very intimate learning experiences as many individuals opt for UNLV instead. Class sizes are small, which promotes the ability to really engage in class and the professor are really knowledgeable. All in all, I've loved my time here!"
Niche User,4,Taking online classes was the best that it could be. My professors still managed to make the lessons as entertaining as it would be in a real classroom. They made assignments clear and answered questions easily when I needed help with something in the class.
Niche User,4,The environment made me feel safe and know that I can get support from anywhere. People are nice and friendly when getting lost or needing information about the school.
Sophomore,4,"For the most part the Professors and staff are absolutely amazing. They go beyond just their job to make sure the students get what they need and want. (having our cake and eating it too!) They listen to our questions, concerns, problems, and always try to find a solution that fits best for the students. These guys really go beyond the office hours and try to see everyone as human rather than just an educator and student dynamic. Your always going to have some bad apples in the bunch but even so, students have an outlet to voice their concerns about those bad apples, and they are dealt with accordingly"
Niche User,4,I love CSN. The professors are all very hardworking and determined to teach their students the required material and more.
Junior,4,"The class schedule is very versatile along with three campus options, was crucial for me as I was working full time."
Junior,4,My experience at the College of Southern Nevada was amazing ! The professors at this school are very knowledgeable and they try their best to help out their students when in need. They have a wide variety of class times ranging from morning to evenings. This makes it very flexible for students who work or even those students who are parents and are looking to return to school ! I found myself taking morning classes and working afternoons some semesters so it worked out wonderfully.
Alum,4,"They were able to switch over to online very quickly. They had live lectures, recorded lectures, and even online labs. All of my Professors were very supportive when we had to switch to online learning because of the Corona Virus. Depending on your Professor the learning might be self-paced or have extended deadlines."
Alum,4,The Coyote Pantry is where students can go to get a large bag of food and hygiene supplies twice a week. The majority of Professors are very nice and supportive.
Niche User,4,College of Southern Nevada offers a lot of opportunity to advance one's education with cheap yet good classes.
Niche User,4,Classes online were easier than in person. Professors were good about providing study material and clear deadlines.
Sophomore,4,"I was impressed that online school was very accessible and easy to use. I did communications online but thanks to a supportive environment creating a video as a requirement with 10 students made it that much easier to complete a required course and also to engage with students who were scared or nervous to speak in front of a class or professor. Submiting the videos I never felt judged by my professor. Alex is also another great program for any math. It explains your errors and works well with the speed of each student learning skills. When taking the pre-exam it reached my level so each student had the advantage to start at the level they need help with and excel from there. Overall I would have taken more online classes but, I prefer the physical school setting and it’s interactions with a diverse population."
Alum,4,"It is an organized, friendly institution. The staffs and professors are welcoming and helpful. They also have great tutors and supplemental instruction leaders for specific classes to assist students in succeeding in their courses."
Alum,4,"Things work remotely could be quite challenging; however, the College of Southern Nevada provides embedded tutors for some classes and make the online learning environment more assessable, friendly."
Freshman,4,Due to Covid-19 all the on campus classes I took had to which over to online. The professors made sure we students were able to reach them when ever we had a question about an assignment or due date.
Freshman,4,"The college is great and so diverse, there isn't anything I would really change about it another than how expanse the books are. Even the used ones were $60-80 dollars. We pay an arm and a leg to attend classes and then some, I believe books should cost less for students."
Sophomore,4,"I usually would rather take in person classes mostly because I'm a better learning hands on and where its easy to go over questions and talk to other students but because of Covid-19 I ended the last semester online and it was not bad. Professors did everything they could to make it like we were in class on a normal day. Description for assignments and schooling was neat, and help was very much given to the extent by the school. They still tried holding tutoring and student help as much as they could provide. Its a good thing when you have a tight schedule for something like work or a family too because you don't have to leave or come in."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at the College of Southern Nevada has been fairly decent. Having attended both the Charleston campus and the Cheyenne campus both are what you'd expect from community colleges. They have a distinctly high school feel that wasn't unwelcome, however, but the services provided are very much college level. The campuses have always been as clean as could be on the days I visit, with the same going for the restrooms and lounge areas. There are plenty of resources that can be enjoyed and utilized by students, such as computer labs, tutoring, libraries, the recently constructed student unions, and more. The greatest and most glaring issues I have are in the mixed variety of professors found on campus and online. There are professors there that care about what they say and do, and others that slack off and only care for their pay, not for the education of their students. That and finding classes that aren't already full is a pain, but overall I would still recommend CSN to most."
Sophomore,4,I have taken about 5 classes online here at CSN and I've loved being in every single one of them. The instructors are very interactive with you such as giving feedback on work to improve your education. If you email them for help 9 times out of 10 they are willing to help you succeed in their class. It feels like I'm learning in the in class room environment.
Freshman,4,Online was a very clean and easy transition for me as the professors made the tasks very easy for us. I was very impressed how well they were prepared for the pandemic going on.
Junior,4,It was hard at first but my teachers used Canvas conference to see us on camera which was very helpful
Junior,4,"I love my teachers and small class size, and I think they did an amazing job switching to online during a pandemic"
Freshman,4,"I never took an online class just yet, but I will this semester. I hope that it will be a great learning experience for me."
Junior,4,"I took some hybrid courses that had online coursework. I found these more difficult than in person learning as, there is less motivation, and the learning environment is different from that in a home. Although the work was more or less straight forward and easy to follow on your own. There was however the issue of extra help from the professor/instructor being unavailable to you immediately. As you’d have to email or set a meeting to get help."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great school overall. A majority of the instructors are very helpful, caring and actually know what they are doing. There is definitely a sense of community at any CSN campus. However, sometimes it feels as though there is a lack of resources for students entering into the workforce or that the necessary help and information is difficult to obtain."
Sophomore,4,I definitely recommend online classes at CSN. The professors I have had online are very attentive and go the extra mile to help their students understand the concepts without being there in person. They are good to stay in contact most of the time. Some use an alternative learning software which I do not particularly like but it can be helpful.
Junior,4,College Of Southern Nevada is one of the best community colleges I would recommend going there if you choose to go to college doesn't even feel like a community college the way college of southern Nevada is make you feel like your at a university it's cheap and profitable and you will meet the best professors and get your money worth.
Junior,4,The college has 3 accessible campuses in Southern Nevada. Faculty are very knowledgeable in their respective fields. The administrative staff is very accomodating and helpful. Tuition and other fees are very affordable.
Freshman,4,Its a very good experience going to school at CSN its a very good compact college and very fun to go to its not hard to find parking and other essentials. There are many areas around the school that students can hang out and do there study's i highly recommended CSN!
Niche User,4,I liked that I was able to find classes easily on their website and there were a lot of them to choose from in case one didn't align with my schedule. I also appreciated the student help center. I was able to go there many times to get help with an essay that needed improvement.
Freshman,4,I have had a good experience with CSN. I feel like some professors are very inspiring and that makes classes exciting. I also love the help through tutors and advisors on anything you need. There is definitely a lot of support for you to succeed.
Sophomore,4,So far my experience at CSN has been great. My professors are great at their jobs and are always willing to make classes fun and enjoyable. I don't feel as though I've struggled much because I know there's help when I need it. Students are friendly and willing to work others. I like the smaller and more personal feel than that of a university. Overall I am extremely satisfied with my time at CSN.
Freshman,4,CSN has provided me an affordable opportunity to earn my AA and then transfer to a more reputable university to earn my BA.
Freshman,4,"Being a college student in my first year, I found it a bit difficult getting ready for the semester to start without much support. CSN was able to help me sort out my financial aid and even gave some good financial advice."
Junior,4,"The College of Southern Nevada (CSN) is a public community college in Clark County, Nevada. The college has more than 2,500 teaching and nonteaching staff and is the largest public college or university in Nevada. It is part of the Nevada System of Higher Education. College of Southern Nevada has three main campuses in the Las Vegas Valley: the Charleston Campus, North Las Vegas Campus and Henderson Campus. There are also eight learning centers: Moapa Valley, Summerlin, Mesquite, Green Valley, Western, Sahara West, Las Vegas City Hall and Nellis Air Force Base."
Alum,4,"CSN was a pretty interesting school! There were three different campuses, which I thought was awesome because you got to experience all different things for example at the Charleston campus that campus was huge compared to the others so it kind of reminded me like a university it had many different events so that was the main campus. The only thing that made it difficult was when they kept changing the requirements for the degree I was trying to go for, which was nursing."
Freshman,4,There are many online classes that help me with my schedule a lot. The credits were easy to transfer from other colleges I went to too.
Freshman,4,"It was nice to choose the classes you would like to take. Whether it was in class, hybrid, or online, the student got to choose."
Freshman,4,When needing help trying to find classes for you major isn’t really no help from Academic advisers but good school plenty of space in classroom for stupid good school for students who aren’t fortunate To afford bigger colleges such as unlv
Sophomore,4,"My experience here has been pretty good. They have some good professors and some bad just like any college, but the good does outweigh the bad."
Freshman,4,I have experience nothing but good at this school. This school has wonderful professors that care about my well being and my knowledge and there are many opportunities to take to learn more and more. There are computer labs that are open to students and it is just amazing.
Niche User,4,I like how easy everything is to figure out. The website was very easy to navigate and signing up and applying was very easy. The application process was very fast and not hard to figure out. I like all the options that are available for classes and academics.
Sophomore,4,"Overall I enjoy College of Southern Nevada because the atmosphere they provide is welcoming, one thing I think that could be changed is the counselors because the Henderson location doesn't have enough and I have to book so far out in advance to see a counselor."
Niche User,2,"They have you pick your classes, which could lead to taking the wrong ones or, taking them in the wrong order. The counselor was rude and unhelpful."
Freshman,2,Your pretty much on your own until you get into class. The administration staff is horrible and not helpful at all. Enrolling and all that is tough to figure out on your own. The teachers and classes are fine but the rest of everything sucks.
Junior,2,"The Admissions office is student ran with barely any management. The electronic login for the line queues is helpful and overall the teachers are not terrible, but once enrollment in classes begin good luck finding the classes you need to meet your schedule. It's overpopulated with students."
College Sophomore,2,One had one class. It was not my favorite
College Sophomore,2,Some teachers are not good.  Not very many courses offered
College Sophomore,2,There are not enough career prospects here. It's very selective and small.
College Junior,2,I believe that it has been bad for the reason being that I don't feel like I'm being helped the way that I should.
College Senior,2,"No internships available, and people keep to themselves. It's also hard to get a meeting with a counselor, I've been here for 2 years and it's a hassle to even ask one simple question to them."
College Senior,2,"It feels like busy work, because you don't get that human interaction. I feel like online classes are meant for students who work full time, or people who are too busy to be in a classroom. Other than that, if a student has time to meet in person, they should take it because it helps retain the information taught."
College Junior,2,"The online classes are not the best. I prefer on-campus over any of the online classes I've taken. Two of the three online classes were actually pretty good, however my english class online was a total nightmare. For starters, the instructor was disorganized and did not communicate well online. The instructor would not write the instructions clearly, and would mark all of my assignments in the 90-100% range. So with the impression that I was doing fine, I was actually at risk of failing without even knowing; until I received a phone call on my birthday not from the instructor, but from the administration. The teacher never once tried to contact me. I had to try and contact her via email, and after a long wait her response was limited at best."
College Freshman,2,I haven't taken many online classes but I did not enjoy the ones I did take. I didn't like that I couldn't talk to a teacher and it was too difficult to really figure out the website
College Freshman,2,I haven't experienced or seen any of this
College Senior,2,I have not found these services to help.
College Sophomore,2,There are not proactive w/students
College Sophomore,2,There is no relationship between teacher and students. Hard to learn.
College Sophomore,2,I don't think there are any post grad services.
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid department is always busy.   It's often difficult to get an actual person on the telephone, which is my primary option because I have a part time job and am unable to wait in long lines."
College Freshman,2,"when i trensferred my credits, they did not go through when they were said to, i had to do all new placemnet tests and many other things to get my classes, that process took so long, i had many classes at different locations that i did not like"
College Senior,2,"Convenient is not the right word to describe CSN's Henderson campus. It is near impossible to schedule an appointment with an advisor/counselor, it is very hard to get classes that I need, let alone want. All-in-all avoid the Registrar/ Financial Aid Office as much as possible since they treat you as a number and are not very helpful or willing to help. I am currently in the process of transferring credits so I am not sure how that experience will pan out yet."
College Senior,2,I go to CSN at the Henderson Campus. There are no athletic centers so I cannot really rate on that aspect but the library has very few books that relate to the classes there. The majority of the books that I need I have to go to the Charleston campus for and the Henderson has very little campus activities that I am aware of.
College Junior,2,Online courses at my school are not very good
College Sophomore,2,"I have not taken online classes due to the fact the students I have talked to about them give them really bad reviews. The students have said things like the teachers that are teaching the online classes are hard to get a hold of, do not help adequately and, make it hard to complete the classes."
College Junior,2,My financial aid hasn't came in and i don't understand why
College Junior,2,I have not yet received any financial aid because there was a problem with my parents' tax return and I think it is irrelevant.
College Senior,2,There are no recruiting trips or internships to say the least.
College Freshman,2,"The gym here sucks! The computer lab is okay. I never really heard of an athletic center. This school is more like you go toschool, study, go to work, and go home to sleep. No fun. Then re-do that all over again.  Plus stress!"
College Sophomore,2,There's pretty much nothing to do on campus other than a limited amount of clubs. Basically you go in and out of classes.
College Sophomore,2,CSN has been having a lot of trouble with their financial aid delivery these past few semesters. They have also been discussing an increase of tuition.
College Sophomore,2,"The campuses are incredibly far from each other, and there are not many activity centers at all."
College Freshman,2,"My major is Creative Writing, and I don't have the slightest clue as to what my next steps should be after English 101. Top it off, without investigating, I don't even know who I should talk to about that. Not even sure about who my counselor is."
College Freshman,2,"I say it's bad because there is a major lack of athletics, and by major I mean none. CSN seems to have too many students to not have more athletics for its' students! Sure there is a baseball team, or was... wait, do we even have that anymore?"
College Sophomore,2,"They don't have the specific Physical Therapy classes for my major which is Physical Therapy. I have to take classes that will help me with my major and get degress, but the class on the major itself is not available."
College Senior,2,"The financial aid department is difficult to deal with, as most of the staff are young adults adults or students who do not have a lot of experience. I've also run into problems due to their mistakes, which took 12 weeks to correct."
College Sophomore,2,I am not a fan of online classes. I don't feel like I get all of questions answered on the spot like I would in a regular class.
College Senior,2,"no athletic activities, we don't excel in that department"
College Senior,2,"many classes just sell out, or are limited in availability, it has been getting much more difficult to find classes to fit ones schedule"
College Junior,2,"We have a Wireless connection that students can all connect to and it is awful! It is extremely slow and you have to log in every single time you turn your device on. It makes it difficult to do class work when your internet connection is slower than molasses. Also, the copy machines are broken and don't work great at all. One time I needed to make copies and every copy machine in the library was not working. "
College Sophomore,2,"We have a lot of free study help, like tutoring hours and professors are always willing to help you out during scheduled office hours.  Our student center is partially staffed with students which makes for employees who don't always know what they are doing. The lines for registrar and financial aid center are sometimes very long."
College Senior,2,"When I had online courses, it offered no challenge or interaction between the other students and myself. I also felt like I did not learn as much as I do in a lecture. "
College Senior,2,My school doesn't offer any alumni network or job prospects. 
College Senior,2,The education I'm getting is worth the money I have paid but financial aid did not help me with any grants for my Mom is a nurse. 
College Sophomore,2,"It isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either, I'm sure"
College Sophomore,2,I don't really use any of them except for the cafe sometimes.  The computer lab is VERY large and very quiet.  The cafe has good food.
College Sophomore,2,I'd say the school is about average.  Everything is do it yourself though.  If you need to talk to someone you have to find them yourself and hope that they are even the right person.  When applying for the school they gave me very broad instructions so it was difficult to figure it out with out being over charged or charged for something I didn't mean to click on.  And they don't really inform you of anything.  It's almost like the honor system.  You just have to trust that they actually WILL take care of it.
College Sophomore,2,CSN has no real resources other than the library for students. other than the basics there is no extra resources.
College Senior,2,"CSN is a typical community college.  It does not appear the staff really cares about the students but there to perform job duties.  As a 40+ year old adult who returned to school after 20 years, I would have felt better about returning to school if the I felt the staff really cared.  Although I have to take out school loans to pay for my education I was not discouraged by the lack of the staff concern which is a good thing because I may have decided that I did not want to return to school but I didn't."
College Senior,2,"In my opinion, I think all classes that are offered at this college should be transferable. That being said, why are there classes available that you can take for ""fun?"""
College Freshman,2,"I wish there was more communication between the students and professors. My professors rarely ask the class if they have any questions. I am impressed that they offer tutoring services. Since I did not fully understand the math assignment given to me, I scheduled an appointment and my tutor was very helpful. The class registration process was fairly simple. Everything was all done online so I was able to easily maneuver through the website and add the classes I needed. My workload isn't too bad. There have definitely been nights where I was up late trying to finish work but it's not unbearable."
College Freshman,2,I don't like the financial aid system. I have a job and want to save money soil want get help with school so I can really better myself and push my self forward. I work very hard and for them to tell me I don't get any aid but then I find out the girl next to me in class that doesn't show up much with no job no responsibilities and no drive gets a big financial aid  check and really bothers me. I feel like with all my hard work I'm the one who deserves something
College Sophomore,2,"Its acceptable for a community college, but i feel its the professors who have their favorites that pushed me to that conclusion."
College Junior,2,"The academics are okay. I have had predominately good professors since I have been a student. It is such a small school, and pretty much all of the students are there to go to class and then go home. It seems to me that the students really care about school and their grades. I hated the online learning system they used called angel, this upcoming semester they are changing it to canvas. I can not wait, I feel like I learn a lot quicker and a lot more efficiently."
College Junior,2,"There are not very many resources on campus. I do make it a point to take advantage of the free tutoring though. The only thing I do not like about tutoring is that it is so hard to find a tutor, most of them are busy when you walk in and its almost impossible to get one on one time. We had a BBQ last semester and that was fun, but not very many students take advantage of the campus activities, and in return they turn out to be not a lot of fun. The campus is still sort of old, but you can see slowly but surely the campus is being renovated."
College Sophomore,2,It REALLY DEPENDS on the individual professor...i had a few that did everything possible for their students and others that were really inflexible.
College Junior,2,"government financial aid is great
no scholarships or grants available for nevada students
many hidden fees"
College Senior,2,"I attended CSN because I slacked off in high school and needed a new start. For the most part it was a good experience, class sizes and flexibility. I was able to schedule my classes around other activities in my life. But  I have recently had to take a year off due to their financial  aid process which is not up to pare. They processed my paper wrong causing me to be dropped from my classes for two semester. This is definitely a last resort school. I will be transferring as soon as I recieve enough credits to attended an actual university."
College Junior,2,"We have a lot of programs, but due to my age I feel out of place. I'm like 20 years older than most students. Their is not a lot of stuff offered for my age group."
College Freshman,2,Most of the professors are a joke. They don't check their notes but expect students to check grammar and spelling. They show no respect for their students and it's insulting how many of them do that.
College Senior,2,"There's three campuses that offer classes.  Not to mention all the tech centers and such.  The problem is there's some classes that aren't available at all the campuses.  

The guidance counsellors never know anything of use and every time you ask them for help they always say we don't deal with that probem, you have to go to this department or that department.  

If you call the number to have a question answered you have a merry-go-round of a automated system which more often than not just tells you to talk to a counsellor in person anyway."
College Junior,2,"Being an Earth Science major, I very rarely interact with anyone of the same interest. Most students in attendance seem to be culinary, gaming or biology majors. Smaller science fields are very much a minority at CSN. With that, there is not really a prominent earth science department. The science faculty is very open and helpful, but they don't really cater to any specific sciences."
College Senior,2,"Even though most of the teachers do no teacher me what I would like to learn from what I have heard from other graphic design students, I always take something away from their course, either it be group projects or a certain lesson they taught that meant something to me."
Freshman,1,Absolutely a terrible school. Very unorganized. I can never get a hold of faculty members or professors. Professors are very condescending.
Freshman,1,Absolutely a terrible school. Very unorganized. I can never get a hold of faculty members or professors. Professors are very condescending.
College Junior,1,I've been needing a lot of help being able to plan out my degree but haven't had any help or felt any progress.
College Junior,1,Getting financial aid is horrible! The financial aid department is practically run by students and they won't even let me talk to some one in charge.
College Junior,1,"They don't seem to offer career services, that I know of."
College Student,1,Im not a fan of the online courses i cant learn from them at all!
College Sophomore,1,"you are on your own after you graduate or transfer out of the school, from what I have been told."
College Freshman,1,"Network always having problems, computer lab always full"
College Junior,1,"classes canceled for lack of enrollment
odd times for classes
more campuses needed"
College Junior,1,"difficult to get classes needed to take higher level classes
wait list for many programs"
College Sophomore,1,"I had to drop my one online course because it was hard to figure out when assignments were due, instructions were not understandable, and if you got out of sync once, it blew the whole class."
Recent Alumnus,1,Almost non existent. I have never dealt with them. They do a bad job of marketing themselves if there is one.
College Senior,1,"The process at CSN is horrible. The process takes a long time for you to even find out if you are rewarded with the aid you applied for, then they process your paperwork wrong causing you to get dropped from classes. But I guess the cost you pay for the classes are reasonable. You can save a lot of money by taking your general core classes at CSN verses going to a university."
College Sophomore,1,"computer labs are always overcrowed, rarely a computer open,, the connection is terrible and could take up to ten min. just to sign in to your account. Printing in costly, ten cents a page."
College Sophomore,1,the students that are supposed to help with problems are not helpful. computers are very slow
College Sophomore,1,I've had no help on where to go as a psychology major-I'm lost!
College Senior,1,I gave my school that grade because through all the classes I attended I only had a handful of teachers that I would actually look forward to attending their class as well as precipitating.
College Sophomore,1,"I had trouble understanding anything about the fafsa. I filled it out for two schools, and I only got loan packages for a second choice school. Fafsa told me that my family was expected to contribute all of the costs, i didn't get a cent for CSN so I'm paying out of pocket."
College Junior,1,I don't feel I am getting enough financial help in Nevada. We are a state that lacks high rank in education standards for the United States. I think the state of Nevada needs more financial programs for students.
College Senior,1,"Not very reliable, and computers can be very, very slow."
College Senior,1,"Just forget it. If you want a unique school experience in Nevada, go to UNR."
College Senior,1,"Filled with people still stuck in their high school world. Best to keep to yourself if you don't want to get caught up in high school level drama at college. Oh, and overall speaking, the people who go there are not very bright, at all."
College Sophomore,1,"If you are paying for the tuition out of pocket, then the process is very smooth and would rate it around a B. The cost of tuition is also very reasonable for what you get, just make sure to check the price for class material. Why I gave CSN such a low grade is because of the financial aid center. There has been times where I nearly gave up on college because of the hassle I have to endure to get my pel grant and student loans. Advice would be to always go down every day to check the process, because you will not be notified till after  the the due date has long passed if there was a problem with your application."
College Junior,1,It is easy to register and ad/drop courses online. But the staff is miserable and credit transfers and anything else you ask them to do takes at least 10 weeks and include various steps for you to take.
College Junior,1,"Online classes, at least the 11 I've taken, are terribly organized. ANGEL is one of the most laughable school programs I'm yet to encounter. There are constant issues with the system and it is not compatible with Google Chrome. I absolutely hate online classes, but I keep getting sucked into them due to scheduling issues."
College Freshman,1,its alright . its just not fun at all. every class I have is a joke and the work we do is a joke. out of all four of my classes i only enjoy going to one . classes are very small and i like that .
College Senior,1,"Since the start of this semester, it has been problem after problem. And it seems like every year I'm here, something else comes up to slow down my educational speed. I have to call constantly and ask questions as to why things aren't happening in the manner they assured me it would."
College Sophomore,1,I don't like online classes. If you have a question there isn't anyone to ask usually and your teacher gets annoyed if you try to turn in stuff early. I like classroom classes much more.
College Senior,1,I have never received any kind of career services or education from any of my professors or supervisors.
College Sophomore,1,"The tuition  is incredibly reasonable, The education is worth every dime paid. Unfortunately, the staff running the financial aid and register department couldn't be less helpful. As a potential student walking through the doors of College of Southern Nevada be warned that you will be waiting in 3 different lines for 2.5 or more hours, with absolutely no guidance. Most staff members in the building are unwilling to assist. if you plan to attend this school, I highly recommend you go with someone who is currently enrolled and do all of your paperwork and research at home before walking into the building."
College Sophomore,1,"One Computer Lab? It can be hard to get a computer at the busy time of the day on campus due to the school only having one lab with about 50 computers. The school just increased the tuition rates, so why aren't the students seeing any improvements in computers or libraries?"
College Sophomore,1,"Since i turned 18, I moved out on my own. I do not qualify for any financial aid because my parents make too much money. How is that fair? i live alone, support myself, work a full-time job and go to school full-time for the last 5 years."
College Senior,1,Online Classes – Online classes are very different from traditional classes because in online classes it all relies on you. Youhave a certain deadline and I waited until the last minute and procastinated and that's why i ended up with a grade im not proud of and thats why i dont like them. you haveto learn to manage time areounf your class and to not PROCASTINATE.
College Sophomore,1,Financial aid office is not the best lots of issues. Grants never on time and they don't contact you if paperwork is needed. I had to wait 1month before I had my grant after class already started.
College Freshman,1,"One Big Hassle. This past semester, I was unable to apply for more than one online class because of multiple mistakes on the counselor's half. I had a schedule made, but due to person reasons, I had to drop the classes I had and switch to online. When the counselor wouldn't take the release off of my account, so I could register on my own, I missed multiple opportunities for classes. There are so many students that the classes were filled."
College Senior,1,"I don't believe there are any resources for post-grads, or if there are they aren't readily advertised or available."
College Senior,1,"They Just Don't Care – I don't feel that administration has the best intentions for the students. They don't encourage students to apply themselves academically, nor do they have any interest in those who want to create positive change within the institution. Trying to get a faculty member to commit to a student cause is a nightmare, and dealing with administration is an absolute nightmare!"
College Sophomore,1,"The State Needs to Stop Taking Away $$$$ – In Las Vegas, you either go to UNLV or CSN. Of course there College of Nevada, but you hardly hear anyone going to that and don't forget the trade schools. Anyways, the parking is horrible and most of the older staff members aren't very nice."
College Freshman,1,"Its a ""Come N Go"" School – Originally it was a community college, but then 2 years ago, they changed the name from ""Community College of Southern Nevada"" to ""College of Southern Nevada"". Honestly, i dont care how different you change the name of the school, it's still a community college. When your mom or dad or aunt goes to the same school as you, then yeah it's a community college. It's literally a school where you take classes then go home. Theres no games or school-wide activities."
College Junior,1,"Distance Education – I think that, generally the education is worth the tuition.  Increasing use of DE (Distance educ or online classes) in place of traditional classes lowers the value of the education."

Freshman,5,"This college has a lot of resources for low income students and offers a wide variety of programs and classes. Thereâ€™s very good energy whenever you set foot on campus. During this pandemic, they have done everything necessary to protect the students and staff. Glad to have experienced this."
Freshman,5,I think that the instructors really care about their students and want them to do well. I always feel comfortable reaching out and asking them for help. They offer great resources so that students don't feel like their alone in their academic journey.
Junior,5,"The online classes are flexible and the instructors give clear guidelines and due dates. The use of Canvas makes it easy to navigates what is due, and to check your grades."
Freshman,5,"When I was looking for college, TCC was my first and last choose. I liked going in TCC because the communities are full great people. Full of culture and diversity. You fill home the first time you attend TCC. I decided to be involve in college, I end up been president of club and senator."
Freshman,5,"Due to COVID-19, we had our spring quarter all online and TCC did an amazing job making it happen for all of the students. Canvas is very organized and it is easy to contact teachers and other students of the classes."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small class sizes. The music program is excellent. Dr. Lymann is amzing. I find professors are very approachable and always willing to help. Being a community college, TCC is very diverse. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate."
Niche User,5,I decided to do Running Start at Tacoma Community College and I can confidently say that I have no regrets whatsoever. The program at TCC is amazing for high school students like myself who find themselves wanting hands-on experience. I have a greater understanding of the world around me; the professors are eager to teach and help each and every student succeed.
Sophomore,5,"Overall I like this school. The buildings are easy to find on-campus if you need help with finding something; anyone is willing to help you whether it's a student or a staff member. The professors want you to learn and help you succeed. They give you many ways to study and learn the material if you need more help they were willing to work outside of office hours to do so; as well as giving you recommendations for tutors on campus that can also help you. 
One problem with this college that I would change is the food as it is not as great as it could be. I believe the college does try to produce the best food but they feed numerous people it's hard to do so. If I could make the food at school different, I would change it to healthy, tasty food with an assortment of types. With healthy tasting food, more people would take advantage of the food. Also, if the food tasted better and had healthier options, less food would be wasted."
Freshman,5,Tacoma Community College is very helpful with signing people up and I really love the campus life. The teachers are all very friendly and helpful. Choose Tacoma Community College for your next area of study.
Senior,5,This was unlike any schooling I've attended in the past. Three classes is considered a full load. If you use RateMyProfessor.com and speak with your councilor it becomes nearly impossible to fail. I am Currently finishing up my AA and am taking 2 polisci courses and a Shakespearean literature course but am easily able to maintain an A in all my courses. The faculty that I've encountered have really focused on the individual success of their students. There have been times in the past where I was unable to submit an assignment on time. Once I explained myself they were willing to accept it with only a small penalty. The campus is amazing and all the faculty are committed to the success of each individual student regardless of who they are.
Sophomore,5,I love the campus at Tacoma Community College. Overall the campus is always very clean and it's an amazing place to study especially outside there are a lot of places to sit. On top of the campus being clean it is extremely easy to find your way around even without a map.
Sophomore,5,"Tacoma is a great college for anyone looking to further their education, I have been to another community college through my college education and did not receive the same support and assistance the way I did with T.C.C, would highly recommend it."
Freshman,5,"It is a diverse school with the most helpful staff and teachers I have ever encountered.  The students are accepting of all types of people, and there are so many events and social things to attend- it is very easy to get involved."
Freshman,5,"There were a few ups and downs, but I love the campus and the student body are very easy to interact with. The math professors I have had so far have made the classes incredibly easy. My psychology professors are wonderful instructors and the English professors have given me many good reads and challenged me to do excel in my writing."
Junior,5,Tacoma Community College has a community. The students engage with each other and everyone is basically mutual friends with each other.
Freshman,5,The staff has been extremely helpful.  I have not been back to college in years and they were informative and patient.
Sophomore,5,"Tacoma Community College offered an amazing atmosphere with incredible above and beyond teaching. This campus promotes diversity like no other, along with acceptance and understanding.

There are amazing resources provided to its students and I would recommend this college for anyone."

Sophomore,5,It is a great place to go to if you live in the Tacoma area and are looking to go to a community college for two years.
Sophomore,5,"There are so many reasons to like about Tacoma Community college, first off the resources that TCC provides. The help from tutoring, not just in math or science, but also in writing, psychology and more.  Also these resources not only help inside, but also outside of school. They have help to find you job, a house, daycare and etc. I love how beautiful it goes during the each seasons. One thing I would improve on is the parking, There isn't enough parking in to morning, and sometimes you'll be late to class because your just trying to find parking."
Niche User,5,Small classes and a welcoming environment from both staff and students. Lots of academic resources available for students to use.
Sophomore,5,"Tacoma Community College is a excellent place where students can find a large diversity of ethnics, good teachers, and when students need help for a specific class. Also, this college is composed with some clubs and activities organized by Student Engagement Organization, which allow people to have fun during the quarter."
Niche User,5,"I love TCC my professor are amazing. They always go above and beyond to help. Glad I choose this school. You also have to work hard, be dedicated and attendance is everything."
Sophomore,5,"TCC is an awesome school, especially if you are a new or returning student. Student life at TCC is really great with events and activities held throughout the year. There is a lot of diversity amongst the students and professors which in my personal opinion, makes class discussions more of a learning experience. The only thing I would recommend TCC taking the time to fix would be the financial aid office only because they take a while to get back to you or different people will tell you different things. However, I have noticed this last quarter they have been much better about returning emails etc."
Senior,5,I love my Respiratory Therapy program. I feel confident that once I graduate it will be easy for me to get a job and I will have job security.I do however think the campus needs some serious updating. The cafeteria is horrid and they don't even have a coffee shop on campus.
Freshman,5,I would like to see more student involvement. I've found many are not willing to help others and have taken it upon myself to hold study sessions.
Freshman,5,Tacoma Community College is a great college to go to after high school. I haven't started yet but from what I've heard so far and from being on campus that this place is amazing
Alum,5,I really like how helpful everyone was at the college. The counseling office helped me map out the classes I needed and what it would take to transfer to a university. The teachers were great and cared about their students.
Freshman,5,"This college is always very helpful. I like the structure. Parking is terrible and financial aid office is not always that helpful, they never answer the phone or return phone calls."
Niche User,5,"I love Tacoma Community College. It is a small, local, and friendly college that has given me a change to earn college credit through the running start program. I thoroughly enjoy attending the school because of its friendly staff and its good-natured students. The only thing I would change is the bad rep it can sometimes get because everything about it is amazing!!!"
Freshman,5,"I have been here since last year and I really enjoy this community college. In here, I have been making a lot of friends so far and from them, I learn a lot of things that I have never known before. My major is Computer Science and I know that TCC is the best place for that major, especially after I graduated, Washington State is the good place for my Major. so I'm loving it"
Sophomore,5,I love going to school here.  By far the best experience of my life. Classmates are awesome the teacher are great.  I am able to study and be in a safe place.  I sometimes find parking tough but thats any college.  I love my classes and my program is amazing.
Freshman,5,TCC is excellent! There are plenty of resources to educate yourself or get help with your assignments. It is such a diverse school and there's so many opportunities for scholarships and financial rewards.
Freshman,5,"This College is amazing. I know a lot of people bash on a community college, but college stands against any other technical or elite school. The students that attend their are focused on their studies and completing degrees for a career. The faculty is very helpful and gives you all the information you need to succeed. Great school, great experience, top notch."
Sophomore,5,I like the teachers and the environment. Quiet and beautiful. It is a diversity college. TCC offers night courses and nice online classes which make convenience for students who are from different age group and flexible for thiir work time.
Sophomore,5,"I was a running start student through my high school at TCC, but I found it to be very fun and interesting. The professors really care about getting you to learn and getting you to pass. The campus is very nice and class sizes are small which is a plus. My biggest lecture was only about 50 people and the lab was 25 which was very nice because it allowed students to be a lot closer to the professors."
Junior,5,"The professors are knowledgeable and find different ways to teach a concept. I like that the campus is small, well kept, and has a modern style."
Freshman,5,"It's my first quarter at TCC and as an older student who is returning to college after a long hiatus, everyone has been very helpful in guiding me through all the processes and answering the millions of questions I've had. I'm very impressed by every department and staff member with whom I have interacted. Professional, friendly, and supportive."
Sophomore,5,"I liked Tacoma Community College because of the people I've had the chance to meet. A lot of my classmates and teachers have assisted me with achieving my academic goals by offering me plenty of advice. I've been able to form a study group with a new set of people during most quarters, and everyone here seems to have some story to share. The college hands out a lot of food during the beginning and end of the quarters as well.

I won't say that everything about my experience here was positive. I was given a ticket for not purchasing  a new parking pass for the school year, so I moved my car to a parking lot closer to where I could purchase one from the cashier's office. I come back to find I was fined for the same reason, in the same hour. I explain this to security and fill out a waiver. Not only was my request to have my second fine waived declined, but the second ticket cost double the first ticket."
Freshman,5,"I've found that Tacoma CC is very easy to navigate and help is always available. There are a ton of resources available to students for advising, extra study help, and life outside of the classroom."
Junior,5,"Tacoma Community College is a great college. They go above and beyond everyday to make learning easy and to help you reach your goals. The professors and more than amazing, and the institution itself is immaculate."

At TCC there is a very welcoming climate, I got to know a lot of people my age and even a little older.  I have attended both morning and afternoon and now evening  classes. I feel very safe on campus.  I have truly enjoyed my first year at TCC."
Sophomore,5,"This college has fantastic resources to help any student succeed such as free tutoring in all subjects, dedicated faculty and staff, plenty of computer access, and a vibrant student life department."
Sophomore,5,"This is the best community college in the area. They offer a great array of classes, and have great advisers to help keep you on course for your degree. They also offer great programs like running start that helps high school kids graduate with college credit, even an associates degree!"
College Freshman,5,The classes at TCC that I have completed have been well taught by wonderful professors. I have made great student-teacher relationships and I feel as if the professors at TCC actually care about the success of their students.
College Freshman,5,"I'm getting my AAS then trying to get in the radiology program. There is a lot of homework but I love every aspect of college. TCC has an amazing campus, it's such a beautiful school."
College Freshman,5,I love Tacoma Community College. The teachers there are great and help you with any questions one might have. I love learning my only regret is that I didn't go earlier but better late then never.
College Student,5,This school is very flexible with times of classes. I also work and have a family at home. Ive never had any trouble with working around everything.
College Sophomore,5,"They have an understanding that life happens, but they don't want you to give up on your goal. They help you any way they can. They go out of their way just to help the little man and not just the well known man. You are not invisible in their eyes you count as a person and that is exactly how they treat. Plus they make it fun learn. You learn something new everyday."
College Senior,5,I did have to transfer credits and they transferred 100%! I have taken both in class and online classes in order to fit around my schedule and it has worked great!
College Senior,5,"Online classes are great! They allow you to accomplish school at the convenience of your own time! I took online classes when I had to pick up more hours at work. My experience with online classes is they show you what they want from you, and you can set aside enough time to finish those assignments before they are do. It is nice not having to go to class at a certain time everyday."
College Senior,5,"To be a psych major at TCC, it is a great experience! The students I have in my classes are in almost all my classes with me each quarter. The teachers have never been so involved and seem to really love what they do. Having such great teachers makes coming to school so much easier. Since I learn so much during class time, my study time at home is very low. I learn pretty much everything I need to know at school and am able to carry on my everyday life afterwards without having to stress to much. Starting in fall when I move to a University, I will get to intern with CPS. The Social work program is really hands on and I couldn't be more excited!"
College Freshman,5,Classes are very hands-on and the instructors are great at explaining the material.
College Freshman,5,The professors are awesome! They are there to help and want you to succeed.
College Freshman,5,"Tacoma Community College offers classes online, in the morning, at night, on the weekends, aw well as having web enhanced and hybrid classes. There is really a class for any schedule."

College Freshman,5,"This school puts us into the workforce before graduation. having hands on experience, as well as contacts will give me an excellent oppertunity to obtain employment after school."
College Junior,5,The teachers I have had have been great and I love this school.
College Junior,5,I have had a great experience at this college.
Freshman,4,"Tacoma Community College has very nice staff , they always help you with the things you need. They answer the questions you have and email you personally if you have any trouble with anything."
Graduate Student,4,People are very nice but some Professors have problems with their teaching methods to give students opportunities.
Niche User,4,With COVID-19 happening right now a lot of professors are accommodating with deadlines and schedules as long as you communicate with them.
Niche User,4,"Even though the thought of community college can be a bit off-putting sometimes, or not seem as good as a regular university, this school is still a valid option for those wanting to obtain their AA or AS to help with cutting tuition cost in the future."
Freshman,4,"My personal experience was a little rough because I am a physical learner, but I had very nice teachers that helped Me along the way."
Junior,4,"As a college student that was nervous returning to college, TCC made it simple and the staff was very supportive. The instructors are top notch and the students are amazing to work with."
Freshman,4,"First time be a online student. The experience was pretty much wonderful, and good too know how he fill like to be online student."
Freshman,4,They are doing their best to assist everyone and keep classes going while also dealing with the current pandemic. Keeps everyone up to date about the current events as they come.
Freshman,4,I liked all of my professors because they were all very informative and helpful. They want nothing but the best for their students and do all they can to help them. I felt very safe on campus and they had many areas where you can study efficiently.
Freshman,4,"Wonderful administrative staff at this college. They really care about the safety of their students. In my experience, most of the teachers are top notch. It is a very ethnically diverse school, which is great. It would be even greater if there was more political diversity."
Freshman,4,The students and professors are very accepting and professional. The professors love to help their students and are passionate about their jobs
Senior,4,"I attended Tacoma Community College as my college for Running Start. TCC is constantly providing events and resources for their students. TCC offers free tutoring, counseling, and more. The advisors are helpful, teachers are great, and there are tons of resources you can use to help with your educational experience."
Sophomore,4,Tacoma Community College has been a great school to go to. The majority of the professors really care and want to see you succeed. I would like to see more events going on to get people together.
Junior,4,"What I liked about Tacoma Community college is first itâ€™s big campus. Thereâ€™s a variety of classes I can take, And many building locations so students arenâ€™t crowded up in one hall or building. Also, the resources are very helpful, such as the writing and tutoring center. That is where you can make an appointment with an individual who knows a certain subject who helps you with things you struggle with; it part of your tuition so It is beneficial to use it since you already paid for it. Lastly, the campus is always clean, neat, and has green grass."
Sophomore,4,"This Community College is worth trying over an expensive University. Most of the teachers are great, some are really bad. The financial aid office is horribly rude and non-responsive."
Niche User,4,I've taken classes here mainly for prerequisites for my major at another school. People are nice overall though it just felt a little disconnected for me because I wasn't taking courses for years in a row with the same class of students.
Freshman,4,"This is a great school for those who plan on transferring to a 4 year university. It is fairly affordable, the staff is supportive, and the campus is compact/ easy to navigate. However, some of the teachers are subpar. I HIGHLY suggest using rate my professor to choose who you sign up for. The teachers either make or break the experience. Another thing I've noticed is most people are reserved. If you want to make friends join a club or sport."
Sophomore,4,"I have going to this school for about three years. They are very helpful when it comes to you getting help as far as classes, aid, tutoring etc. They also help with transportation with either the bus or gas. I truly love this school and I would recommend it to any and every one."
Freshman,4,"I've just finished my first quarter and am a Running Start student. From my perspective, it's not much harder than AP classes taken at the high school level."
Niche User,4,"The Tacoma Community College has a very strong science department, but their English department is very unsatisfactory.  Being a science major, this has not affected me strongly, as I have learned a lot in their biology and chemistry classes, but the required English courses I took were difficult, boring, and unorganized."
Freshman,4,So far I have loved attending Tacoma Community College (TCC). I like how in contact my teachers are and how in contact my advisor is. The one thing I would change is more variety in the evening classes for us working adults as it is difficult to work around a full time work schedule.
Senior,4,"I was a Running Start student here for two years, and I loved the campus.  Finding classes that fit my schedule was relatively easy, and the other students on the campus were very helpful as well.  Many of the classes are ten minutes apart, and the campus is not too big to the point where you can not get from one end of the campus to the other.  The staff and security are friendly as well, and the campus throws fun events for the students to enjoy throughout the year.  The welcoming committee is very friendly as well."
Sophomore,4,They offer a wide range of classes in the evenings so people that work like myself are able to continue their education.
Freshman,4,I love the campus and all of my classes have been enjoyable and within my academic capacity! The professors were all great and attentive. I have learned about many different subjects while at TCC. The campus is big and beautiful. Some of the newer buildings are so intriguing and incredible to take classes in.
Junior,4,TCC is a great stepping stone for a transfer degree. Although I would recommend packing a lunch. They no longer have an campus staffed cafeteria. Think of their current one more like a mini mart with some salad options.
Sophomore,4,My overall experience at TCC was very good. The professors are knowledgeable about their respective subjects. They all really want you to succeed. The tutoring centers are very helpful.
Freshman,4,"Although it is a very small school, the campus has a very refreshing vibe to it. Considering that we're in the state of Washington you get the smell of freshly dewed trees after a morning cloudburst."
Senior,4,"I have been attending Tacoma Community College for four years now. I've seen many professors, councilors and students. Most students at Tacoma Community College are very diverse and friendly."
Sophomore,4,The faculty is very nice and accommodating. Lots of diversity at the school with people ranging from high school age all the way up into older adulthood. Most of the teachers are very good at what they do and are passionate about helping others. They have office hours where you can go in and get extra help if needed. There are plenty of resources for you to get help as well if you need it. There is a math and writing tutoring center and many other resources as well.
Sophomore,4,"I have been able to complete my two year degree in 1 1/2 year. Teachers are credible, and provided a positive environment."
Sophomore,4,I am part of the running start program and it has been a very good program for me. All the professors and staff are very helpful.
Freshman,4,"Tacoma Community College is very diverse. The campus is nice and always clean. All students are respectful and have not witness any negative activity in the campus. I really like that there are Emergency Buttons which I am glad they have near every building for the safety of students. The Professors are great, they seem very passionate about their jobs and it reflects onto their teaching. The food is average, nothing special about it. But there is a food truck that sells great burgers outside of the cafeteria."
Niche User,4,"I have been enrolled in the Nursing program at TCC. I have enjoyed the classes and my teachers. There are few bumps due to a new curriculum, but you will see that at any college when something new is being put into action. Overall, I've been satisfied."
Senior,4,"In general, I love TCC. I love the campus, most of the events, most of culture, and a lot of the teachers. Bad teachers exist, sure, but thanks to places like RateMyProfessor, it's easy to find good ones, and there are a ton of them who have a real passion for what they do and are great at showing us their passion through their teaching. The culture is pretty diverse, people of many different groups and cultural backgrounds coming together. A lot of the students are pretty nice and friendly there, and in general, it creates a really nice atmosphere. The campus is also beautiful for a community college, the environment being very green, almost as if it were built with the environment in mind. It's a wonderful place, and I'll definitely miss it when I move on."
Niche User,4,What I love about TCC was that all Faculty members were so kind and helpful. Very knowledgeable and they push you to succeed in life.
Senior,4,"Pro: There are nice professors.
Good library.
Con: food options. Selling more healthy food would be grate."
Freshman,4,Tacoma community college is really one of the better community colleges in our state. They have a really great exchange program and alot of clubs  to be with. Not including the staff and teachers are all very friendly and supportive. The value of the cost of college isn't bad either I think anyone starting out this would be a great college for you.
Sophomore,4,Tacoma Community College was my first college environment. It is a very mature environment full of students just like you. They all want to be successful and the professors and advisers will help you with that. It's also a very diverse school with foreign students.
Sophomore,4,"Tacoma Community College has been a great place to begin my college career. The helpful staff have helped me to figure out my major, and the passionate professors have taught me more than I thought possible. The newer buildings are really great, but the more outdated buildings do have their issues. I would like to see parking on campus improved, as well as the clubs, activities, and variety of food offered."
Junior,4,I really enjoy the students and faculty. All the buildings are up to date and resources are clear and easy to find.
Senior,4,"The only reason I took off a star was because the financial aid office is the most unorganized chaotic school office I have ever been in contact with. Otherwise, the professors are extremely nice and supportive. "
College Junior,4,Studying Nursing is good choice at Tacoma Community College
College Freshman,4,"So far, everything I have learned is applicable to the real world. I look forward to continuing further into my journey to really dive into major specific courses."
College Freshman,4,I have been at TCC for a year now and have been overall pleased with my experience with this school. There is a wide variety of teachers with many different approaches. The only complaint I have thus far is how long the school takes to process financial aid applications. I waited 3 semesters before someone contact me about my qualifications regardless of how many times I tried reaching out to the financial aid office.
College Senior,4,"There are many different types of professors and teaching styles used that may be helpful to you to add on to your experience in such areas. The class sizes are usually 20-35 people and most students are very interactive and outgoing, as well as most of the professors are extremely passionate about their work and are flexible yet expect you to meet or go above and beyond what they ask of you."
College Senior,4,"If you really apply yourself, then you will learn everything you need to know. There are multiple opportunities given by TCC to expand your education."
College Senior,4,"This college was amazing for me. There is a good amount of diversity, passionate and approachable professors, someone always waiting to help guide you if needed, and tons of school functions and activities to get you more involved. I had never been to a more engaging college before this."
College Student,4,I view all my grades and coursework online it is fairly easy. The other students are very friendly we get together in a study group to work together. The teachers are helpful as well.
College Student,4,I'm currently in premed so I will be majoring in science and then transferring to a university.
College Student,4,There are so many courses offered here the class sizes I would say are about 20 to 25 students per class. Not all professors are great I had one teacher last quarter that was very unorganized and was not the greatest at teaching. but the rest have been really great
College Student,4,I am currently going to school for pre-med. This is only my second quarter so I'm still doing prerequisites. I am a fulltime student.
College Student,4,My school is a very good school they are one of the top community colleges where I am at. There is tutoring centers for free where you can go and get help with any subject in school. Majority of the teachers are very helpful and nice. There are a lot of programs of study. This school is very diverse.
College Junior,4,It is generally flexibil but there are some classes that are provided just one teacher and one class not as many.
College Junior,4,"I think the online classes are good teacher are keeping in touch with students, however there could b some teachers that do not communicate with all students to give updates and encourage them like other teachers are doing. They are just providing information about assignments and it is no connection with students, but online courses are good!"
College Junior,4,The Career Center is very helpful!
College Junior,4,"The career center is very helpful, and employers are nice. It will be better to include internships and more opportunities for different degree."
College Junior,4,Professors at this school are very nice and helpful at least the professors that I had. The quality of the courses are good and some of them are too intensive.
College Junior,4,"I like this school because I found that teachers are nice and the faculty staff are very helpful. In addition, the system- the college computer program called Canvas, that they are using is clear and not confusing to use."
College Sophomore,4,Tacoma college has high reviews for its paralegal program
College Senior,4,TCC's career center is very helpful. We get a lot of useful information about different work places at the center. The people who work there are very friendly and helpful. Our job prospects are very good. Some of the students already found jobs during their last year of studying.
College Senior,2,"What options, they are there, but you have to be an experienced student to know they exist."
Recent Alumnus,2,They are run by popularity
Recent Alumnus,2,They are disrespectful and rude.
Recent Alumnus,2,Always full so take longer to graduate
College Junior,2,a pain to get the courses you want when you need them
College Student,2,I would choose to go to another school if I could do it over again.
College Student,2,"The student body is fairly closed off. It's a community college, so most people quickly clique back up with people they hung out with in high school. There's not much socializing in classes however, and a good portion of students go to school, and then straight back home."
College Student,2,"I took off two quarters because I was told by my advisor, and two other people working in the Advising Center that I was on academic suspension. I come back after completing paperwork, having to reapply, and having a meeting/making a plan to better my studies, that I never had to take a quarter off in the first place. Completely disorganized."
College Freshman,2,At the career center i was told to just apply online through the website. Then online on the alumni job search site there are no local jobs.
College Senior,2,"Some of the professors aren't the best but most show good knowledge of the subject they teach. Also, the registration process can be very difficult, especially for transfers. I've heard about this from a friend who had difficulty transfering and eventually just gave up."
College Junior,2,"The class registration process is not fair, which caused a lot of international students can't get into the class they wanna take."
College Junior,2,I think the school don't really take art as an important thing.  We only have a tiny gallery.
College Junior,2,"The registration process is unnecessarily drawn out, and difficult at times."
College Junior,2,"If you had asked me this question a year ago I would have given them an A. However, since then, Tacoma Community College decided it would team up with a third-party company to dispense financial aid rewards through a credit card. While it sounded like it would make things easier, it hasn't."
College Sophomore,2,"From what I've heard from people, the online courses seem like a lot of hard work that could be avoided if you just took in-classroom classes. I don't have much experience with them myself, but I do have to do a lot of online homework and I know that gets frustrating, especially with my math class. It's hard because of how you have to answer questions and how sometimes the answers may vary or how the program decides on how it wants its answers rounded. For example, one time a lot of people in my class were having trouble trying to figure out how to round the answer to this one problem, it turns out the problem accepted a rounded decimal answer out to 5 places which we thought was odd. Online classes/homework would be better if you attended workshops for them, they do have flyers up for these workshops, but honestly if you aren't paying attention they're easy to miss. More help in figuring tings out would be nice."
College Junior,2,"While the cost is great for the classes. The financial aid process is a HUGE nightmare. No one was able to help me, or tell me what was wrong until it was too late. Then they simply told me ""oh well"" rather than telling me how to fix it. It seemed like I was fighting just to get my financial aid fixed to be told that I wouldn't receive anything."
College Senior,2,"Right now I am going through the financial aid suspension appeal process. Last spring my financial aid including student loans, ran out. The money I  received after tuition costs was half of the amount I had expected. This was what I used to buy books and supplies as well as pay living expenses like rent, utilities, transportation and so forth.
I made attempt to balance my stressful situation, but failed, and did not get the required grade point for the quarter.
Had the financial aid office given me an indication prior to my situation becoming critical the process would have been much less frustrating. Weeding through the financial aid system is difficult enough, but trying to focus on my studies without the financial burden was impossible for me."
College Junior,2,"Because of my status as an international student, there is not much financial aid available for me."
College Freshman,2,The Financial aid process in the college is confusing which pretty much made me wait till after a semester to get financial aid
College Senior,2,"Not much too it, and no real help that I could find. Just a computer search tool for job boards, and a few books. Really needs to be staffed with knowledgeable people."
Freshman,1,"Because of covid there is no one in the offices. It is late july and there outgoing messege still says they will be back on april 4th. They take entire weeks to respond to emails and send boiler plate responses without reading what you sent. If you follow up trying to reiterate and get an answer they tell you ""it is rude to question there previous response"" and then block your email so you cant communicate with the faculty. Waste of money to go here."
Freshman,1,"The staff is incredibly rude and lazy! They refuse to process financial aid documents until a week and a half before classes start making it impossible to secure housing. The government site for FAFSA says to expext to have this processed in late march or early april. I informed them that this would make applying for loans and setting up housing impossible and they told me they were ""sorry I didnt understand how things work"" and that ""I should get a job if I want to go there"". The reason I am currently out of work and needing to return to school is I lost My leg and am finding it impossible not to be discriminated against by employers. I informed them of this and they told me ""The city has homless shelters you can live in"" I cant safley take my prostetic off at a shelter without the risk of it being stolen. So Instead of doing a couple minutes of paper work on time per what the FAFSA web site says is expected they said I should be homless and called me Lazy because of my disability."
Recent Alumnus,1,Bad admins and financial aid treatment and experience.
College Junior,1,Dealing with financial aid is a constant battle. I have to give myself a pep talk before dealing with them always walk away upset and frustrated. They have not helped me once since I stated school here.
College Senior,1,"Printing on campus can get very expensive, since each sheet costs 10 cents. I would rather go to the public library where printing is free. Considering the amount of tuition paid, students should get printing free of charge."
College Freshman,1,"Not So Good! applying for financial aid was the easy part, but the hard part was recieving the money from the school. lots of students were not able to recieve money because there was some random papers that didnt get filled out, but noone was ever notified of such documents being needed."
College Freshman,1,"The Worst Quarter of My Life â€“ I am a good student, and the quarter I decided to go all online was the one that killed my GPA and made them question my financial aid."
College Sophomore,1,"I Attend the University of Mildred â€“ I chose my school because it is the only one within an hours drive that has my progam. the ""advisors"" have done nothing but make me take the wrong classes and act as though their main goal is to keep me here as long as possible. Also most of the books come in a handy dandy TCC edition that can only be purchased at the book store for outragous prices but have no new information but you do not know this untill you buy the book. The classes are great, if your in the right one and they do not cancle the class and not tell you till 15 minutes into the first days class. All in all my exprience has been pretty dismal and I have been attending a 2 year school for 4 years."
College Junior,1,Right now I'm in the basic classes I haven't got into my classes I really need for the nursing program but I know my classes are going to become more challenging and from i'm what I have heard getting into the nursing program you have to have a 3.0 gpa and their doing lottery picks so who knows when you will be able to  get in the program.
College Junior,1,"AWESOME Resources â€“ we have a lot of tutoring centers/programs. But most of the tutors don't speak very good English, and its impossible to get an appointment.  But its nice to have them there when you need it. they would be the best resources i have ever seen if more of the tutors and staff spoke English"
College Junior,1,"The Online Teachers Are Terrible. most of the teachers are terrible, both at communicating and teaching.  The classes are way to easy and you don't learn much."
Recent Alumnus,1,If there are some I was never offered them. I was sent a degree in the mail and not even given a graduation date!

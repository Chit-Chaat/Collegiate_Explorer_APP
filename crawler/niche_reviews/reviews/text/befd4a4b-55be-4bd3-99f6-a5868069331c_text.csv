Alum,5,I did not have any online classes. I graduated in 2001.  I have worked with CU graduates and they all graduate with confidence and seemed prepared for their new nursing career.
Freshman,5,"Feels like a family, as a recruit i was pleasantly surprised about how friendly and caring everyone was to me"
Freshman,5,"I love CU. All the faculty and staff know you, make an effort to learn your name, and want you to succeed. Student Life is so much fun, and everyone gets along very well."
Graduate Student,5,"Great college, professors care and available to access. You learn a lot at this school, make great friends, and have the ability to connect and make relationships that will help you when you graduate and start your job search."
Niche User,5,"While attending Cumberland as a high school senior, my time here has been rather pleasant. My professors care about how students are dong not only in the classroom but also outside. They will help in anyway they can to see their students succeed, and it is nice because the classes were not big."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely loved my experience. I have never met teachers how cared more about your success and helping you achieve your dreams. The dorm life was very poor and I would like to see that changed and facilities upgraded.
Niche User,5,I haven't went to the school yet but it felt nice on campus. Everyone was really nice and helpful. The campus felt safe to walk around on. The staff was very helpful.
Junior,5,I LOVE Cumberland University! I am very pleased with my education thus far and I hope to finish out my degree here.
Junior,5,I am in the school of Nursing at Cumberland University.  The teachers are warm and welcoming and the classes are small and perfect for learning.  I love my cohort and feel a strong drive to be a great nurse.
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful. Everyone on campus I have met so far has been so kind and helpful. The campus is very close to my home, too. It will be so convenient when I start college. I have not gotten to meet any professors yet, but my co-workers that go to Cumberland University say the professors are wonderful. The financial aid office has been extremely helpful, too."
Freshman,5,"Cumberland University fits perfect for my situation. I was looking for an opportunity to play baseball at an elite level, and I found exactly what I was looking for. Cumberland is an excellent school. It has the benefits of going to a university but since it is not very populated, it provides you with great opportunities for personal relationships with friends, coaches, deans, and professors. My overall experience at Cumberland University has been fantastic."
Freshman,5,This campus is great if your looking to be apart of a small community. The college very small and everyone knows everyone. The are many organizations to be apart of and a lot of services for students to use that will help them with classes and also enjoy there time while in school.
Sophomore,5,I like the school because the school stuff will help you with anything that you need help with does not matter what is it
Freshman,5,Cumberland University is like home to me. Coming from a small town it is not much of a change! Professors get to know you more on a personal level and you truly never feel alone. You are in an encouraging environment and they set you up for success with free access to tutoring. I would recommend this school ten out of ten times to anyone wanting a small university!
Freshman,5,Halfway into my freshman year everything has been great. The people are usually friendly and the professors actually know your name. If there was one thing that I could change however it would be a simple expansion of everything.
Junior,5,"I love how small the campus is and how the professors truly get to know you on a one on one basis. The only thing I would change is getting rid of the Tennessee Promise, because there is not enough room for all of the students it's pulling in."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at Cumberland, and it has been great so far. Great teachers, that take the time to help out,  and campus is easy to great around."
College Junior,5,The professors are very kind and supportive. The workload is not terrible. Studying in the library is very common.
College Junior,5,The campus is very diverse. There are students from all walks of life.
College Junior,5,There is no drug use on campus.
College Junior,5,"Everyone on campus has become friends with the campus police. The student body usually has their number in their phones in case they need to call. Nothing has ever happened that would be of seriousness that a security would need to step in/ protect, etc. they are very protective."
College Junior,5,"The dorms and housings overall are very clean and the hours are very appropriate. The locations are very close to the classroom buildings, so transportation is convenient for the residents."
College Junior,5,"I immediately felt at home there. Making friends and becoming close to the professors and staff was very easy. The student body is very supportive and encouraging when it comes to academics. I always know that I can go to another student or professor, etc whenever I have an issue or question about anything. I am greatly enjoying my experience."
College Freshman,5,"Cumberland University has been wonderful to me so far. I enjoy the small class sizes and access to tutors and professors. I believe that Cumberland is the best school that will help me achieve my dream of becoming a nurse, and I plan to continue with my Masters there after I graduate."
College Junior,5,I love it at cumberland
College Senior,5,"The Caf has some options (sanwiches, salads, hamurgers and dessserts) that are served everyday, but the main entres change everyday and are very healthy, filling and delicious. THe staff is also very friendly."
College Senior,5,"Technology is great a Cumberland! My freshman class recieved ""free"" ipads from the school, but I am not sure if the school still supplies those for students. The Computer labs are great and there is computer access as well as wifi in every building on campus. The IT team is also very efficient and when I have had problems they have been solved within one business day."
College Senior,5,I have seen every race and religion on campus and have not heard of any disrespectful attitudes towards anyone.
College Freshman,5,Computers are located everywhere. Work will be easy to get done. 
College Junior,5,I feel 100% safe on campus. I would walk alone at dark and feel very comfortable. 
College Junior,5,I love my biology program. It is very tough but I know when I finish and get my degree I will be set. 
College Junior,5,"Very up-to-date technology with fast, free wifi. "
College Senior,5,not a problem.  Plenty of parking right near the campus
College Sophomore,5,"We have all kinds of local restaurants. There is a Ryans, Chic-Fil-la, Taco-bell, and etc. Also, being a college student you receive plenty of discounts and the school does a good job at letting you know what kind discounts you receive."
College Sophomore,5,"Cumberland is a relaxed college. Most students do nothing until the weekend. When the weekend comes, most of the students party at the local bar in Lebanon. Most guys and girls dress relax like shorts and regular tee shirts."
College Sophomore,5,Cumberland are not super strict. They are very relaxed. Just as long as you do not do something very extreme.
College Freshman,5,"Cumberland is mainly made up of international students. Everyone is from some place different. Every person you meet, whether it be in sports, academics, or events, you learn that their culture to your own might be completly different. I personally think it is a great way to expand your thinking of different countires and people. CU does a great job of keeping the diversity on opposite spectrums."
College Freshman,5,Cumberland has contracted a security company to patrol our campus at all times. The campus also has emergency phones throughout the campus
College Freshman,5,NOT INVLOVED – i am not involved with anything just trying to keep grades up
College Sophomore,5,Cumberland University has a beautiful campus with all buildings in close proximity to each other. A cozy and comfortable place to get your education with all the amenities of larger schools.
Senior,4,"Cumberland is a wonderful school, though it is quite pricey if you don't have a scholarship. If you are looking for something that is small and more one on one base, Cumberland is your school. We however are very small and don't have many food choices on campus and have heard living in dorms are not the best."
Senior,4,"For online experiences, it will just depend on the class. If its education they overall are amazing, but chemistry and those types of classes have proven to be hard and difficult."
Alum,4,Small school which always you to develop more of a personal relationship with you instructors and teachers.  You start to feel like a family since you are together so much.  They really want to challenge you but they also want to see you succeed.
Freshman,4,"online experience was great, professors helped me with the work and the workload was very manageable"
Junior,4,"l like the openness of the people here. Teachers and staff are extremely open to helping students not only in the classroom, but also finding jobs on campus and internships elsewhere. They truly want students to succeed. The campus is small but diverse, and so there are many ways to make new friends. This is helpful for me as I tend to be shy, but since I see familiar faces everyday, it is easier for me to interact with new people. I do wish there were more clubs available on campus, though Cumberland does give me the opportunity to start my own. I also wish the library was a bit more diverse in its reading options, though the staff are very helpful in finding new books or articles if asked. I am on the tennis team and would like tennis to be as publicised as the other sports. At all sports games I would love to see more students showing a sense of school pride, as generally we are pretty quiet unless something big happens. I am happy that I chose this school and met many great people"
Sophomore,4,"I have made many many friends right off the bat at Cumberland University. I am in my second year of being there now and I love it. The faculty and staff has almost always been super nice. My teachers are awesome. They really work with me when I need help on assignments and push me to do better. They are also super flexible with anyone who has any sort of disability. The people are fantastic. The only things I struggle with are, because it is a private college, they have high expectations which can be difficult to meet sometimes. The school parking is also rough for commuters. There is simply not enough parking so if you are not at least half an hour to an hour early to your classes, you most likely will not get a parking spot in time. Other than those two things, I really enjoy my time at Cumberland University."
Junior,4,"I enjoyed the smallness of the university. I also had the ability to have one on one with professors, and he or she knew my name and where I needed help, rather than just being a face in a crowd."
Niche User,4,Professors care to know your name and want to see you succeed. There are also so many many tools and resources to help you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"A great school overall, with a small amount of students to professor ratio it helps one get to know them and receive help faster. With the school being small there is not much student life activities happening. If tuition is to expensive they will provide with many scholarships."
Freshman,4,Selecting Cumberland University as my Freshman starter I realized it is a nice campus for those who want to be away from home but not at a big school. I am a student athlete so making a connection and getting to know people came easy. The professors are really interested in getting to know their students as well as eating in the cafe and participating in the same activities. With that being same they are understanding when it comes to traveling during season and set forward the best plan for every individual. I also live on campus to make commute easier like stated earlier it is home like to be on a small campus and nice to be a walking distance from the library.
Junior,4,Overall I have had a great experience at Cumberland. The faculty are great and very helpful. I would like to see more parking for nursing school.
Sophomore,4,"I have attended Cumberland University for 2 years now, and it is a really great school! The Professors here have taught me a lot, and the campus life is great!"
Freshman,4,"I attended Cumberland University mostly due to their TN Promise eligibility; however, the school itself is actually a wonderful place, and the bonuses(such as free tutoring, the several spots to relax, etc.) are surprisingly nice. I'd certainly recommend Cumberland as the place to go, especially if you're going to be using the TN Promise."
Freshman,4,I love the academic atmosphere and face-to-face experiences with professors. You can talk to any professor about almost anything. I always feel safe on campus and with the people around me. The only thing I wish for Cumberland to do is to update the campus a little.
Sophomore,4,"The staff are very helpful, as are any random students. The facilities are good. The food beats high school food. Overall, my experience has been good, except for the parking. The parking sucks."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love cumberland University , because it's like one big family! Everyone is there for one another ... staff , students ,and community! The student life could be a little better more sororities! The cafe food is good especially on taco Tuesday's! The  Athletic program is amazing every team is so supportive of everyone . The class room settings are awesome great small classes professors willing to talk whenever and provide students with any help they might need!"
Sophomore,4,It is an excellent university which enables students to read their full potential. It offers a range of scholarships that allow the pupils to study what they wish to study.
Sophomore,4,"Cumberland University offers a unique college experience due to the large faculty to student ratio. This allows the faculty to have the opportunity to get to know each and every individual in the class. However, it is very clear that some professors care about the well being of their students more than others."
Niche User,4,Student to teacher ratio is small which makes the relationship feel more like family. The cross-country team is great and has the major of exercise science.
Freshman,4,I really like Cumberland University so far. Its been a great experience meeting all of the faculty and staff. There is a lot of and helps when doing things you love!
College Junior,4,"My professors for the most part have been very supportive and encouraging. They truly want me to succeed and are experts in their fields of study. They allow me to meet with them during office hours, and encourage note taking and questions in class."
College Junior,4,"Greek Life is held to a high standard on my campus. They are known for doing great things for the community, and the acts in which they carry out are often discussed in student sessions and in classrooms etc."
College Junior,4,I love the student body's overall enthusiasm for the university's athletics. I love being part of the huge crowd when the student body is at a sporting event. It really brings the campus together.
College Sophomore,4,So far my overall experience has helped me improve my decision making process.
College Sophomore,4,I think it should be more opportunities for jobs on campus.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe walking around campus.
College Sophomore,4,I cannot say enough good things about my school and my softball team.  My student/athlete experience has been absolutely great.
College Sophomore,4,I love that my professors understand my athletic responsibilities and take the time to accommodate my schedule when my sport is in season.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Cumberland are great, they are very recognized by the school and are highly expected to do well in their classes just as well as non- athletes."
College Junior,4,The faculty are very helpful and welcoming. The instructors care about each and every student. The university makes everyone feel like they are at home. They try to help out everyone including the community.
College Freshman,4,"I have never been barred from doing whatever I want on campus. As long as you do not do anything inappropriate, it is great."
College Freshman,4,"Since the school is so small, there are not that many people the office workers have to deal with, so they are fast and courteous about the financial aid process. If any errors are made or any questions, they are readily available to help."
College Freshman,4,Financial aid office will work with you.
College Freshman,4,There are many different options to choose from near campus. Whether you want to go to a small restaurant like Chik-Fil-A or Red Lobster.
College Freshman,4,I ended up getting financial aid but I still have to pay quite a bit of money.
College Senior,4,"Cumberland has a brand new soccer stadium on campus. It also has excellent facilites for all sport, especially baseball! There is a refurbished dorm called the ""learning commons"" that was turned intlo study rooms, computer labs. and testing rooms that allow students a quiet place to focus while not having to retain complete silence like the library. Historic Memorial hall is also very beautiful and host the science labs."
College Senior,4,"Alcohol and drug visability is very transparent. There are some off campus parties that have given access to alcohol to minors, but the drug scene is very limited. I dont remember any specific instance where I was personally offered drugs. Cumberland is very strict on dgrugs and alcohol."
College Senior,4,"SInce Cumberland is a liberal arts influenced school, all of the students I know are very acepting of diversity on all fronts. Most of the students gravitate toward the left politically but it is an open area for healthy discussion, not a gang up situation whenever there is a dissenting opinion. There are many foreign exchange students, as well as students from different areas of this country who are (mostly) there on athletic scholarship. Diversity is very well tolorated."
College Senior,4,"Cumberland works with its students in collaboration to achieve what is best for the student. As far as applying and getting in, they make it as easy and straightforward as possible."
College Junior,4,the Rudy wellness center is great.
College Junior,4,I feel confident that I am receiving a great education.
College Junior,4,THERE ARE A LOT OF CHOICES
College Junior,4,there is a lot to choose from
College Junior,4,lots of different types of people
College Sophomore,4,the majority of our students are athletes so sports are a huge part
College Junior,4,"The facilities are nice, but they also depend on the building. "
College Junior,4,The school is very small and so the parking is convenient.
College Senior,4,I live off campus and I love it.
College Senior,4,"Most of the time parking is a breeze, but if there is a sporting or some other type of event going on, then you will have trouble finding a spot. "
College Senior,4,"Very little crime on our campus, it is constantly monitored and I feel very safe when I am there."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of things to do, and there are a lot of other students to associate with."
College Junior,4,There is a lot of diversity on campus. There are also a lot of students who are international students. Anyone of a minority ethnicity usually gets better treatment than the majority. A lot of the students I've met are generally religious. 
College Junior,4,"Compared to my junior college, it has so many more options and availability times. It is very convenient. "
College Junior,4,There are a few shopping centers in town with bigger shopping centers close by. 
College Junior,4,My father handles my financial aid situation......
College Junior,4,I play volleyball at CU. The school spirit that shows up at our games are great. The coaching is very underscored though. It has a huge negative effect on our team performance. 
College Junior,4,"While Greek life isn't a huge deal at Cumberland, it has grown a lot in the last few years, and looks like it will continue to grow. Many of the student leaders on campus are members of the sorority and fraternities, and many athletes are as well. You can definitely balance class/athletics/Greek life if it is something you are interested in."
College Freshman,4,Cumberland is a private college and contains mostly athletes. Cumberland is a very small college and everyone gets along.
College Freshman,4,The weather at Cumberland is great. Hot summers mild weathers.
College Freshman,4,"I received serveral scholarships and financial aid, it was rather easy. Cumberland financial department is very helpful."
Niche User,2,"Cumberland University was at one point a good school it is not however at this point, the leadership here have no clue how to fix issues, let alone realize they themselves are the biggest issue so many of the programs here are struggling and they aren't dealing with it. There are much better options than Cumberland for better prices."
Sophomore,2,I liked the small class sizes. But it is not designed to hold the amount of students that currently attend
College Freshman,2,"I haven't lived on campus, but i have a couple friends that do. I have been to their dorms, and its worse than hotel rooms. They are small and not so good. These are the freshman dorms though. At the current cost of tuition, I am very disappointed in what Cumberland has to offer considering freshman dorms."
College Sophomore,2,EP the freshman male dorm is nasty and dirty. The restrooms always have urine on the seat at all times. none of the freshmen seem to care about the residence halls.
College Senior,2,"There is little funding and few staff for the chemisty or biology programs at Cumberland. The labs themselves are outdated, and the school does not seem to have any plans of updating them any time soon. The professors are very passionate however and that is what saves the entire science program."
College Senior,2,Very few students live in off campus housing outside of thier parents house. Property is very expensive in Lebanon and the number of houses for rent is very small. It is very difficult to live off of campus.
College Senior,2,"The school seems to be constantly reorganizing and re prioritizing which majors and programs it thinks is important. Case in point: the school built a new wresting facility, new soccer field, and refurbished an old stadium for football just in the time I have been there (3 years), while its science department is still using chemicals, specimines and equipment from the 1970's. It has been known for its liber arts programs, but now is trying to shift focus to buisness and sports related majors. It's as if the school is going with the flow instead of setting an example."
College Junior,2,not the nicest area. older houses. Cheap rent.
College Student,2,greek life is not appreciated and few options
College Student,2,alot of weed and alcohol but that is everywhere u go. it says its a dry campus but this sucker is a 12 ft deep swimming pool!
College Student,2,the sports teams for the most part are teribble.
College Student,2,"we have a mall, food, movies, and bowling but have no money because of the big ticket price for education here."
College Sophomore,2,there isn't much transportation around school and the community
College Sophomore,2,the only thing to do is go to a party over the weekend someone might have or go to the only dance hall we have
College Sophomore,2,our cafeteria is not open long enough during the day and offers very few options for students. there are even fewer healthy options as well. the variety of choices besides the caf are limited to one or two other meals if you don't want to eat in the cafeteria
College Senior,2,As far as I know there is no transportation options available at this college. Students who live on campus walk/bike and the ones that don't drive. This campus is in what is considered a rural area.
College Junior,2,I had to park in a no parking zone one day. I received a ticket but it was revoked due to the fact that I appealed it. At the beginning of school parking was a very big problem. 
College Junior,2,I do not go out but from close sources I hear the close by bar is very fun on the weekends. 
College Junior,2,"So far, the weather has been nice with a few drastic temperature changes. Being from the South, it is much colder here than at my home. I had to purchase some warm clothing that I was not expecting. "
College Senior,2,"The campus is small and some of the buildings need an update. The nursing campus needs an update on the lab equipment. The student center is a nice place to study or watch television. There is not much to the campus life, just a movie and an ice cream night."
Alum,1,I took all of my classes on campus and I desperately wish I could turn back time and pick a different school.
Alum,1,"An absolute joke of a school. No one who works there knows what they’re doing. They just send you round and round on endless missions to try and get something- anything- done. Financial aid office has no clue what the business office does, the registrars office has no clue what the other 2 offices are doing, it’s an endless cycle of ignorance and arrogance on the schools part. They constantly “lose” paper work causing any work you do get accomplished to be in vain. Then the professors like to teach off subject of the book and waste your time in class when you could be studying for the exams instead of talking about anything and everything but the exam material. Save your money and time and go somewhere worth actually learning from."
Sophomore,1,"Save your money and go somewhere else! I don't even know where to start! 
1) If you need help with financial aid or admission, good luck! the people who work in these department are useless. For example, I had a question about financial aid and every time I called I get a different explanation. 
2) Tuition is ridiculous for this school. You pay way too much to sit in a class with the ceiling falling down. The building for the nursing department is old and falling apart. The food choices are minimal to say the least. 
3) The computer labs are filled with out dated technology. 
4) The library is old and moldy.
5)The residence halls are old and very small. It feels like a shoe box to be honest."
College Freshman,1,"There are only the cafeteria and the Bulldog Bistro. 

The cafeteria food is better than high school food, but not by much, which is extremely disappointing considering tuition costs. The Bistro is way better to eat at. It is a mixture of Papa Johns with other options like subs and an assortment of junk food. The pizza is delicious though."
College Student,1,"dorms are way over priced because they are small...girls do not have closets just tiny tiny wardrobes, super hot in the summer and super cold in the winter, waken up in the mornings with no electricity is not fun. there is nothing to do on campus, and the cost is not worth what you are getting."
College Junior,1,There is one club in the whole town and the only people who go are people who do not attend college and do drugs and are nasty.
College Junior,1,There are available scholarships but everyone is after them due to the high costs. The people in the office are not very helpful.

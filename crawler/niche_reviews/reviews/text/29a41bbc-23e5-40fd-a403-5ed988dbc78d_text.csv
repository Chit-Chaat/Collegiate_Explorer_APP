Freshman,5,So far my experience with Huston- Tillotson University has been amazing. They have tried there absolute best to make sure I had everything I needed to enroll and become and be the best student I can be.
Freshman,5,So far everything online is working amazing haven't started online yet but will be very very soon and can't wait.
Alum,5,My experience at this AMAZING HBCU was amazing. There's so much culture and pride at that school it's a beautiful thing.
Sophomore,5,Doing online learning from HT has actually been pretty easy and not that much hiccups. They have worked with the students and have rolled out new programs to help them get up to speed with using online platforms.
Freshman,5,I like that campus and classes are very flexible and that the professors are willing to understand you.
Alum,5,"Huston-Tillotson graduates many who have made great achievements in the Nation. For instance, Azie Taylor-Morton who served as Treasurer of the United States during the Carter administration from September 12, 1977, to January 20, 1981. She remains the only African American to hold that office. Her signature was printed on US currency during her tenure."
Freshman,5,It’s a real family environment . Professors and faculty takes the time to get to know their students one on one .
Junior,5,HT is a great HBCU that gives every student the opportunity to be great matter what has happened at your prior school.
Freshman,5,"i have visted huston tillotson campus twice , one with my school other with my mom . The first time i walked on campus it felt like home , a community and most of all a family . Second time i didn't want to leave! i will be attending HT this fall. :)"
Senior,5,A great experience so far. Professors are excellent and take the time to further your learning in a more hands-on approach. I would like to see more classes offered and more up to date facility.
Junior,5,"Huston-Tillotson is an amazing school to attend. Its located right in the middle of Austin so every attraction that Austin's downtown has to offer is within reach. The campus environment is very friendly and welcoming and you never feel out of place when you're there. The campus also sits on one of the highest points in downtown so from a few different angles, you get a good look at the city skyline which is always a nice touch. The classes are small, so you get a sense of inclusiveness, and every professor on campus is dedicated to making your experience worth your time. I'd recommend it to anyone."
Junior,5,"I enjoy attending Huston-Tillotson University, I’m looking forward to working alongside my classmates."
Freshman,5,I liked that HT was so diverse & the student body was just like a huge family. I think that a football team should be added to the school because who doesnt love football games?
Junior,5,Huston-Tillotson has allowed me to continue my education with my hectic schedule. Through the Adult Degree Program I can achieve my academic goals while maintaining a job to support my family.
Freshman,5,It great on scheduling and they very helpful and supportive with one other they make u feel welcome and like u are here to learn motives me to move hard for my success I really encourage any individuals to check them out the wonder college and I can’t wait to get started fully
Freshman,5,When visiting HTU my experience was incredible I really enjoyed the small family orientated feeling that I received while walking around campus. I feel if your looking for a family type feel and a home away from home you should definitely attend Huston-Tillotson University
Freshman,5,"I loved Huston-Tillotson University because it offered ""a home away from home"" environment. The class sizes were small, the professors catered to the students needs and the café was amazing. The president of the university was so in tune with us, she knew our names personally. HT was an outstanding higher education facility."
Junior,5,"I love this University! The campus is small, but it gives off a family vibe, the teachers are great. They actually want to see you succeed and be apart of the community."
Senior,5,"I have enjoyed attending Huston Tillotson University due to smaller class sizes.  You can get to know the Professors and other staff, you aren't just a student on campus.  The Professors and staff know you be name.  Everyone is friendly and very helpful."
Junior,5,"I will say that for the just concluded 5 months semester my experience in some cases are well perceived and gave me a lot experiences each semester as I go higher in my academic life, first I will say some of my classses the instructor is well informed and known the course given to him or her to teach in some cases they don't, which put a lot of work hard on the study in other study more to meet put with the course requirements. But in over all I will confidently say that some of the classes which mainly are required course in my field of study are positive experiences for me, I will confidently say to any individual wishing to take a course in Huston Tillotson University to first go through the enrollment management to get the required courses for his or her classes"
College Junior,5,Our campus is very diversified.
College Sophomore,5,They are veary helpful twords students and each other
College Junior,5,It will be the best.
College Freshman,5,Best school ever if you ask me
College Freshman,5,Living on campus at HT is very great. The staff are caring  and strict which brings everyone to together and builds a strong friendship
College Freshman,5,We have the best nurses
College Sophomore,5,MY SCHOOL MAINLY SURROUND ITSELF WITH BASKETBALL AND TRACK. ! WE WON A LOT OF GOLD MEDALS AND CAME HOME IN SECOND IN DISTRICT. SOME OF OUR STUDENT WERE QUALIFIED FOR NATIONALS.
College Sophomore,5,I FOLLOW ALL CAMPUS RULES AND I DONT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANY OF THEM. IT IS JUST FOR THE SAFETY OF THE STUDENTS WELL BEING.
College Sophomore,5,"The house is a bit much, but what college isn't. In our housing dorms, WE ARE A FAMILY."
College Sophomore,5,I am Captain of the Huston-Tillotson RamNites Dance Teamand we will be in full effect this year. You have to have at least a 2.0 GPA and good social skills. We perform at all school and local event all over Austin. We do provide opportunities and we are very well known.
College Sophomore,5,"As my first year in college, it was the best !!! i was just so upset that ended soo quickly. I did have some trouble times, but i managed to come out on the honor roll. This school is easy to get into ,but the classes are challenging. Stay focus because it is easy to fall off."
College Sophomore,5,The dining is not bad ... there are times when the food is on point then there are times were you might choose to go out and eat.... We are in Austin so the variety of places to eat is out of this world!!
College Sophomore,5,It's really not difficult. We have a guy named Paul Leverington that sets up job fair if not every month every other month. So when it's time to get an internship or a job it's already set up... all you have to do is show up be professional.
College Sophomore,5,"When it comes to the class size it's perfect! the classrooms are very small and intimate so your able to get to know everyone one in the class. As well as getting closer to your professor whenever you need help, they are willing to take the time out of their day to help you."
College Sophomore,5,"It really starts with you. Here at HT it's about what you know and who you know. Learn how to study and when you learn how to study, you learn how to teach."
College Sophomore,5,"Austin has been a great city, there's many places you can find interesting and many jobs that are willing to hire you."
College Sophomore,5,"Overall everyone on this campus including the teachers, peer, Greek life and staff are great and very easy to talk to when you need help and there located close to you on campus in case of in emergency"
College Junior,5,you have tons of places to go too and then you have downtown just less than 5 minutes away. Its great to enjoy the beauty of austin
College Junior,5,"The city of Austin is known for its nigthlife. 6th street is famous for having the best bars, it also host SXSW in the spring time too."
College Junior,5,"There is always something to do in the city of Austin, TX. The city is a very fit and active city it has an amazing nightlife and awesome museums and lots of festivals."
College Freshman,5,The food out here is the best
College Freshman,5,6th street is always packed and fun.
College Freshman,5,Most non-Greek students look up to the Greek students and love everything that they stand for. Most of the Greeks are very nice and speak to the students. Their events are always on point. There is no Greek housing but we do have plots for the different Greeks here on campus.
College Freshman,5,Everyone on campus just mind their business pretty much but every now and then there are some disagreements. No judges one another's sexual orientation. It is what is.
College Freshman,5,For me the financial aid office is awesome . The staff is there and willing to help you whenever you need it !
College Freshman,5,The campus security is on point . They do a very good job in keeping us safe.
College Freshman,5,"Huston-Tillotson University is in Austin, TX we our surrounded by everything...parks...clubs...movie theaters... restaurants... etc.. this is a beautiful city that is full of so many things to do."
College Freshman,5,We have computers labs all over campus. If you go to the peer learning consultant center in the jm building it is free to print.
College Freshman,5,"The nightlife at my school is always fun, all thanks to our fraternities and sororities. They organize the best parties and students from other schools are invited. We have probates. We also have parties based on events of the month like we have a Halloween party, Friday the 13th and others. The club scene is usually safe because we try to act as mature as possible because the police can come in at any point. A lot of people in college have cars and so come along with people who don't, it's very cool."
College Freshman,5,I don't see drug use on my campus.
College Sophomore,5,There are many people in each field that is willing to help and mentor you through college.
College Senior,5,"My overall experience attending my college has been great. Although I have a lot that I don't like about it, what makes Huston-Tillotson unique are the professors in the business department. They make the work tough, but they go out of their way to make sure students learn the material. They are comforting and encouraging to all students in never giving up even when they are struggling in a subject. If a student is looking to become a better student and gain more knowledge in their field of study Huston-Tillotson is the perfect University to go to.  "
College Senior,5,"The program is accredited in the business department. The professors are excellent and have great compassion for every student that walks through the doors. The workload is tough but fairly easy to balance with other classes and personal life. The unique aspects of the program is that students are held to a high standard, but the professors make sure that every student has an opportunity to learn. There are a lot of internship opportunities during each semester, and there is a lot of information sent out to students for internships/job opportunities at other locations off-campus.   "
College Senior,5,The University Estates are convenient in terms of distances. You can find help through the email sometimes students are leasing their apartments for summertime.
College Sophomore,5,It is excellent the teachers are always there for you. They will help you if you need it and take as much time they need for you to get it
College Freshman,5,I love the small classes and the one-on-ones with the teachers. you can miss a class and not be worried if you are going to fail the rest of the semester. you are not just a number you are an actual person.
College Freshman,5,"We're all treated the same. You're a child of God, who are we to judge?"
College Junior,5,"One of the most amazing things about being at Huston-Tillotson University is that students really matter. Since I've been here I have developed a sense of pride to know that my instructors don't just teach, but they care about what matters to me. They encourage me to stretch my horizon and see opportunties at every angle in order to be a successful, well-rounded individual."
College Junior,5,"mightgod2010
Huston-Tillotson University

   There is a zero tolerance campaign of underage drinking and drug use. First time offenders get a letter sent home and a talk with the dean about what happened. Second time offenders are handed over to the local police and another letter is sent home."
College Junior,5,"When I first came to Huston-Tillotson University, it was to just get a degree to compete in an already aggressive job market, but now I know I'm going to leave with so much more. A small campus on a hill describes a university that has big opportunites such as small class room size, friendly advisors and inspiring educators that are passionate about what they teach. With all that to offer, I say it's worth the climb to get on top of that hill."
Alum,4,I think taking online classes was a great experience. The teachers were assessable whenever  I needed help. I was able to access the work very easy.
Senior,4,I was about to give up on Huston Tillotson based on my experience regarding a financial aid issue that came about because of a lack of communication and a change guard.  But the accounting office came together as a group a d resolved my issues. I list my confidence before but now it us renewed. Great place to go to school.  I would recommend it to anyone.
Senior,4,Very Best University.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Great professor awesome staff and nice friendly faces no matter were you go.
Sophomore,4,This is a great school. i really enjoy HT. the only thing i would change is their student portal is not the most user friendly and needs some work.
Junior,4,"It’s been more than 10 years since I have attended college! Being a part of Huston-Tillotson University Adult Degree Program has been like home away from home. The Education curriculum is, by far, the best I have come across and there is always someone willing to help you, if you’re willing to reach out!"
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Huston-Tillotson University for my first year in college was a good one. The academics of the school was amazing, the professors were there for the students and were always willing to work with us. They had us engage everyday, not taking a day off and growing out knowledge. The programs will help the student (me) become prepared to step into the real world and be successful. The only reason why Huston-Tillotson University was not an excellent experience was the business part. The business off was very lazy and had a ton of mistakes including billing and financial aid, they would not add scholarships to the cost and then would not tell us until right before we leave for break, so we had to stay longer and it was very frustrating dealing with them. Other than that, the experience was very good, hoping to have an excellent sophomore year with no issues."
Freshman,4,"The one thing I love about this college is that the faculty take the time to get to know their students personally, and push them outside of their comfort zones. It's really a fRAMily."
Junior,4,"So far, my experience here at Huston-Tillotson University has been absolutely great! I came here in August of 2016, and ever since then, I've gotten the chance to meet new people, travel may different places, and make a multitude of connections with the skills of networking, given by those in authority. Also, this is the only HBCU in Austin, TX and the oldest education system of higher learning. And let's not forget that this school is placed right on Bluebonnet Hill, which is even better. If you are interested in come here, please do! we are a FRAMily, so come and make HT your home!"
Junior,4,I love the fact that it is a small and close net school. I love the fact that everyone is like family and everyone cares. I would like to see the financial aid department change with getting students refunds back sooner.
Sophomore,4,"This is a wonderful institution! It is very diverse and there are many opportunities for students to take advantage of from studying in China, to being an intern at the Google Headquarters.  The campus is very family-oriented and I would recommend this school to anyone! The issues that are on campus are minor technical issues so overall, this school if amazing!"
Niche User,4,I like that the school is very little. Its easy to walk to your classes and is a nice and cozy environment. I like how tutorials are mandatory for freshman. I feel like i would do better at a small school so that why i like Huston-Tillotson.
Freshman,4,"Huston-Tillotson University has a beautiful campus and is a HBCU. It consists of 1,200 people, the professors are extremely understanding and are their for you whenever you need them. The students are all friendly and helpful, definitely a good environment to be in."
Junior,4,"I actually haven't started classes at HT yet but i ave toured the campus a few times and from what i have seen of it, it looks like a very nice campus, there is a mix of a little modern and a little bit of older or rustic, and there is so much history behind the school witch i find interesting"
Junior,4,"I love Huston-Tillotson University. I will be a junior Fall 2018. It is the most diverse campus I've stepped foot on. All of my professors are great and actually cares about each individual student. The falculty is wonderful. There are so many opportunities that Huston-Tillotson University offers their students. If I could change anything, it would probably be the size of the dorms. They're very small rooms shared by 2 people. The temperature is almost never right, either too hot or too cold. But other than that, I believe there is nothing else I would change about my HBCU. I love it here and can't wait to give back."
Junior,4,To date It has been an incredible  experience. I feel supported by ADP staff as well as  professors. I’ve enjoyed my classmates and the  we’er in this together  attitude.
Freshman,4,"What I like about Huston-Tillotson is how small it is. It might seem like a bad thing when looked at at first but when looked at closer, it makes the campus feel like a small community. I have made strong friendships as well as succeeded academically while enjoying my classes. The only thing that I think my university should change is the financial aid and business sector of staff, there should be more clarity between them and the students because there have been some issues regarding that sector."
Freshman,4,It's very family oriented and everyone makes each other feel welcomed. I've made some really good friends. Everyone there is on the same grind as you. The teachers want to see you succeed. Even though it's an HBCU everyone is welcomed there.
Freshman,4,Huston Tillotson makes you feel like you are apart of the school. No one really passes judgement on you especially if you are older and going back to school.  The one thing I would like to have changed would be the process for Veterans using the Vocation Rehab program. They seem to drop the ball because of the lack of knowledge on how this works with schools.
Sophomore,4,"I have been at Huston-Tillotson University for almost a year. I transferred in from a different school. I am in the adult degree program which is aimed at adults and working people who are busy during the day, get a change to attend school at night. I make straight A's here. I am currently on the dean's list. The atmosphere of the school is great. Communication with financial aid is a bit of a battle at times but that would be the only downside I see. Overall, its been great."
Senior,4,"Good learning experience, Professors are awesome and willing to help you succeed. Expensive but worth it"
Senior,4,"The faculty and staff are there to help you and refuse to see you fail. Although some of the facilities could stand to see an upgrade, they are very clean and well maintained."
College Senior,4,I am not that aware of the greek life.
College Senior,4,This school helps me and believe I can succeed at everything  I put a passion too.
College Junior,4,"One on one with professors, always study groups."
College Sophomore,4,I am on the basketball team and I love the students that come to the games its jam packed every game.
College Sophomore,4,the school spirit is all around great everyone loves each other.
College Sophomore,4,A few room parties no more than 10 people in one room mostly just your closes friends
College Sophomore,4,A few well known parties some parties are secret and you must be invited prrsonaly
College Sophomore,4,Plenty of help crnters that are easy to find with conveant hours
College Sophomore,4,"Students are not presuered into doing anything they dont want to by other students or staff 

Students who do not smoke or drink can be cool with thoses that do with out drinking or smoking 

Students that do somke or drink dont do so on campus 

All students are respectful"
College Sophomore,4,They are very helpful twrods students
College Sophomore,4,We have not had any problems with any sexual assaults on any students on or off campus
College Sophomore,4,There is pently to do on campus from offering volentering surveses to events that allow you to just have fun
College Sophomore,4,"The career prospects are great.  The help from the alumni network, employers recruiting and the career services are very helpful if you help yourself by using these services."
College Sophomore,4,"HT was founded in 1881, the facilities are dated.  They are in the process of updating throughout the campus.  The athletic department is one of those facilities that is being updated to help with the number of athletes the school is bringing in.  School/fan support/spirit is high on any sports day."
College Sophomore,4,I like the fact that the classes are small and you can get more interaction going between Professors and students.
College Junior,4,I dont like the fact that the syllabus is made for the professor.
College Freshman,4,The school so far has been great I made lots of friends and know that my teachers will help me out in the long run.
College Junior,4,The classrooms are great the professors actually care about the students and would like to see everyone succeed.
College Junior,4,we have a great career center and you can tell they want their students to get great jobs and opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,The environment is family oriented and the small classes make interaction in the classroom much better than a larger school.
College Junior,4,"My school is very small. Its really about what you make it, If you sit around doing nothing then you would consider HT ""boring."" If you get involved on campus things will turn out better for you. We are all a big family and the students, we work together and have eachothers back. The classes are small and your able to connect with the professor and also the students. Administation is difficult and very slow but, if you talk to the right person they will help you as much as they can."
College Freshman,4,HT is right next so quite a few restaurants and stores with lots of food products. There are Mexican food places and convince stores and markets with a wide variety of food options compared as well as places.
College Freshman,4,"As I did a college tour, I got to go into the dining hall and some of the experienced students showed me the kind of food that they get to eat and I just thought It was great. The have that southern food which is really good!"
College Freshman,4,Theres many student housing apts nearby.
College Freshman,4,There are many nearby places thats also cheap
College Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere. There are a lot of organizations that you can get into its really nice.
College Freshman,4,"the administration is great and strict. if you were to miss six straight classes in one course you will be flag in the system, and you get a letter or email to report to the center of academic for questioning."
College Sophomore,4,"Since Austin, Texas is a major city, there are the varities of distinguished restaurants and restaurant franchises.  All I have tried are excellent.  Some have student discount; although, I don't use them."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm too old for Greek life anymore.  I do enjoy watching them, there is so much energy in the atmosphere, it sometimes exhaust me.  And, I love it."
College Sophomore,4,"This town has a great history; Austin, Texas.  This is a spectacular place to be for any artist.  This is the capitol of the state of Texas and the politics are overwhelming and very inviting.   The city government incite its citizens to be involved all the way around in its politics, political views, and public participation in its public policy making.  I am excited to be within this type of atmosphere."
College Sophomore,4,The housing choices are enormous and so is the availability.  All is fair in parking and safety.
College Sophomore,4,"WOW!  Job Fairs are on site at the htu campus.  The prospectors are enormous from investment banking to law enforcement, etc.  I have never been to any campus where the choices are vast."
College Sophomore,4,"I am content with the financial aide on my campus; the process always go smoothly and in an orderly fashion.  I, also, appreciate the financial aide officers and their competancy and the assistance they provide."
College Freshman,4,"Parties are not that presentable unless a specific occasion, Greek, or the party promoters throw one"
College Junior,4,the city is electric with energy this is like the city that never sleeps.
College Sophomore,4,WE DO HAVE SOME BUT NOT MANY.
College Sophomore,4,We have awesome HT faculty & staff. We also have awesome Peer Learning Consultants(PLC's)  here in the Center for Academic Excellence. Whenever you need help with your work... you can just go the CAE center for help and if you ever need to print out anything it's free when you go their center.
College Sophomore,4,"The cost of tuition and fees have recently increased, due to the dorm renovations . Otherwise its worth getting the education. Also, work and apply for scholarships they are life-savers."
College Sophomore,4,"Since HT is a small & private campus we are limited to what we have such as programs. However, the libraries we recently renovated so it's really nice and a great place to study. As far as hangout spots trust me there are plenty and once you start to socialize among your peers you will lol... Campus Activities are actually doing quite well we are in the process of bringing more activities for students to enjoy."
College Freshman,2,"Having a house off campus from HT is not a great thing to have. The prices are twice as much as the on campus dorms and aren't that descent. Parking off campus is kinda 50/50. You can park on like the side of the road but there's a great walking distance if you do this. In order to get into the HT campus, you must go through a gate with a security checkpoint to make sure that your an HT student."
College Freshman,2,Really unorganized when it came to money aspect.
College Freshman,2,as an international student it is a little bit hard for me to gain financial aid.
College Freshman,2,"most of the food they serve are really bad, people tend to eat because they paid for it and even if you don't eat it your money wont be returned back to you, so you are not given a choice."
College Freshman,2,The education level is the same as high school; I received an better education in high school!!
College Sophomore,2,The gym is nice but it would be better if it was updated. 
College Senior,2,The financial aid assistance on campus is bad. Every semester when I apply for financial aid or have questions none of the employees there are on the same page. One employee will say one thing and another will say something different.By the financial aid employees on campus are not on the same page it makes applying difficult. 
College Senior,2,The food on campus is not good. The quality of the products that are used to make the food are not good at all. The last time I ate on campus the food tasted horrible. 
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid came with loans for my package and now I am struggling searching for scholarships.
College Senior,2,"The dorms are small and stuffy, the temperaturs for the dorm rooms clash with the ouside environment. The cost is about $2,000 more than living on campus because it comes with certain charges. The housing process is very easy but can be deemed unaffordable and unworthy. There aren't really any amenities but a flat screen television in the lobby. Everyone hangs outside the dorms but the dorm life is messy especially the bathrooms. And it is not the janitor's fault!"
College Senior,2,The food is very much edible but not pleasing to eat. Many students have complained over and over again. HT definitely needs a new dining service for the students' meal plan. They serve the same thing everyday and even every week. It lacks choice and diversity.
College Junior,2,The security doesn't do anything. I have heard of numerous students having their cars broken into and the security can never seem to find out who's causing them. The academic dean is some what strict we don't have certain organizations as far as greek on campus because of her. Also the greek life is boring because the new academic dean doesn't allow the greek orgs to do stroll offs etc. HT has stupid policies in my opinion for example the refund checks are so unorganized they'll have a whole line of students from the cashiers window all the way outside and these people would be in line for hours at a time maybe.
College Freshman,2,The overall best sport is soccer and lady's basketball.
College Freshman,2,"It could be better. You smell weed on a daily basis, as people walk past you. Showing up to class high as a kite. No one is taking actions."
College Junior,2,"They are small, and Deltas are not on campus which sucks!"
College Junior,2,Safe During the Day... as Long as You're Not Invovled in the Trouble. Within my first two weeks a student got jumped in one of the stair cases... It was shocking to be honest. The campus police are a strong presence though one or two seem more interested in keeping people off campus than patrolling the campus. I'm nervous walking out of classes after dark.
College Sophomore,2,Since there is really nothing to do it doesnt affect anything
College Freshman,2,Haven't Begun to Learn About My Major – The classes that I have to take a HT are not even related to what i came to the school to study and I am going to be a Sophmore next semester.
College Freshman,2,The Staff Is Regular – At HT you have people who you can tell enjoy there jobs and those who enjoy the fact they have a job. Some professors take there job seriously while others don't really show much effort as a college professor should. The cafe sucks.
College Sophomore,2,Cold Dorms – The dorm rooms are very cold so I feel sick and uncomfortable most of the time. They only do this because of the humid climate outside.
Freshman,1,"Because of the lack of diversity, everyone seems the same. Everyone generally came from some part of Austin so you’ll never really get to meet someone with a different culture or background aside from the international kids who again, are from the same place too. The volleyball coaches are terrible. I don’t recommend you attend if you are strong willed with impeccable determination. HT hates that if you’re not a push over."
Niche User,1,This is the worst post secondary institution that I have attended. The tuition is unreasonable being that graduates of this university have difficulty finding gainful employment upon graduation.
College Freshman,1,we don't hold much party in the school premises
College Freshman,1,They are to strict on campus
College Sophomore,1,i DONT LIKE OUR FINANCIAL AID . THE BEST ADVICE I CAN GIVE TO SOMEONE IS TO DO IT AHEAD OF TIME. DONT PROCRASTINATE.
College Senior,1,"The computers at the school are horrible. The computers are slow, unreliable, unclean, and out of date. The need of a personal computer is not great, but it comes in handy when trying to take notes or completing an assignment. Overall the computers need to be upgraded, and the computer labs need to be renovated to look nicer. "
College Sophomore,1,Although we have a small campus i feel as if there should be buses or shuttles that come to the students apartments through out the day.
College Freshman,1,HT needs o get with the times. Its time to update the entire school
College Freshman,1,Mostly blacks and africans but there are other races that are growing there  and making it diverse.
College Freshman,1,"Parking is costly and extremely limited for students on campus. There is a parking lot just off campus for students that is free, but good luck getting a spot."
College Sophomore,1,Not So Good – This is A bad campus to live on better yet go to for the price! All the staff is for them selves
College Sophomore,1,Lose Lose! Parking here can either lead you to two things 1. A wreaked car or 2. A parking ticket
College Freshman,1,"Not Really That Diverse – At HT there are more than one type of ethnic groups such as Blacks, whites, and Mexicans. The school is accepting of all races but there is not really that much of diversity on campus, dominated predominately by African Americans, followed by Hispanic heritage."
College Sophomore,1,"The setting of the nightlife on Huston-Tillotson Campus can be compared to a lifeless dance where everyone is standing around or even a funeral honestly. Walking on campus at night, everything is quiet and sometimes there wont be another person in sight. You will not have to use your senses during night hours because there really isn't no interaction with anything at all. It is just dead in all areas but peaceful none the less. If you are looking for enjoyment or fun, this is the last place to be."
College Sophomore,1,"Strictness Is Non-Existential – Here at Huston-Tillotson University, most of the guidelines and rules are not enforced like other colleges. They do promote certain rules for the use of no alcohol or drug use. However, they do not have strict security to make sure that people are not under such influences. On the contrary, the visitation policies are very strict and are put into action. The resident assistants and advisers even go to great lengths of kicking minors off campus. Despite all of this, HT is usually a carefree campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on HT campus is like being a taxi driver in New York City. It is very crowded and busy. First, there isn't really a parking space that is spacious enough for all students. This is detrimental because the space we do have is set on a dirt road filled with rocks. Many people have experienced rock scratches, dirt on their cars and even accidents because of the limited amount of space. Some students even have to park their vehicles on the side of a street, if a vacant spot is available. This hardship is by far the worst and it can only get worst."
College Sophomore,1,"Not That Many Computer Labs – Most of the labs that we at Huston-Tillotson University are usually available for the actual computer classes not at the leisure of a student. Also, there isn't usually a great number of computers to use in the lab. It is possibly at a  number of 10 the most. If a student needs to print out an assignment for their course, they will need to wait until another individual is finished and a computer is available. It is important for a student to have their own laptop and maybe printer so that they do not experience this."
College Sophomore,1,There is no such thing as off-campus housing. If we want to live off-campus we have to apply for either a student apartment or full apartment. There isn't much room on campus to supply the need for the growing student population. The school isn't doing much to battle this issue either. They have these pointless townhall meetings to fill our head with the same lies they told the previous generation of college students to have graduated from here.

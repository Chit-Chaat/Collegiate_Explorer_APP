Freshman,5,"It is very organized with its platforms and the placement of assignments. They use canvas, which is a very nice platform to use when completing school work. They're up to date on grades."
Freshman,5,"I love the friendly atmosphere at Lenoir-Rhyne. There is  a smaller number of students at the school, which gives a more one-on-one approach to learning."
Niche User,5,very helpful and understanding they are very flexible always offer ways to help and really care about their students
Junior,5,"Lenoir-Rhyne has a beautiful campus. With a smaller student population, everyone at LRU feels like family. Once you step on this campus, you will feel at home immediately."
Freshman,5,I loved the environment of family that Lenoir-Rhyne incorporates with their classes. There are small classes and I don't feel like I'm simply another number. My counselor is close and real with me which I also love.
Freshman,5,I have always lived near Lenoir-Rhyne and it has been a blessing. It is very convenient for me to attend and the small classes are amazing. I have enjoyed my experience and plan on graduating from here.
Freshman,5,Lenoir-Rhyne University is a very friendly private school and will make everyone from anywhere in the world feel welcoming. The professors work well with students to try to get them prepared with all the proper education they need for their future careers in the workforce.
Sophomore,5,Lenoir Rhyne is a great all around school to attend. LR has made everything easy and fun from classes to campus life!
Sophomore,5,"Lenoir-Rhyne University, or better known on campus as,""LR,"" is a small private college. The small size of the campus allows students to better interact with one another, creating a family-like environment."
Junior,5,"Lenoir-Rhyne University is a university that is different from others. Even though it is expensive, attending LR makes you feel like it's worth it. This University shows the students that they really do care. The staff takes the time to have a one on one meeting with them. They let the students know that LR is here for them. The experience that I've had here at LR has been different than what I would have imagined. This school has spirit, love, they show that they care, helpful, and so much more. Lenior Rhyne also has so many different programs and opportunities that help students with their majors and careers. LR supports and encourages you to become an active member of the school community as well as the community in which Lenoir Rhyne is based. They provide opportunities for community service within the school and the local community. Overall, LR is such a great school to attend and I hope students to decide to attend. I am so very proud to be a student at Lenoir Rhyne University."
Sophomore,5,"At Lenoir-Rhyne University, the education is excellent as the professors seek to make sure students understand the material and want their students to be successful in the course that they are teaching. Additionally, attending a smaller school allows for a one-on-one learning experience which makes learning new material a lot easier."
Niche User,5,"When I visited the campus for the first time, I loved it. It was the most beautiful campus I had ever seen. I was thrilled to find out that they had an amazing soccer team for females,as well as a nursing program."
Freshman,5,I like the personal attention that they give to each incoming student. I like that the campus is not spread out so you don't have to drive around to get to each building. I like that they have a variety of sports and facilities to accommodate any of your sports interests. I like the variety of programs available to meet your academic goals. The counselors are very knowledgeable and helpful. They are available to answer any questions and are not pushy.
Freshman,5,"The campus is small and welcoming. From the beginning, the admissions team was very helpful with any questions I had and always responded quickly. When applying for specific programs admissions team members were there for friendly reminders with due dates and missing items. Great school!"
Niche User,5,I am an upcoming freshman for the 2019-2020 year and I've only been on campus one time but it was absolutely gorgeous. The students and staff members are so kind and understanding. The campus wasn't too big so it was easy to get around and the dorm rooms aren't location far from the campus at all.
Freshman,5,"While I may not have actually started classes yet, I love the general atmosphere of the campus. Everyone is so nice and welcoming. The town is amazing and quaint as well. My parents both attended and graduated from LR as well."
Freshman,5,I love the campus at Lenoir-Rhyne University and the diversity on campus. There are many different majors and minors available to students and many graduate programs. Hickory is a well-known city and it offers a plethora of activities to students at Lenoir-Rhyne.
Freshman,5,"Lenoir-Rhyne University is a university that is different from others. Even though it is expensive, attending LR makes you feel like it's worth it.

LR, also, has so many different programs and opportunities that help the students with their majors and careers. Overall, LR is such a great school to attend and I hope students to decide to come to LR"
Niche User,5,I thought the staff and students were FANTASTIC! I have 2 sisters that attended there and I cannot wait to go there in the fall! I went on my own personal tour and everyone on campus was friendly and welcoming.
Sophomore,5,Lenoir-Rhyne is a great school to attend. It provides to one-on-one professor student experience and also provides a wide variety of activities to do on campus. It is also great with providing many organizations to be apart of such as Greek life.
Freshman,5,I had a great experience during my tours at LR. It is a beautiful campus and is continuing to grow every year.
Graduate Student,5,Lenoir Rhyne is a very community based school.  They support and encourage you to become an active member of the school community as well as the community in which Lenoir Rhyne is based.  They provide opportunities for community service within the school and local community that build on the Lenoir Rhyne foundation of giving back. The alumni program continues to reach out and link past and current students in a familial way without being intrusive.
Sophomore,5,"Lenoir-Rhyne University, is the best college I visited and is the best school I have ever attended. Though my first year was difficult, I had so many instructors help me with big life changing decisions. I would recommend this school to anyone who wants a small university with teachers who truly care for not only your education, but you and your well being."
Sophomore,5,My experience at LR has been great so far. It is a small school so there's a really great community. Almost everyone I see is a familiar face. All of my professors have been great and they truly care about your success. Sports are a big deal on campus and it's fun to go to all the games. They also have many clubs and organizations to get involved in. One complaint I have is the food. It definitely needs some improvement.
Sophomore,5,"Lenoir-Rhyne University is more than a school- it is my home. I transferred here from a larger school in NC. I have been so pleased with the wonderful professors, the support from on campus staff, and the 20-25 small class size setting. LRU has so much to offer. Including clubs, sporting events, and not to mention that there is almost always something going on on-campus. The surrounding city of Hickory has lots to offer as well, including restaurants, bars, shopping and lots of parks and hiking trails."
Freshman,5,"I am right now a first-year recruit at Lenoir Rhyne College. As you likely know Lenoir Rhyne College is a predominately white school, and being an African American female individuals regularly would have thought I would go someplace like North Carolina Central Or Winston Salem State College, but I chosen against it fair to get myself awkward, since on the off chance that you are as well comfortable, you are not developing. By and large, Lenoir Rhyne College is exceptionally comprehensive and not judgemental. it is a charming curious school, which would be awesome on the off chance that you are a thoughtful person since it is exceptionally little. You see a few of the same faces each day and you start to memorize faces and names."
Sophomore,5,"I like the atmosphere at LR. The professors are wonderful and care about their students. It is a really supportive environment, and is pretty welcoming even as Lutheran university."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy LR. They have made me feel so welcome. I moved 6 hours away to come here and I feel at home on campus. They have best security people on hand to help you with anything. All the RA are super helpful to the freshman. All professors are willing to sit with you in the cafe and help you out.
Sophomore,5,This is my dream school and I am proud to say I attend there now. I would use the money for school so that I could keep going to my dream school. They money would help me keep attending and proceding with my dream college and degree.
Niche User,5,Great school.  I am very thankful for the opportunities that they have offered me.  Their academics have really helped to progress me and give me a huge jump start.
Freshman,5,I love how this university is such a close knit community. The professor really take your time to get to know you.
College Junior,5,I love my school. It is very small and personable. All of the professors are expert and care about each individual. I consider LR as my home away from home.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I have never been scared or felt unsafe on campus.  However, every semester some random man pulls up and flashes the young and unsuspecting college students."
Recent Alumnus,5,Several career fairs occur throughout the year.  Some of the career fairs are for jobs specifically at the school and some of the job fairs are held for other companies throughout the community.
Recent Alumnus,5,LR has something to do all of the time.  All but one of the teachers go above and beyond what is required of them.  I would go to LR again despite the large amount of debt that is accumulating quickly.
College Junior,5,Professors are fantastic. I am a history/politics double major and I have yet to come across a poor professor in my discipline.
College Junior,5,The liberal arts approach to studying is refreshing and forces me to consider the different aspects of my discipline. The professors/faculty are fantastic and the class sizes are small. I would 110% recommend the LR model over any big-school's approach to learning.
College Junior,5,"LR has plenty of opportunities for jobs directly out of college. The career center helps to assist students (and alumni) with job searches and is very useful for identifying and getting in touch with future employers. One thing about LR that most students don't realize is how committed the alumni network is to the university, in particular when it comes to hiring."
College Junior,5,"There is a rich history of fraternities and sororities at LR, greek life has been at LR for the past 80 years. Fraternities at LR are small, but growing while the sororities have been ever present. The addition of Omega Psi Phi has helped bring new life to the fraternities, Pi Kappa Phi has had strong recruiting classes the past few semesters and Theta Xi has been consistently present. Greek life at LR is not really about the partying scene (the school tends to be pretty uptight about Greeks partying on campus) and greeks focus more on brotherhood/sisterhood and philanthropy."
College Junior,5,"The school is roughly 25% made up of athletes (35% if you only include the on-campus population), which at first is a little intimidating to those who aren't affiliated with sports teams. However, after a few weeks new students easily adapt to life at LR. The sports teams perform very well. The sports that draw the most fans are football (who competes nationally every year) and basketball (who typically brings a good sized student section). Some of the low-key sporting events that are always fun are soccer (the students are allowed to sit and heckle on the touchline) and lacrosse."
College Junior,5,"When I first committed to LR I questioned rather I would have a good time (it was a fall back school with deep family roots), however, in the past two years I have come to absolutely love the university. I am convinced that LR has the best faculty/staff out there - the one on one interaction with faulty is absolutely amazing. The school also offers plenty of extra-curriculars/clubs such as intramurals, Greek life, music ensembles, political organizations and more. Also, the school fields some of the best sports teams in DII and the tailgating scene is outstanding for its small size."
College Junior,5,We have a very safe campus and our security does everything in their power to keep us safe and let us know of any crimes in the nearby community.
College Junior,5,I love how small the class sizes are and how wonderful my professors are. They all really care about me and my success.
College Junior,5,I feel very confident about getting a job once I graduate. I feel like our degrees are very valued.
College Junior,5,I have had a wonderful experience in both dorms I have lived in. My housing process has always been fairly easy as well.
College Junior,5,We have a great fan base due to the students on campus and our surrounding community. It is always a fun time and a very inviting environment. We have lots of school spirit.
College Junior,5,Faculty and Staff prepare you for the work force and they help you find internships/ jobs what ever you may need!  I have had two staff members help me get different internships.
College Junior,5,I love living on campus! Living with my peers are great. I am always talking and interacting with staff and residents.
College Junior,5,"Lenoir-Rhyne University is great! The faculty and staff is very helpful and helps prepare you for the real world. The professors are tough but will help you every step of the way! Athletics are a big part of Lenoir-Rhyne, especially football! GO LR Bears!"
College Freshman,5,"There was one incident last year, but I and everyone I know feels extremely safe on campus are great. The people in security are the best, they know people by name if you go to see them"
College Freshman,5,Everything that the people in administration do help with this
College Freshman,5,The professors are the best at LR as anywhere. They really do care about you and your grades and success.
College Freshman,5,Great athletics and it is a huge part of life at LR
College Freshman,5,Probably the best decision I could have made. Unlike a big school I really feel like all professors care and students alike. My only complaint of right now would be slow wifi and the cafeteria food gets old.
College Freshman,5,"You guys just don't know what to do with the Honor's students, do ya? Either way, I love this school. Wouldn't have it any other way."
College Freshman,5,"Guys, if you're afraid about applying to college, this is your safety net school in North Carolina. Get that FAFSA and scholarship money up, and this place is very laid back. I slacked off quite a bit and am paying for it, but everyone within the school is there to help you. We have a wonderful Dean of students, amazing, understanding professors. The curriculum is a bit easier than what you could expect at, say, UNC, but the class sizes are also smaller. More 1 on 1 with the professors. Registration is a breeze. If you're looking for a safety net, or just want to get the initial ""I need ONE acceptance letter to stop freaking out,"" try here. Laid back."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is friendly, and teachers help in anything"
College Freshman,5,The dining prices off-campus is the best. I love going to cracker barrel which is located down the street. The prices don't even exceed 10 dollars.
College Freshman,5,"Many of the students have great school spirit. The team has many great players, and none of them are jerks."
College Freshman,5,The availability is pretty good.
Sophomore,4,I like the small feel of Lenoir-Rhyne. Lenoir-Rhyne offers a lot of help to those in need of assistance on campus.
Sophomore,4,I really like the small class sizes.  You get to really know the instructors and they get to know you. They are easy to talk to since the classes are so small.  I wish there was more parking for commuting students.
Freshman,4,"I like Lenoir-Rhyne Athletics, they have very good Athletic teams, also very good coaches and dorms but the tuition needs to change"
Junior,4,"My overall experience with Lenoir-Rhyne University has been pretty good thus far. This fall is my first semester as a transfer student from CVCC and it has been a bit of a hassle getting everything transferred over and also the communication within the admissions department isn't very good, but I am hoping that after this semester, everything will run much more smoothly from here on out."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Lenoir-Rhyne has been very good so far. I changed my major and they made it very easy to do so. The only thing that I would change would be the cost. It is a private school so I knew it would be a little more expensive than a public school, but I would like to see a decrease in the tuition price."
Niche User,4,I have had a fairly good experience with Lenoir-Rhyne University. The admissions department is super nice and fairly easy to get ahold of.
Senior,4,"I really enjoy this school. Class sizes are small and and professors are very supportive and are willing to help. While I don't mind liberal arts education, I would rather skip taking a few classes and focus more on my majors."
Senior,4,"I love Lenoir Rhyne. However, the buildings are outdated. We pay a lot of money to attend this school, so where is our money going? LR has a wonderful campus life and everyone is really nice. The professors are smart and they want to see you succeed. LR feels like a family environment. The food options include the cafe, subway, and grill works. We do not have much like other universities because this is a small campus."
Niche User,4,This is a small campus with small class sizes. The faculty is extremely helpful and involved and you are known by them personally and not just a #.
Junior,4,"I have been given the opportunity to become more independent and further my leadership skills while also growing academically. I came to LR in the first year of the new marching band, The Spirit of LR. It has been exciting to watch this amazing music program continue to bloom. I was invited to apply, and was accepted into the Broyhill Leadership Institute during my sophomore year. Through is program I have had new experiences that are actually leading to an exciting trip to Greece this spring. I have earned more responsibilities through my workstudy at the campus library where I am being promoted to a supervisor position in next semester. All of these opportunities have occurred while working toward obtaining my degree in Graphic Design. My advisor has been extremely supportive in helping map out my academic plan so I am well prepared. I have had a few challenges along the way, but have been blessed with supportive professors, staff and campus friends."
Graduate Student,4,"The campus is small and the staff are all very polite. As a new comer to the campus, I had some trouble my first day finding where I needed to go and the students I ran into  were very good about directing me where I needed to go. Everyone I have interacted with from the school post my acceptable have done well at informing me what I need to do next."
Alum,4,Campus is beautiful in the foothills of the mountains. Diverse environment. Great professors and administration. Multiple choices in academics.
Freshman,4,"I love the small classroom sizes and the one on one help that you are able to receive from the professors. I’m not a huge fan of the living situations and I feel as if our facilities could be updated more for the price that we pay, but overall I love my school and the greek life we have here!"
Junior,4,"I am a Junior at LR. This school fits in with my personality. If you are a person that wants the sports life and participate in extra curricular activities, this school will provide you with the opportunity to do so. However; if you choose to focus on academics, there is a good  relationships that can be had with professors. The neighborhood feels safe and the campus is clean."
Sophomore,4,"The university is a great place to go to college if you want a place that is close to your home and if you want a college that gives you excellent knowledge in the field you are going for.  The university also as small class sizes so that you get a better experience with your professors, where the professors have more time to help you learn your field.  The professors also are great and easy to talk to if you need help, by either face to face meetings or by email or canvas website.   The whole college experience is outstanding except for one thing that I do not like and that is having to go to convocation meetings when if you are an off campus student."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the smaller class sizes and the quality of instruction I've received from all my teachers. In addition to this, there are plenty of organizations and student groups for students to participate in. Regarding what changes I'd like to see: 
1)A multi-level parking deck for commuting students
2) Renovations done to the interior of the Rhyne Building (particularly the heating and cooling system)"
Junior,4,Overall it is great. However there are some issues with administration and with getting in touch with people in business offices.
Senior,4,"I like that the professors are willing to help and make it a priority to learn everyone's name. The students are people and not just a number. All staff, including security and cafeteria staff, were friendly. I feel like the food could be potentially better. The dorms need more attention than what they get. Cheap paint and having to deal with mold constantly is terrible."
Senior,4,I have enjoyed my overall attendance so far of this university because you do meet some interesting people that come from different backgrounds and cultures. The best person you will meet is Pastor Weisner.
Alum,4,"The campus at Lenoir-Rhyne University is stunning!  It is one of the smaller college campus' if you compare it to colleges like Duke, NC State or others but it is friendly, family-like, and faculty is concerned about you.  The class size is small so that as a student you get to know your professor and they get to know you.  You are not a number, you are a person.  That makes learning much more meaningful."
Freshman,4,"I love the look of the school and the small campus makes it easy to get around. The professors are very good and easy to work with.  There is lots of academic help on campus from both the professors and peer tutors.  So far my classes have been challenging in a good way and I have grown and learned a lot. The only downside is that I'm a vegetarian and from a large city with lots of good food options, so I miss that."
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman at Lenoir-Rhyne University and am pleased with my growing education there. The professors are very helpful and the students are welcoming and friendly. The campus is just about the perfect size and so beautiful with nice tall trees and fresh green grass. I recommend this college to everyone.
Junior,4,"What  like about the University is the Student to Professor ratio. It allows for a closer connection to your professors, increasing your chance at success. Improvement I believe this school needs is more food places to spend your meal plan at."
Freshman,4,"Lenoir-Rhyne is a pretty good school. I commute so there's not much keeping me around other than classes. I enjoy the size, it's a smaller school, so you get to know professors instead of being just another number."
Sophomore,4,"A great school that is full of people who genuinely want to see you succeed as a student. The professors are very personal. Many improvements to campus over the past several years have greatly increased the appeal of this school. The biggest issue are the terrible freshmen dorms. Small, dirty, too hot/cold. Thats my biggest complaint."
Recent Alumnus,4,Everyone seems relaxed when in their dorms.
Recent Alumnus,4,Greek life plans different activities throughout the year for the students.  Some of the activities may include throwing a pie at your teacher to raise breast cancer awareness or selling pinwheels to raise awareness of abuse victims.
Recent Alumnus,4,There is much school spirit at LR.  Free shirts and other bonuses (like a semester of free tuition) are given out to the students at some of the athletic events.
Recent Alumnus,4,I had a very easy admissions experience with LRU.  The staff was helpful and I was given a decision within a few weeks
College Junior,4,"There are good parties just about every weekend. The best parties are typically thrown by the Soccer Team, Lacrosse Team, Pi Kappa Phi and Omega Psi Phi (at local clubs)."
College Junior,4,"The party scene at LR typically revolves around one of three things - each with their own pros/cons - on campus fraternity parties, off campus house parties, local clubs/bars. Fraternity parties (especially Pi Kappa Phi) are great when they are not on suspension. The houses are easy to walk to and the parties are huge, unfortunately the school (particularly security and the greek life coordinator) are overly strict with the fraternities and are quick to put them on social probation. Off campus house parties are typically put on by the different athletic teams, these parties are really fun, but very exclusive and if you choose to go you will likely have to run from the police at some point. The local clubs have events (typically hosted by Omega Psi Phi) most weekends, and these events draw a large percentage of the students, and can get very rowdy and crowded."
College Junior,4,"There is a decent amount of racial diversity on campus, however, most of the non-white students are athletes. Most everybody is some form of Christian - the school is ELCA Lutheran and probably 15% of students are Lutheran, however, the majority of students come from a baptist background. If you asked the whole student population their political affiliation I wouldn't be surprised if a slight majority came from republican households, however, for the most part students are apathetic to politics (although there is a very strong College Republican chapter). I would say that the students are very accepting and welcoming of diversity."
College Junior,4,"I feel 100% safe and secure on campus. Apart from petty crimes of opportunity and the occasional streaker in Price Village, there is no crime at LR."
College Sophomore,4,"My experience at my school so far is that I have found every person that I have encountered  to be very kind and always  wiling to help. I think that if I had to go through the process of picking my school again, I would make the same decision, I feel like this school is a perfect fit for me."
College Freshman,4,Security is very nice and helpful. I always feel safe around campus.
College Freshman,4,The professors are very helpful. There are many courses offered at multiple times. The classes are small and interactive.
College Freshman,4,The athletics compete against some hard teams but have good seasons. A lot of students come and support the athletics.
College Freshman,4,The faculty are very helpful and the campus is very nice.
College Junior,4,I think that the greek students are typically viewed as just typical students. Greek students have many friends who are not greek.
College Junior,4,I love the professors at my school. Just because of them I would choose Lenoir-Rhyne all over again if I had to.
College Junior,4,"Love the faculty! They are tough but helpful, they want you to succeed!"
College Junior,4,Security and Residence life does a great job in securing the resident halls and campus!
College Sophomore,4,"The professors have mastered their fields, and they are doing a great job of teaching me what I need to know"
College Sophomore,4,"The football team is the main focus in athletics, but they do a great job"
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very helpful in and out of the classroom
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly, the biggest problem is the wifi and the cafeteria food. The professors I have want their students to succeed; they try their best and I feel that they really want to get to know me and help me. My advisor and my teachers in my majors (psychology and sociology) are so helpful and amazing! Even teachers who aren't in my major clearly want me to succeed too. I really do love my school."
College Freshman,4,Their nursing program is one of the best. The staff and students are terrific as well.
College Sophomore,4,"I attended Lenoir-Rhyne for a little over a semester before my schooling was interrupted. When I was back on my feet I enrolled at a community college where I stayed for a semester before I became homesick for Lenoir-Rhyne. I reapplied, and it was one of the best decisions of my life."
College Freshman,4,Had to give 4/5. Lost a point because many are rude.
College Freshman,4,You can get a free tutor to help in any class
College Freshman,4,"A 5 minute drive and you'll find a mall, and tons of restaurants"
College Freshman,4,Got half of it paid by school
College Freshman,4,They have lots to do during weekday
College Freshman,4,"You can get free tutors, if you have trouble in class"
College Freshman,4,"Its not that difficult, and if it is you can call."
College Freshman,4,"The partying and night life seem great, but I do not party. I mainly focus on my work."
College Freshman,4,Greeks are not treated any different from any of the other students.
College Freshman,4,The people on the campus are very supportive to sexual assault victims.
College Freshman,4,"I like the fact that we can have dorm visitation. There is a curfew, but it is around 11 or 12"
College Sophomore,4,A good mix of local and chain restaurants
Alum,2,"My daughter met many great people there and made some life long friends. That is the best thing I have to say about them. Since her first semester and each one after, her schedule, prereqs, course load, graduation track, etc. has been messed up. We got responses from advisors like ""my bad"". One advisor told her she was NOT going to get into grad school with her 3.0 GPA and she shouldn't bother trying to get into a class. I spoke to several administrative people who noted there was a problem and they were working on it but they would not have things straightened up in time to help my daughter's situation. She was a 3 sport athlete and employee in the library there, yet she was still ""not good enough"" for them to actually put effort in for I suppose. 
Guess What?! She got into grad school at Lenior-Rhyne. Where the debauchery continued. After completing this year, she will be attending another University where they actually do care about the students."
Alum,2,"This is not a good place for a person to get there education, because the teachers protect themselves and cheat the system when they have done something wrong. Students are not heard there. Even the dean was very rude while dealing with an appeal. Teachers are allowed to do how they want like different grading scales. Also LR covers up a lot of stuff that no one looks into."
College Junior,2,If I could do it all over again I would have honestly not chose this school as my number one. The landscape of this school is very beautiful and well kept but the organization of the school itself is a mess. The website of this college is very confusing because it will sometime revert you back to the old one. Another thing is the cost to go to this school. This university is one of the most expensive in the state of North Carolina and will eventually lose enrollment because of the high cost.
College Freshman,2,"For what you are paying, it is not worth it to live on campus. It would be cheaper to live off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"If you aren't personally invited, then it's hard to be aware of parties that are going on"
College Sophomore,2,There aren't a lot of parties on campus
College Freshman,2,"There have been a few crimes since I've been here. Girl was roofied her first semester here, so definitely kept an eye out, but there was nothing else similar to that happenings since. There aren't fights, but there may be some loud yelling very rarely. I don't feel scared or intimidated, all these guys are harmless if you play your cards right. Our police though can be meh. That was when it was TOO strict, but it has toned down and it's nice. This one does his job, does it well, but let's you do you if you're not a belligerent ass. For standard state police, you'll hear them coming along the road every 20 or so seconds. It's the same with ambulances and firetrucks, so try to get used to that."
College Freshman,2,"I hope Lenoir-Rhyne staff reads this. I wholeheartedly understand that it's the company (Cisco?) that's in charge of the dining services in the cafeteria, but there must be another way. You have to realize that there will be some people who will refuse to eat it ""because it tastes off;"" but just as well, there are people who ONLY have cafe to eat, and therefore will simply stomach through it. There is zero flexibility in Bear Bucks, either. I can buy a sandwich that I already can get on meal equivalency, or I can get a pizza that will take up ~1/5 of my Bear Bucks.

We would like to see more options, not just things to satisfy the people who go here now, but simply to bring LR's community together. Give the ID card some more use."
College Senior,2,Not many clubs nearby.  Most people just went to Charlotte.
College Freshman,2,"Non reliable times, same and average food, non-dependable service."
College Freshman,2,"The computers themselves is not the problem. The wifi here is terrible, and really needs an upgrade. They did make it a little bit better in the dorm rooms by adding in additional routers, but overall the internet just needs to be overhauled"
College Freshman,2,"The majority of the people who live ion campus have cars and money. So the school decided to take away the shuttle which, does not help people who cannot afford to get a car much less ride the bus. They did not inform us that the shuttle was going till we moved in on move in day."
College Freshman,2,"I'm from an island along the equator, so the temperature doesn't drop below 50 degrees. So it's a huge change to the mountainous weather. "
College Freshman,2,The registration process is terrible as a freshman. I was registered late my fall semester and no one knew about any classes and there were  really none to pick from. Make sure you triple check to make sure you are taking the correct classes for your major!
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, Lenoir-Rhyne doesn't have much of a ""night life"" at all. It's just the location in Hickory, there isn't much going on here."
College Senior,2,Nightlife is not very good here compared to others schools I have seen.
College Senior,2,Our dining options are not very good. There is fairly low quality and stuff has been consistently under cooked.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The Charlotte airport is 56 minutes from campus. There is a LOCAL service called Hickory Hops (approx $40) that can take you to the airport, but this is not campus provided. In extreme cases or emergencies, campus security can come pick you up and take you back to campus. There is now a new public bus line that the city of Hickory implemented, but I have not utilized it or know its stops in proximity to the campus."
College Sophomore,2,You have to arrive early to get a decent parking spot that doesn't make you have to walk a mile to get to class.
College Sophomore,2,"Besides telling me to fill out FAFSA, they only recommended one website, CFNC.org. I have done all the work on my own to find scholarships."
Alum,1,They doubled the normal class size by combining the satellite sites. How is small and friendly equivalent to 80+ students from all over the state in one zoom call?
Freshman,1,"Easy Admissions process but that's how they get you caught up. If you are a person of
color I do not recommend this school at all because it is a hostile environment more often than not. The business office and financial aid do not like to cooperate when you need them. The cafeteria food is not good and it does not stay clean. The dishes are not even washed properly. The Dean and President swear they are there when you need them but they brush your issues aside and ignore your emails. Me and many of last year's freshman class left because our experience was terrible. And being a student athlete wasn't much better."
Freshman,1,"I'm one of the few African American students that attends Lenoir Rhyne University. It is not the proper school to choose if you are an individual of color. There are zero activities or support for us. I am also a pescatarian, and that is very difficult here considering the fact I have to use my own money to buy food from the supermarket. They have no options in the cafe for individuals like myself. Everything closes at 7 o'clock, so if you have no money to purchase outside food, you have to wait till the next morning. All of the school's funding goes to the football team and its players. I know this because I am a student-athlete."
Sophomore,1,"This is the worst school you could possibly go to as a student. The faculty is nice but all of the money goes to athletics. I was told the cafeteria stays open 24/7 so students are able to snack. It closes (locked) at 8. Students are also finding roaches in their food. I have stopped eating at school which sucks because it's a waste of money. I was told there is always fun stuff going on...this is the most boring school. Nothing is ever going on. They have many clubs and stuff but they are for people who are gay, black, vegan, stuff you title yourself with. I'm a straight white woman who likes to eat steak and out of their many clubs I dont fit any of them. I have many hobbies but they dont have clubs for people who like sports, they dont have clubs for people who like music, they dont have clubs for people with hobbies.  This school is made out to be so amazing and it is such a let down."
Senior,1,Where does all of our tuition go? They take all of our money and give us absolutely nothing in return. The faculty is very nice but the resources and campus are horrible and if you are not on a popular sports team that is in season you are not able to access anything good.
Senior,1,"School has some very kind faculty and the small classes are great for one on one help. However if you are not on a sports team you are not of much value in anyone's eyes at this school. The school is also severely overpriced and the money is not seen through any of the resources. They do not provide great athletic/exercise accessibility to anyone that is not an athlete or in season as an athlete. Many of the dorms are also very poorly maintained. With a tuition as high as this, you would think that you would see it carry over in to some aspect of student life. Social life is enjoyable at first. If you enjoyed high school, Lenoir Rhyne is no different. It is not as much of a college experience as it is simply a bigger high school. If given the chance I would have gone almost anywhere else.If all you care about is getting one on one time with faculty members, then this school is perfect. Otherwise,the negatives far outweigh the few positives."
College Freshman,1,Not really much nightlife. LR is a very peaceful school.
College Freshman,1,They did not explain the financial aid packet well. Other than my sister and myself we are the ones who are going to college. When my mother went to college things were different and she could not explain it to me. I almost lost my financial aid. I was able to get it but I got less than what I would have gotten. I had something incomplete of my packet that I was not aware of or told about until the end of the semester. 
College Freshman,1,"There are only four places to eat on campus; the cafe, bear's lair, subway and cub's pub. Mainly they all serve the same thing, except for cub's pub which serves all kinds of coffee. "
College Freshman,1,"I was told it was a bus to take you around places, but there isn't any bus. If you don't have a car or a friend on campus who owns a car and would be willing to take you around, you are out of luck. "
College Sophomore,1,I do not know much about off-campus housing. It is not explained very well
College Junior,1,"I Honestly Can't Think of Anything – I never thought about it but...I can't think of anything outstanding.  I'm not trying to bash the school or say it's horrible because it's fine, but there isn't anything outstanding here.  I do like the small campus size, but it's a big downfall for other people because there isn't much to do.  I also like how there are free pool tables and foosball, but they are in pretty bad shape due to heavy usage.  LR is known for a good nursing program.  We are getting a new chapel.  The unique thing about LR is it's small size campus is about a 10 minute walk from one side to the other.  It's great because you'll see about everyone you know at least once in the day."
College Senior,1,"Drinking is everywhere. Most people can get it, even if they aren't 21. And the school doesn't do a good job of enforcing the ""no alcohol"" policy."

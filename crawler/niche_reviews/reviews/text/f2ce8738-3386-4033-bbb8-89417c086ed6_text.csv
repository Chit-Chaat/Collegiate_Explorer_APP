Sophomore,5,The online experience was very relaxed and easy. The teachers made sure everything was very clear so that none of the work was complicated . They were always easy to contact and fast to reply.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely loved the school. From beginning to end the staff and students were so overwhelmingly welcoming. They always did everything to include everyone in everything and bind us all together with God. The sports were competitive and all the students supported every athlete at every sport! For such a small school they sure can create a big family at a fast rate! The teachers were also a huge help and they are very realistic with everything and are very hands with students to secure success.
Sophomore,5,"I really like SCU! There is always an event going on here and things to do, even for a small campus. Because the campus is small, everyone knows everyone, making friends easy to happen. The professors are always available and are willing to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,What I like about southwestern Christian University is the care they give when enrolling and all the needs they’ve met for students. Making sure all students take the classes they need and want for their specific area of study.
Niche User,5,My daughter is currently a freshman here and is on the softball team. It is a nice small school. She enjoys her classes and her softball team.
Senior,5,Great online program! It's just a great school. The professors are very helpful and they are very encouraging. I've been able to learn more about God's word and still complete my studies. I'm very happen with my decision in furthering my education at SWCU!!!!!!
Freshman,5,"Everyone is so friendly and truly cares about you.  They want you to succeed as much as you do.  The moment I stepped on campus, I knew this was the place where I was suppose to be.  You can truly feel God's presence on this campus."
College Junior,5,Campus life and dorms are nice and comfortable.
College Junior,5,Our security is really good and we don't ever have issues on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Sometimes it sucks because you get stuck on campus when it snows A LOT, but is good because classes get canceled(:"
College Junior,5,"Considering I am am online student the technical support has been excellent!! The systems are never down, and student support is always quick to help with any concerns"
College Sophomore,5,A very wide variety of political opinions.
College Sophomore,5,"I have my own laptop, but if I had needed one, the school would have provided one to me.  The courses, labs, and all other forms needed for computer work is very easy to access."
College Sophomore,5,"I checked out several schools before I found SCU.   After I had chosen one, I found SCU.  I called and quickly changed my mind and my school.  SCU offers courses and rules that follow my own way of life.  I chose SCU because it is a Christian school and the values that they view are the values and views I believe in.  I could not be happier with a school and any difficulty I have, the Student Support staff is ready and willing to help.  When I started in Febuary 2013, I had no computer skills and my Student Support contact helped me through all of the learning.  I have now a working knowledge of my laptop and am currently carrying a 3.25 GPA.  Thanks to God and all the staff and Professors at Southwestern Christian University!"
College Sophomore,5,"The Financial Department has the most helpful people.  They are very easy to talk to and very, very nice."
College Sophomore,5,I have read and accepted all of the conditions of being a student of SCU and understand what rule-breaking would infer.
College Junior,5,Not hard at all. The process is barely intense and it is definitely worth a look see.
College Junior,5,"Yes, I am looking forward to counseling. It will be an exciting field to study. "
College Junior,5,"I am not sure the cost because I have not received one but, I would think it would be low cost."
College Junior,5,"I know it is Oklahoma, but our downtown area is starting to build up and it is really nice to see life in the city."
College Junior,5,"The finical aid department is very helpful. When you need something, they are there to help.  "
College Junior,5,I feel the atmosphere is fun and energetic! 
College Junior,5,They recently just updated some of their facilities and have added some nice places to hang. 
College Junior,5,Lots of people to hang out with and I love the nights during the spring due to the activities the school has for it's students.
College Junior,5,"You get the best of both worlds. The saying is ""it's Oklahoma"" when the weather is known to change from time to time really fast."
College Junior,5,It's a very safe environment! The personal is staffed well and very nice to be acquainted with. 
College Junior,5,I enjoy the amenities the University provides to us students. 
College Junior,5,"I felt the campus is organized and well kept. Causing everyone to appreciate the campus. Therefore, this causing the campuses policy to sound strict. "
College Junior,5,"It is a small university where you should know everybody. I love the location, close to the Oklahoma "
College Junior,5,I have attended the school on occasion and I have not seen any possible traits of doing drugs or having alcohol. 
College Senior,5,I think we do a great job with diversity
College Junior,5,"The opportunity to get help, and be successful is amazing at SCU. Due to the smaller university environment, students are more capable of accessing help from Professors, who are wonderful, Christian, hard-working teachers. They take extra care into ensuring success for every student and are all passionate about what they do. There are chapel services that provide GREAT opportunity for students to get involved in ministry and in worship, and the effort that is made by the instructors is fantastic. I strongly believe in the Academics here at Southwestern."
College Sophomore,5,"I personally do not have an apartment and cannot afford one at this point in time. I am playing basketball and trying to keep up with school. It would be pretty hard to juggle school, basketball, and a great job that could help me pay the bills each month. I have heard that the apartments by our school ""Rockwell Plaza"" are nice, good looking apartments. They are not a descent price if you were trying to get a roommate to share with you. However, the rooms are not that big and the rent is not too cheap. The location of the apartments are very convenient because they are not too far from the school. Students get to school within 5 min and that comes in handy. Being close to the school allows students to be able to get to class on time. Also most importantly, students are able to save gas! The apartments have a park and looks like a safe environment. I heard that the landlords are very friendly and will work with you when you explain to them your situation."
College Sophomore,5,"The school is really strict. There can't be any girls in the boys dorms or any boys in the girls dorms at all times. For all classes you get up to 10 absences, it doesn't matter if it is excused or not. 2 tardies = 1 absent. Dress code is strictly enforced and there will be consequences if not followed. Curfew is at 10 o'clock so if you want to study with a friend it has to be done early. If a student parks a little bit off of the yellow line in the parking spot to the side then they will be written up for a warning. Other than that the rest of the rules are common sense rules to abide by."
College Senior,5,"The internship program is phenomenal. I love that I get college credit to intern at a church and gain experience for the rest of my life. I am in my senior year and plan to graduate in May 2014, knowing full well that I will be prepared to enter into my own ministry. This takes up a majority of my time but it is well worth it because I know that my work is not in vain."
College Senior,5,"I love the biblical studies program at SCU. I feel like the teachers are very knowledgeable of the subjects they are teaching and really care about the well-being of their students. The workload is pretty average for college students. With the semester outlined in the syllabus, it is easy to plan your schedule around exams and papers."
College Junior,5,"The community and atmosphere is awesome, we're like a family!"
College Freshman,5,"The student recreation center is the best place for entertainment. The environment is fun, safe, and great place to meet people.  The center has video games, table games, music and a tv.  I won't have to leave campus.I can stay focused since I'm a freshman."
College Freshman,5,"After touring the Campus of Southwestern Christian University, I feel confident that the school will have computers available for students to complete assignments. I also noticed student support in the lab I visited. I know most students will have their own computers, but the university is set up to provide computer labs if needed.  The school is set up for student success."
College Freshman,5,Great attention and small classes give students and teachers more interaction to help understand material and questions. Therefore helping us as students succeed.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Scu was great not just because I moved out of the house but because of the connections I made with different people all around the world. The teaching staff and administrations were some of the best people I've ever met in my life. They didn't just make me feel like a sad freshman, they made me feel like family."
Freshman,4,"Great small school with a good location.  It is a very small campus, so everyone knows everyone.  For the campus being so small, there are a lot of things going on.  There are SGA events and athletic events happening all of the time.  There are two new sets of dorms that are very night and the location is near everything in OKC."
Senior,4,Great school! Needs to drop old bible college rules and go into a full liberal arts college to keep retention up.
Senior,4,"I'm​ in the adult studies, I love it, it fit in with my schedule, and that it's a Christian University"
Junior,4,"I like the student to professor ratio. It gives us students more individual time with the professor if need be. 
I like the diversity of the students. An estimated 30% of the students are forgieners. Also also like the location. SWCU is just on the outskirts of downtown OKC, located in Bethany. With only a 15 minute drive, one could find themselves at the front door of the Chesapeake Areana, home of the Thunder. There's quite a lot to do in OKC. Ones first impression may say that the city is small and scattered, but if you look hard enough there is great things there. Same with SWCU. The opportunities that SWCU off are just about limitless. The relationship one might build with fellow students, could be some of the most important ones in life. Who knows when one might need to travel to London, South Africa, or Victoria Australia, to make a business deal? 
Great school in my opinion. You just have to look deeper and find the great things within."
College Sophomore,4,"Because the school is so small, the threat level is not high like at a state school. Generally, you feel safe walking alone on campus because every building is so close."
College Sophomore,4,"At Southwestern, every person that I have been in contact with has been kind and friendly and you can truly tell they are out for your best interest. They are there to help you, in whatever field of study you may want to go into, and they are well equipped to equip you in your future area of work. They promote good attitudes and strong relationships amongst the student body, as well as for us to look past everyones differences and stand together; unified on one level."
College Junior,4,Don't have a career center.
College Junior,4,"Not the best teams, but we believe we can win!"
College Junior,4,"SWCU is a small campus, but it's a great school!"
College Junior,4,The dorms are very nice and you have to use your school ID in order to get in the buildings and the halls.
College Senior,4,"It has a small town kind of feel, but there is quite a bit of history if you go looking for it."
College Senior,4,"I have not been to any games myself, but I have heard at sporting events there is a lot of attendance."
College Senior,4,I have not had any issues with the staff.
College Senior,4,Like it is listed above. Enough diversity to keep it interesting.
College Senior,4,"I don't live on campus, but I have seen the housing and it was very very nice!"
College Senior,4,Just turn in the stuff that is needed and your financial aid process will go smoothly.
Recent Alumnus,4,THe diversity club works hard for all the students to feel welcomed and loved on campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Eating off-campus gives a lot of options, and lots of different cuisines to try."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I spend a lot of time on campus, being involved in a lot of on campus clubs, and different employment."
Recent Alumnus,4,"At my school, we have over 150 campus clubs, and most everyone knows everyone else and has met the dean of my faculty... so much that he knows everyone by name!"
College Sophomore,4,I absolutely love the Dean over my department.
College Freshman,4,Greeks are very involved in the community and are upstanding citizens.
College Freshman,4,I love my classes that are geared toward psychology.
College Junior,4,I like it. Great teachers and students. 
College Junior,4,"Professors and Staff are extremely helpful. For students who enjoy a smaller classroom setting and a more personal relationship with their professors and not teachers assistants, SCU is a perfect environment. All of my professors and then some know me by my first name and treat me with respect and understanding. SCU is a Christian University and provides fantastic Bible classes with very impressive and knowledgeable professors. Being a smaller university, about 500+ students, getting in touch and connecting with all faculty and staff is much easier.
There are many work-study programs that are very flexible with the students schedule.
The workload I would say is about average depending on the amount of hours you are enrolled in, and Professors are very helpful and understanding of students schedules due to the more personal relationship that is available.
I am currently a part of an AMAZING Internship, and there are others, called Victory School of Leadership where I will get my degree in three years in Christian Leadership and learn hands-on ministry at the local Victory Church. 
The opportunities are endless if you are determined and serious about finding them.
"
College Junior,4,"SCU is very well located. For quick and convenient, there is a gas station that is less than a block away, just right across the street. There are tons of fast food options for affordable and quick options, and a short drive to the city can provide you with endless options and a great environment to enjoy the downtown area and see what Oklahoma City is all about. "
College Junior,4,"The policy at SCU makes it a great environment concerning the use of drugs and alcohol. There are consequences that effectively keep drugs and alcohol of campus. There are of course students that make poor decisions and push limits, but for the most part, the regulations and policies are very much a part of campus life. Not in a way that is overbearing. In a way that is respectable and gives a feeling of security. Due to the curfew, that is absolutely reasonable, students must be back in their dorms by curfew. Each room is checked at the time of curfew, which for some is annoying, but for those who understand, there is a feeling of protection and security. Use of drugs and alcohol is never visible on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Even though we are a small school, our athletics are a big thing! We have a lot of student/faculty support and school spirit and the teams train hard. The majority of our school is involved in athletics and it's fun yet challenging for us to become better. We have athletes from around the world and our teams are like a family."
College Sophomore,4,"The weather is pretty great most of the time and the sunsets are amazing. It can be a bit windy and chilly sometimes and we had a couple days this past year where school either got delayed or closed because of sleet or snow, but overall I enjoy the weather. When its cold or rainy it is not that bad because our campus is small so you don't have to be outside long."
College Sophomore,4,There is a number of apartment complexes nearby and they vary on cost. Bryan Hill is the apartment complex closest to the school that a lot of students live at and I believe is the cheapest around. There are also some small houses around that you could rent if you can afford it with a friend or two. They aren't far from school and they are in a pretty good location.
College Junior,4,"There are plenty of affordable apartment complexes nearby. The amenities are unbeatable and almost all fo them are within minutes of the campus as well as other conveniences like Target, WalMart, fast-food restaurants, and shopping malls."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a curfew at SCU. However, you can sign out whenever you need to if it is approved by your RA.  If I want to stay out past 1 or 2 I will go stay at a friends house."
College Sophomore,4,Very seldom do I have to worry about parking.  I almost always am able to park in the same spot every day.  The only time I worry about parking is when there is a big event.
College Sophomore,4,"Southwestern Christian University provides a safe environment for it's students.  The students are held to a high standard, and therefore theft and bad pranks are almost unheard of.  There are always security guards on duty and I have never felt unsafe on campus."
College Sophomore,4,Its not very noticeable but every once in a while there will be students smoking marijuana in a dorm room and they try to cover it up with lots of air freshener. The only way I knew about this was the fact that it was my suite mates. Now one else even knew there was any drugs on campus. Its usually just about 2 or 3 guys on campus and smoking marijuana is the only drug scence at this college.
College Senior,4,Love It – It has equipped me and is continuing to prepare me for the future.
College Senior,4,The people at this college are very easy to work with.
College Senior,4,This school offers many different opportunities to get hands on experience with your future occupation as well as teaching the basics and extensive material to succeed in these areas.
College Senior,4,This school offers a wide variety of majors along with an amazing campus feel that is feels very welcoming.
Junior,2,"It's an okay campus, and the people are friendly. But they treat you like you're 12. Although there is no more curfew, you still can't do anything. You can't party, God forbid you touch any alcohol even if you're 21. They'll put you on probation for anything. Drinks, PROBATION. Touches any substance that the university doesn't agree with, PROBATION. Doesn't go to chapel 28 times, PROBATION. It's actually ridiculous.  Athletic facilities are pretty dumpy. The equipment looks like it was bought from a retirement home. Equipment is broken and takes forever to get fixed. Most of the coaching staff is nice so I guess that's okay. The trainers do their best, they're okay. At times they make questionable decisions. The gym is about what you'd expect from a small school. The cafeteria food is not the best, but the manager is a great dude and tries his best. He doesn't have much to work with in the first place, and the budget isn't much so you can't blame him for the crappy quality."
College Junior,2,Most students who graduate from SCU turn around and start working for them the day after due to the fact that their degree isn't adequate enough to get a job outside of SCU.
College Junior,2,"We don't offer course each year. We offer a select few courses and classes to choose from. Also, when it comes to taking a lab you should probably rethink it. All labs are online and you don't get much out of them."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It takes so long to receive, and then no one is available to help when there are questions."
College Freshman,2,"No drinking, no partying, no boys in rooms"
College Freshman,2,"The internet connection does not always work and it is hard to study or use resources or documents online because it is so slow. The computer labs are alright, but they always seem crowded at the most important times."
College Senior,2,I think that we need more security on campus
College Junior,2,"The curfew at Southwestern is somewhat ridiculous! The Residential staff are strict about what time you are in your rooms. There is also a strict dress code that people can be written up about. And quiet hours are between 11pm-8am. You also have to attend chapel 23 times per semester or you will be put on a ""spiritual life probation."""
College Freshman,1,no going out allowed at school.
College Senior,1,"They were getting back with me late, and the lines were long"

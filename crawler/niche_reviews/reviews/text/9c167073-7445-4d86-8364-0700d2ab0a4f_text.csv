Junior,5,"At UCSD, many instructors use pre-recorded lectures, discussion forum, and online office hours to teach classes. Due to the COVID, many students from other countries went back to their home countries. Instructors at UCSD prefer to use asynchronous lectures to help these students who are not in Pacific Time zone. This also benefits students who wants flexible schedule."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student at UCSD, and UCSD impressed me by its diversity and academic aspects. To be specific, I saw that there are various and different people in the compus, and there are many ""teaching"" professors.
Another thing that UCSD impressed me is the career center and career fairs. More specifically, UCSD provides various help and way to help students to get a job or find internship."
Senior,5,"The school has been a wonderful experience for me. I have met a lot of cool friends, and professors that have helped shaped me into the person I am today."
Sophomore,5,"When taking online classes for Spring 2020, it was more challenging personally to adjust to the at-home setting; I lost motivation, didn't attend lectures, etc. I ended up getting good grades, but I don't think I actually got much out of the class itself than I usually do for in-person classes (The school also provided the option for you to set the grading preference as Pass/No Pass instead of letter grading for any class including major requirements). The professors and the TAs were very considerate for these conditions, as they thought about how much of a dramatic change it was. I also took 2 summer session classes online, and it was a great experience (rushed, but expected). Not having to pay for on-campus housing to attend summer classes was a huge plus, and having no midterms helped a lot."
Freshman,5,It is amazing. The campus is huge making it have a lot of freedom of movement and soul. Very diverse which is always a big plus.
Freshman,5,I personally did not participate in the online portion of learning so I cannot cgive constructive feedback on this topic.
Freshman,5,San Diego was absolutely university and I couldn't recommend it enough. The campus was absolutely beautiful and there were numerous opportunities and tools to help you on your way to success.
Alum,5,"The professors were
absolutely incredible. The classes I took have prepared me well for PA school as well as any tests that needed to be taken, i.e. GRE."
Alum,5,The availability of podcasts at UCSD has made in extremely easy for virtual learning. The recordings make it seem like you are actually in class.
Sophomore,5,"I took online classes at UC San Diego, and the classes online were excellent, in my experience. The professors were understanding of our online situation that they'd allow us to use our textbook(s) and notes to take exams. Professors also tried to keep online classes engaging by having students go in ""break-out rooms,"" and allowed students to talk with each other regarding the course work."
Sophomore,5,"I had to take classes online because of Covid. While it was a big transition for me, all the professors were understanding yet helped us achieve our learning objectives."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. Although it takes the professors a week or so to adapt to online instruction, they do it efficiently so that the course material can best be presented remotely. The professors are easily accessible via zoom and email. And some classes still have interactive aspects."
Sophomore,5,"Prior to remote learning, the social life at UCSD isn't as horrible as people make it out to be. People are very approachable and  it is fairly easy to meet people and join organizations that would be fun. The location of the school is grea, the beach is walking distance, and the weather is always beautiful. It's a quiet area, but there are always party scenes available."
Alum,5,"Spanish Literature courses at UCSD implemented enrichment via an online platform that well prepared me for my study abroad experience and demanding axademics in Madrid, Spain. Exams and laboratory requirements were conducted via the online platform."
Alum,5,"I liked the atmosphere, the availability of the professors during their specified office hours and the high quality of the Education received. UCSD Faculty expand and awaken every students' knowledge and prepares all students for their careers and professional endeavors beyond their chosen undergraduate curriculum. The setting is unaparralleled, breathtaking and inspires a strong sense of study willingness."
Senior,5,"My overall experience at UCSD has been very positive. The professors are very caring and concerned for their students' learning. They encourage their students to reach their maximum potential. UCSD has many resources for students to get a jump-start in their future careers. There are also tutoring services offered to students for free, so those that are struggling can be helped out. I think that the location of the university is also excellent, seeing that it is by the ocean. There are also many open spaces where one can go to study at or take a break between classes."
Alum,5,"I had to take my entire spring quarter and summer quarters online at UC San Diego. Although I was quite nervous about this transition, I feel as though my professors really made the adjustment as smooth as possible. My professors were very understanding and patient. Although we were not in a conventional learning environment, my professors went above and beyond to make sure we were excelling. My online learning experience with UC San Diego was as great as I expected it to be."
Alum,5,"Being an undergraduate student at UC San Diego was one of the best experiences in my life. This university truly values the importance of community, diversity, equity, and inclusiveness. I have made unforgettable memories during my freshman year in the Revelle College dorms, during my role as a resident assistant, and even as a research assistant. This university truly values student success and I could not be more grateful."
Junior,5,Professors are very smart and adaptive. Most classes transitioned well to the online learning experience without taking away from our grades or knowledge.
Junior,5,I met the best people here! Almost every student I've met is incredibly smart and wonderful to talk to(once they open up). UCSD is what you make of it :)
Alum,5,"UCSD has engaging coursework that is relevant to the field of study. UCSD has an exceptional campus and interesting architecture. Settled along the Pacific Coast, UCSD is in an amazing location. It is safe and secure along the beautiful La Jolla Shores. The school is filled with competent professors. The academic environment is challenging and competitive, as the fellow students are of the highest caliber."
Freshman,5,"It's hard to have online learning overall, but I think UCSD is very understanding so things move smoothly."
Freshman,5,I'm a freshman and honestly UCSD has made my college experience amazing. Like literally everything is amazing and I'm so glad I'm able to attend.
Alum,5,"UCSD gave me the skills and opportunities to do research, find mentors, and become proficient in my field. This allowed me to get into an Ivy League graduate school. They are a top-tier research university and the education I received was world-class."
Freshman,5,My experience has been great as an incoming freshman because they are very welcoming and provide all the information I need. I especially like the reminders about upcoming deadlines.
Junior,5,"UCSD is an amazing academic institution supported by its research facilities, involvement in the greater San Diego community, and its healthcare support in both nearby hospitals and cutting-edge research."
Sophomore,5,"As a Data Science major whose classes already involve lots of work online/on personal devices, the transition to online learning has been relatively seamless when compared to other majors. All professors were accommodating and understanding and made appropriate/fair adjustments to examinations/grading."
Alum,5,"I took a biochemistry course online, and it was super engaging and ended up being one of my favorite courses."
Niche User,5,I didn't actually attend there so I don't know about the questions below but I would definitely recommend it to other people. You want a good school? Go to UCSD!!!
Niche User,5,"I went to go see UCSD and it's amazing! I don't actually attend there, my brother is going to and I love the library! It's amazing and awesome and I definitely see myself in the future attending there."
Junior,5,I am transferring to UCSD this fall and they have been very helpful with the move. I have not yet started but I am very excited. The COVID situation is not making anything easy but they are working hard to make sure the students stay comfortable. The only downside is that I'm transfering from out of state and UCSD doesn't seem to offer many scholarships to out-of-state students and it does cost a lot.
Junior,5,I don't know if I will be taking online or in person classes given the situation but they did say we are leaning towards hybrid courses. I feel as though it will still be very productive.
Sophomore,5,"I took five classes online for my last quarter of my second year and I loved it. As much as I miss classes in the usual setting, my professors made this experience bearable. They've been very aware that the pandemic and recent murders of innocent Black folks such as George Floyd have left students in a bad headspace. All of my professors made adjustments such as making the finals optional and all of them have made it known to us that they are there for us. Also, they've used Canvas in effective ways such as uploading all lectures for students that can't make it to the Zoom lecture."
Senior,5,I love this school. I transferred here from community college and was very impressed with the quality of education I received.
Senior,5,"Since our switch to online learning during the pandemic, my online learning experience has still been very good quality. Although we are not getting the full experience online it is still a good temporary replacement."
Sophomore,5,"The campus and students are very welcoming and interesting.  My experience here exceeds all my expectations for a university that truly cares for its students, faculty and staff!
Through this coronavirus pandemic I, and my fellow students, have felt well cared for with multiple communications keeping us informed of the decision making process being developed to keep us safe, healthy and hopefully back to school in person, soon.
Thank you for this opportunity to share my experience."
Freshman,5,"This school is absolutely fantastic. You cannot beat the location, right alongside the beautiful coast of California with ocean views from the dorm rooms. The diversity is impeccable, the school constantly stresses the idea of inclusivity and comfort to embrace your culture. Their are many clubs and activities on campus where you can meet new people and find your place. The academics are rigorous but it will teach you how to become the best student you can be. It is naturally competitive but that is also what keeps performance at a high level. The professors are extremely professional and skilled at what they are teaching. I would not trade this school for anything, it has helped me grow and enjoy the so called ""best years"" of my life."
Freshman,5,I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly my professors picked up online learning. Of course there was a little bit of a learning curve from my end but my professors adjusted grading and assignments to help students perform as best they could under these circumstances. I myself am not an online learner but there has been such a strong support system from my school in adjusting grading and costs to help the students as much as possible.
Freshman,5,"I had all my classes online for spring 2020 and had regular zoom classes during the times I would on campus, but the workload was very accommodating given the circumstances as were the teachers."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved Univeristy of California, San Diego. They had endless resources for their students and the teachers were always ready to help. There were many  on campus organizations avaialble for students to be a part of and that made the experience rich and fun"
Freshman,5,"It is perfect for me! I am a human biology major and since UCSD is a research-based school, I find that it is the most fitting for what I want to pursue."
Senior,5,"UCSD is capable to provide all opportunities to students. However, due to large classes and general overpopulation on campus it is hard to find lab positions."
Junior,5,"I love UCSD for so many reasons. The academics are impeccable, the professors are brilliant, and they offer a variety of resources for their students. Whether you want to be a part of a research lab, join a club, or peruse any of the 8 library floors, the campus is yours. The only thing about UCSD that I don't like, is how huge the campus is, it feels like a small city. However, they do let you ride bikes, skateboards, scooters, etc. Additionally, I think academic advising could be improved, but I know how difficult it is to organize that for how many thousands of students UCSD has."
Alum,5,The professors are really willing to help see you succeed. They want people to go to their office and ask questions or even if it is just to talk! The only thing I would change would have to be the parking situation and the construction!!
Alum,5,"I loved this school. The campus was great, it almost felt like a summer camp vibe. The campus has lots of trees and is very nature oriented. The professors and classes were great. The academic experience is very good. The forming experience was awesome. The food on campus is amazing."
Freshman,5,"My experience with UCSD is good. I am  freshman here in Sixth college, and i am a psychology major. I live 2 hours away from home but this campus makes me feel at home. The staff is very kind as well as the students attending here. Coming into a new environment, I was afraid to not fit in, but the school managed to locate me in a good place due to the questions asked when applying. I definitely plan on returning for the next 4 years."
Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere and vibe of the whole campus. Everyone is very friendly and nice. They have a wonderful biochemistry department with all of the latest most up to date labs. You get hands on experience with real scientific research.
Niche User,5,"I enjoy the campus very much when I visited. This is definitely a school I want to attend. The campus is very diverse, the food is good, and the opportunities of STEM programs such as Marine Biology taught at the Scripps Ocean Institute are absolutely top notch and the views are gorgeous."
Niche User,5,"The University of California, San Diego is a great way to meet new people and interact in many clubs and organizations all the while attending your major in each of the seven colleges that the University of California, San Diego has to offer. Regardless of what college you choose, you will be given every opportunity to study your major which makes the University of California, San Diego a very diverse and colorful experience. Ranging from hundreds of majors, each one gives you the opportunity to interact with multiple professors all of whom have a lot of experience in the field."
Niche User,5,I think the University of California is a very beautiful campus with diversity and then area is just gorgeous with so many activities to do. The also have the major and programs that will be beneficial for me to be a doctor.
Niche User,5,"I love everything about UCSD. The campus is large but doesn't feel overwhelming. The environment is very professional, but if you need a break, the beach is a ten-minute walk from campus. There are so many different people with diverse backstories and they all come together to form a collective and beautiful community."
Graduate Student,5,"UCSD has a very large, nice campus. I really enjoyed my time spent during my undergraduate years. The faculty members were very knowledgable and great educators. I also made great friends and really learned a lot from my classes."
Sophomore,5,So far my experience has been nothing short of incredible. I have grown so much as a person and met many people that I consider myself extremely close to.
Freshman,5,Overall the quality of education is amazing and the curriculum is rigorous. The only thing I would change is the social atmosphere is quite dull.
Freshman,5,"UCSD is a very diverse college. It has an excellent academic reputation among all the colleges in San Diego. Students at UCSD get the academic help they need to pass and learn from the classes they take. There are always
steps and guidelines to anything you want to do on campus. It's a very well controlled campus and the students, staff and professors treat each other with good respects."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus it was simply beautiful and the people seem to be genuine and kind. Honestly the only thing I would change about the campus would be the distance it is from my home town!
Senior,5,"UCSD thrives off the dominating demographic of S.T.E.M majors on campus. There are a plentiful amount of research opportunities for those students who are eager to enter any STEM profession. The campus is divided into soon to be seven colleges, which makes covering its footage is a bit taxing. However, the university provides resources in all areas of professions and interests, and is more than open into welcoming new organizations on campus to satisfy unrepresented interests."
Niche User,5,The campus life on UC San Diego is very energetic and fun. I felt very at home on campus and was entertained when interacting with students and clubs. The site is also very beautiful and a calm place to sit and enjoy yourself.
Sophomore,5,"UC San Diego offers many resources for students to be able to enhance their studies. From accessible office hours to writing, math, etc. tutoring, a student like myself is able to perform strongly with this free help."
Alum,5,"UC San Diego is a beautiful campus with top-notch programs. My experience as a student was highly rewarding and set me up for success in my professional life. My only negative experiences had to do with professors making it very clear what their political ideologies were, which made some students uncomfortable."
Sophomore,4,"Academically, it's pretty standard. Many people say campus is dead but it's ok if you know where to look."
Junior,4,"All my classes are currently online, but professors know how to accommodate with students being in different time zones and are very understanding. Some of my friends have in person classes and they said that the classrooms are very well socially distanced to ensure safety as well."
Junior,4,Beautiful campus and amazing faculty. They provide students with all necessary resources and want us to succeed and dominate in the real world.
Senior,4,"Classes online are fine, but it doesn't beat having a class in person where you can talk to the professor and make friends. Online is a big trickier and it's hard to learn that way in my opinion."
Freshman,4,"So far, with online information and schooling, UCSD has been good at keeping students and staff up to date on COVID-19 information and allowing access to online campus resources and keeping in touch with other students and staff during this time. But the campus itself is gorgeous, most of the campus is accessible via walking and there are buses and shuttle as well. The location is great because it is so near the beach and the weather is overall year long pretty mild. UCSD is also not socially dead. If you know friends and get involved, it can be really fun."
Freshman,4,"So far, with online information and schooling, UCSD has been good at keeping students and staff up to date on COVID-19 information and allowing access to online campus resources and keeping in touch with other students and staff during this time."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the number of opportunities that the both the location and the school provides. Everyone I've met is super nice, and I don't believe the ""UC Socially Dead"" stereotype is true from my experience. However, this school could work on better advising for enrollment as well as creating more diverse student demographics. In addition to that, this school is one of the biggest UC campuses, so it makes walking to class pretty hard (they have shuttles that could help, but bikes/scooters/skateboards are recommended). Those are probably my only complaints though, and overall I definitely think that this school was the right choice for me."
Sophomore,4,"This university has granted me so many opportunities, from summer camps to internships, during high school that made me fall in love.  As an attending student, the university has exceeded expectations and has been a dream academically and socially."
Sophomore,4,"While my classes were difficult, my professors did their best to accommodate.  They adapted to the different teaching style and some adjusted class curves generously."
Senior,4,"Wonderful experience at UCSD. AMAZING and GENIUS professors. They are definitely passionate of their profession. Of course students are expected to work extra hard but the professors there want us to succeed almost as much as we do, they for sure go out of their way for us. They wholeheartedly have our best interest at heart and for that I am appreciative of my experience at UCSD.

4/5 stars for parking :/"
Junior,4,"Yes, although it was a difficult time to suddenly transition into all remote-learning, all the professors were very patient and considerate of the issues that students were concerned about."
Junior,4,"This is a really good school for STEM and liberal arts students. Research facilities are cutting edge and provide plenty of opportunities for students to pursue their fields of interest. In addition, the Tony-winning La Jolla Playhouse is held in high regard for those interested in theater. The campus itself is built on a large hill but it is easy to navigate through and eco-friendly."
Sophomore,4,Overall they have great staff who is always available to help. They are very understanding and want you to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is nice. There are a lot of places to study. Professors can be unhelpful at times. Overall, a good school."
Sophomore,4,"After switching to online, professors are a lot more lenient and understanding. Everything is recorded so it is easier to learn."
Senior,4,"I took classes online this quarter and overall the professors were very organized with their schedules. Not all my classes had mandatory video chats, but the ones I did have were very productive."
Senior,4,"UCSD is big on research, so some of the professors don't really care about teaching their students. Learn how to become self-sufficient and teach yourself."
Senior,4,"Something good about the online classes are the professors upload them early, so you can learn on your own time."
Alum,4,I did not have any online classes when I attended UCSD. Sometimes our homework and assignments would be conducted through online platforms and I did not have much trouble with them.
Sophomore,4,"UC San Diego is an awesome school with a beautiful campus. As for the people, if you are a party-person this school is definitely not for you, and do not be alarmed if people are not friendly because everyone finds their niche here. BUT, if you love SD and SD vibes this is it."
Senior,4,"Both quarters where COVID was a thing, finals were cancelled. The online learning was easy to adapt to, but some professors made classes harder because they're now online."
Sophomore,4,"I was able to experience UCSD before and during COVID times. Before COVID became a pandemic, I was lucky enough to experience what college and a sense fo adulthood like. Since I chose to dorm at UCSD, I was able to experience freedom and independence as I had to learn to do stuff on my own. UCSD professors are kind and thoughtful towards students as they want to succeed in life. But when COVID came, I had to move out to my home and teachers had to learn to use zoom to teach. When transitioning into remote learning, it was easy for me to adapt to this new learning environment because I had a laptop. I feel a laptop or computer is needed for online learning because it is easier to learn and pay attention to professors and TAs."
Junior,4,University of California - San Diego is located in a great area and has a good reputation for its diversity as well as the adequacy of the classes available.
Graduate Student,4,Positives include research opportunities and large campus size. Negatives are huge class sizes (400 students)
Senior,4,"My online experience was very good with UCSD. I believe professors provided students with resources to learn at your own pace. However, some professors were not accommodating or understanding with technological problems."
Senior,4,"Although the campus may need renovations and overall lacks school spirit, I met my closest friends and felt that I was provided with great opportunities because of UCSD."
Senior,4,All of my classes (besides my lab class) felt the same as they would if they were available in person.  Even the lab class was very creative in helping us learn the laboratory procedures and safety practices.
Senior,4,There are so many opportunities for undergraduate research here.  I recommend you take advantage of these research programs early and often.
Alum,4,"I took one quarter of online classes my last quarter due to COVID-19. They did their best with the situation at hand. I prefer not to take online classes, but given the circumstances, I still was able to learn and complete my degree."
Freshman,4,I think the online experience has been good but there are a few kinks they have to work out. However the teachers are working very hard to adjust and I am grateful for that.
Junior,4,"I took classes online in Statistics, Upper Division Biology, Physics Lab, and Philosophy. I found that even in lab courses, the lack of an instructor did not hinder my learning. The TAs were more than understanding and willing to provide additional assistance in undergoing a smooth transition. The classes are justly rigorous."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus in a stellar location (beach, the city, good food). Academics largely depend on your major and lower div/intro classes can be hard to get. Personal experience with all professors/transition to remote learning has been positive. Lots of resources - you just have to take matters into your own hands to find them. 

Residences are adequate and differ by college. Food overall is good - lots of variety and somewhere to get food wherever you are on campus. 

School spirit is definitely lacking. The college system allows for community building but takes away from school spirit as one university. Social life varies; student organizations are plentiful and you can find your social group through there."
Alum,4,"UCSD is a great school with a lot of perks. The location is perfect - you can study on the beach or outside any day of the year. Classes are tough, but they really push you. The academic advising at Revelle was particularly amazing. I didn't appreciate the school until I graduated."
Freshman,4,"Academically, UCSD absolutely lived up to my expectations -- all of my professors so far have been great teachers with fair grading policies. UCSD has a stereotype of being ""socially dead"", but I've found that as long as you make an effort to meet people through clubs and orgs you won't have that experience."
Freshman,4,"Due to COVID, all of my spring quarter classes were online. The learning experience was highly dependent on individual professors. All of my profs were understanding, accommodating, and transitioned to online learning very well. I miss the socialization of in-person learning, but academically the school transitioned well."
Niche User,4,"Honestly  I loved attending school here. I was a Political Science major and though my department was small, I had educated professors who were passionate about what they taught. I got a great education and had a wide variety in classes."
Niche User,4,I didn't take any classes online however there was an online portal so I could turn in assignments and do readings. I found it very easy to use and navigate.
Sophomore,4,"I really love that UCSD has provided me with a safe space. There's so many resources for students! Ever since I was a freshman I've loved to go to the resource centers. In these spaces I have found connections that will last for the rest of my life. I also STRONGLY recommend enrolling Summer Bridge (available for incoming freshmen BUT space is limited) because it's opened so many doors for me. 
However, it saddens me that the Black student population is so low. There is not much diversity in the school. This can be seen in staff diversity as well. UCSD preaches we have so much diversity but this isn't true."
Senior,4,"Overall, I am happy with my experience at UCSD. I am a data science major which is very new here and that makes it hard sometimes for grab the opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"Plenty of support available if needed.  Never felt like we were left to figure out this new process on our own.
Hoping to be on campus soon."
Freshman,4,"I was honestly unsure about coming to UCSD because I heard so many things about it being socially dead and I wanted a fun/normal college experience after going to a small high school. I decided to join Greek life and I’m so happy I did because my social life is certainly not “dead” and everyone I’ve met knows how to have a good time, but also really smart and studious! The location is also insane since it’s so close to the beach, La Jolla, and downtown. I’ve met the best people and the academics are amazing, so I’m really happy I chose this school. If you’re unsure, I say do it and make the most of it because your experience in college is all about what you make of it!"
Senior,4,"There are a lot of resources and opportunities offered by the university. However, being that UCSD is a competitive school, the rates of depression are really devastating to see, and the health services offered are not as well known about and/or accessible to students.
There are a lot of interesting courses offered, so it was super dope getting to take those courses, but the professors may not always be invested in your growth."
Freshman,4,"Very good academic scene, and as for social scene, it's really what you make of it. Some very good professors and some average professors. Overall really enjoyable."
Freshman,4,"Great school for STEM majors and walking distance to a beautiful beach! I love it here so far, I have made many memories from living at the dorms before having to move out because of covid-19. My professors have been great at teaching even remotely, and there’s a bunch of clubs and activities on campus for students!"
Alum,4,"One of the most beautiful campuses in the world, UC San Diego offers ocean views from many classrooms. How many schools offer you the chance to take a surf break between classes? Faculty have always been friendly and approachable, though there is a definite preference for STEM majors. The university campus itself is whimsical, with Geisel library's unique architectural design, modern art installations, and a crooked little house perched atop the school of engineering."
Sophomore,4,"Amazing academics, lots of opportunities and plenty of resources. Great for all majors but especially stem majors relating to biology or engineering. Great career paths after graduating"
Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience at UCSD has been overwhelmingly positive. Almost every faculty member of the Data Science department has pushed me to be the best version of myself that I can be. I've been able to procure great internships and job opportunities as a result of that. However, one thing that can be improved is the amount of courses offered. I've always wanted to take a religion class but every quarter I wait for a specific class to be offered and it never really is. Sometimes I look at CAPEs and they haven't been offered for years. So maybe either update the classes being offered or make it easier to know when a course is being offered."
Sophomore,4,My experience was great as the campus is very welcoming. I like how the campus is open to everyone and nature can be seen within walking distance when someone needs to go for a walk for fresh air. There are a lot of on campus resources for problems that a student may have and would need help with. One thing that I would like to see changed would be the selection of food offered by the dinning hall.
Niche User,4,"It is a big university so it may be intimidating at first, but you'll find that all or at least most of your classes will all be in the same area. The cafes and food choices are also really good and some of the classes are small too, which eases a lot of peoples concerns."
Sophomore,4,First and foremost we need better wifi! But that has already been established (supposedly) Fix current and more relevant prospects before beginning completely new projects (cough* construction for a whole new college)
Niche User,4,"I like how UC San Diego has multiple colleges within itself that allows the students to feel like their not on a massive campus. I would like to see, however, to see more activities and competition between these colleges to make it feel more fun."
Sophomore,4,I think the University of California is a very beautiful campus with diversity and then area is just gorgeous with so many activities to do. The also have the major and programs that will be beneficial for me to be a doctor.
Freshman,4,"The University of California is an okay school. In terms of academics, it is very good, especially if you are planning on majoring in stem. The social scene, however, is lackluster. Be prepared to go out and find friends yourself, for the school does not truly emphasize parties. The school atmosphere is very laid back. Beyond that, the food is also okay. We have multiple dining halls, each specializing in their own cuisine. The food scene around San Deigo is pretty good, the city is well known for its Mexican and Asian food."
Sophomore,4,"Hardly any parking! Every day is a struggle to find somewhere to park. Most professors are great, and want students to receive the help they need. The school continues to expand the campus, which leads to traffic jams and overall stress. The school expands, yet quality of life for the already existing students is not too great."
Niche User,4,"I love the atmosphere of UC San Diego. Although it is an enormous campus, there is still a large sense of community. In addition, this UC is very unique because of the six college system that also adds another element of community to the campus."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at UCSD had been good overall. The campus is large, encompassing six colleges within its premises, with each college offering a variation of GEs and experiences. Educationally the institution is solid, with open professors offering debate and conversations in their classes, not just lecturing. UCSD is not very well known for its athletic programs, but does offer a variety of workout options, from swim to the weight room to sports like basketball. La Jolla is a very nice location for this university, I never felt unsafe while at university as this city was so stable. I was in a dorm for a year, and the experience while there was decent, I got to meet new friends, and the place itself was adequate to live within. The food is alright, nothing much to complain about, but socially UCSD is lacking, especially compared to schools like SDSU. But, as stated in the beginning this school all things considered has been beneficial to me, and a place for academic maturity."
Freshman,4,"My experience at UC San Diego has been very satisfying. I find that the community at UC San Diego is extremely supportive with help provided ranging from academics, to financial support, to having dog therapy days, and more. There is the rumor that UC San Diego is the ""socially dead"" college, however, that is absolutely false. Anyone can easily socialize whether through parties from organizations, to events hosted in each of the 6-7 colleges on campus, or even from finding individual small groups of friends in the same suite or dorm. The only reason I would give the school a 4 star is due to the difficulty of the school. The courses and professors are difficult, but it isn't impossible for an A. It's just something students need to adjust to and realize that they must truly work hard for the good grades and GPA."
Freshman,4,"The school is great for those interested in STEM. I've met a bunch of really smart people who are really fun to hang around with. I think that everyone in general is really polite, and even though there are a lot of introverts, the social scene isn't dead."
Niche User,4,"The campus is really nice, it is a friendly environment and I feel safe there. I like the programs they have at UCSD like the nursing programs because I want to join the medical field and I believe that UCSD is the best fit for me."
Alum,4,"Fairytale land from afar as the campus is filled with priceless sculptures, deep canyons, groves of eucalyptus, and stunning architectures. UCSD is an oasis to many, and I am honored to have called it a reality. Class structure was different than most as we were on the quarter system which added extra stress and an onus on students. With 10 weeks to learn a completely new subject, and complete exams every other week, it hindered us from effectively managing our time, decreased our ability to shift focus/majors, and prevented many from engaging in on-campus activities. UCSD needs to focus more on our workload and student-life balance to improve quality and experience."
Sophomore,2,"Because of COVID-19, online learning has taken away much of UCSD's STEM related value because of the lack of access to labs and in-person research. And, you will be paying for overpriced online learning. But, to each their own."
Senior,2,"At first, I was honored to become a student of a school highly noted for its academics and research. 
However, over time, I have become disappointed through many factors. The school spirit is pretty much nonexistent, and I have figured that it is because several students of the school feel the same way. 
We are charged excessive fees with vague to no explanations of why those charges appear in our monthly accounts (ex. my current billing statement is requesting the payment of $129.52 for activity fees, $58.50 Recreation Facility fee, and $50.73 University Center fee on top of a $1116.00 Summer Session Tuition for being enrolled in ONE summer class... with the facilities still not open due to COVID-19.)  
It seems as if the school is focused on collecting money from all of its students to boost their reputation rather than the wellbeing of its students. 
Overall, I would like if the school could improve their transparency with their students and the quality of academic counseling."
Senior,2,Some of my professors tried their hardest with the online platform but others gave up trying to teach online.
Senior,2,Some professors are great but the rest of the staff and administration are the biggest group of incompetent and elitist losers on the planet.
Niche User,2,Doesn't give financial aid to international students despite having California Residency. P.S I'm writing this review to get a niche scholarship for a different college.
Alum,2,"There are some AMAZING professors and programs, don't get me wrong. But the whole school is just one massive administrative failure. Advising is a joke, their websites and digital systems are borderline inoperable, and the school has gotten so big that everything about you as a student is lost in an unrelenting tide of data-driven nonsense and degree-factory horror. A year after graduating, having been hamstringed by their system time and again, I have to say the University of California Socially Dead was absolutely not worth my time nor money."
Junior,2,"I came from a community college, and even then the help I received at my college was far more than the staff at UCSD. Unfortunately, being an international student here is not the most pleasant experience, on top of the hefty tuition fees we have to pay."
Junior,2,"unfortunately, this university is not as great as it is rated.

Academics,

the classes are very rigorous (esp, engineerings), professors are not rude but dont care about students, their priority is research, the thing that makes student excel is, competitiveness and their efforts.

Diversity,

not too diverse, mostly Asians(50-60%), other groups might feel left out, I've seen very few African descents.

social life,

many struggle with social life here. students are not welcoming and friendly outside of the niche, most of them are nerds and not open-minded, not to mention, many only hang out with their own race/ethnicity, they are also stressed out. 

the worst part, administration;

seriously rude, financial aid office is beyond rude and unhelpful. 

The school mission seems to me be about the maximum amount of profit they can obtain from this gigantic business. 25% international students, investment on research, high tuition fee, high admission rate, expensive parking etc."
Junior,2,"I believe the campus is lovely and enjoy the weather, it is ranked pretty high in the charts and is well recognized. However, I feel as the campus is socially dead. Everyone is busy doing their own thing and there isn't much space to make friends because the quarter system goes by really fast and there also isn't much school spirit. There are is no parties on campus. The food and item on campus are really over priced and la Jolla is a very expensive city. I believe this is a good school academic wise but socially it is not. I often felt isolated on campus. This school is for those that are willing to give up their social life."
Junior,2,"The school places an overall importance on garnering revenue without much care for student financial aid, non-STEM departments and activities, etc. I was a part of organizations that have had difficulty holding meetings/practices since the university did not provide any support for the organizations. Various departments lack adequate professors (e.g. the math department appears to rely on their graduate students to serve as teaching professors without much lecturing experience) and administrative-wise, employees working in various offices (e.g. financial aid, academic advising) are of no help."
Alum,2,My time at UCSD was not the best. It is true the school is great in academics but fails in all other aspects. This is not a school you want to go to to have a great time. This is a school you go to if you want to focus only on academics.
Sophomore,2,Some research opportunities. But a lot of competition and the administration is not formed to help those with special circumstances but instead to get money.
Alum,2,Students are very competitive and non-helpful. Lots of opportunities for professional growth but doesn't have a good college atmosphere.
Sophomore,2,"This school sucks. Academically it is very challenging and so if you are here to learn I do not doubt you will get an excellent education. However the things you learn here will not help you after college at all. The small amount of POC's on campus are overrun by white people or asians. The campus is nice on sunny days and crappy on cloudy days. I didn't even know we had athletics. Do not even try to find a party because you will probably arrive with the cops. Some of the professors care, but not enough. If you are a person of color then La Jolla is not for you."
College Senior,2,Students do not come here for athletics. Most do not even care about athletics unless you are part of it.
College Sophomore,2,There is no school spirit at the school. All the Athletic games are empty and no one attends them.
College Sophomore,2,I definitely regret attending this school. The community is more than lacking and the administration doesn't care about students whatsoever.
College Sophomore,2,It's very cliquey and time consuming in the Greek social sphere.
College Sophomore,2,"UC San Diego has some fantastic classes, research opportunities, and great minds, but the administration and their dogged determination to make the most money possible from their students absolutely ruin the experience. The social life isn't good at all, campus life is very fractured. It's nearly impossible to get a good class schedule, even with sophomore standing. The UCSD administration don't care about students and they don't even pretend to try."
College Junior,2,Housing is overcrowded and overpriced...but so is housing nearby because UCSD is in La Jolla.
College Junior,2,I know very little of the sports on-campus. They are seemingly nonexistent.
College Junior,2,"I only lived on campus my freshman year. I lived in a suite with 16 girls total, all sharing the same bathroom.  My room was a double that had been converted to a triple, so it was very cramped.  I had planned to move back to on campus apartments for my senior year, but I was barred from accessing the applications.  After moving off campus I was notified that my four year housing gaurantee had been terminated.  So I was aware that I would never be guaranteed a spot on campus again, but it was rather unclear in the sense that I had no idea it meant I couldn't even apply to live on campus again."
College Freshman,2,I am not in student housing because of the school's lack of housing and over admittance
College Freshman,2,"Would like to see the push to D-1 with our current sports in the near future, and eventually a football team perhaps in the long term. Sports would increase school spirit and contribute so much to the social environment. As it is now, to be honest no many people really care too much for the sports events."
College Sophomore,2,"Job Fairs are too crowded, lines are wayyy too long, not that useful. Better to apply online."
College Freshman,2,"Although we might go D1 soon, It'll take time."
College Freshman,2,"Greek housing isn't allowed in La Jolla which is disappointing. I rushed but dropped out because it was very time consuming. However, if you want a social life and to meet a lot of people greek life is the best way on campus to do that."
College Freshman,2,No football team which sucks. We are currently trying to go D1 which would be awesome. Since I am a former athlete I enjoy intramural sports and have gone to many school sporting events. Never much fan support except on spirit night.
College Junior,2,"It's not very good unless you are in engineering. If you're in engineering, you have a huge range of opportunity through DeCAF"
College Junior,2,"I hate campus housing. Although it's more convenient than off-campus housing, it's extremely cramped, dirty, old, and expensive. Also, I had a silverfish infestation problem last year that the school refused to exterminate so I was very uncomfortable living in my apartment. In addition, the appliances are s***."
College Junior,2,"I don't really care too much for the UCSD student programs. Most of the students are pretty easy to get along with, but the administration doesn't really care for the students at all. Everyone is pretty much on their own in order to achieve personal academic and career success, so it's important to remain ambitious. Since the school is pretty isolated, career opportunities are limited to the San Diego area and unless you're an engineer, not many distinguished companies recruit here."
College Freshman,2,Greeks don't necessarily affect the social atmosphere and most students look down on Greek life
College Freshman,2,The school consistently squabbles over whether to have D1 sports (it doesn't currently)
College Junior,2,"I do not understand why, if I could do it all over again, I would pay the amount that I am for courses that fulfill my gen. ed. requirements if I could take classes at junior colleges that are not only transferable to the UC system/towards my graduation but which cost a fraction of the price I am currently paying."
College Freshman,2,"school sports are bad and no one cares, but the gym and other facilities the school provides is amazing"
College Freshman,2,"Lowkey, UCSD has no Greek scene. It is UCSD."
College Junior,2,I'm not apart of any frats so take this comment with a grain of salt.
College Freshman,2,"So far, I haven't seen athletics to be very outstanding or a huge part of campus life. I have been to a few games and have enjoyed them, but our D2 athletics do not shine or stand out as an overarching part of the school experience."
College Senior,2,"From what I have seen, no one really cares expect Greeks themselves."
College Junior,2,No one cares about them.
College Freshman,2,"The school is more academic based. It does not have a football team, which may cause the school to have not as much school pride."
College Freshman,2,"Athletics are not important at all, we don't even have a football team."
College Freshman,2,"I wouldn't choose UCSD because of the socially dead atmosphere, theres no school spirit, people just study 24/7"
College Senior,2,I think the admin. keeps things too secret from students--just like most universities at the moment.
College Senior,2,I hardly ever party on campus because everything gets shut down quickly. I just party in my party or other friends' off-campus.
College Freshman,2,"Some Greek life exists, but the school is pretty strict about hazing and parties, and most of the big frats have pretty bad reputations."
College Freshman,2,"If you want parties, go to SDSU. You won't find anything here."
College Junior,2,don't go here for the parties
College Junior,2,"No buffet style, bad food."
College Sophomore,2,RSO's are constantly breaking up parties.
College Sophomore,2,Dance community is pretty close knit
College Sophomore,2,Middle class people have it pretty bad.
College Freshman,2,"Since I don't have a car and solely relying on bus schedules/lines, it's difficult to plan to eat somewhere. It takes time to go out and find something other than a chain restaurant or a mall food court."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I'm just reviewing UTC's overpriced food court that specializes in Asian-fusion, right? Or Costa Verde's more fast-casual options like Chipotle / Five Guys / Starbucks?"
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you luck out and get one of the more recently built dorms, or the ones in Muir, it's great. If you get Revelle, Sixth College, or the Village then, good luck to you."
Recent Alumnus,2,The social life on campus at UCSD is subpar at best.  You have to join a club/frat to get access to the good parties.
College Freshman,2,off campus frat parties. SDSU and PB are the only options
College Sophomore,2,Very unsocial and difficult to do anything during weekends
College Sophomore,2,Terrible food only shows importance to certain halls
College Freshman,2,"The school is so strict on alcohol and fun in general that its no wonder the school is socially dead. In UCSB, authorities are very tolerant of partying and drinking because they know its apart of the college experience. Here, they all have a pole in their ass. You can hardly make any noise at night, slight drinking is never allowed. If you're having too much fun, you'll get arrested or written up. Period."
Freshman,1,"Pretty much everything this school advertises about themselves they either greatly exaggerate the extent or outright lie about it. The mental health facilities they are so quick to brag about in the brochure are a complete joke, their infrastructure is entirely inadequate, the management is poor, and they really couldn't care less about you as an individual student."
Niche User,1,"Huge party school, got food poisoning from the food served there, had a horrible time and left halfway through my freshman year."
Junior,1,"This school is overcrowded and terribly run. The chancellor is a joke. Classes have horrific waitlists, housing off or on campus is running around 1900 for a tiny studio. Students depressed and forced to be over competitive just to get by. Claims to be a good path to med/nursing/pa/grad school but when you check the actual classes required, UCSD does not even offer them. Go anywhere else."
Alum,1,"I transitioned while I was here and the bureaucracy  and administrative staff did a horrendous job of following the court order for name and gender change. I had to follow up with 10 different systems after giving the registrar the court order, and I had to threaten legal action. I got laughed at in the face by a staff member at the student health center while I was requesting a medical document with my legal name on it instead of my previous name.
The academics and professors were okay."
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible housing, exorbitant prices, and apathetic RAs galore."
College Sophomore,1,"This school has absolutely no school spirit, and very few people attend games."
College Sophomore,1,Our teams are amazing but our school does not want to move up to D1 for some reason which affects them. It's sad to see them try so hard but it not be praised due to the fact that we are not a Division 1 school. The fan support is great during spirit week other than that you don't really hear much about the sport events unless friends are on a team.
College Sophomore,1,"No school spirit, no football team"
College Senior,1,There is no sports life here.
College Senior,1,Too strict and administration tries to shut down any student activism before it even starts.
College Junior,1,Sucks as much as the dining halls. The salads are the best thing on campus.
College Freshman,1,Way too strict. A party gets you on probation
College Freshman,1,Sucks. Nothing on campus. Security too strict.
College Sophomore,1,The only financial aid I received were loans. I could not qualify for anything else because the financial aid office required me to use my parents income information even though I am the one who will be paying for my education. I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I am not able to use my own financial information to receive aid for my own education.
Recent Alumnus,1,"They police us like parents. It's no fun being on campus. It's no fun being anywhere near UCSD. RA's will write you up for alcohol and drug offenses. There's a loud-noise curfew in general, and parking enforcement is really strict."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I only went to one off-campus party in my 4 years of UCSD. It was a binge drinking fest, and filled with try-hards who practiced beer-pong way too much. Is it bad that even the party games are taken way too competitively here at UCSD? I mean if you're part of the Greek Community, then having fun will not be a problem, but for ordinary people, you can just about forget about it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Dining hall food is way overpriced ($8-9/plate, generally $15/meal) and tastes no better than fast food restaurants. There's no specialized meal options, because all dining halls rely on SYSCO supplied ingredients. Other than that, it's bleak. I mean the food options on campus are just as bad to be honest. Campus' best options include Santoini's Greek or Bombay Coast, but you're going to be paying $9-10 per meal. Ugh. If you don't believe it's this bad, look at the yelp reviews of UCSD's dining options.

Normally colleges have places nearby, or across the street. UCSD got wise, and leased all those properties out to real-estate developers to build gated communities, so there is no college town, no close by burrito or burger joint. Even across La Jolla, you're stuck with the same over-priced and bad tasting food. The best options are a drive away in Convoy or the rest of San Diego."
Recent Alumnus,1,Never experienced a more awkward group of people.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Bad food, enforcement were mean and angry."
College Sophomore,1,It is extremely strict and but give you 3 strikes
Recent Alumnus,1,"No sports, intramural only, some D1 but no school spirit"
College Sophomore,1,"Even though they make it seem like there are a lot of funds for students, unfortunately it is still a public institution owned by the government. As a student from a middle class background I received no financial aid; hence, why I need to apply to outside scholarships to help finance my education. I am disappointed with how the government revenue is used. I think that education should be the highest priority, and public education can only be improved if tuition was kept low and financial aid was distributed more fairly."
College Sophomore,1,Sooooo hard to get financial aide
College Freshman,1,It is HORRIBLE. What am I paying almost 600 a year for?!
College Freshman,1,So expensive and no availability. .. Do you even care that I'm homeless??
College Senior,1,"There have been stabbings, rapes, and murders on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Unless you know somebody, you're not going to have a nightlife."
College Freshman,1,The campus police come whenever there's any sort of noise.
College Freshman,1,"I did not qualify for financial aid, and now my parents are struggling to pay for my tuition and other college fees."
College Freshman,1,Wifi is slow and disconnects frequently and randomly.
College Freshman,1,I got put in a triple even though I didn't even select it on my form.
College Freshman,1,"Parking permits cost upward of $300 and there are genreally never any spots open for students, yet the number of spots for commercial, teacher/teaching assistant, and graduate students outnumbers the amount of those groups that park there. "
College Freshman,1,"Food is overpriced and not very pleasing to the taste buds. Most entrees which include one side and one main items such as chicken or things along those lines. I always eat chicken sandwiches because they're the cheapest item I have found that are decent tasting and won't destroy your meal plan. Most of the food is not very good, but that could be because my mom would cook every night for my entire life leading up to my transition to college."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking at UCSD is awful. The prices for parking permits are outrageous (upwards of $500), and it is still very difficult to find a parking spot. It is much easier to rely on public transportation than to have a car on campus."
College Freshman,1,Many people drink in their rooms and don't go to parties when drinking. I've encountered a great deal many of students who drink to release bottled-up emotions and stress; it's outrageous and disgusting.
College Freshman,1,Parking permits are incredibly expensive and there is a huge lack of parking spots
College Freshman,1,"I don't make any money. Any. I work minimum wage at a Mexican restaurant, and can barely save any money. What I do save is used to pay my housing, which of course I have to pay on my own. Yet since my parents make a six-figure salary the university thinks that I can afford to pay to go to school here, which I can't. I currently have two loans and am only in freshman year! FAFSA did not help, nor did the scholarships I applied to. My advice is to go through the motions and apply for FAFSA and Cal Grants, but go the extra mile: apply for as many scholarships as humanly possible! "
College Freshman,1,You should not own a car in UCSD. You will find no parking and it will suck.
Recent Alumnus,1,i've never seen anyone get caught or written up for drugs
Recent Alumnus,1,super expensive and there are never any spots free
College Senior,1,Good luck finding a spot I bought and started riding a scooter just to deal.
College Freshman,1,Same food same food same food. Enjoy Mexican food almost everyday. The only good dining hall is Pines and you bet yourself that place is going to be packed. 
College Freshman,1,Oh god don't get me started. The closest off campus restaurant is 30 minute walk.  The variety sucks absolute ass.  It's either campus food or off campus junk food. I never look forward to eating. 
College Freshman,1,"The education here is OK. The campus is dead. All shops on campus are overpriced. Food gets very repetitive. Party scene sucks unless if you join frats,  even then house parties normally need a drive. The surrounding area is boring. UC Socially Dead."
College Freshman,1,"I might be biased, coming from a city with world class public transportation but La Holla has terrible bus schedule. It takes forever to get anywhere, especially with everything being very far. "
College Sophomore,1,There are barely any spots sufficient enough to hold remotely half the students' cars here. The permits are outrageously expensive as well.
College Sophomore,1,Unless you are an in-state resident then you will receive barely any financial aid for that out of state tuition. Otherwise UCSD is generous with their financial aid.
College Sophomore,1,"If you're living on campus, then it is necessary to have a designated driver to access anything remotely fun that is off campus."
College Freshman,1,"PARKING SUCKS. Especially near Muir, you can NEVER find an S spot during the week and it's soooo expensive.  "
College Freshman,1,Downtown SD is close but you need a car.
College Sophomore,1,"If you are stuck in the middle class, as I and many others are, you will receive nothing besides loans with high interest rates. I'm entering my sophomore year with over $50,000 dollars in debt. I received a 3.9 my freshman year and did not even receive any scholarships."
College Sophomore,1,The parking at this university is very expensive and overpriced. The university doesn't really care about helping students in this area and provides bad parking spot availability to students.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The Art Department is terrible. I'm in Media and I don't really learn anything. Some of the professors are amazing and make classes engaging, but some classes I'm forced to take like art history, or asian art history was terrible. UCSD needs to stop hiring art coordinator/curators as professors. They can't teach and definitely can't write an exam."
College Sophomore,1,I have not yet had an internship but I plan to get one next summer. There are virtually zero economics related jobs and/or internships provided by the school. Such internships are usually located far away from the university and I have to sit on the bus for an average of an hour and a half to get to an interview for an internship. I wish that the school would find a way to make economic related internships more accessible to students the way biology related internships are.
College Junior,1,"The faculty have more parking spaces than the students, which is outrageous. Also you won't get parking spaces near any of the colleges you need to go so you'll be parked miles away from the class you need to go. Don't bring a car!"
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is horrible. There are only three parking garages for such a big campus. There are parking lots, but none of them can be parked in overnight, and there are few students parking spaces anyway. sometimes it's almost impossible to find a spot. Permits are very expensive, tickets are as well."
College Sophomore,1,There is no nightlife regardless of age. You can find it if you look hard but it's difficult to find other people interested in going out and it's generally inaccessible.
College Junior,1,The parking at UCSD is terrible. There aren't even enough parking stalls and they sell too many parking passes
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking might give more students headaches than anything else at UCSD. The permit prices are increasing each year (for an ""S"" spot it is probably over $60/month now and going up). If you live off campus, you need to get to school really early if you are coming for 8, 9, or 10am classes and still might end up spending 15+ minutes finding a space.

When I lived off campus, I would take the bus, but on the rare occassion that I drove to school, I would park just north of Eleanor Roosevelt College at the Gliderport, where there is a dirt lot that is free to park at until 8pm (and the street parking there is valid until 2am, if you are going to be on campus all day for classes and clubs). Parking at the Gliderport is a good option if you don't have the $ to pay for a school parking permit and don't mind the 15-20 minute walk just to get to the center of campus."
College Junior,1,"There is some sports on campus, but because we are not a division 1 school it is not a priority to students. I was barely aware that we were in the national championships for women's volleyball. (Well, truthfully I'm not sure if it's soccer or volleyball. That says a lot.) It would be awesome to have more sports on campus and make it a bigger focus for students."

Freshman,5,"I have loved my time at Oklahoma City University. It is a small campus, yet you are still able to feel like you are getting the same experiences as a larger school with all it has to offer. With it mainly being a preforming arts school there are so many personalities and background you can meet and become friends with. That doesn't go to say that other programs thy offer aren't excellent. I am currently a Nursing student and I have been pleasantly surprised with how exceptional the program it. The Nursing school is ranked number three in the state and it shows. The professors are extremely invested in their students success and personal growth. With it being such a small community here on campus you feel right at home, there is always a friendly face just around the corner."
Freshman,5,"I have taken a few classes online due to the pandemic and it has been nothing but pleasant. The professors continue the discussion just at the would in an in person environment. The adjustment has been slight with learning some new software different from high school, but there is always someone to help is you have questions."
Senior,5,My online learning experience is excellent especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. The professors are very supportive and the zoom meetings were smoothly.
Senior,5,Oklahoma City University has beautiful campus with great academic atmosphere. Staff and faculties are very nice and the minorities are being respected. There are lots of activities on campus. This university takes care of students and put their success on the priority. I am in Kramer School of Nursing and all the faculties and staff are very supportive and knowledgable. They are full of love and consideration. This is the best education experience I have ever had.
Senior,5,"I loved the small classroom, the professors, and all of the opportunities that OCU gave me.  I was able to thrive in the small environment and am grateful for the entire experience."
Niche User,5,It's a small town fill and wounderfull staff. Everyone has been bery helpfull in the application process.
Freshman,5,I have attended okcu for on one full semester so far and have learned so many new things for my career everyone is kind and accepting it is a great environment to grow in . If you are ready to learn not to be taught go here.
Freshman,5,"Oklahoma City University is a great place to connect with other people and have new experiences. The campus life is very diverse and the University focuses a lot on the different cultures of the students. Because it's a small campus, it's a lot easier to connect with fellow students and to have a face-to-face relationship with the faculty. Just last semester, I had a class that was only 5 people and the dynamic was very enriching and helped nurture genuine conversation and learning."
Niche User,5,I have only taken a tour here but between the tour and conversations with many people I have heard great things and know a lot of people that enjoy it at OCU!
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere at OCU. It's a very small class oriented University that gives you the one on one needed to truly excell in college. The campus is calm and quiet while being situated next to the busy brick town district in Oklahoma City.
Freshman,5,Oklahoma City University is an amazing college! I am so glad that I get to continue my education here. The personal connection that you get to make with your professors is incredible because you can go directly to them if you need help. It is such a friendly atmosphere with so much to do on campus!
Senior,5,"Expensive, but worth it. I have made so many connections here, personal and professional. I definitely want to do my graduate here."
Alum,5,"It was the right size for me; I could get to know people, but there was plenty to explore. I stayed mostly with the music crowd. Amazing music, dance, nursing, business, and law schools."
Freshman,5,"Oklahoma City University is incredible! The staff is attentive, the campus life is great. Itâ€™s just a great place to school, especially for the arts."
Junior,5,"With a price tag that can leave you in six digit debt after you graduate one wonders why anyone would ever come here, but the answer is simple: It's worth every penny. You work with people who are not only knowledgeable but professionals in their careers. The professors are always going to answer any questions you have if it means helping you learn. I honestly can't imagine myself attending any other college."
Niche User,5,"I love Oklahoma City University, the class sizes are small and the teachers care.  I've had a wonderful experience, and they are so helpful."
Graduate Student,5,"Great university, with great educators. I really enjoyed being a student here and felt that I was prepared well for my job after graduation."
Graduate Student,5,"Great experience, Great professors, Great learning experience. I have loved my experience at Oklahoma City University"
Junior,5,Oklahoma City University has allowed me to grow both academically and personally. The small class sizes has allowed me to gain better knowledge and have better communication and relationships with both my professors and my peers. I have found many of my passions through all the things OCU has to offer. I love OCU and wouldn't wish to be doing my Undergrad anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the professors and small classes. It makes for a better learning environment for me. There is a lot of activities on campus which makes for a fun night out or a quiet night in. I would change the food. There is the same variety of options every week. I look forward to specials!!!
Senior,5,"I came to OCU from Las Vegas and I am so beyond happy that I did. This university has the best family atmosphere and I am truly pleased with how welcomed I felt and still feel. Professors are always willing to help you and want you to do your best. They are at the tips of your fingertips if you need to talk-- literally, I text my professors, not many students can say they do that. The school overall has a big family feel. The athletics department is the best in the NAIA. We have won the most National Championships and we have a great director and assistant director behind us that support all teams, no matter the sport."
Alum,5,I was a member of the dance department. The school is so well organized and the material I learned is invaluable to me in my future career.
Niche User,5,"My time there was like no other, everyone there was friendly and embracing. I felt like i was at home"
Senior,5,The faculty and professors at the Kramer School of Nursing at OCU are incredible. They have the student's best interest at heart and ensure that the students utilize every possible avenue for success.
Freshman,5,"The facility is super clean, the campus is nice and clean and small enough to get to different buildings on time. I love the drama department and all the different performing arts classes available and love the student body."
Senior,5,"Oklahoma City University is rapidly becoming the leader of the arts in the South/Southwest. Class sizes are small, and curriculum is molded to you. The music education department has exploded within the past 4 years with the addition of Dr. Michael Raiber on faculty, a national and leading expert in the field. The program is breaking new grounds working hand-in-hand with the extraordinary El Sistema Oklahoma, and the program is supported by the state's most prolific Collegiate National Association for Music Education (CNAfME) chapter."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are all experts in their fields. I have not had one professor who was assigned to teach a class in which he was not highly experienced and had already taught in the past. Many classes are lecture based, but the professors are able to review or clarify information upon a students' request, as the average class size is 17 students."
College Freshman,5,100% of business finance and accounting majors are employed upon graduation. 98% of nursing majors make it into nursing school upon graduation. The school has the second highest turn out on Broadway in the country. 80% of biology majors make it into med-school upon graduation.
College Freshman,5,"Students had to do a course load on the safety tips and statistics before entering OCU. Of the entire last school year, there was one reported rape. Sexual assaults rarely, if ever, occur, as the student body of the undergraduates is slightly over 1200, and reputations would be very much at stake for anyone involved. Also, the atmosphere is committed and focused on pursuing careers, so the party scene is minimal."
College Freshman,5,"I was recruited by Lambda Chi Alpha but did not join due to financial difficulties. I plan on joining as soon as funds are available, as the fraternity life at Oklahoma City University are beyond all expectations I had due to observing State School fraternities. The guys are very diverse in their background and culture, and being with them is the closest thing to a brotherhood I could imagine."
College Freshman,5,"Oklahoma City University is commonly referred to as Over Committed University. The dance program and the musical theater program are of the top most renowned in the country. It has the second highest Broadway turn out in the country, yet there are only 1200 undergraduates. The school offers a liberal arts education, giving you the opportunity to immerse yourself in a broad spectrum of studies and activities. I personally am a double major in Music Performance and Economics, I am a walk on to the rowing team and I am a member of the undergraduate investment club."
College Junior,5,Received personalized emails every step of the way.  Way to go OCU!
College Junior,5,I haved loved OCU and the passion that they help instill in their students.  My undergrad was a dream and I can't wait to continue my education and obtain my Masters degree here.
College Junior,5,For performing arts education across the board it is top quality.
College Junior,5,I love Oklahoma City University and wouldn't trade my time here for anything.
College Junior,5,The alumni network in the performing arts industry is unparalleled.
College Junior,5,I love Greek life and am so happy I joined (even though I waited until my sophomore year).
College Junior,5,I would not trade my experience here for anything.
College Senior,5,Great school.  Awesome professors.
College Senior,5,Easy to enroll with all needed help along the process.
College Senior,5,All staff from Admissions to Professors are very helpful and professional.  They are there to help you succeed.  What makes my school unique is they only require four hours per week on campus.  They remainder of my education is online.
College Freshman,5,Greek like at OCU is amazing! There are three fraternities and four sororities that do a lot of good for the community and campus. I joined Greek Life during spring recruitment and the process was super easy and friendly. All of the houses on campus are nationally recognized.
College Freshman,5,Oklahoma City University is a diverse school with students pursuing everything from dance to law to music.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I got a job as soon as I wanted to after graduation, the school hosts regular career fairs, no trouble in this area."
College Freshman,5,"We have a non-substance campus. Our room checks consist of our fridges and kitchen spaces being looked in because if there is alcohol or drugs, students confronted by the police (I believe)."
College Freshman,5,I have really enjoyed my classes here on campus. I have learned something in every class I have taken so far and it makes me know the money I am paying is worth it. The class sizes end at 20 students on average. We are forced to take some courses that other universities wouldn't necessarily make students take but that is what makes our college more diverse.
College Freshman,5,"The thing that makes my school unique is the fact that I am came from a high-school with even more students, so coming here was not overwhelming. It is also unique because it is very one-on-one, and you can speak with your professors whenever needed. They are very confident in your and push you to be your best. It is very calming for me, personally, to be able to ask my professors questions when I need help and not feel like some random student that they just call out during role-call. Along with academics, I am also on the cheer and pom squad and have very much enjoyed my time of pursuing my passion at the collegiate level. It is very rewarding and brings much enjoyment to my live. Overall, I really enjoy this university"
College Junior,5,The professionalism at the Meinders Business School has been top notch. I am very appreciative that this business school has created programs that focus on the energy industry and fit well with our city as a whole. The networking available was one of the major reasons I chose this school over others.
College Freshman,5,I know so many students who have internships in many different fields. The work/study program here is amazing. The people in the career services office are so friendly and they explain everything really thoroughly.
College Freshman,5,"Courses are challenging but interesting. I have learned so much from every course I've taken. The professors can't be beat- they are all so kind and they care about each student as an individual. My classes are all pretty small (around 15 people) so there is a lot of individual assistance, which is amazing."
College Freshman,5,"OCU is unique because it's a small school but the community of students and faculty are the most supportive, loving, caring and generous group of people any student could hope to meet. Everyone is so supportive; the staff will drop everything to help you and talk to you about anything you need."
College Freshman,5,"Many students in my field of study that graduate from my school get employed right after they graduate. They have many opportunities and are extremely well prepared to start a a career in the professional dance industry. It isn't just the classes that prepare us, but the values they instill in us that make us desirable in the industry."
College Freshman,5,I love our Greek life! I am involved in Greek life and it was a great decision. Although we don't have many sororities and fraternities they make up for it in the wonderful people belonging to them. We have a no hazing policy and the organizations strictly follow it. Greek life does great philanthropic work for their national philanthropies and for our school.
College Senior,5,OCU staff have been very informative and helpful
College Freshman,5,"OCU teaches student right away that sexual assault is a very serious topic on campus. We are to attend seminars and watch videos teaching us about it and showing us the consequences if we do attempt to do so. There are also weeks dedicated to the awareness of it. The only problem I have heard of when attending would be an incident of a person coming off of campus, but the law enforcement that stay on campus 24/7 were quick on the scene to help the victim."
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms are spacious, not many amenities. The social atmosphere is very nice."
College Freshman,5,"OCU is VERY centered around its Greek life. Anyone who is anyone is usually a part of a Greek organization. There are some independents that choose to never join an organization but they still get invited to things! One of the best choices you can make at OCU is joining a fraternity or sorority. Most parties are thrown by Greek students but there are a few that are hosted by sports players. 

There are 4 options for Sororities:

- Alpha Phi

- Alpha Chi Omega

- Gamma Phi Beta

- Phi Mu

There are 3 options for Fraternities:

- Kappa Sigma

- Fiji

- Lambda Chi Alpha

Chapter Housing: Kappa Sigma and Lambda Chi Alpha both have chapter houses that are a bit old but are still great. Fiji just received their charter so I believe they are still working out details on obtaining a house. All of the sororities besides Phi Mu have little mini houses by the Methodist dorm. They don't have any living spaces but they do have very nice meeting areas and kitchens."
College Freshman,5,Oklahoma City's restaurant options are extremely diverse. You'll find several amazing places. Especially in the part of town where OCU is located. Its an up and coming area filled with local shops and restaurants with friendly staff.
College Freshman,5,Everyone knows each other so that makes parties pretty fun.
College Freshman,5,I love it here! We all fit in! We all are focused on making a career! We all want to be successful and this school helps us with that.
Niche User,4,"At Oklahoma City University, I met amazing people who I know will be my lifelong friends. I met professors who care a lot about their students and who prepare them for the future careers. The campus is kept clean and there is always something to do."
Senior,4,I love going to school here. It is however very expensive and can be very hard to be kept up with. The classes are challenging but very helpful with them being as small as they are. You get that one on one with your professors that really care about their students.
Freshman,4,"I love the education I'm getting here. The size of the school makes it very easy to get involved and make new friends. It's a place where everyone knows each other and its super uncommon to run into someone you've never seen before, but I still have a lot of fun and have been able to make a solid friend group"
Sophomore,4,"I love all of my classes and the student life is great!Everything is close together and easy to walk to and the students are all supportive of each other no matter what major. Greek life is great here and its a good way to make friends and get involved on campus. The caf is great but sometimes is could use a little work in the freshness of the food. The performing arts programs here are amazing, and the list of successful alums is outstanding! It's why I chose this school!"
Freshman,4,Oklahoma City University is very clean and friendly. They strive to include every type of student and provide the best education possible.
Sophomore,4,"A little disappointed in their organization, however the education is great. It is expensice, but overall very beautiful."
Sophomore,4,I love how small the university is. The professors are always there to provide help and they know you personally so each student is very comfortable with seeking the help they need. With a small campus you have a quick access to everything on campus. The campus is very diverse in terms of types of majors. There are a lot of on campus extra curricular to get involved in!
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love OKCU, people here are so kind and accepting of everyone else. There are so many options and opportunities on campus in the way of clubs, organizations, internships, etc. and if there isn't a club for what you want it is so easy to make your own! The professors are all amazing and are all willing to help you in any way they can and are extremely personable. All the food at the cafeteria is also really good, Mrs. June makes the best sandwiches and quesadillas and Willy makes amazing breakfasts and fresh grilled options"
Senior,4,"The only complaint I have about Oklahoma City University, they over looked my transcripts when trying to transfer in for the Spring semester. I ended up having to enroll the very last day available when they finally realized my transcripts had been sent, causing me to begin classes a week late. Other than this, the campus is quaint and quite. The faculty is extremely helpful and kind. Also, the class sizes are small, perfect for extra one on one availability when needed with your professors."
Freshman,4,"While I love OCU and the community here, I wish tuition was more affordable and the food served in the caf was better."
Junior,4,The campus is small but is extremely homey. The professor are overall really nice and helpful. I found the cafeteria to be amazing. They had it redone with different rearrangements of seating. The campus book store is a bit small and not much diversity. They had redone Alvin's but honestly miss the older version when the chicken alfredo pasta was still served those were honestly the best days when I was Freshman.
Niche User,4,"Wonderful school. I enjoy every moment here, the campus is beautiful and welcoming. The staff is very kind and always there to help out."
Sophomore,4,Oklahoma City University is a prestigious school for the arts. The Music program is nationally recognized. The dance school is ranked as the best in the country. The theatre program is well known and they offer an array of imphisis such as many areas in technical theatre.
Junior,4,Oklahoma City University is a wonderful university where students are free to express themselves without judgement.
Junior,4,I have enjoyed my time at Oklahoma City University thus far. I have been challenged by the faculty to think and create in many ways outside of the dance studio. I have been set up to succeed in the entertainment industry by the rigorous coursework and schedule we as dancers have.
Senior,4,"The student and faculty community of OCU is great. However, it's very expensive and the facilities and amenities need a lot of improvement."
Sophomore,4,"As a student athlete and musician at Oklahoma City University, I experience a wide variety of things. One day I will be playing volleyball or watching another sport compete, the next day I will be watching my roommate act in a play. Everyday is a different day and it is a great experience. It is an everyday thing to hear students singing on their way to class. I also hear different languages and accents all around campus. OCU has a very diverse group of students, they come from all around the country to earn their degree from here. I feel that my college experience is more diverse than most!"
Freshman,4,"Good school overall especially if you are into Dancing, Singing, or acting. Smaller school makes in easier to get to know everyone which is always a good thing. Good professors with small class sizes makes it easier to work with."
Niche User,4,"This college is definitely worth all the money, but it was just way too busy for me. I was in constant stress mode, but I know people who can thrive in that kind of environment. Unfortunately, I can't."
College Freshman,4,"The housing I am in is called Walker hall. It is set up for the purpose of privacy and efficient space... It is very difficult to run out of storage space, as every piece of furniture in the rooms are built with slide out drawers and are able to be moved into convenient, out-of-the-way spaces."
College Freshman,4,"I am a walk on to the rowing team, and the boat house is an Olympic training center on the river in OKC. It's pretty hard to beat the facilities we have; OU and UCO both send their teams up to our boathouse to share in the amazing opportunities we have to train."
College Junior,4,A friend had an issue with assault and it was dealt with seriously and efficiently.
College Junior,4,"Never had any issues with campus housing.  There is definitely one dorm that ranks above the others, but there are options and that's always great!"
College Junior,4,"I didn't join, but easily could have.  They include anyone and I don't feel left out by not going Greek."
College Junior,4,We have great diversity on campus and are very accepting.
College Junior,4,"I rarely feel unsafe on the immediate campus. The area surrounding it however, is not the best."
College Junior,4,The Cokesbury Apartments are a great option while still being on campus.
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at this school has been pleasant so far, I am not really into sports or clubs, other than the nursing ones; but I've heard that it's been a great basketball season. One thing I don't like about the school is that they don't provide transportation-so a car is much needed!"
College Sophomore,4,I love Greek life on our campus. It is not as demanding or expensive as Greek life at state schools. It's a wonderful way to make friends and give to important causes.
College Sophomore,4,"This school is very well known in the performance world, and from what I've seen/heard, OCU alumni tend to get work in their desired field both during their attendance and after graduation."
College Sophomore,4,"Sorority life is great, and all the girls are so sweet, even if you're not sure if you want to join definitely go through recruitment, just to meet people! however, they do suck up al lot of time, and sometimes act like they are more important than school work, especially during philanthropy weeks and homecoming."
College Senior,4,Very convenient facilities and great resources
College Freshman,4,"All the students are extremely aware of sexual assault and take the matter very seriously. Sexual assault spent happen very often on campus, but when it does, action is taken immediately."
College Freshman,4,"My first year at OCU was nothing short of magical. I fell in love with my school the minute I stepped on campus when I was a high school sophomore and I'm still in love with it today. I was able to take all of the classes I needed to take and also some that I wanted to take with the help of my wonderful advisor who also guided me through the trials of my first year at college. Most of my professors were wonderful and really wanted their students to succeed.

Being a small school, we are a very close knit community. Everyone knows your name and major which makes campus more of a community rather than a school setting. Oklahoma City University is where I found home and I hope others find their home here too"
College Freshman,4,"People get sick as is the way of the world, but our health clinic generally fixes them up in no time. I haven't been there really but overall I haven't heard of anything bad health or safety related on campus."
College Freshman,4,The professors in my field (Theatre Production and Design) do a great job of informing you about summer internships. They make it a point for a student to have one so they their resume won't be sparce when they are thrown into the real world.
College Freshman,4,I love it at Oklahoma City University. All my professors are approachable and have helped me out when I have asked them. They are also forgiving when it comes to forgivable mistakes. I feel as if I'm with a second family at my university and staying there is my top priority.
College Freshman,4,OCUPD is great. You can tell that they're working hard to keep us safe.
College Freshman,4,Things can get really tough. We often say that OCU stands of over committed university. It's worth it in the end though. You just gotta work hard and not give up/
College Freshman,4,"A degree form this school can mean a lot. People have heard of us. And for my major at least, music education, they're supposed to be really good at helping us find a job once we graduate."
College Freshman,4,"There have been a few problems, but they have always been quick to deal with them."
College Freshman,4,"I am loving my school so far. It's hard work, but it's everything that I wanted it to be."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Overall a good experience, the school challenged me and my perception and in the end I guess that is why people to go universities, particularly a liberal arts school."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's kind of in a rough area of town, but the campus itself always has police patroling and is generally pretty safe."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Some of it is awesome, some of it is not so awesome. Just stay in Centennial, or did they change the name? The new dorms."
Recent Alumnus,4,Greek life has a strong presence considering the campus is so small
Recent Alumnus,4,OCU is a really great school. They don't have a lot of program variety but are very good with what they do offer.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Always have great programs, just not a lot of involvement from the student body."
College Freshman,4,"I live in the Methodist Dorms and I really enjoy it. I have my own room and bathroom, as does my roommate. We share a living room and a mini-kitchen. It is better than living anywhere else on campus. They are the newest set of dorms."
College Junior,4,I have been pleasantly surprised by the athletic facilities and the teams at the school. Attendance at the various sporting events is eventful and fun to be a part of. I enjoy the attending the soccer games the most.
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus. We have the OCUPD always around, and there are very few sexual assaults reported here. I feel safe because I know administrators work really hard to keep students safe and informed."
College Freshman,4,The greek life here is HUGE! almost everyone you meet will be involved in greek life. The philanthropy is amazing.
College Freshman,4,"I think this campus is extremely safe. However, the area the school is located in is generally not very safe, but our police department ensures our safety."
College Freshman,4,"My courses so far have been great. Some classes that I was required to take I wouldn't have chosen them for myself and do not believe that I got my full tuition out of them, but overall I believe I am getting a quality education."
College Freshman,4,"I love this school and the environment of the students and professors create around it. I am part of the dance program and at times it is difficult and somewhat unfair how we are treated, but generally I feel like it is a great pre professional  program that will fully prepare me to get a job in my field of work. The students here are wonderful and are so welcoming to new students. There are also many clubs and organization so there is something for everyone in campus."
College Freshman,4,The school is great with amazing and understanding professors but it is very expensive.
College Freshman,4,"Great, small campus. The class sizes are small and the professors genuinely care. There isn't much school spirit or diversity."
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a semester into college, and I can already say the theatre training is incredible."
College Sophomore,4,Its a really great school with a great faculty that cares about the success of the students.
College Sophomore,4,"The students are kind, the facilities are lovely."
College Sophomore,2,"homeless people are always around (especially in cokes, sometime in the clubhouse/ laundry room) the blue emergency poles are out of order. OCUPD is too concerned with writing tickets."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm sure its fine, but literally nobody cares at all."
College Senior,2,The nursing school needs improvement. Lazy professors.
College Sophomore,2,It is unhealthy processed food.
College Freshman,2,"It is great when they have variety, but sometimes they are lazy and just prepare few options. I once got a raw burger."
College Freshman,2,Not very good. Alvin's has good food but they're slow.
College Freshman,2,I'm not allowed to get a work-study even though my family could use more help paying for my education
College Freshman,2,The wifi is never reliable
College Freshman,2,The caf does not have good options a majority of the time
College Freshman,2,some things happened with the music scholarship
College Junior,2,"The athletic facilities on this campus aren't very good. However, I'm ok with that because no one really goes to OCU for athletics anyway. The school knows what their students are interested in (primarily performing arts) and they keep those facilities in perfect shape."
College Junior,2,"Lots of gay guys, lots of straight girls. Barely anything else."
College Junior,2,Greek life is super annoying.
College Junior,2,No one cares about sports except if you're a rower.
College Freshman,2,"Oklahoma weather sucks.  Point blank.  It's too hot, too cold, or too windy most of the time.  Spring brings storms, and if you're not used to them, they can be pretty scary.  Living here all my life though, if you take the necessary precautions, everything is okay.  October is usually beautiful."
College Sophomore,2,One day it is 90 and the next day there is snow. If you are scared of tornadoes do not come to school here because they happen all the time. The campus does have tornado safe areas but only a few a located within the dorms. When the weather is bad the school always loses power.
College Sophomore,2,"I was a business major because they give out tons of scholarships and sell you on a stellar program. However 90% of the students in the business school hate being there with a passion. No one participates unless they are forced to by the professor. A lot of OCU's professors are adjunct as well. I am leaving the school because the business school teaches you only how to think inside the box and how to follow the ""norm."" However I have heard stellar things about the musical theater and acting programs. All students in the performing arts have mandatory weigh ins. Many students suffer from severe eating disorders that the departmental majors pretends to not notice."
College Sophomore,2,I was a Business major and the work load was okay. I did not enjoy my classes because I felt like the teachers baby the students. The business school only gives internship/job opportunities to the teacher's pets or to students who have their elite business scholarship. The facility is top notch however things are always broken or the staff doesn't know how to run things correctly. The business counselors are the absolute worse. They offer no guidance and give off a feeling that they do not care about their students. I have heard the counselors in other departments are way more on top of things.
College Sophomore,2,"They give out TONS of scholarships but then pile on loads of extra hidden fees. They stack late fees on things you payed for or overcharge you for things. You have to watch your account balance like a hawk. They keep raising tuition as they continue to give out scholarships. Most substantial scholarships are rewarded to majors where they lack students. Example: math, science, and business."
College Freshman,2,Most guys are gay. It's a performing arts school. The girls are pretty and fit mostly. Not nearly enough straight boys to go around.
College Freshman,2,"There are some house parties thrown by the same few people. They are boring, attended by the same group of drunk, silly people mostly."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a campus bus that makes occasional trips to walmart, but it is primarily ment for international students.  There are a few resturants and grocery stores within walking distance, but I wouldn't walk to any of them at night as a girl alone.  The public busses aren't great.  You really need a car or a good friend with a car."
College Sophomore,2,"The transportation at Oklahoma City University is not very convenient.  There is a system for student to rent cars.  I am not aware of the cost.  However, transportation is not necessary if you live on campus.  The campus is very small and therefore walking to any part of it from living quarters is not a hassle.  I rated it low because there is not transportation outside of campus, that I am aware of."
College Senior,2,Parking is rather difficult because since all of the law school is made up of commuters they have a lot of parking that is designated therefore there are very few convenient places for an undergrad to park on campus.
College Sophomore,2,The atmosphere and scenery on campus is awesome but its like we're in our own little bubble. Around us is ugly scenery and unsafe areas. However there is a mall close by as well as a cute little town with some night life and OKCs professional basketball team.
College Sophomore,2,The only good covered parking is for the students living in Methodist Hall. The cost of a parking permit isn't too bad though and wherever you park is usually pretty dang close to your classes and forms since we have a small campus. Just be sure to park in your designated area. Otherwise you'll be given a ticket right away.
College Sophomore,2,Well first off you aren't allowed to live off campus until you're 21 and if you do decide to go ahead and move off the school doesn't offer much help. The houses are alright around school but the area is rough and not very safe to be out alone in.
College Junior,2,"Its avg. Its a private catholic school you cant expect it to be not strict.
its good for everyone to have it that strict."
College Junior,2,The local atmosphere around okc from the looks is not very safe. We go to a very nice school but are surrounded in a pretty rough neighborhood.
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do but go to a trashy club down the street, or go to a bunch of trashier parties and get drunk. Bricktown is all cool and stuff, but you cannot get into anything under 21. Transportation involves you driving or begging for a ride."
College Freshman,2,"The cost is much too high, and not worth a lot of housing says they have to offer. It would be cheeper to live completly off campuswith no meal plan, than to try to scrape up money to afford to live here."
College Freshman,2,"They Annoy Me â€“ I am not in a greek life, its just for meeting people and having parties. They of good things as well, but its just not my scene."
College Senior,2,If i lived on campus i would alot time for finding a parking spot.  If you live on campus always walk since the campus is not big.
College Senior,2,"Average at Best â€“ OKC is not what you would call a 'happening town' as there are many areas that lack the accommodations one needs to have a good time. For a capitol city, one needs to have a car in order to get around town as there isn't a reliable public transportation system (it appears as though low-income residents use it) and things are so far apart that one can't walk to attractions, even though the university is located in OKC. It isn't OKC's fault that it is so big; however, there could have been more invested in upgrading the general aesthetics of the community surrounding the university."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Nothing Good Within Walking Distance â€“ apartments aren't that hard to find, but don't even think about traveling to campus without a car in non-daylight hours. It's dangerous considered dangerous once you get off campus."
College Freshman,2,It's frustrating because I never know what to wear. The mornings could be freezing and the afternoons blazing!
College Junior,2,"very unpredictable, sometimes running and it's still summer.snow a lot too"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The weather can be completely different day to day. We get hot, dry weather, as well as windy rain, hail, tornados, snow, and ice. Be prepared for anything."
College Sophomore,2,"Bad Focus â€“ So the alcohol/smoking rules aren't very strictly enforced, even though we have a ""zero tolerance"" policy. However, when a girl in my grade lied to campus police and told them that my friends had been harassing her, they were going to put it on their permanent records without even considering other testimony to the contrary (like mine). I think the school needs to decide which infractions are more serious than others."
College Sophomore,2,"Not So Strict â€“ There are people who regularly keep alcohol in their rooms. One of my most recent roommates kept at least six cans of beer readily visible in the fridge, but it was very difficult to get RA's to do anything about it. I'm sure it would even be possible to hide alcohol in the more supervised dorms, since room checks are very superficial rituals.

One of my sister's old roommates would go out onto the balcony adjacent to her side so that any ashes her cigarette might leave could be blamed on two of the other three residents in that room. Those two even put a ""No Smoking"" sign above their balcony door, but the behavior continued."
Freshman,1,"If you are already experiencing low self esteem and looking to build it up, I would NOT recommend coming here. About 95% of students on campus ( predominantly MT or Dance Majors , but can apply also with Theatre Majors as well) are full of people who fill themselves with entitlement and too much pridefulness and would judge a person based on status ( Which is ridiculous I mean what is this high school)?"
College Sophomore,1,"The people in charge of housing are unprofessional, rude, and do not look out for the students best interest. the RAs get to do whatever they want. the cost of housing is too expensive for what you get out of it."
Recent Alumnus,1,There is a great greek life only if you want to be sober and active on campus. 
Recent Alumnus,1,The apartments are old and really need to be updated.  They extremely overpriced for the quality of the apartment.  It would be more cost effective to live off campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Bad for Straight Girls â€“ There is not really any other way to say it but there are an unusually large number of gay men attending OCU which may or may not be directly related to the liberal arts. Not that this is a bad thing but if you are a female and coming to OCU to find ""Mr. Right""... it may take a long long time."
College Junior,1,Dry Campus â€“ I know of a 40 year old living in a dorm who was punished for having wine in her dorm.
College Sophomore,1,"It's the City's Problem â€“ Moving around campus is fairly simple because it's so small, but if you want to go out into the city, you'll have problems. OKC has an incredibly insufficient public transit system (if it can be said to have one at all). This is especially troublesome when the surrounding neighborhood can be considered ""dangerous"". This is more of a city problem though, and less of a university issue."
College Senior,1,"Serious need of improvement â€“ If you live in the cheaper dorms, you are SOL. Students living in the apartments get their own lot and so does the students in the expencive Meth Hall. Otherwise there isn't a lot of parking available. students have only a small parking lot near the dorms or a larger parking lot all the way by the gym. The Law studnets basically get free reign to any parking that is convenient. Also the Buisness school have a huge lot which is rarely full that only professors and commuting students can park. The worst parking is at the frat houses where they have almost no parking. "
College Sophomore,1,Terrible Transport â€“ Public transportation in Oklahoma City is crappy. Waiting for a bus can take forever or it might not come at all. The best way to get around is to have your own car or call a cab.
College Sophomore,1,"Dry Campus â€“ Why does this matter to high school seniors, Univeristys should be about education not how much you can party or if you can hook up!!!..

I'm sure if you wanted to get drugs you could, just like despite the fact that the school is a dry campus people still drink, but i dont understand why this is relivant."

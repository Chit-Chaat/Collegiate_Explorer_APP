Sophomore,5,The only experience was definitely different but my experience was good. All my professors were communicating with me respectfully and I never ran into any issues. I would do online classes again but I have no negative feedback in this experience.
Sophomore,5,I believe Savannah State is a beautiful school with an amazing campus. The atmosphere is warming and the students definitely make the campus feel like home. I believe there are a few things that could be better at the school but everything can always use improve it. I don't believe the negative image of the school is deserved. This school has alot of great resources and the sea behind the school is breathtaking. The professors are great but I believe the students make SSU better. Never met a good group of people who support each other and support each other like SSU. We are one big family. I do wish we could have more funding at the school so things wouldn't get cut. But im glad my first experience with college was at SSU. You will be all kinds of people especially people who don't make you feel alone.

The campus and the HBCU atmosphere has helped me gain an understanding on what it means to be an educated African American female. It has shown me that my mind, my heart, and my skin color shall be things that enhance me, instead of things that negate me. The staff have been very helpful thus far and I have encountered many faculty members who go above and beyond despite being paid way less than they deserve. I realize how blessed I am to be able to receive a college education and my studies have become my top priority. My ‚ÄúUniversity by the Sea‚Äù has greatly  impacted my life and I will put in every necessary amount of hard work to continue my college career here. Thank you."

Join alot of clubs, branch out and network, get to know people because these guys will become like family and focus, focus, focus on your education. It is really easy to slip up and be behind the curve and that 3.0 gpa is hard to keep ."
Freshman,5,"My 1st year at Savannah State was a great experience. The college atmosphere was great and I met alot of new people. My professors were tough but they also encouraged me to be  self motivated and take more responsible for my learning. That inspired me to work harder.

 One area that needs improvement is the security of people coming on campus. Eben through security is seen daily, many outside people are on campus that's not part of campus activities or programs.

The students at Savannah State are treated with a lot of respect and that's makes me proud to be a student. Many of my friends brags about their advisors and how they help with classes, issues and guidance."
Junior,5,"Honestly, it has its ups and downs but that is with any college. When I first came here I felt like I didn't fit in and maybe I didn't belong here. But as the days went by I got out of my room more and met people. That alone transformed how I viewed the school. The campus is nice and the food is pretty good. If you don't like the on-campus food, there are plenty of restaurants outside the gate. I've come to love the school. Its all about perception"
Sophomore,5,"I loved their motto. It actually means you can get anywhere from here. The housing is better than most colleges. It comes with full kitchens to cook in. I love how everybody treats everybody with respect, and everyone is willing to help everyone. The professors could be better. Some of them don't do what's necessary to help out when needed. Others don't care. But for the professors who actually do the right thing they are appreciated. I love the dress for success Wednesday's, and the spirit wear Friday's. It really gives the University a chance to show off their school and everything it's made of. Dress for success makes you feel good. When you look good, you feel good."

Savannah State is the oldest historically black college in the state of Georgia and has shaped me into in the woman I am today. Currently as a junior, I have had the opportunity to create a blueprint of my future with the help of my university.

Senior,5,"the thing  that attracted me to Savannah State University was that it's away from home, haha. Once i was able to visit the campus it was breathtaking. Everywhere you would go there would be so much school pride. I asked myself, ""wow, would I be this happy if I attended this school too?"" Then came homecoming...... that was the MOST fun I ever had in my life; from the parties all the way down to the tailgating experience. Being in Savannah, there's never a dull moment, it's always something to do whether it be on campus or off."

However, after my visit to Savannah State I immediately called my mom informing her that this school was the perfect fit for my next 4 years of learning. 
Two months later my mom and Aunt brought me down to Savannah for orientation and the chemistry placement test.

Fast forwarding 3 years later Savannah State was one of the best decisions I‚Äôve ever made."

Freshman,5,"I love the environment at SSU! Easy to get around campus. The professor not only want you to pass, but SUCCEED, in their classes.

Freshman,5,My experience at Savannah state is overall the best experience in my life so far. I love that it is an HBCU and how historically the school is. It has so much history behind it.

Freshman,5,I am a current freshamn at Savannah State University but I have transfer credits too. They accpeted all my credits I had did during MOWR and their policy is that if it matches in course name or has similar description of material then they will accept it which I thought was great. Their very big on school pride and knowing our alma mater is of highest importance. I heard there's a oral or written exam we are given as final test for our First Year Experience classes.

Savannah State University has taught me discipline in one of the best ways possible. This discipline has also taught me that in fact ""anything i put my mind to I can do"". I believe in myself wholeheartedly and as a student at the University of Savannah State i feel as if the faculty and staff believe in me as well. Savannah is my second home to Atlanta anywhere i go I make sure to represent my school by being bold, being respectful, being intelligent and being tiger proud."
Sophomore,5,"When I arrived to Savannah State University, I was really excited because I was a freshmen and I didn't know what to expect. All of my friends and family talked to me about their personal experiences while being in college. I took in all of their advice on who to be friends with, not going everywhere with anybody I dont know, and the occassional lectures on stay focus and prioritizing. Savannah State Univeristy had a great welcome week for incoming freshmen but as fine went by, I starting realizing how college life really was.   So I eventually had to adapt in making my schedueling more flexiable to complete my work and do other actives on campus such as parties, going downtown, doing community service and working  out in the gym. if I were to change anything, I would change the visitation hours because it mademe and other college students feel as if they didn't have any freedom as well as the process timing for paperwork and information."
Freshman,5,I like how the professors and staff at Savannah State University care about the students. They want us to succeed and they will help us do that if that's what we need .

Freshman,5,"It's a really nice school ! You'll love it your first semester . The professors are pretty nice , they don't let you miss out on too much ."
Sophomore,4,"The College of Business Administration or COBA for short is a really great school to attend. The business program itself is very structured and competitive. The students are taught on all aspects of business to have a overall understanding. Then they are taught their specific major specialization in my case its Global Logistics and International Business. There are others such as Management, Marketing, and accounting.  I have found the subject material very interesting and can't wait to learn more.  If you have a meal plan at Savannah State King Frazier is the place you'll want to get food. They have buffet style and healthier options. Don't waste your time at the student union food court unless your using the Corner Caf√© . You'll get more food at King Frazier Dining hall."
Freshman,4,"The student life is great. The faculty dealing with financial aid and some of the advisers are trash. It is a great school full of opportunities but you Have to go find them or forge them yourselves. I love my HBCU but the adults who run it can definitely do a better job. The food is good, the social life is great, and all together the school is a vibe."
Sophomore,4,Only took the remaining Spring courses online due to COVID19.  I had no issues with accessing the courses or materials.  It was a smooth transition.
Junior,4,"I have made many friendships and found many opportunities to excel in my major and for charity. I do not, however, like how some things were taken away from the students that are necessary like our dining dollars."
Sophomore,4,"One of my favorite things about Savannah State is #SSUDress on Wednesdays, where all of the students dress up in professional business wear for the whole day. It doesn't seem like a big deal but I feel like it not only helps with confident but also teaches students on what is and isn't acceptable as business wear. Another thing I like about Savannah State is how included everyone will make you feel, at Savannah State you will feel like you're apart of a big family that you stay connected to even when you graduate."
Freshman,4,The community and relationships built on campus is a memorable experience that brings Scholar‚Äôs from all different backgrounds together to reach a common goal of academic excellence.

Though there could be time when you feel a bit boxed in you have to just get out of your dorm room and just explore a little bit more because there are so many organization on campus that'll educate you and keep you active , if your classes are not enough already. The best advice I could give one is to not be shy and adventure to the best of your ability! It is also important to build a good connection with your professor they may have job opportunities for so just speak with them and do not be afraid to share your story with them."

Alum,4,"I love Savannah State University. I love the sense of pride and family atmosphere here. I loved Dress For Success every Wednesday. I appreciate all the professor that really cared about their students and did their best to be relatable to us and understand us. I appreciate Dr. Kimberly Frame and Dr. Christina Davis for being rockstar professors and keeping me on my toes. I also appreciate Coach Kellie Fletcher for being the best cheerleading coach that program has ever seen.  Sure, Savannah State has their share of problems but name one school that does not. The idea of a college experience has to include the struggle or else it would only be half as beneficial. Coming in as a freshman and transitioning to a graduate program at that same institution, gives me such nostalgia. Especially when I walk through the campus pass by dorms that I used to reside in. I have so much love and appreciation for Savannah State University for making me into the professional woman that I am today."
Sophomore,4,Savannah State is a great school. The professors actually care about you. Savannah State have a very family like environment.
Senior,4,"I was asked so often for what reason I needed to go to a little school when a major college is so much better. Try not to misunderstand me, I'm certain a major college is extraordinary yet I completely love heading off to a smaller school. I realize that I pass up huge games and having individuals really know where it is.  I become acquainted with a great many people at my school and I know my educators great. I am so cheerful I settled on the choice to go to Savannah State University. I like the school spirit that Savannah State University has as well. They always want you to achieve and they always have our best interest. Some things I want to change is the food they serve the students."

The classes are challenging and prepares me for the higher level classes, I know how to budget properly, and I know how to get any business taken care of. Although there are not many options for food, it is still great and fills me up. There are plenty of other students, faculty and staff that are willing to lend a helping hand if ever needed. Despite what critics may say, I love this college and would not transfer anywhere else."
Senior,4,Savannah State is a decent university that has a beautiful campus right beside the marsh. You can smell the ocean right beside the eating cafeteria.  The campus is pretty big and each building has its own story. It is a beautiful HBCU that I enjoy . Yes it may have some issues but the school overall is decent
Senior,4,"Savannah State University being an HBCU has given me the experience of a life time. As a person of color, attending an HBCU and learning about not only the history of my school, but also the purpose of HBCU's in general has given me much more of an insight on just how important they are to this country. Like every university it has its minor problems and hiccups, but that is overshadowed by the great things that go on in this city and on campus . The amount of diversity seen at the university is quite astonishing as well, the level of acceptance that comes from my peers is heartwarming. This school in its entirety has helped me find myself, help me find life long friends and given me a pathway to have a prosperous future."
Niche User,4,I am a dual enrolled student at SSU and I have had a wonderful experience . They have really helped me adjust to a college lifestyle and have prepared me for my future in post-secondary education.

Sophomore,4,"the diversity on Savannah state campus is astonishing for it to be a HBCU predominantly black school we have all different types of races on campus and plus there are just great vibes on campus from the activities hosted in the student union to the study group hosted around exam week all down to the student life . the athletic are slowly graduating to a point where there is more attendance and more support not just from current students but also the alumni. there are just a lot  of opportunities for one to flourish at Savannah state.  from the different organizations such as CAB campus activity board, to NAACP, the leaders on campus and just small organizations such as chess club, book club, etc."
Freshman,4,Savannah State is a great institution to attend. While attending the institution I have realized that not only do they care about your academics but also about your outward and inward appearance. They are all about integrity and respect. everyone that you see has class and is working towards a purpose whether that's on campus or in their study.

Freshman,4,"I love SSU, this transition from high school to college, and living with my mom to living on my own was not at all overwhelming. The campus is manageable. The floor plan of Tiger Place and Tiger Court are nice. If you want things to be done, like financial aid for example you have to be very determined and on top of it! The parties are lit! The food is defiantly a hit or miss. The teachers I‚Äôve had have been helpful. Overall, I love my SSU."
Freshman,4,Savannah state makes you feel like your at home. They welcome you would open arms and everybody is like family.
Junior,4,I have had a wonderful and diverse experience within my last 3 years attending Savannah State University. I love the African history and growth of the school over the years. The safety of the school is my main concern when it comes to the school and hope this will improve. There a multiple eating facilities on the campus.

Freshman,4,"My experience at Savannah State is amazing. The campus is beautiful, the staff is helpful when needed. Academically awesome!"

Like most people say you make your college experience how you want it to be. Become involved in organizations don't be scared to do things.
Junior,4,"When I first attended Savannah State University, I admit I did not like it. To the location from the people, it was all a new experience for me. Two years later, I love my HBCU (Historically Black College/University), Savannah State University. Every university/college has its inner problems, but you are the ultimate benefactor. I learned that, the only person to make it the best four years of your life. I joined the school's Newspaper and have participated in various community service opportunities. I also was inducted into the University's chapter in the National Honor Society."
Sophomore,4,"Being an out of state student from Madison Wisconsin, then attending Savannah state was a eye opener for me. I never really attend a school with a lot of other students of color. I recommend this school for African American students especially because there is so much culture and history invested into this school. All by attending Savannah State, us as students get know ourselves better and our culture. I've learned more about African American history in one year at Savannah State than any other time in my education."
Junior,4,My experience was a roller coaster. Being that I transferred there it was semi hard for me to adjust. But thank god I had friends that went there and I also met people along the way.
Sophomore,4,I have already spent a year at this college. I am ready and somewhat ecstatic to see what else it has to offer.
Junior,4,"It is a nice school. Most of the professors are lenient, but some are strict. Campus life is interesting. Overall, it is what you of the experience."
Freshman,4,"The school is not a bad school. It is a lot of positivity around this campus and the history of this school and campus is very, very interesting. Only thing I don't like about the school is that the Library is not 24 hours and we don't have a restaurant on campus that stays open late"
Sophomore,4,"Savannah State was not my first choice school, but I am glad I decided to come here. The professors are extremely helpful and I have learned a lot from them. There are not a lot of parties on or around the campus so it is easy to study and stay on track with school. The school is 30 minutes from Tybee Island and about 15 from anything else, so there is never a dull moment in my spare time. I feel that coming to Savannah State, I will stay on track to graduate and reach my overall career goals."
Freshman,4,"Personally I love my hbcu, Savannah State Univserity. Its a very family oriented university and the professors are very helpful. However, I would the change the fact that our president isnt very involved with the school."
Junior,4,"Savannah State is a great university. I wish their financial aid office was more helpful, I continued to have issues with them. However,  the people are great and the surrounding area is wonderful."
Freshman,4,Although Savannah State may have few issues in get things done in time. The school is not a bad place to revive a degree.
Freshman,4,"During my first semester at Savannah State University I had a great experience because the teachers are very nice and caring and majority of the students all have a bond together. The only think I would like to change is for the students to show more love, spirit, and appreciate to our school. Some Savannah state students dislike certain things about the school and say bad things about Savannah state university. I would just like for those students to fix the problem at the school to help the school be better. Other than that I love Savannah State University and the campus life."
Sophomore,4,"I attended SSU as a freshman. There were a lot of students from my high school and other high schools near where i lived, so it was easy to connect and make friends. Savannah State is like a family school everyone likes to party together especially around homecoming. The professors really are there for you and want to make sure you pass, they will really work with you to keep you on track. The campus is small so pretty much everyone knows each other and gets along well. The dorms are all nice, the freshman have some co-ed dorms and some traditional dorms. The upperclassmen have a choice between on campus apartments and on campus town houses which are both nice and well taken care of.  The campus has three different food places, each consist of different types of food such as the cafeteria, the union ans tiger express. The school is an HBCU but is also very diverse. overall I enjoyed attending Savannah State and would recommend upcoming freshman to attend."
Sophomore,4,"The security protocol should be changed, the enthusiasm of the employees, the professors are Great, however the math professors all seem to be foreign making it harder for us to understand,"
Sophomore,4,"Savannah State is a very exciting school to attend, but there is alot that they could work on. Like guarenteeing safety that they aren't providing, and students definitely aren't getting what they're paying for."
Freshman,4,I am currently a college freshman here at Savannah State University. My experience here has been a great one. I really like the fresh faces that I have never seen before. I enjoy the campus life and the food. My professors are great and easy to talk to and reach if I have any concerns.
Junior,4,"As a Savannah State University student, I have access to a wealth of programs, resources and activities.  This institution provides me with information to make navigating life at SSU a little easier. "
Sophomore,4,"There are a variety of different opportunities that are presented at Savannah State University, such as holiday events, concerts, Greek life, sports, fashion and talent show and so much more. Savannah State even gives student the luxury to introduce opportunity to their peers and the community themselves. Although, there are an abundance of amazing positive aspects of SSU, like any other college, there are also contras. Some may agree that it is very difficult to obtain help from certain officials on campus; such as the financial aid office, the cashier's office and even some advisory officials. Also Savannah State University is a popular diverse HBCU, which is located in the middle of a low income, high crime rate community, which could definitely entice a major concern amongst the students and campus."
College Freshman,4,My favorite experience has been getting to my fellow tigers at Savannah State University.
College Freshman,4,Savannah State encourage you to find you a little part time job if possible and that's why they offer jobs on campus. The reason is because they understand that some didnt come with a car and then you have some who needs some financial help because their doing it on there own.
College Freshman,4,My classes are average some are big and then others are small. Also the style of teaching is something I'm gonna have to learn because there not gonna wait on you because they are expecting you to be ahead of the game.
College Freshman,4,When it comes down to our safety the police department is always informing us that if anything happen make sure you call them. No matter what time or day you call them they dont ever want us to feel like were alone and at anytime we're out late always walk in groups.
College Freshman,4,My housing is GREAT! I live in the fllc currently and I love it there's always something to do and people are always around. You get a chance to meet and greet with new people and speak with the SOLS and ask them questions you may have. It's like best of both worlds really I couldnt ask for a better building to live in honestly.
Junior,2,Very great students and atmosphere. Horrible campus workers and professionals. Overall they were mostly looking for money but they presented a good goal but somehow sometimes failed to fall through with that goal. And the cleanliness of the dorms seemed not be a huge priority involving rain damage.
Sophomore,2,Savannah state in my opinion is one of the best HBCU in the country. It open my eyes to things that a person like me should've known about.
Freshman,2,School is ok needs to be more diverse and more school oriented. School spirit could be there more and the campus food could improve.
Sophomore,2,"Savannah State University or as we call it the Illustrious University by the Sea Savannah State University is an alright school; However do not let the hype get to your mind. The diversity of teachers is excellent as well as the academics, and there are many organizations on campus for students to be active and contribute to there temporary home for the upcoming years. There are many downfalls though, Savannah State housing is horrible, the security is decent but not at the level it should be, the food is hit or miss, and financial aid/cashier office is horrible with getting students information together and processed in time for school to start. There is a long list of bad news to give; However, some people love the school throughout all of this and others hate it."
Sophomore,2,Savannah State is not my best choice. I wish I would of applied somewhere else. It‚Äôs not a bad school but as far as safety it is terrible. It‚Äôs sad that you have to constantly look over your shoulders because it‚Äôs unsafe.
Sophomore,2,"I like how caring the teachers are and understanding, what i didn't like is that sometimes Savannah state can be unorganized and the dorm i live in have to many problems and they don't care to fix them fast enough."
College Freshman,2,its somewhat safe. it can be improved though
College Freshman,2,"I heard they were okay, but they not that good so aw man :/"
College Freshman,2,Everybody smokes weed n drinks
College Freshman,2,Overall athletics are not good. They need help
College Sophomore,2,To be honest i have no idea so that is kind of bad on their behalf.
College Freshman,2,"the housing rooms are to small and sometimes messy, and there are also to many rules for the college students."
College Junior,2,Football team can use some work. Overall everything else is good.
College Freshman,2,You only see them at social outtings and parties.
College Freshman,2,"heating/ac systems dont work proporly, unorganized, not helpful"
College Junior,2,Housing that is assigned to upperclassmen  is old and rundown. There should be some funding allocated to renovating housing.
College Freshman,2,It takes a while for financial aid to process.
College Junior,2,"Horrilbe , very slow at processing paper work."
College Sophomore,2,"My school is the pits in football and basketball but we are the top in baseball. Many st,dents attend on athletic scholarships and the school has many rival teams with long histories of back and forth wins and losses."
Recent Alumnus,2,Team involvement and performance go hand in hand to show support for the school. School sprit is designed to help banter the need of the students and support the need for bigger stadiums and creative athletics needs.
College Sophomore,2,im at a hbcu there a few other peope of other ethnicity other than blacks
College Sophomore,2,"Social science, whiting,Jordan and sometimes even Payne is soooo hard to park in in the middle of the day"
College Sophomore,2,"Never had to go through financial aid at another school but, at Savannah State it was a badddd experience took hours to go through."
College Sophomore,2,Not terribleeee but I've visited other schools and their facilities are WAYYY niccer but hey SSU is trying. People complain about how much more we need but don't wanna pay for the better facilities JUST SAYING lol
College Freshman,2,people constantly smoke and drink
College Freshman,2,Drugs at our school are easily accessed. People are using these drugs within our campus and are continuing to get away with it.
College Junior,2,"The police officers and security guards on campus aren't allowed to do their jobs. It seems like they ride around the campus patrolling for parties and drug usage, but they aren't there when someone is getting robbed or shot at. They treat students who live on campus like prisoners, but the locals who are on campus illegally with respect."
College Junior,2,"I think it will be a hard process getting into a good law school after graduation, because of the undergraduate university I have attended, but I won't let that hold me back. I am confident enough to apply to all the law schools that I wish to attend, and I will hope for the best. The most important criteria for admission will be the GPA requirement, because the best law schools in the country, expect students to have a very high undergraduate GPA. I'm still in the process of applying for schools, but the application process seems fair at this moment."
College Junior,2,Not a lot to do.
College Junior,2,Limited housing off campus that is too expensive.
College Junior,2,Campus crime is very bad because there's a general lack of security at the gates during certain hours of the day. Some off campus people will sneak in and stay til after hours and that is usually when events happen that cause problems.
College Junior,2,The city is more for older people and younger people tend to stay on campus or head to the beach to have fun.
College Sophomore,2,"Monday I had on a sundress in sandals. Tuesday it was freezing and needed winter boots. Wednesday it poured down rain, got bright and sunny then dark and poured down harder then back to sunny in a matter of minutes. It can be a hassle to dress and go places."
College Freshman,2,Start early. To get everything you need done and start school on time. You should start the process early
College Freshman,2,Let's just say drugs at Savannah State University are a big part of parties/kickbacks and most social gatherings.
College Freshman,2,"Considering my school is a HBCU you can totally understand why it's so homogenous. We have SOME diversity, but not much."
College Freshman,2,the 2nd most dangerous school in america
College Freshman,2,It does not have a variety.
College Freshman,2,Like I mentioned earlier - its a pretty bad area and I don't feel safe leaving campus to get something to eat.  
College Freshman,2,I was evicted out of my dorm even though I applied for financial aid early and was awarded prior to the start of school.  The issue was with the financial aid staff not understanding how to apply the loan and it took several months to correct the issue.  They have poorly trained resources helping new students get on board.  
College Freshman,2,The off campus housing is bleak and pretty much obsolete and not safe.  
College Sophomore,2,"They are either broke, you cannot print when you absolutely need too. Not a hot mess but close to it."
College Junior,2,"I received a good amount of financial assistance, but a horrible experience when i got hope and suddenly they took it away, because they didn't check my information correctly."
College Sophomore,2,There is a need for more places to park. Especially during move in day when there's hundreds of students moving in with many cars in the way of the next car.
College Senior,2,"I must give our population a C because we have a lot of people but not much quality. We have very good looking people but they sometimes abuse that fact about themselves. Most of our people, in my opinion, do not really value themselves to the fullest degree."
College Junior,2,a majority of the campus is of the black race. a hand full of caucasion and very few of any other race
College Junior,2,"I feel like the weather at Savannah State has a mind of its own. One day it will be raining and then the next it will be sunny, which isn't hard t understand being that the school is only minutes away from the Atlantic ocean. I recommend you keep an umbrella on you at all times in a bag or something to carry it in."
College Sophomore,2,The diversity among students are slim to none. There are mostly African American and a few Caucasian students here and there. The school should try to appeal to more ethnicities.
College Sophomore,2,"In my opinion, its not a lot of places you can actually live off campus. Its mostly houses around our campus. Most of the apartments are further out from campus."
College Senior,2,"The tickets can be quite annoying especially if you play baseball because there is no baseball player parking location. We park in the on campus apartments ""the ville"" and I have recieved two tickets there."
College Freshman,2,At Savannah State our Athletic are below average. Our football team haven't won 5 games since I don't know when. The only sport our school gets recognized for is basketball. So we need a lot of help so that we can build the university to its highest potential.
College Freshman,2,"we have many campus shootings. i feel safe to adegree. i know alot has something to do with the crowd you hang around, but i had a friend that was robbed at gun point next to our dorm, that is not acceptable. but i love this school so i give the safty a C-"
College Sophomore,2,Being that Savannah State is an HBCU the diversity level is very low. There are other few ethnic backgrounds here but you can tell they stand out because they all hang out together rather than mingle.
College Freshman,2,Public transportation is provided but its not really relieable as it pretains to my schedule. I encourage having your own car.
College Junior,2,Savannah is not strict. There are ways to get around security and their rules. Do they do there job in trying to protect us ? OF COURSE ! But it doesn't take that long to realize that there are other ways about doing things.
College Sophomore,2,"There are several restrictions, but they are supposed to be from us to be safe."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not hang out at night. The only time i stay out late is if I had a rehearsal or Im coming in from church,"
College Sophomore,2,We have shuttle buses that takes us around on and off campus but they are pretty slow and unreliable at times
College Sophomore,2,No Place I Would Consider Living ‚Äì Savannah State University is not the  best campus to live. why? because the dorm arrangements are horrible and you you get room with the worst roommates.
College Sophomore,2,"Little to None ‚Äì If you are under 21,there is none. If you have a group of friends you guys will find something to do other than that stay on campus Savannah is an older town. There is always some type of party going on every weekend though."
Freshman,1,Professors definitely thought this was the time to increase work load on students. Everyone‚Äôs situations are different but it was no help from unprofessional professors. Online learning is definitely a learning curve and I feel some of my professors didn‚Äôt support me for it and honestly failed being a decent human being.
Freshman,1,This school is terrible. I had the WORSE experience at Savannah State University AND I WILL BE LEAVING AFTER I GET MY GPA STRAIGHTEN BACK OUT. I HAVE SOME MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS SCHOOL IT IS RIDICULOUS AND IT MAKES ME ANGRY EVERY-TIME I THINK ABOUT ALL THE MESS THEY CAUSED MY FRESHMAN YEAR. I do not recommend this school to anyone. This school does not care about the students at all. They are very unprofessional and a hot mess. SINCE I CAN ONLY USE 1000 CHARACTERS I AM UNABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE I HAD.
Freshman,1,"lemme just tell y‚Äôall. this school is POO. bruh, when i say they do not help you with finances ....... bruh. it‚Äôs ridic. don‚Äôt send your children here. i‚Äôm tellin ya. ain no jokin bih"
College Freshman,1,Security be around all day but never around when something happens until way after
College Freshman,1,they take away our visitation like we kids
College Freshman,1,they get all the glory
College Freshman,1,horrible I hate savannah state
College Freshman,1,Teams put up 90 points on the football team! Male basketball is just as bad.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Security is a huge problem, as there are several crimes and shootings on campus. These cause students fear and unease of their safety at all times."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Living off campus compared to living on campus is a big difference when it comes to price, convenience, and safety for the students. The pros of living off campus would be no rules, no set time for activities, The cons of living on campus would be safety and reliability."
Recent Alumnus,1,Security and safety is often a issue on most campuses which deters most students from living on campus. Strict policies and values are adhered to keep safety number one for all students. Values are often gained by keeping the rules and laws of the school to prevent injury or fault.
College Junior,1,"The financial aid process is horrible. I think the students go through so much to get little funding for school. The advisement isn't great, and there aren't enough scholarships for students that are qualified to get them."
College Junior,1,Not easy to find anything off-campus. Most homeowners don't like to allow students to pay them using refund money and will look at credit which is mostly poor for college students due to lack of experience.
College Sophomore,1,"It is really just the ticketing that poses a problem. Outrageous prices for slight mistakes, the permit cost is ok but it could be lower."
College Junior,1,I am now a upperclassman and attempt  that point the strict rules make you move off campus
College Junior,1,If there is no Decal you get fined. If you park in the wrong spot despite the urgency in you doing so you get a higher fine. Greatly necessary.
College Junior,1,Although we welcome any and everybody to our university Savannah State is hailed as a prestigious Historically Black College and University. With that being said the majority of the student body are African American.
College Freshman,1,"It could be so much better. Days without Hot water, NO visitation, and many more."
College Freshman,1,There are not any restaurants around here that fit that descriptions they all charge full price.
College Junior,1,"The sport team we have at Savannah State University are not very good. However what we lack in performance, we make up for in pride. Everyone on campus takes pride in being a SSU Tiger. Win or lose the tiger chant can be heard throughout the stadium and arena."
College Senior,1,Parking on Savannah State campus is awful. There's not enough good parking spots & parking spots are very limited in areas.
College Sophomore,1,Help Finaid ‚Äì I feel the financial aid at SSU needs organization and they are always slacking. Better system needs and more faculty.
College Freshman,1,To get  good parking you have to come before everyone else. The campus police wont hesitate to give you a parking ticket either. Sometimes if you come too late you might have to park away from your location.
College Senior,1,"One of the most horrible things about my school is the parking. I can honestly say I've racked up a number of tickets just parking at my school I pat tuition at. My school require students to have parking decals which you must pay for and depending on the decal is where you can park. My school is getting bigger every year in student numbers and more cars are coming on campus and at night, parking can be competitive depending on where you are trying to park."
College Junior,1,"We Need Help ‚Äì There are not enough parking spots for the students, they raised the permits on the cost of getting a sticker on your car that shows you are either a resident on campus or you attend their. Raising cost on campus with not enough parking areas is not good. Cars are needed on campus. it help students to travel around the city they are at."
College Freshman,1,At Savannah State the greek life is very important however I gave them a F because they are very divided and are in competition with each other instead of help each other.
College Freshman,1,The weather in Savannah is never constant. There may be rain one moment and sunny the next moment. The humidity in Savannah is very high. Due to the fact that we have a swamp and are near the ocean is a big issue that effects the temperature and climate.
College Freshman,1,Greeks Are No Major ‚Äì The Greek life is not major. It is not how you would think Greek life is suppose to be. However the Greeks are very helpful when it comes to community service and being a mentor for other students. You do not need to be in a frat nor a sorority to get special attention. As the saying goes its not what you know its who you know. As long as you're networking in a positive way you will have a great journey as being a scholar.
College Sophomore,1,"Dining Delimmas ‚Äì Well if your like me, your not a fast food buff. I like going nice places and having a nice meal, and thats nowhere in close proximity to SSU. There are places just noe that really suit my tast or my budget."
College Freshman,1,"Campus Security ‚Äì The campus police takes his job very very serious, and when it is time to come back on camp at late nights, he can be very snobby. He ask for your id along with winding the windows down which is very uneccessary. Also,the police are strict about small kickbacks in the your room, I feel if we are not doing nothing wrong and we are acting like adults then treat us like one!"
College Freshman,1,"High Crime Rate ‚Äì Multiple crimes committed on campus, including shootings, robberies, drugs, and alcohol."
College Freshman,1,"I really dont think there is a good selection because, the affordable ones seem to be in bad neighborhoods and the good ones are expensive"
College Senior,1,"Things to Avoid If Boarding at SSU ‚Äì Alcohol. SSU is a dry campus and even if the students are 21 they are not allowed to have it and keep in mind that alcohol violations are a whopping $500. If you like to have friends over, do so between the hours of 6pm-11pm(Sun.-Thurs.) and 6pm-12am(Fri.&Sat.). ""Illegal"" visitation fines are $100 and this basically happens if you have visitors past the 12am hour. I can honestly deal with the alcohol policy but the visitation policy also includes visitors of the same sex after hours."
College Senior,1,the school is one of the most dangerous college campuses in the state of Georgia..enough said
College Senior,1,the parking is very poor. on campus students with cars are couraged to walk around campus. they give parking tickets out too much and for dumb reasons. we are in college and they treat us like we are already in the work force.. i am very dissappointed with this
College Senior,1,Registration Process ‚Äì The registration process is not that good seeing that you have many classes that conflict with each other and therefore you are stuck choosing what classes you belive are more important. You also have classes that are only offered once a semester and not both semester which in itself is a hassle.
College Sophomore,1,No Words ‚Äì transportation is not even a factor on this campus
College Sophomore,1,"Not Very Diverse ‚Äì Savannah State is a not very diverse school, being that it is an hbcu."
College Freshman,1,"No Cuffing ‚Äì No one ever wants to go steady around here. Everyone loves to have sex, but no one wants relations."
College Freshman,1,"I really despise the student cafe, they have really poor taste and quality."

Freshman,5,I am dorming on campus and it does get lonely sometimes. Especially since it is very isolated. There tends to be a lack of transportation. I want to get a job but everything seems to be so far from me. There thing else on campus is pretty much close because of the virus. So everything is very limited and there are also  alot of precautious.
Sophomore,5,"Merced is a small city, so there isn't a lot to do. That being said, campus life is like a town on its own. My experience so far has made me a better person both in my character and academically."
Sophomore,5,This school has a beautiful campus that is only going to get bigger. I think the academics is very good and has a great school environment. Staff is very kind and super understanding. There are hundreds of clubs and activities one could join if interested. There is a lot of campus jobs. This school does make their students feel safe.
Junior,5,"My experience at UC Merced has been one for the books. The school is new and evolving and I thoroughly enjoy it! At first, students from your high school may look at you and ask why you would even consider going to UC Merced, but being a part of this UC campus has been one of the best decisions of my life and I would never even think about switching schools. It feels amazing to be a huge part of a school that is changing daily. The school is always looking for new and improved ways to vamp up the campus from building new dorm rooms to also building a much larger and new dining center to account for the large amount of students coming in each academic year to the school. I love the fact that most of the new buildings within the 2020 Project have dorm style buildings with classrooms and educational spaces on the bottom floor of the building. It has been nice to be able to roll out of bed, brush your teeth and go straight to class that is within less than a five minute walk to the class."
Junior,5,"Life at UC Merced was difficult to adjust to, but after a while, UC Merced becomes your home away from home. Merced as a city has a special place in my heart. The city is not ideal; however, making the best out of every situation you are put into will allow you to have an excellent time at UC Merced. The campus is growing and expanding constantly which is nice since the campus is new. There are not old and broken things within the campus since all the new tools and gadgets are being introduced and compiled in the new buildings. Living in a brand new dorm room is not something every college student gets to say, but I was lucky enough to have been given that opportunity. Its all about give and take. Being on an older campus, you may experience more of a night life in the surrounding town, but older and broken gadgets on campus. At UC Merced, the school is evolving and the city is trying to keep up with the changes the school is making, but it is hard because the school moves very quick."
Junior,5,It was an odd switch but the professors were very accommodating to the current situation and were flexible with the students needs.
Junior,5,A lot of resources for those who need it. This includes items like tutoring or financial help. Student life is also easy to adjust to.
Freshman,5,To be honest I'm an incoming freshman but the online experience with the student first center was great.
Freshman,5,It's a really nice school. Every looks brand new. I'm excited and looking forward to starting my journey there.
Sophomore,5,Everyone was kind to help one another with the remote learning shift. The professors are more than helpful. The students for the most part respect and help each other.
Sophomore,5,Comfy and welcoming. I am having a memorable time. It is like a community support for all. I like how everyone is there and present in each and everyone's presences.
Freshman,5,"So far my experience at UC Merced has been very good. Everyone I have meant this including; students, faculty, and staff have been very friendly and helpful. Not only that but it is clear that the success and well being of students is the priority of the University."
Freshman,5,"I sincerely enjoyed how much UCM truly cares about their students. The diversity on campus is outstanding and the community is tightly knit. Since they are the newest UC they have amazing opportunities such as being able to take part in new research, etc. They're still adding buildings and remodeling around them to accommodate the students best interest. They really listen to their students and care for them as a whole."
Freshman,5,"All professors and staff did their best to accommodate the students when transitioning to remote learning. They constantly made sure everyone was taken care of, and even for those who didn't have electrical devices at home, were loaned laptops, etc for the remainder of the semester."
Junior,5,Most of my professors did great in teaching online. There office hours were supper accessible and I felt more engaged than ever.
Sophomore,5,"UCM is a great school if it is really what you want your focus to be. There are not many distractions to take part in, so it is most ideal when attempting to divulge completely."
Sophomore,5,"We have an array of ethnicity here at UCM, and our academics don't fall short of amazing either. We are small, but we are also the fastest growing research university in the nation. Since we are such a new UC, we have top of the line technology and completely sustainable architecture. A perk of being a smaller UC is you have more one-on-one time with your professors, so you are able to excel in your classes, as well as, get to know your professor on a personal basis. The atmosphere is so welcoming because the students here are so kind and staff really care about the students. There are plenty of resources to help you throughout your time here. I can see UC Merced becoming the biggest and best UC in a couple of years."
Senior,5,"its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride,its been a good ride repeat"
Freshman,5,University of California Merced is a relatively new campus that is quickly gaining attention as well as prestige. The campus is continuously expanding into greater things.
Sophomore,5,I like that it is really diverse in terms of the student population at whole. They really help out financially and have a lot of resources so that one can succeed in their studies. The people there are really nice and overall it has been a memorable experience.
Freshman,5,"What I like about UC Merced was how diverse it was. There is a lot representation from a lot of different communities. Along with this representation there are also resources for these communities. For example for our African American community there is AFRO Hall (Afrikians For Retention Outreach), LGBTQ+ community we have a resource room, and there is so much more! Changes I would like to see is the meal plan."
Junior,5,"Loving the university so far, very welcoming and one most incredible thing about it is that it is a university that is still growing!"
Freshman,5,UC Merced is a friendly environment with lots of friendly students that will help you when in need of help. There are many resources around campus to go to.
Niche User,5,What I like about UC Merced was how diverse it is. There is a  lot of different communities. Along with this there are also resources for these communities.
Junior,5,"For this school, the friends you have really matter. The professors here are simply amazing and passionate. Even if it is a small school, you'll have a better chance of getting research and job opportunities than other schools. I already have friends who had internships at Google, Facebook, Goldman Sachs; I can go on. The 2020 Project helps with the increase of opportunity and quality of student life. It's also a really good school if you're not really a party person and like quiet college life. Not saying there aren't parties, but if you are looking for a party school, this place isn't for you."
Senior,5,its pretty good overall a great place the surrounding is full of vegetation and the air is a little bit moist/humid but it feels nice. the location and people are nice with a family friendly place you can walk around
Freshman,5,"My experience at UC Merced has been very well so far. The atmosphere is great, whenever I'm on campus I always feel welcomed and safe."
Freshman,5,"I liked the fact that there is not a lot of distractions around the school, itâ€™s mostly farmland which helps focus on school."
Graduate Student,5,Good college. Great teacher. Nice college. Quite area. Have a very good program. Beautiful dorm very safety. All professor very focus to student. Only parking for student to far from building. Have UC bus around the town
Freshman,5,The community that is in UC Merced makes the school much more unique than other colleges. You feel welcomed and are introduced to many research opportunities and resources for your future success.
Freshman,5,"I like that the university provides students with free tutoring, a beautiful green campus, and professors that are very knowledgeable in their fields. There's a marketplace in case students forgot the essentials to daily life such as toothbrushes and nail clippers as well as diverse foods. I also like how class sizes are kept small despite how many students attend UC Merced. Everyone has a chance to talk to the professors if they need more attention and it's amazing how much information we cover and explore in class. One of the things I enjoy about campus is how delicious the food tastes since I'm able to enjoy something new every other week. We can also bring food into the library which is a huge relief when I have to study for a couple of hours without moving."
Sophomore,5,"Growing up in a suburban neighborhood for the majority of my adolescence and then suddenly starting the next four years of my academic career in a rural university came with its own strengths and weaknesses.  In my first year, I grew the most as an individual and realized aspects of my character to greater accommodate the transition of living away from home and the comfortability I had known for all my life.  UC Merced is unique from every other UC campus due to its diverse demographic and teamwork mentality.  I have not met an unkind individual who wasn't willing and able to help a stranger in need."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy going to class every day knowing that it's here at UCM. My classes are very interesting to me which keeps me intrigued in the lectures. The staff are very kind, the pavilion food is decent, and the campus is always looking spot on clean. It is just such a welcoming environment which is why I enjoy learning here."
Sophomore,5,"Well like many here, UC Merced wasn't my first choice but the University has a very special feel here that many of the others don't have. Stepping on campus feels refreshing, the campus is so diverse so its very easy to fit in and the people on campus are extremely friendly. UC Merced still isn't what most of the other UC's are yet, but that doesn't mean its never going to get there. The University really wants you to succeed and go on to graduate and that is something that is very apparent and obvious. UC Merced to many is the gateway to a better future for them and their families, it is almost poetic how the campus is still expanding and growing at the same time as the students are. UC Merced has something very special to it, everyone is a pioneer here because without us the university would never get the opportunity to grow to the scale of the other UC's. So if you want to feel apart of something bigger and truly make a difference, then this is the college for you."
Sophomore,5,"Although UC Merced is the newest university added to the UC system, it is vastly growing. The campus life is extremely amazing, it's feels as if you're living in a small town on campus, which allows you to feel comfortable and at home. Stepping on this campus will never make you feel out of place because it is rich with diversity. It is easy to fit in and find the wonderful group of people, just for you! UC Merced also offers many different variety of courses for their students that helps guide the students towards the path that is right for them. The professors and staff are extremely helpful with their students and are always ready to provide students with the help that is needed. UC Merced is an amazing school!"
Freshman,5,"The college campus is very modern and resourceful. During my orientation, upperclassmen were very welcoming and friendly. For being such a new university, UC Merced offers many opportunities."
Freshman,5,"It's still a new school. They are trying to expand. If you are comfortable with small classes, then this school is for you. They do have some seminars that fits a couple hundred, but most classes are from 15-20 students. I look forward for my first year."
Niche User,5,"Literally, the best college there can be. It provides the most financial aid help for students as well as with scholarships. It's the top best for providing financial aid. There are the best of best majors in this school... name it and there it is. If you're looking for psychology it has the best major for it. It's the most diversed even if it doesn't seem like it. Has the best sports section and some of the best athletics. The campus is spaced out well, has some nice places you can study or hang out even though it's in the middle of nowhere. There's remodeling and making of more space so that's good."
Junior,5,"Great school. There's a lot of activities all the time around the school.  A growing school. Everyone is very friendly. This school is very adapting. Nobody ever feels left out, there's something for everybody."
Senior,5,Itâ€™s a fairly new and continuously growing campus. The student life is very diverse allowing you to meet people from different backgrounds. With lots of modern technology and good professors its a good school to go to.
Senior,5,"Its new, its beautiful, small, rural, and rigorous. UCM may get dismissed by a lot of people for its lack of name recognition. But come here and be ready to be wowed. This school is very eager to make a name for its self and it is building a lot of research labs and hiring young and eager professors. Classes are rigorous, and the professors will definitely push you to be the best you. The city of Merced is growing, and has fully embraced being home of the bobcats. Still, don't expect the school town, it isn't that. Instead come here to be part of something new where you can definitely make your mark."
Freshman,5,What I love about the University of California Merced is how diverse the campus is and the student life is amazing everyone is so kind to each other. The buildings are just beautiful.
Freshman,5,"When I first visited merced it gave me a good feeling,that it was going to be my home for the next few years. The diversity there is outstanding and the students and staff are positive and really kind. The campus is pretty big and its expected to expand more which means new opportunities and new buildings."
Junior,5,"Although remote and relatively small, UCM is a great university. At first, I thought i was not going to like this simply because of how small it is and where its located. The environment and school grows on you. Every professor I have had has been great(natural sciences), I expect every other professor is great here as well."
Freshman,5,I would like to see with more connection to the city rather than being out of nowhere. If there could be more majors open and more fun time. Overall it is a great school to go. I have visited and it really does seem to be great.
Freshman,5,"I like that UC Merced is a very diverse, clean, and well managed college. If i were to change UC Merced it would be the size of the bedrooms."
Sophomore,5,"I love Merced for its beautiful sunrises and sunsets. Even though, it's pretty far from the city, I find it to be very peaceful."
Sophomore,5,All the teachers are really nice and helpful. Typically a quiet area and you have to make up your own fun sometimes. Also has many place to go to when you want help.
Senior,5,It is a small UC at first sight but the opportunities there are big. The students and staff are friendly and easy to get along with. Not only that but a helping hand is never too far out of reach. It is a community that thrives off of each other because there is support.
Sophomore,5,"I really like UC Merced. I love the scenery. The community is really good. We are all hard-working students, but we are not as cut-throat as other UC's. The food definitely can be improved. The new buildings are enjoyable."
Sophomore,5,what I liked about UC Merced is that some classes are small and could get that one on one experience. Something I would like to change is for them to inform the students more of the basic needs.
Sophomore,5,"Merced is in the middle of no where and town is 6 minutes away, but it is the most beautiful and quietest place that I love being there. I live in the city so itâ€™s nice to get away from all the chaos and sirens thatâ€™s always going on and hear nothing but nature. The stars are beautiful making it into a beautiful picture. There are no city lights interfering with the stars and no sirens that wake me up. I love Merced"
Freshman,5,"The best thing about UC Merced are the people you meet. The most amazing thing is realizing you aren't completely on your own. The professors, faculty, and students are extremely open to helping you succeed and have the best college experience ever. Yes, it's a small campus but it's still growing and the most wonderful thing is that as the campus grows you grow with it. The amount of diversity the campus has is so refreshing and inviting. I wouldn't change a thing about UC Merced."
Freshman,5,This School is pretty new and everything about the school is fascinating. In addition there is a lot of diversity around and the culture creates friendships. Also the school is very good at helping;ping students financially.
Freshman,5,I like how small the campus is but offers sufficient resources for students. I love how the school gives a ton of financial aid compared to other schools.
Freshman,5,I'm an upcoming freshman and I went to their events and I became fascinated with their programs. Their staff was very welcoming and friendly and overall it was great experience.
Niche User,5,"The University of Merced is an overall amazing school, and I would not make any changes to it since there is already changes in the process."
Sophomore,5,"I love the counselors at University of California- Merced. They are very helpful and very nice. The learning environment is also very good. I have learned a lot over the years, about what I want to pursue and the opportunities that were in front of me to reach."
Sophomore,5,"I love being a student at University of California Merced! The professors are amazing and very helpful. The class sizes are decent, plus discussions and office hours are very helpful when you need extra help. There's plenty of options when it comes to food, there's a brand new dining center and many food trucks. I would definitely encourage people to apply to UCM, it's continuously growing and it great for first generation students."
Freshman,5,"In my short time at the University of California, Merced, I have grown and changed in so many ways that I didn't think were possible. When I first got here, I had the typical, first day of school jitters, but as soon as I met my roommates and my classmates, all the butterflies went away. I was met with a large, but close-knit community of young, intelligent people, who all came to this school to better their education and make a difference in their lives. From the first club meetings I went to, I found a community where I could express myself, learn, grow, and thrive without being judged. I am so glad I made the decision to come here, and I wouldn't trade this experience for anything."
Senior,4,UC Merced is a newer school that is small but has great academics and great student involvement. There is a lot of growth that is happening with campus and academics.
Freshman,4,"This year is a little different. WIth the COVID pandemic, I've stayed at my home in Los Angeles and took my classes online."
Freshman,4,They're handling the Covid-19 pandemic very cautiously and seriously which I very much appreciate. At the same time they're trying to make all their students feel as connected as possible to the school remotely.
Sophomore,4,"It was during my second semester of my first year when most students began moving off campus and eventually moved back home. Because of this, most of the classes transitioned to online which I felt was a little difficult for me to be able to switch from in-person instruction to online video instruction."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently going onto my second year of college and I do believe that the University of California Merced was a great choice, as of this year and last year, it has helped me in more ways than I could have imagined, changing me both physically and mentally. I do live far from Merced--about a 4 hour drive--but to be a part of a school that is continuously developing, I would not have it any other way."
Sophomore,4,"Eventually, mid-spring semester all classes were online. I liked this because I was able to move back home in San Francisco while attending school. At the same time, since I wasn't on campus I got a refund for housing and other fees. Going to tutoring sessions was a challenge but, I was able to keep up with my counselor with ease."
Alum,4,I graduated UC Merced with a bachelors in Human Biology. I had an amazing experience both academically and socially. I made amazing friends who were also my study mates. I highly recommend this school to anyone who is interested in STEM.
Sophomore,4,"On my short time of being at UC Merced, I had great connections with my professors and I am able to find receive any help whether it be on a class material or me mentally. I am proud of how many resources UC Merced has offer to every student on campus. To better improve UC Merced, I believe they should provide more information about scholarships and other financial aid resources, as many students like myself, I know I would apply to them!"
Freshman,4,Something I really enjoyed about UC Merced is how small the school was. This size of school allows you to have better connections with students and staffs. UC Merced provides many resources for students to succeed. The diversity at UC Merced is just amazing.
Freshman,4,UC Merced has a great community. Students are willing to help one another in difficult classes and times. My classmates had made the school a place where I feel welcomed with open arms.
Freshman,4,UC Merced is not as bad as people may say it is. The campus is very spacious with a lot of student activity. The only drawbacks is that the school dining center has sub par food and the town is kind of far from campus with not a lot to offer.
Freshman,4,"Very good teachers and professors. The campus is quite small so its very easy to move around and get to each class. Very nice atmosphere, the only downside is that in the summer it is scorching hot so do not recommend staying at UCM for the summer."
Freshman,4,"What I like about the University is the campus being clean and not too big to get lost in, and there are a lot of helpful resources in order to succeed in school."
Freshman,4,"I love how friendly people are, the amicable environment just welcomes you to the university. I enjoy the connections you make here at UC Merced. The school spirit is definitely here and we try our best to make the best out if the area. Because of how remote the area is, it can bee difficult to really find new things to do. Despite that, the school really tries their ultimate best to provide fun activities for the students such as dances, fundraisers, events and much more. Academically, the help provided here is exquisite, there are TA's, professors, centers, peer help and much more that really encourage you to do your best in your classes. Something else that really helps me is the tranquility that you feel here. Because of the nature such as the trees, the lakes and fresh air we have, you really get a sense of calmness and freedom here."
Freshman,4,"At first I wasn't excited to attend Merced because it wasn't my first choice however, there are many benefits to coming to this school. Tuition is cheaper than most colleges and the campus is continuously expanding. Campus is  great as well as the people."
Sophomore,4,UC Merced is growing quickly and admin is attempting to accommodate to all of their students. Not enough professors or courses to allow students to graduate in time.
Freshman,4,"Very engaging and amazing professors! Many tutoring services and amazing faculty. Not much to do after class, so make sure to get a car or use the bus to have some fun!"
Freshman,4,It's a very pretty campus with lots of resources for the students. The classes are small with about 20 students per class which makes it easy to get to know the professors.
Junior,4,Currently a small University when compared to others which can provide a more tight knit learning experience.
Freshman,4,"As a first year I expected to be ridiculously homesick and tired of being on campus all the time. I was dead wrong! Campus is filled with life, events that aim to reel in students, and a small tight knit community that can be explored on the weekends with the bus shuttles that the school provides for students to go into town. I absolutely love the fact that Yosemite Lake is right in our backyard and within walking distance when you need to clear your head after a day of stress. It was fairly easy to connect with others because of how small the campus is and how nice the students are."
Niche User,4,"What I like about UC Merced was how diverse it was. There is a lot representation from a lot of different communities. Along with this representation there are also resources for these communities. For example for our African American community there is AFRO Hall (Afrikians For Retention Outreach), LGBTQ+ community we have a resource room, and there is so much more! Changes I would like to see is the meal plan."
Sophomore,4,"I liked the diversity that UC Merced had to offer. However, UC Merced lacks fun extracurricular activities and or big events."
Freshman,4,"It's a great place with fantastic teachers and curriculum.  It is a bit boring and it feels like the campus is isolated from the rest of the city, but it's nice."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about the University, it is a small campus and the instructors are very nice and helpful."
Sophomore,4,I dislike the town in which this university is placed at. The clubs and organizations at UC Merced are nice to be part of. It's hard to use your phone's data or make calls from the campus. The professors I've meet are nice to their students and are willing to communicate and help.
Sophomore,4,I have gone through one year at this university and I think it is fine as it is. I would like to see some quality of life improvements like adding more food and housing options.
Freshman,4,"Although UC Merced is impressive for its short term development period, it lacks deeply in Computer and bio - technology programs. It has the weakest facilities, instruments and tools compared to other UC's delaying the students understanding and comprehension the computer sciences. The psychology and humanities programs on the other hand are relative up to par with the other UC's."
Niche User,4,"I recently visited the school, the people there were very amable and helped me right away. They made me feel like I was home and showed me around while explaining everything."
Sophomore,4,"I like how the school is a good size so that we are able to connect with many people, especially people of the same major because there are limited classes and we are able to help each other out. The buildings look very modern, so I enjoy the view too. I joined many clubs, but ended up sticking to 3 or 4, and everyone has been really nice. Based on the pi chart, there would be a higher percentage of Latinos or Hispanic, but the school was actually diverse in my point of view. There are so many resources open to help student with their education as well."
Sophomore,4,"The professors want you to succeed. The people are mostly nice. The only bad thing would be that the location of the school is in the middle of nowhere. There is a lake, but other than that there isn't much to do."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is currently undergoing construction to expand the campus, so that there are more facilities for the students to learn and get hands on experience. The professors are nice, lenient, and trying to help students pass and learn their courses. The students are nice and willing to work together for group projects."
Senior,4,"I have been attending University of California Merced for one and a half semesters. This is a new university in the California state system, and so the town and college does not have a very developed support network compared to other colleges that are much older. Most of the sediment here is to get your degree and get out or transfer. For your money I believe it is a good investment."
Senior,4,The campus is tiny but amazing. The campus is currently under construction and grows so much as days go by.
Sophomore,4,"This new upcoming university provides many academic opportunities for its students. Because most students decide to live on campus and away from home, the programs that the university provides makes that life shift much easier and comforting. Such comforts may include counseling from the Care office, social organizations, local dining and food commodities, physical exercising facilities, etc."
Sophomore,4,"UC Merced is a good school academically. Something that I'd like to see change in is school events. Since the school is in the central valley there isn't much to do, therefore the school should provide more events in my opinion."
Freshman,4,"I love how the professors and students are so kind. This campus is full of diversity and equality, that's what I love about it. Not only that but this school provides counseling and advisors to guide students to perform the best within their abilities for their education."
Freshman,4,The environment of this campus is good for allowing students to study and avoid easy distractions caused by friends. The education level is very high and the professors' expectations do not fall short from other UCs.
Freshman,4,What I like about UC Merced is that the professors actually have time to answer any questions you might have after class if they don't have time to get to you during class.
Freshman,4,UC Merced is the newest UC added to the University of California system.  The school is going through substantial growth.  The school does a good job to recruit prospective students and the student body is the most diverse I've seen in the UC system.  While many of the programs may not be nationally ranked I think UC Merced is doing a good job to recruit top professors through its UC network.  I like that the school support is there for all students who need support and assistance.  I would recommend a school tour to provide you additional in-depth information.  I recently visited and had left with a positive impression that I didn't expect and was very impressed.  Check it out for yourself!
Freshman,4,"UC Merced has a very diverse student population and has the same commodities in education as other UC Schools, but lacks in development. Hopefully those problems would be solved with the 2020 Project."
Sophomore,4,The Students First Center we have here on campus is extremely helpful and kind. However I rates 4 stars because I understand not all students have the same experience as I do and I would like to voice their opinion as well. Also the priorities made for class registration needs to change because it is unfair for students to stay an extra semester because they couldn't get the class they needed.
Junior,4,"Main reason why I went into UCM was because of money. It gave me the most amount of money, which in my case was the number one determining factor of what school to pick. My first official time that I actually got to see the campus was the first day of school. Its located in the middle of almost nowhere and I had not heard much about this school. I did not know what to expect however I was willing to give it a try since it gave me the opportunity to continue school with the least amount of school debt. The first day of school was a moment I will never forget. I fell in love with how the community of the school was so engage with one another. I felt like I was welcome to a new family and a sense of acceptance. The teachers are amazing if you take the time and engage with them. The students are friendly and are always willing to help one another. Although there is not much to do outside of school like city wise, there is a lot of self finding and beautiful nature to enjoy."
Niche User,4,"I am a high school student who is taking college courses at the same time. One year ago, I had the opportunity to visit the campus on a tour and found it to be one that I am now seriously considering. Based on my memory of the tour, the academic and campus seem very good, but I hope to attend an updated tour in the future."
Sophomore,4,It is an extremely nice campus that offers new and advanced classrooms that allow students to stay engaged.
Sophomore,4,"My experience with this University is overall a positive one. It was difficult for me at first to adjust to the city of Merced, seeing that it is very small compared to South California. However, dorming help to alleviate that issue and helped me gain social connections that improved my experience and travel around local areas."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I really like the University of California, Merced. I love how small it is and the positive environment around me. All the professors I have had so far are very understanding and helpful. Everyone here is kind of doing their own thing, but everyone is also very easy to talk to. The only reason I can't give this school the 5 stars is because, I have recently found out that they will no longer let any food trucks come into the campus because students get more food from the food trucks than the school pavilion. Unfortunately, this is because the school pavilion food is not so great.Students are constantly complaining about how unhealthy everything looks and tastes, and how they do not offer any menu on what exactly they are feeding us."
Freshman,4,"I like how the campus is fairly small, which means that classes are smaller and students can easily get the support they need from professors and TAs."
Junior,4,"UC Merced is a really nice campus that as of today continues to expand. It is really easy to build connections with your professors and the classes are not as big which is an advantage as well. There are many resources on campus if ever in need, you just have to reach out and show you're interested. A downside to this is that because the school is small, it lacks the fast service other schools might have. The classes when signing up for them get full right away and it is really stressful when you are looking to graduate on time. Apart from this, the diversity of the school is very broad and this makes it very easy to fit in and feel like at home."
Freshman,4,I like the diversity that UC Merced has because everyone is friends with everyone. There are also some fun events created for students and they are usually free. I also appreciate that there are buses that take students into town. I would like to see a wider selection of food because it gets old fast.
Freshman,4,The University of California-Merced is a great school for the many opportunities it provides for all upper and lower class-men. They offer all sorts of resources from research projects to tutoring for almost all categories of academics.
Junior,4,"This school is continuing to grow and slowly starting to expand. It can be difficult to sign up for classes with the number of students admitted, but more staff are coming in. Most professors are easily available outside of class as well as other tutoring opportunities."
Niche User,4,"There  was a high school student event there where we got to explore the campus. We were each assigned certain classes and in each class we were provided with different information. For examples there a STEM class where the guest speakers were all women. They were telling us there there aren't a lot of women in STEM. This actually inspired me because it made me realize that we need more women in engineering and science. Also, the school is absolutely beautiful and is currently in the process of expanding."
Sophomore,4,"UC Merced is a great place to learn and grow. Although the campus is not all too big and is a bit isolated from the city, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved and get plugged into school and town. It is also a more calm and relaxing campus, although you can always find ways to turn up. Tuition could result a little expensive without outside help like scholarships or loans, so it is good to be prepared."
Freshman,4,My experience has been quiet good so far as a freshmen. Somethings that I would like to see in a future is the quality of food. If there were better food choices it would improve the campus. So far academic wise classes has been great. Campus is pretty diverse and the new dorms are great.
Freshman,4,"I like the community aspect of this school. Despite its currently small size, its students and faculty are very welcoming towards one another. Maybe a little more options/expansion in education."
Freshman,4,There are more opportunities here as well as many tutoring opportunities. There are various clubs to help students engage. Living on campus is convenient. The food would be better as it needs to be imoroved especially if one has to live solely on the food given here as many students may not be able to afford meals off campus.
Niche User,4,The University is very nice. I like going to their library and studying. There is a great atmosphere and overall everyone just wants to learn.
Junior,4,Merced offers a small town feel along with the academics. This combination is unique as many colleges also come with a large variety of distractions.
Freshman,4,I love the agriculture surrounding the campus. Very beautiful and away from the city. Every staff member would always be more happy to help you with any concerns or questions you might have. The students here are amazing and easy to talk to.
Sophomore,4,"UCM is a beautiful and growing campua. The diversity is honestly amazing and everyone is super nice and helpful. There is no competitive vibe. However, the food and professors could be better."
Sophomore,2,Online is a new concept and need some getting used to. There was a lot of poor connections and some classes had to cancelled.
Alum,2,"If you want to grow and gain experience before working in the industry, this is the right place for you. You really have to apply yourself to this school in order to gain the full experience. Majority of students are cool, but some can be rude and in their own world thinking they will be successful while theyâ€™re failing fundamental classes for their major. Food on campus has been inconsistent, some years being good and some just terrible. Location is ok, students really have to go out of Merced to have fun in other cities. Overall, I took advantage of my time at this school but Iâ€™ve came to the conclusion that itâ€™s a living hell for new students incoming. Choose wisely."
Niche User,2,"I wish UC Merced have more specific majors instead of broad Biology with emphasis tracks. UC Merced is good for engineering and biology. A newest campus of UCs, small local community, diversity, small campus. To improve would be more different variety of food and places to go."
College Freshman,2,"I can only speak from finding a part-time job on campus, it's very bad and the website gives a difficult time when applying."
College Sophomore,2,Sports are not a huge part of this school. The best sports them UC Merced has to offer is soccer but even then its not something many students will go watch.
College Sophomore,2,We have no football team!
College Freshman,2,I feel like their isn't a lot of athletic involvement in this school mainly because we are left with very few options. There isn't even a pool. I feel like forming a football team would bring the school together.
College Freshman,2,Our varsity teams don't receive as much support from the student population despite their achievement.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is still a very small school so there are not a huge amount of varied facilities to use.
College Freshman,2,"Since Merced is a new school, there hasn't been enough funding for sports teams. We have the basic cross country, and soccer, and basketball teams, along with volleyball, but we don't have the typical football team. People attend the sporting events, but even then the gym for basketball games get full and many people do not get to enjoy the games. The soccer team has a grass field, but there are only to bleachers where students can sit to cheer them on. I think something that would definitely unite the school, and would create school spirit, would be the building of a football stadium, so that we can enjoy football games. during the fall when we typically enjoy foot ball we are not able to do so because our school has no football team, or football field. Also our school should really invest in a pool so that we can enjoy swim meets and water polo games. These are only some sports that our school could really benefit from."
College Freshman,2,I want to be a pharmacy intern but I have not had the chance to become one.
College Freshman,2,"UC Merced has one soccer field, and one gym. I have only ever heard of 4 sports played there and they are: Soccer, Volleyball, Basketball, and Cross-Country. I only ever seen some soccer games and that is only because it is on the way to the parking lot."
College Freshman,2,UC Merced is a very simple school. They need to work on helping students get the information that they need.
College Freshman,2,"I am not even a part of one...in fact, I don't even know what Greeks do."
College Freshman,2,We barely have any athletic fields...the teams are small and not well-known..
College Freshman,2,UC Merced had an incident with student safety and did not have adequate procedures. The university needs more safety regulations.
College Sophomore,2,Most of my professors expected too much from their students. Some instructors were not effective when teaching their topic in lecture. There is much diversity when it comes to courses. Class sizes were small and effective. Professor to student ratio was preferable.
College Freshman,2,No one really cares about the sports.
College Freshman,2,"Again, UC Merced is only a decade old, so its Greek life is not one of its main priorities. I would say Greek life at my school is weak in that we don't have a Greek row and there is not much advertisement of it."
College Sophomore,2,I don't really like it because I feel like I came to this school for the financial aid money. This school doesn't have 2 majors that are common in other schools and I'm interested in. for example communications and criminal justice.
College Sophomore,2,I feel pretty safe on campus. I don't think anyone is trying to hurt me but then again you don't know what goes on in peoples minds. For example the stabbing that happened in early november.
College Freshman,2,I think the food needs a big improvement. Please.
College Sophomore,2,"Health Department needs to be reported on parts of the DC, bugs have been found in the food."
College Junior,2,"the city isn't so great, but it's what you make of it. surrounding cities are awesome"
College Freshman,2,"The good part of merced is that there are countless of restaurants off-campus and are decently prices with good quality. However, there isn't that much shopping areas to go to besides Target, the ""mall"" is very small and barely has any stores. Generally the parks are average but a few of them are not properly taken care of. There are a few cultural events on campus that are hosted by clubs such as ""Barrio"" and ""Color Conference"" which are leading examples of different ethnicity's and performances, ranging from traditional and modern dances, however we need more of that off-campus."
College Freshman,2,"Well Im not the ""party-animal"" myself, however a few of my friends have gone to parties and say the parties at Merced are not up to their expectations."
College Freshman,2,"Beginning my undergraduate studies, I understand that we have to fulfill a certain amount of general requirements, however I feel like some of them have no, absolute, correlation with my designated career. My goal is to become a Nurse Practitioner. There's this class all Freshman-Sophomore students at UC Merced have to take called, Core, and it involves learning bout random literature, history, planets, etc.. and it has nothing to do with me becoming a Nurse Practitioner. I felt like the classes itself were difficult since most classes don't have homework and heavily rely on finals. I think it would be easier if we had teachers who had an organized plan for each class and actually had criteria that would be on the test."
College Sophomore,2,"The location of the university is in a middle of multiple farming fields and since Merced itself barely has any well known clubs, the focus for creating parties are nearly nonexistent at the university. The only interesting parties that do take place at the university are gaming parties, where pizza, drinks, and multiple gaming platforms are present, which occur at the near end of each fall and spring semester."
College Freshman,2,"I find that there are not enough dining choices here in Merced for college students. There are a few good dining places, but the rest is fast food and unhealthy. We nee more variety here."
College Freshman,2,"I have lived here in Merced my whole life. From the time I was a young teen, to present day, I find merced to be a boring place with no excitement for college life. There is no exciting night life activities for college students, that's why we turn to partying."
College Freshman,2,The campus dining options are very limited.
College Freshman,2,UCM is in middle of nowhere. This is not a party school.
College Senior,2,Third-party vendors are significantly better than campus food
College Sophomore,2,The school gave an alright bobcat grant. But seriously? I'm expected to take 16k in parent plus loan alone for one year.
College Senior,2,The dining hall is extremely small and the viable options are not the best.  There are many improvements that have to be done towards that area.
College Student,2,I honestly have been in a constant argument and fight with the school just to get some funding.
College Sophomore,2,"School is very far from the city. Most things to do are down town, school and the city are not very connected."
College Sophomore,2,"Small lot, the school is still expanding."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much diversity within the campus itself. UC Merced is predominantly Hispanic/Latino and Asian. Not much else
College Freshman,2,"The local atmosphere near UC Merced is very bland. I've lived in the area my entire life, so I am used to the lack of things to do, but I think many people get bored here. The UC tries their best to offer different activities both on and off campus for students to do. These things vary from multi-cultural events, to plays, art shows, concerts, and many others. I would say there are 2-3 campus activities a week that the campus provides for students. The most exciting things that the city of Merced has for UC students to do on their free time is go to one of the two movie theaters in town, shop at the mall, go to Yosemite Lake, and eat at any of the numerous restaurants and fast food places off campus."
College Freshman,2,The school bus can be late which is bad if you're going to Amtrak. Sometimes the bus doesn't show up at all to a stop
College Freshman,2,I wouldn't know because I don't party.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't very much known about what sport events are going on, they aren't a big part of campus life."
College Freshman,2,"While they get you where you need to be, timing of bus arrival is terrible, and it takes forever to get from point A to Point B."
College Freshman,2,No one really cares for the sports teams that we do have
College Junior,2,"Gets too hot, and it gets too cold."
College Freshman,2,"Its bad when I walk down the hallways where I live you can smell the weed and its kinda sad on how many people turn to it to have ""fun"""
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do here the town is kind of empty and the mall stinks if you do want to something Fresno is your best bet.
College Freshman,2,There not much here but a few house parties and even then they are not that great unless you like twerking theirs a lot of twerking.
College Freshman,2,"If you want to go out to eat over here theirs not really much unless you enjoy McDonalds and other Fast food restaurants, the best place is probably In and Out and its an hour on the bus."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people smoke weed and they're pretty stupid about it. For god's sake if you're going to hotbox a place don't make it your dorm, you bloody bloke! Other than that, a few people boast about drinking or using perscription drugs... I'm not very good with marijuana use, so I'm mostly not invited to the places where illegal stuff is taking place."
College Junior,2,There's not enough for the students. The school is still very small.
College Junior,2,Needs more options and it doesn't open early or stay open late enough.
College Junior,2,If you get there late you wont find a spot.
College Junior,2,Needs to be updated. Wifi and portal is not reliable. 
College Freshman,2,i did not like the financial aid for this school because for me it was a hassle 
College Freshman,2,"i honestly don't know what to say. 
there are people who part-take in the party life, but as far as i am aware, it is not too bad "
College Freshman,2,Everything here is pretty much dead. No one is around.
College Senior,2,"Merced is a really small town, and because UC Merced is still considered a new campus, there is not much to do off-campus. I usually spend time at a friend's house, so without students in this town, I would not be willing to live here."
College Senior,2,"There is almost nothing to do in Merced other than eat, so students partake in drugs and alcohol quite frequently. Getting access to drugs and alcohol isn't difficult because of the upperclassmen who are permitted to buy them, and even though there are rules that state that students can't drink on-campus, it doesn't stop them from being sneaky about it, let alone go off-campus to drink."
College Senior,1,"Ate there for 3 years, made me gain a lot of weight to be honest. The options are very unhealthy."
College Freshman,1,"there is nothing to do, and the city of Merced is extremely boring."
College Junior,1,Buses take forever to get you around. Car is necessary.
College Freshman,1,The night life here is practically nonexistent for sober students.
College Sophomore,1,Bus schedules can range from half an hour to an hour while waiting at a stop off campus. it is also hard to identify where buses will stop and where the closest one in the other direction is. 
College Senior,1,Easy to go see the doc. But they usually diagnose incorrectly. The shrinks are excellent and extremely helpful.
College Senior,1,Permits are outrageously expensive and there is very few available spaces for students. Staff will buy student permits because they are cheaper and take up the student spaces. And students cannot take ant staff spaces. Its ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,There really is no stable Greek like her in UC Merced yet although they do put on a good show her and there most frats and sorority's are to themselves and still very small to make much of an impact on the campus.
College Senior,1,The permit costs are expensive. There's very little parking for students. The distance from the classrooms and the parking lot is about a 15-20 minute walk away.
College Junior,1,"There are a few off-campus house parties but they get shut down pretty quickly, and the night life in town is absolutely zero."
College Junior,1,"There's one dining hall, and though they try to provide options, everything is ridiculously expensive and most of it's unhealthy.  There's a marketplace and a cafe available but they're also expensive and they're not included in the meal plan.  Plus, there's never anywhere to sit in the cafe."
College Junior,1,"Not very many places to eat at, and restaurants are all a good 20 or 30 minute drive away from the school so they're pretty inaccessible.  The quality is decent but nothing outstanding, but there are several new places popping up."
College Senior,1,"There is hardly anything to do at night in town.  Other than a couple bars, that is all for the nightlife."
College Junior,1,"booooo! we university students deserve better than cramped up parking spaces that are far from our classes. It takes an average time of 10 minutes to park and 5 if you're not picky. then it takes another 10 minutes to walk up the hill at a normal person pace, but then again you can sprint up the hill in 3 minutes. total time wasted in life 8-20 minutes. if we're lucky we catch a ride on the shuttle bus and cut the time by 5 minutes or more."
College Senior,1,"The night life at UC Merced is very poor. There are a few bars and I believe one recently opened club. The bars in UC Merced are mainly populated by locals and are not ""college bars."" The distance from the University to these places are fairly far and the school bus stop running early, around 12 am, so if you don't have a car you may find yourself ending your night sooner than expected."
College Freshman,1,"Not much to do for the college kids. You'd really have to go to nearby cities such as Fresno, Modesto, or even SF"
College Freshman,1,I only received somewhat financial aid and now it hard for my parents to pay the leftover of the tuition. My parents actually regret sending me to UC Merced. I feel I should have a free ride according to my circumstances.
College Freshman,1,I only received loans and unfortunately UC Merced did not take into account how much debt my parents are still trying to pay off so it was really hard for them to send me here.
College Freshman,1,"There isn't much of a night life here in Merced, if your'e looking for wild parties, this is not the best place to go, though there are some frat parties they are few and far between, mostly the 'night life' are events put on by the clubs on campus, they're fun but not what I would call a 'party'."
College Junior,1,"Parking is always difficult to find and it is very limited.  The parking permit is also very expensive.  Sometimes, students would spend about 10 minutes just looking for an empty spot."

Sophomore,5,"Middlebury College is an amazing academic institution with a lively student population, devoted professors, and a beautiful campus."
Alum,5,"Middlebury is an excellent academic institution that fosters a community of kind, hardworking students. I had an opportunity to take a wide range of interesting classes that pushed me to think in different ways."
Freshman,5,Everyone here is so nice and friendly. Everyone is welcoming and makes you feel at home. The professors go out of their way to make sure you succeed and take pride in their work. Social life is really fun and there's always something to do.
Freshman,5,"Although I am only a freshman, I have loved my first semester at Middlebury College. I have grown so much within one semester, and cannot wait to see what is in the future in the spring term. I am an athlete here and love the facilities the college has. The professors are truly amazing, and make deep connections with each of their students. This campus isn't a place where it's super competitive, rather everyone building each other up so that we can all be successful."
Senior,5,"I would relive these four years over again in a heartbeat! Incredible professors, fascinating student body, and unprecedented resources and opportunities. The location couldn't be more picturesque."
Sophomore,5,"My classmates are brilliant and humble. My professors work as hard as their students, which brings a beautiful sense of respect and intentionality to the classroom—the professors that have tenure re-earn it every day.  Middlebury is a small community of dedicated, smart, kind people living in one of the most beautiful places on Earth. That kindness is what makes this place feel so special to me. In a way that contrasts with the competitive, business-minded rush of so many schools, I think here we are being taught to make choices that benefit the world, and not just ourselves."
Senior,5,"Middlebury can truly be whatever you make of it. There are countless clubs, activities, lectures, screenings, and events to take advantage of all over campus, and students' experience is heavily dictated by how active they are in seeking these experiences. It can be easy to fall into a trap of only going to classes and partying on the weekends because of the intense workload, but meeting with professors during office hours and strategically picking classes should help you with this. Middlebury is a wonderful place with a heavy emphasis on globalism and an extremely high quality of life. There is nothing like being able to finish class and go on a run around town or go skiing within 30 minutes of campus."
Sophomore,5,"Attending Middlebury College, which attracts students from all over the world, has allowed me to interact with students and professors of numerous nationalities and ethnicities. I have met students that represent six continents.  The opportunity to connect with students from around the globe has fostered my understanding of different cultural viewpoints and encouraged my curiosity in learning about unique perspectives through respectful discourse.  However, I would love to see more socioeconomic diversity represented at Middlebury; many students come from wealthy backgrounds, so the student body does not represent true economic diversity."
Junior,5,"Middlebury can get cold, but that's the only negative I've experienced so far. Midd has provided with me with everything I could have wanted from a LAC. Phenomenal academics, great student life, etc. The student body is slightly homogenous, but if you make an effort to make friends of all sorts, it can be easily done. Students take advantage of extracurriculars and the sport facilities, and a trip to Burlington isn't far away. Apply to Midd! I've had a great time there."
Freshman,5,It's an incredible place with incredible people. The academics are the most rigorous a college can offer and the campus is beautiful. The athletics are a huge plus too with an athletic center unlike any other! Apply to Middlebury. It's a place like no other.
Freshman,5,"Middlebury is a great school with outstanding professors. If you are looking for a challenging academic environment with ample outdoor opportunities, Middlebury is the place for you. The people are amazing, the classes are small, the professor truly care about the students, and the area around the college could not be more ideal."
Freshman,5,Small community leading to closer connections between students & faculty members; excellent natural environment helps with relaxing! Overall great place for spending four years.
Freshman,5,"Middlebury is an incredibly diverse and open minded campus. The campus provides students with opportunities throughout the community of Middlebury and the camous itself. The teachers offer plenty of office hours to accommodate their students, and they create very personal relationships with students dedicated to their specific field of study. The campus itself is incredibly gorgeous  and the perfect environment for collective growth among students."
Alum,5,"In my current role, I travel to college campuses around the country to recruit and interview students for positions at my company. I see lots of different schools and interact with dozens of student populations. Each campus has a different vibe and feel, and conversations in campus coffee shops range from purely academic to purely social. I loved Middlebury for the blend of high caliber academics, a hardworking student body, and a focus on active, healthy lifestyles. Students at Middlebury balance work and play, and a weekend was never without hours in the library or miles of hiking, running or biking. The teachers have high expectations for your work, but they understand there's more to get out of college than acing every exam. As I tour college campuses today, I look for candidates who strike that same balance, who take their work seriously, but they don't take themselves too seriously. That's what Middlebury is about."
Niche User,5,I spent the weekend at Middlebury with the swim team and absolutely loved it. The coaches and teammates were so welcoming and I loved the two classes I sat in on.
Niche User,5,At Middlebury it felt like home and I felt accepted to learn despite of my being away from Los Angeles.
Sophomore,5,"I would not change anything about my experience at Midd. Every professor I had exuded enthusiasm for their subject that inspired us students to fully apply ourselves. The student body is welcoming while brilliant in areas such as music, academics, and athletics. The campus is beautiful, and the overall area is one that I can truly call a home away from home. The only drawbacks I can think of are the high costs (which exists at any elite institution) and the fact that students and teachers sometimes unintentionally impose left-leaning ideas onto students, although an active effort is being made to eliminate that."
Freshman,5,"I personally think that Middlebury is a great college, academically and socially. Though Middlebury may have a bad rep for being so isolated from large cities and towns, the many different activities on campus make up for the lack of city life. Academics here are excellent, with great professors who are more than willing to spend their time with you to make sure you are doing the best you can."
Junior,5,"Middlebury College is a wonderful campus with many student clubs, and many international students which is really amazing. The campus is small which is nice to know it very quickly. Plus the scenery is simply amazing: surrounded by mountains. The classes are all pretty small which is nice to participate, and the professors are always available if students have questions."
Senior,5,"It's hard to articulately describe my experience at Middlebury. I've grown intellectually, met fantastic friends, and am so thankful for the opportunity to be a part of such a great community. I'm often in awe of my peers – there are so many passionate and engaged individuals at this school. As a gay midwesterner, I was unsure of how I'd adapt to Middlebury's culture, but I couldn't be happier. The academics are rigorous, but I've found them to be rewarding."
Freshman,5,"The community atmosphere is the foundation of what makes this school incredible. Everyone is so friendly, and helpful, and smart, that it inspires you to be more that way. Academically the school is challenging enough that you feel pushed, and sometimes overly so, but that is how you progress. The food is phenomenal, and no swipe system means that you get it whenever you want. It is one of the safest school campuses, with very low rates of disturbances, and while the party scene is small, that is what people come to Midd for, the small close-knit feel. I trust everyone here enough to leave my backpack in the dining hall at breakfast, and come back at dinner to retrieve it, which translates to fruitful and interesting acquaintance making all the time, especially at the frequent events hosted by the college. Go here, its nearly impossible to regret it."
Sophomore,5,"The academics here are superb, and the professors are probably my favorite part about Middlebury. They are all engaging, knowledgeable, and more than willing to discuss content outside of class. Truly, I talk to a professor after class virtually every day--they create a wonderful intellectual environment and they're some of my best friends.  Campus food is excellent, though it sometimes can be difficult if you have a food allergy as I do, depending on the meal. Dorms do the job, I don't really care about housing that much and got a single when I wanted one, so it's fine by me. The facilities are ridiculously nice, every building I've entered has impressed me. "
College Junior,5,"Cannot imagine a better place for hardworking, creative students who revel in their individuality."
College Sophomore,5,"Totally depends on what you're looking for. I'm a member of the ultimate frisbee team, which is known for wild parties, but I'm sure they're not the Bacchanalian ragers you'd probably find at some state schools. If you're looking for that, you probably won't find it at Midd. But we certainly like to have a good time on the weekends, and you'll find parties Thursday, Friday, and Saturday (and sometimes Wednesday if you're on the frisbee team). We don't have frats, so most of the parties are through the sports teams. Personally, the intensity and frequency of Midd parties are pretty much perfect for me."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are exceptional, the course variety is superb, and registration is simple. The workload is no greater than I'd expect it to be at an elite college, but I certainly did more work in high school. Teachers are accomodating in that regard. Truly though, I'm not an effusive person, but the academics at Middlebury--at least what I've experienced in the humanities--are just a delight and tremendously enriching, particularly if you are partial to a more intimate learning experience."
College Sophomore,5,"Middlebury is always one of the top schools in every sport in New England DIII. Our athletic facilities are truly fantastic, perhaps some of the best in all of DIII--we just had a massive field house built. Plus they're open to all students."
College Sophomore,5,"Middlebury is on the highest tier of renown for US colleges. Though it may not have the breadth of name recognition as some Ivy league universities, employers in the fields in which a Middlebury education excels are sure to hold it in high regard."
College Sophomore,5,"All of my encounters with professors have been wonderful--I love talking to them after class and they are more than willing to help on papers and assignments or just explore the nuances of what's been discussed in class. Regarding course variety, I've been enthused about virtually every class I've taken thus far. If you are a curious person, you will seldom find yourself in a boring or uninteresting course."
College Sophomore,5,"Incredible facilities and some top tier Division III athletics. Students really support, especially come playoff time."
College Sophomore,5,"Challenging, but the resources are there to achieve success."
College Freshman,5,I think everyone's extremely safe and haven't heard of any violence occurring during my time here.
College Freshman,5,"Freshman housing is set up very well, particularly with how they try to get students introduced to one another. Freshmen  are assigned to a first-year seminar, which they take with other freshmen who they live in the same building with. My first year seminar was very beneficial to introducing me to other people within my dorm, and my whole class got very close. I met four of my closest friends in it. I also loved the class and my professor was fantastic.       

Every commons has a CRA, and every hallway has an FYC. My CRA, who graduated the year before I enrolled, and my FYC, a junior, were both unbelievably helpful and nice, and loved to hang out with all of their students. I really love those guys and they greatly improved my college experience. Now that I've finished my freshman year and no longer will be in the same building as them, I still plan on being friends and hanging out with them.

My room was spacious, and my roommate was great. The best part of my dorm (Allen) was the common room, which was where I met and got to know almost every person in the dorm."
College Freshman,5,"I really love Middlebury. I didn't really know what to expect, but the overwhelming majority of people here are kind, extremely intelligent, and very interesting. There was a great community amongst the freshman in my dorm."
College Senior,5,"The commons spaces work really well when you are a first year and sophomore, but this becomes a little dry once you are an upperclassmen. However the options for housing gets better as you get older"
College Senior,5,Middlebury has state of the art sports facilities!
College Freshman,5,"I've never felt unsafe on campus. And I can leave my laptop, bag, and phone anywhere on campus for hours and feel comfortable knowing that it'll all be there when I return."
College Freshman,5,Good employers have heard of Middlebury College and know that it's a prestigious institution.
College Freshman,5,"Professors here are extremely helpful. They are truly here to teach above anything else. They go out of their way to not only make sure that you understand, but also to make sure that you're comfortable and happy. Classes are extremely interesting due to the material but also due to the professors teaching them. There are so many different class options and class sizes are small and perfect."
College Freshman,5,Almost everyone lives on campus. It's the best. The commons system fosters such an amazing sense of community. The parties are all open no matter where they are. It really feels like a community.
College Freshman,5,It's the best because we don't have it. Greek life is not what the people here want.
College Freshman,5,"There is such an incredible sense of community at this school. People really are made to feel like they belong. Professors truly are teachers and they spend as much extra time helping students as is needed. And every school days they foster close relationships between students and their professors, but I think Middlebury truly does this to the fullest. Professors eventually become friends, and they often go out of their way to not just be helpful but also to be kind and compassionate. The workload is hard but that's what you get when you go to an incredible school. I am so happy here, even though it is far from easy."
College Sophomore,5,"Professors here are great, I have had very few professors that I did not like. Most are extremely engaging and very invested in their students' learning. Registration can be stressful, especially freshman year, but it typically works itself out during the add/drop period. Workload at times can be overwhelming, but not more than to be expected from any top college. Lots of great study spaces around campus with a variety of atmospheres."
College Sophomore,5,"Overall I have had a great experience at Middlebury. I typically enjoy all of my classes and find that sometimes the most fascinating classes are the ones I picked randomly to try something new. I think the social scene, all though can be some what repetitive, is a lot of fun. You see a lot of familiar faces when you go out as you spend more time here, which is definitely nice. Being a part of a sports team also contributes a lot to my experience but I think people have just as great experiences who are not on sports teams. Everyone seems to find their group, whether it be a team or extracurricular on campus."
College Freshman,5,"The faculty is superb--all are engaging, insightful, and experts in their fields. They are approachable, wonderful to discuss with during office hours, and an overall delight under which to study. The students here are all ""intelligent,"" but I wish that there were fewer varsity athletes, and more people who are genuinely intellectually curious, though that may just be because I am in a suite with four varsity athletes. Regardless, there are too many econ majors here, and I would say too many science as well. I was expecting more humanities majors here, but the students who are in the humanities I've found to be curious and intellectual. I appreciate the distribution requirements though, as they force an intellectual broadening that may not have taken place otherwise. The food is excellent on the whole, and the dining program is literally unbeatable--you walk in and you get food. The courses are varied and intriguing, and other than perhaps your first year, you pretty much get every class you want. It's harder to get intro courses though. The facilities are honestly unbelievable to me, as is the campus. The chapel, the mountains, the cemetery make the campus seem straight out of a fairytale. I don't know if there exists a scientific explanation for this, but I swear the skies/sunsets here are better than I've ever seen in my life, on par with traditional tourist locations. The library is by all accounts fantastic, and there are two 18-century-esque study rooms that make spending an evening studying almost a pleasure. The student organizations here are above average, and I would say almost everyone is involved in at least one. Parties are largely dominated by sports teams, but once they get underway, no one really notices who comes in and out. There is not a lot of pressure to drink, but I'd say it would be difficult to enjoy the acme of a party otherwise. The dorms are fine, I have no complaints. Biggest complaint is the number of athletes, but everything else is A+."
College Junior,5,Middlebury College is the place to have the best experiences as well as the best education possible. The liberal arts education provides an optimal outlook in my chemistry education.
College Junior,5,"I could not ask for a better experience at Middlebury, it is truly my favorite place in the world"
College Sophomore,5,I could not have asked for a better year at Middlebury.
College Sophomore,5,It's really quite delicious. Good ingredients. need better sourced meat
College Sophomore,5,"For a college I don't think you can get any better than Midd. The food is great and there are so many on-campus options! Midd is also very conscious about buying from local vendors. If you are health conscious or have a food allergy you have nothing to worry about! Just beware of Proctor lady! Atwater undeniably has the delicious food if you're willing to wait in line for it. There's also two cafes, a grille, and a sushi bar on campus. Oh and the ice cream is local too!"
College Sophomore,5,"Middlebury is a difficult but supportive academic environment. Students are driven but not overly competitive with each other. There are work environments on campus for every type of person - from quiet spaces no one will talk to open spaces where you're likely to run into a whole host of friends in a the course of a few minutes. Campus is designed for people to be focused on learning but also to be social. Professors are usually available for individual meetings and happy to help those who ask. The workload can be overwhelming at times, but with some hard focus and coffee from the dining hall it all gets done."
College Sophomore,5,"Overall, housing is pretty great at Middlebury. Freshman year you have no say over where you live, and the range in quality of freshman dorms is by far the largest. That being said, if you live in Battell, which is typically described as being the worst dorm, the atmosphere is unique and bonding. I haven't met anyone who has regretted being placed in Battell. Housing just gets better as the years progress, with upperclassman housing being both spacious and just great all-around. The housing process can be stressful though, and if you get a bad number you better hope one of your friends did better."
College Sophomore,5,"Middlebury is a need-blind Institution, and they meet 100% of demonstrated financial aid if you're accepted. You can always find people who complain that they need more aid than calculated, but it would be calculated similarly at any other school, and at other schools they may not meet the full need."
College Sophomore,5,"Declaring a major is as simple as filling out some paperwork and asking a professor to be your advisor.  I have never in my time at Middlebury heard of a student being rejected from a certain major. The only issue I can imagine may arise when trying to change majors, in the case that a student would not have/be able to obtain enough credits in order to graduate on time."
College Sophomore,5,"Being a D3 school, it's acknowledged that athletics aren't everything. That being said, with such a large percentage of students playing varsity sports, they are a part of life here, and can be taken rather seriously. Students support Middlebury, especially against other NESCAC teams. Sporting events are fairly well attended, depending on the sport. The athletic facilities are fairly nice and open to everyone, and will shortly be even better with the new field house set to open soon. IM sports are a big draw, soccer and basketball in particular. The majority of campus partakes in some kind of sport, whether it be IM or varsity."
College Sophomore,5,"Middlebury is safe, it's as simple as that. We're isolated from major cities, and a small enough community that no one has any qualms or fears that possessions will be stolen. There will probably be a few incidents each year stemming from alcohol, but even then nothing too serious."
College Sophomore,5,"No campus crime. I am never afraid to walk alone ever, anywhere."
College Sophomore,5,It's Vermont and everything is grown local.
College Sophomore,5,"There's a lot of majors, a lot of qualified professors, professors always teach their subject, not TAs or something. most professors prefer being on first name basis with students, everyone's very intent on helping  the students be the best that they can be."
College Sophomore,5,"Everything is in great condition, up to date, and 'nice'.  Middlebury had the best facilities of any college I toured."
College Freshman,5,"I love the academics here - they were one of my main reasons for choosing Midd.  Professors are deeply interested in both the students, and their subjects.  Classroom environments are small, friendly, and really foster intellectual growth.  There are TAs, but never in the classroom.  Rather, TA's tend to grade papers (with the professor's guidance) and run tutoring sessions outside of class time, which are really useful.  Professors themselves are busy, and do have their own lives outside of school, so they're not on call 100% of the time (not that they could be expected to be), but, if you're responsible and don't set yourself up for a situation where you need an answer immediately, they're very helpful."
Sophomore,4,"Although the online experience holds nothing on the amazing in-person experience of being on campus, the school and the professors were accommodating and made the best of a bad situation."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at MIddlebury College and I am loving my experience there. I am a first gen student from a low-income family, and I will say that although the academics and academic supports are great on campus, there need to be more inclusion and diversity. There is sometimes a great sense of elitism on campus and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I think Middlebury College can do a better job at addressing this issue and  put more efforts into integrating the campus."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have had a great experience at Middlebury. The academics are definitely the highlight. The professors are some of the most amazing people I have ever met, genuinely love the school, and work hard to help students succeed. Most of Midd's housing is stellar (aside from first-year housing, which they are redoing). The food, though repetitive, is also very high quality and features lots of local ingredients. The only downside I've encountered is the isolated location. Some people love it and others hate it, but it definitely makes Middlebury unique. This should definitely be a consideration, especially if you are a city person considering attending Midd."
Junior,4,"My overall experience with Middlebury College is a positive one. Although Middlebury has pushed me in ways unimaginable through academics and socially on campus I have learned through each obstacle and hardship I have gone through. I have learned valuable knowledge about who I am as a both a person and a student. I come from New York City, so moving to move Vermont has been a huge culture shock but Middlebury’s community has made it bearable. Middlebury is a place that makes you self-aware and pushes you out of your comfort zone! I’m excited to see where my future will go from here!"
Sophomore,4,"I do not regret attending this college. Although it was not my first choice school, I have found my second home here."
Senior,4,"Middlebury College is a top-tier liberal arts college on the East Coast. The grounds are beautiful, tucked in the mountains and surrounded by nature that is protected and preserved by the college. Bonus points for outdoor courses, tailored for students who are interested in environmental studies. The libraries (yes - plural!) are stocked to the roof with any resource a bookish student could hope for, and they have access to a global network of catalogs for the rare occasion you're looking for an obscure journal. 

Middlebury is working on making improvements when it comes to diversity and inclusion, which is great because progress needs to be made. If you're looking for an internship or summer job, you better work hard to find one - it's not going to fall in your lap just because you're a ""Midd kid."" But overall, it's a great school for anyone who is willing to work hard (and study harder)."
Alum,4,"Middlebury College is an incredible institution when it comes to academic rigor, student community, and physical setting. Nestled between two mountain ranges, the access to the outdoors is unparalleled. Classes are small, and it is possible to have intimate relationships with professors if you pursue them. The student community is somewhat divided by involvement in athletics, but is overall warm and tight knit."
Junior,4,Amazing classes and professors that really foster a healthy learning environment. Beautiful fall. Great athletic programs.
Sophomore,4,"Not too much cultural or racial diversity, but the school does try with international students. Overall, felt welcome even as a person of color."
Freshman,4,"I love all of my classes, very challenging but overall all always learn something relevant and interesting  all the time. Will say the campus can be intimidating and sometimes infuriating for POC's."
Alum,4,"Excellent interdisciplinary education. Professors very available for extra help with students and willing to get to know students personally. A lot of homework, but generally chill student life. Beautiful campus and excellent location for those who enjoy rural towns and outdoor activity. Diversity reflective of its location in Vermont."
Sophomore,4,"Middlebury is set in a truly incredible location between the Green Mountains and the Adirondacks, providing stunning views from an idyllic campus setting. The small classes and attention from professors offer students the opportunity to engage with research, arts, and intellectual passions from an early time in college. Middlebury professors love teaching, are passionate about and invested in the growth of their students, and provide a supportive yet challenging academic environment."
Sophomore,4,"I love Middlebury, there are so many things to get involved in and so many passionate students and professors."
Sophomore,4,Middlebury is a great school with a lot of really interesting professors and staff. I definitely feel like I've grown a lot as a person since coming here. I would warn that coming in as a Feb makes things very hard because mid year integration is difficult.
Junior,4,"Middlebury is a good school. Classes are great and you can learn so much here. It's nice too because the learning doesn't just happen in the classroom. I learn every day from participating in non-academic groups and also just from talking with my friends. The social life is okay, the party scene fluctuates by semester but is never amazing. The school caters to a very white and very wealthy identity."
Niche User,4,its a really good neighborhood. peaceful and quiet. all the teachers get along with students. there is alot of activity and the campus is really pretty
Alum,4,"Middlebury College is beautiful and academically rigorous and has the potential to provide you with four years of great education, great friends, and great opportunities. However, it is very white, very wealthy, very normative, very straight and does not do a good job of supporting all of its students. I happened to be one of the privileged students who Middlebury caters to, and had an incredible time but I am very aware of the college's flaws."
College Junior,4,"Student involvement is high, team performance is generally very good (multiple national championships were won last year), and athletic facilities are great."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't feel very qualified to speak generally, but I haven't had a problem with the housing process. Good roommate selection, fine dorm room. You'll probably get a single if you want one after freshman year."
College Sophomore,4,There's not much going on downtown--it being rural Vermont--but Midd Rides provides good transportation and the on-campus parties are a great time.
College Sophomore,4,"I have never ever felt unsafe on campus, though I'm speaking as a male. I know there was one theft on campus this year, but I think that was just an aberration. People leave their backpacks with their laptops in them wherever--it's Vermont, so."
College Sophomore,4,"Speaking personally, Middlebury has seemed quite diverse to me. My closest friends here represent Montana, Massachusetts, Texas, Maine, and France. Those five individuals vary (signficantly) in sexual orientation, political ideology, race, economic background, and nationality. So I think it's at least fair to say that you won't have to go out of your way to find someone who is different from you, which is mind-opening."
College Sophomore,4,"People party on Fridays and Saturdays, with the occasional weekday party. I would say a slight majority of people on campus drink, though their individual frequencies vary--some may have a beer or two with some friends in a dorm, and some may frequent large parties 3 days a week. I've never felt any great deal of pressure to drink, and there are not an insignificant number of students who'd rather get ahead on homework or stay in reading on a Saturday night (including myself on occasion). Teetotaler or tippler, you will likely find your scene at Middlebury."
College Freshman,4,"The athletic facilities are the best in all of Division III. The field house makes many Division I facilities look bad. Also, the facilities are open to anyone, not just athletes. 

Most students care about the success of our athletic teams, but it's definitely not like a DI school. Our athletic teams have a lot of success, and people are proud of them, but there isn't crazy school spirit.

As a varsity athlete, there's a very good balance between athletics and academics--I don't spend every waking hour in-season focusing on my sport. So, my grades really don't fluctuate in-season vs. out-of-season. Also, playing a sport doesn't feel like a job, and is still very fun. You'll find that quite a few athletes at Midd chose here over Division I schools because they wanted a more relaxed, academically-based college experience, which is the best thing that the athletics program offers. However, that's not to say that playing a sport here doesn't take a lot of work.    

Also, intramural sports have good participation, are fun, and are easy to get involved with."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The classes are small, there's a large diversity for a small school like Middlebury, and teaching really is why professors come here. They're magnificent. Unfortunately, most get caught up in the school culture of assigning insane workloads."
College Senior,4,"Middlebury is ahead of the curve in terms of supporting students through vulnerable experiences on campus. However, Middlebury is still working on how to best support students from diverse backgrounds (racial, ethnic, nationality, gender, socioeconomic, and those with intersecting identities from these aforementioned groups)."
College Senior,4,"Middlebury has its issues that it needs to work out, but it is wiling to move in the right direction, which this is a lot to say compared to other schools I have heard of. I would choose to come back if I could do it all over again!"
College Freshman,4,"The professors and curriculum are all amazing. Some students struggle with the workload for sure, but it's kind of expected at such a prestigious and academic school."
College Freshman,4,"Athletics are important and almost everyone is involved in some sport, but they don't dominate life here. Everyone here knows that we are here to get an education and that that's what comes first."
College Sophomore,4,"Nightlife is pretty much all on campus with the exception of a couple bars in town for the above 21 crowd. Parties on campus are pretty much hosted mostly by the male sports teams, but really anyone can get into them."
College Sophomore,4,"Many students are involved with athletics on some level whether it be varsity, jv, or club sports. All the varsity teams are usually pretty good at a minimum, and many of the team complete of the national level. Teams get a good amount of support from fans, given it is a division 3 school. The athletic facilities are awesome."
College Freshman,4,"As a part of a sports team, I can say that I have an incredibly strong support network at this school.  I feel very comfortable in everything I do and can get an inside scoop about anything.  The party scene is very fun and the students are all incredibly interesting."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not interested in sports but most people here are pretty athletic, and Midd really pours a lot of money (more than they should in my opinion) into sporting and facilities."
College Freshman,4,"It's great in that unless you are literally caught with alcohol or a joint in your hand, you're not going to get in trouble. And if you somehow manage to have that happen to you, worst case scenario is a citation and a meeting with your CRA or Dean, which are embarrassing but nothing too terrible. They're more concerned with making sure you're safe; otherwise they generally don't interfere too much.

This school has some pretty strict policies about protests on the books, but generally you can pass anything off as ""Art"" and get away with it. Although there have been some pretty strict crackdowns on activists in the past.

If you're blasting music at 1Am on a Tuesday chances are someone going to call in a noise complaint on you, which is annoying but honestly warranted. Don't be obnoxious and you'll have a pretty chill time. And if you protest, make sure you'll have plenty of wiggle room if things go down."
College Freshman,4,"It went pretty smoothly. Midd doesn't do anything but need based scholarships so that's something to keep in mind. I had some issues with filling out a non-custodial parent form, but other than that things went fairly well. Although considering my mom does my financial aid and not me, I may be oversimplifying the process."
College Freshman,4,"Although I was getting sick of it by the end, for college dining it's pretty good. Especially as a vegetarian, it's nice to be able to eat the majority of the food served, and always have the option for a salad if I'm not in the mood for other foods. Plus it's free. Atwater for lunch is the best, and if you can sneak into the dinners (just pretend you're in whatever club they're hosting it for, you'll rarely get caught) it's really good.

My complaints would be that they don't have a great variety of fruits, dining halls close way too early, and that they literally do not season the food. I mean I know my college is a PWI but is a bit of pepper too much to ask for?"
College Sophomore,4,Middlebury is a prestigious institution with a great alumni network.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful! The landscaping and custodial crew really do an amazing job at putting the campus back together after mud season. BiHall has the second largest window in vermont! It doesn't matter how cold it is, you will want to be outdoors here."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic facilities on campus are amazing! They just opened a new field house this past fall (2014). If you're not a varsity athlete you are doing something athletic - club, intramural, hiking, skiing, staying fit. It can be a bit intimidating. The huge presence of athletes on campus does create exclusivity. Overall, it is extremely easy to stay active here."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of living options at Middlebury: from spacious singles to off-campus houses. From personal experience, the administration is very accomodating if you need to change rooms or need to be on a certain floor. Middlebury's housing shapes the social life. Sports teams typically take a large suite in Atwater and host parties. If you are part of a social house you can live there. And of course there is a plethora of special interest housing. I've gone to the weybridge ""local food and environmental studies"" house just for some good farm-to-table food."
College Sophomore,4,"Space is limited, but that's true of most dorms. Bathrooms are always clean and all-gender. Most dorms have kitchen spaces available. There are also laundry facilities in most dorms. The lottery process is really easy and everyone who needs on-campus housing gets it."
College Sophomore,4,"Though off-campus housing is limited, there are enough options that many people do it. Housing is generally very affordable and with good budgeting is less expensive than on-campus housing plus meal plan. The main downside to living off campus is being a little farther away, and walking up the hill in winter gets tiresome fast."
College Sophomore,4,"The classes are challenging and the professors are amazing. They care about individuals and want to help us become successful in our field by learning and getting research jobs/internships. However, Middlebury's one class = one credit system makes it difficult to be a science major with a lot of labs compared to non-science majors."
College Sophomore,4,"No administration is perfect. Regardless, academic honesty and the Honor Code are taken seriously, and breaches punished accordingly. In terms of alcohol and parties they're what you'd expect from a college administration. If you're caught with alcohol as a minor you'll get a citation, or throwing a ridiculously loud party you could get shut down. Nothing too serious, but repeated violations do add up."
College Sophomore,4,"While you are, I suppose, in a certain club once you join your major, it isn't anything too groundbreaking. Depending on what it is, you could have access to certain spaces or materials, and professors will be even friendlier. Since it isn't a competitive process, most materials and benefits that you have being a specific major are also accessible by non-majors."
College Sophomore,4,"Middlebury has a nice assortment of restaurants in town, all of which are within walking distance (if you're able to drive, there are several more upscale options). There's variety in terms of style, and the food tends to range from pretty good to excellent."
College Sophomore,4,"There's always several options weekend nights, and parties here are fairly inclusive."
College Sophomore,4,"While students typically complain that Middlebury is in the middle of nowhere (which it is), they don't give the town the credit it deserves. Yes, it's out of the way. But there's access to shops, good food, and ways to amuse oneself. It's nothing compared to a large city, but you know that going in, and it makes the best of what it has."
College Freshman,4,"Student life is overall pretty good. While some facilities are older, most are well-maintained. Lots of green spaces and study spaces. Some campus events and activities."
College Freshman,4,"Freshmen and sophomore housing is in the oldest dorms on campus. These buildings are not very clean and wireless internet access is not great. Junior and senior suites and social houses are located in newly refurbished, high quality dorm buildings and social houses."
College Freshman,4,"The administration is moderately lenient, although a lot of the lack of strictness with alcohol and drugs is a result of lenient Vermont state policies on the substances. The public safety officers frequently hand out citations and parking tickets, but they rarely report anything to the local police."
College Freshman,4,"Lots of safety and security measures in place to prevent crimes like robbery or sexual assault. I have never seen or heard of anyone being robbed or sexually assaulted, and a huge deal is made of any minor crimes. Middlebury is largely a safe campus."
College Freshman,4,"Middlebury has a large percentage of students involved in the athletic program. For many sports, it is easy to walk on to the varsity team, while others require extended prior contact with the coach. Teams perform moderately well on average. There is good fan support, although most athletic events do not attract huge crowds. The gyms and fitness centers are open to all students and are, for the most part, available and not too crowded. The fitness center opens at 9a and closes at 10p during the week, so it is not really possible to go to the gym before class."
College Sophomore,4,"We have social houses, not fraternities and sororities."
College Sophomore,4,"Public Safety does a great job with protecting the students on campus. However, they have a history of targeting minorities and basically everyone who doesn't coincide with the typical appearance of a Middlebury student: white, rich, cis-gendered, straight, male (sometimes females). So I suppose I would say it's great for the normal Middlebury student, and not so great for the 'abnormal' Middlebury student."
College Sophomore,4,"There are things that are not so great - such as RAs, limited space (when compared to schools like HPU - but really, a college dorm is a college dorm), and the fact that Ross was literally designed to be riotproof by a prison architect.  But overall, housing at Midd is pretty great"
Recent Alumnus,4,Midd is very open-minded and helps celebrate different cultures and beliefs.
Recent Alumnus,4,"It may be in the middle of nowhere, but you can always find some great parties."
College Freshman,4,"Most people are involved in sports, whether intramural, club, pseudo-varsity (rugby and crew are essentially varsity teams with marginally less funding and no laundry benefits), or varsity.  Games are attended, but very few by more than a handful of supporters."
College Freshman,4,"There is at least one thing going on at Midd per night, 3 nights a week, for almost every week of the semester.  Depending on the time in the semester, there might be 4/5 different parties going on per night, in which case there will be something that appeals to most people, or there might be 1/none, where a lot of people will choose to just extend their pregames.  The parties at Midd are very repetitive - a Palmer party is a Palmer party is a Palmer party - same thing every time.  Bad parties are a rarity, but, the scene can get boring after a while.  There are definitely nights where people enjoy their pregames more than they think they'd enjoy a party, and you end up with 30-40 people drinking and hanging out in a dorm room.  All of this being said, going out can be a blast.  Social houses here know how to throw down, and the Atwater Suites and the Mods go absolutely wild."
Recent Alumnus,2,"High international diversity, which is also aided in senior year by the high number of students who return from studying abroad. Shockingly low socioeconomic diversity. Get used to seeing those BMWs and Audi SUVs around town..."
Recent Alumnus,2,I did not like Middlebury. The culture here seems to equate workload with learning and I think there's more to it than that. I wish I had gone somewhere else.
Recent Alumnus,2,It's a well-known liberal arts college in the north-east but not so much elsewhere. The career center counseling was poor.
Recent Alumnus,2,Not enough focus on learning; too much focus on producing work.
College Freshman,2,"People here are pretty aware of sexual assault, but no one ever believes that it can really happen to them (or that they or someone they're close to can be a perpetrator). Most of the time it's not ""intentional"" in that people get intoxicated and take advantage of others, using drugs as an excuse. It isn't though, and the horrible drinking culture on our campus combined with a general lack of respect in the partying scene contributes a lot to assaults and a feeling of unsafeness. 

As far as administrative response, I'm not sure of the specifics of the process but the general sense is that they care more about Midd's image than victims/survivors. Which is probably why, among other reasons, when two of my friends experienced incidents, neither of them felt comfortable going to administrators. Compliance with Title 9 doesn't equal full-fledged support. Things are getting better I think, but there's till a long way to go."
College Freshman,2,"The general Midd party scene isn't really my thing, although there are alternatives (Palana, Meeker, Q/A) that are moderately better. Then again there's never a guarantee that parties will be any good here. And the atmosphere of all of them is pretty unsafe. I've had some pretty creepy experiences, and 2 of my 5 closest friends have been harassed as well. Overall things are pretty unsafe, and you'll probably have more fun pregaming and chilling with friends rather than taking your chances at a party."
College Freshman,2,"There are maybe three or four places close enough to walk to in town. There's one Chinese place you can order from until around 10 or 11. If you want to eat somewhere else or want some late night food, you either have to drive (or walk an hour if you're really desperate) to McDonalds or you're out of luck."
College Sophomore,2,"I still love the idea of Middlebury, but the school is not for me. I made so many friends at this school and they all fell apart because of the social hierarchy here. I loved my professors but it was so difficult to get into one of their labs. I love how many outdoor activities there are but everything is student-run and can be a bit unsafe. 

**I am transferring and every person I have told has responded with ""I would do the same if I wasn't playing a sport here."" For so many people to say this to me should have been surprising but it wasn't. My professor even admitted that something needs to change at this school because it is becoming too exclusive."
College Sophomore,2,"The typical student at Midd is from a boarding or private school, has at least 2 houses, and speaks more than one language. Some girls take trips to St. Barths for the weekend. Its a bit much and the elitist atmosphere is in your face. I am transferring out of Middlebuy because of the people here. I was bullied for a medical condition."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of drinking on campus; I would argue more than at big state schools. Combine that with large male athletes and you have a problem. One that Middlebury is not trying to solve. I wil not speak on personal situations; I have had a few very very bad ones. The mentality of a lot of athletes here is that the girls are prey. Every hear the guy seniors host a ""predator/prey"" party where they invite freshan girls and get them drunk. And yes the school does know about this. Do not go out alone."
College Freshman,2,"First year housing is based on your first year seminars and the rooms range from extremely nice to extremely unpleasant depending on which hall you get allocated. In my case, I got allocated to the most ""social"" one but also the worst one in terms of amenities. It's all based on luck."
College Freshman,2,"Very few restaurants to choose from, not much on the menu. Customer service not great. Locals don't really love the students, as in some college towns."
College Freshman,2,"I chose a cold school because I really didn't want a warm school (general sweatiness = gross), and like cold winters.  The problem with Middlebury is, winter never really goes away.  Even when it warms up, there are sporadic freezing days, which can get depressing - the fact that winter never goes away.  The bigger problem is at night though.  Drunkenness/cold are not the greatest mix, and jacket-weather while going out = decent chance of walking home from a party in the cold without a jacket.  There's also a pretty serious ice problem in the spring.  We'll get rain/snow during the day, have it melt, and then refreeze at night, so the paths late at night/the next morning are dangerously icy.  Lots of people fall, and a few people get hurt every year from it."
College Freshman,2,"It is possible to get off of campus, but unless you have a car, it's not easy.  There are school run shuttles to the airport for breaks, but they're typically pretty inconvenient with when they're run.  The same goes for shuttles to the snow bowl.  To go anywhere else requires booking a car service (expensive), or having a car.  There are zipcars on campus (I think), but they're pretty much unused (really not sure why)."
College Freshman,2,"1 coed frat. Some fun thursdays, not much else"
College Junior,2,"If it wasn't for certain people, rugby, exercise, academics, and sheer force of will, I would have left Middlebury long ago."
College Junior,2,"While the use of hard drugs like cocaine and heroin is more out of sight (you have to seek it out but there are plenty of people doing it), the use of Marijuana is EVERYWHERE.  The smell is horrible and public safety never does anything about it.  The administration is stricter on alcohol, both those under and over 21, then any kind of drugs."
College Junior,2,"Negative temperatures are a regular occurrence in December and January.  Spring doesn't really being until May, by which point there are only two weeks of school left."
College Senior,2,"Transportation to and from the airport is extremely costly, and Burlington is hard to get to without your own car."
College Senior,2,No Parties Last Past Midnight – Public safety breaks everything up so there is nothing to do. the only options end up being social house basements which can get old very quickly
College Junior,1,"We don't have greek life, so a lot of the social scene is determined by sports teams, both varsity and club."
College Freshman,1,"There's pretty much nowhere else to live, which is why 99% of people just live on campus. I think seniors might have a lottery that lets them live off campus, but it's so difficult not a lot of them do it. It's just no worth it."
College Freshman,1,Off-campus housing is near non-existant.
College Freshman,1,"The town of Middlebury is painfully remote, with only a few small restaurants, a grocery store, and family-owned shops. It is a safe area, for the most part, with little crime reported. The local population is surprisingly unfriendly with students from the college. Despite the fact that Middlebury donates millions of dollars each year to support the town in different ways, many locals resent the college's presence. In large part because of this hostility, students rarely venture off campus."
College Freshman,1,"There are three dining halls on campus. Two, Proctor and Ross, are open everyday and located conveniently near the center of campus. The nicest one, Atwater, is open only for lunch, Monday through Friday, and can be found at the corner of campus. The hours for Ross and Proctor are not very convenient. The halls open each day at 7, closed between 2-4p, and then closed at 8p. As an international student from Spain, this is a very difficult schedule to follow. I am accustomed to eating lunch between 2 and 4p and dinner between 9 and 10p. In addition, the course and sports schedules make it difficult to get lunch and dinner while the halls are open. I often miss meals, and not by choice. The food itself is not great. Everyone knows to avoid certain days and certain foods at Proctor, thus the lines at Ross are consistently massive. It is not uncommon to wait an hour in line for dinner at Ross dining hall. I have spent a lot of time at a number of other similar colleges and universities, and I am overall thoroughly disappointed with the food and dining at Middlebury."
College Junior,1,Either nonexistent or horribly run.
College Junior,1,"Other than Mcdonalds which is only accessible by car, the only reliable and tasty option is Magic Wok, a chinese place.  Otherwise, when the dining halls (which are mediocre at best at every meal besides breakfast, which is heavenly) close at 8pm, there is no place to get food."
College Junior,1,"The housing lottery system is ridiculous and has not an ounce of fairness in it.  The dorms are not very clean.  The social life is horrible unless you are rich, white, preppy, elitist new englander or wanna be new englander or are one of the hippie, environmentalist, protest crazies."
College Junior,1,The college is strict about all the wrong things.
College Sophomore,1,"A Bunch of Rich White Kids – What do you expect at a college that costs 56,000 a year to go to? There is a bit of diversity, but the black kids are actually from Africa and the asian kids are usually from asia. There aren't many ethnic kids from america"
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much Going on – Townies are pretty weird, and there isn't anything to do in town unless you're 21."
Recent Alumnus,1,It is bad for underclassmen and only good for some upperclassmen depending on the dorm.
College Senior,1,"We Don't Have One. We have co-ed social houses in place of frats and sororities.

Some throw decent parties, but they are nothing special. Each house has a ""type"" although almost anyone can pledge. KDR for example is filled with urban-oriented kids while ""the Mill"" is for hipsters and ADP is filled with football players and their girlfriends."
College Junior,1,"Not So Much – There is not much, there is a 24 hour diner on the weekend, a sandwich shop, an Indian restaurant and a Chinese restaurant, but don't go on the look out for quality ethnic food, there is none."

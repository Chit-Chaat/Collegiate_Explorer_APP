Freshman,5,"With all of the COVID-19 restrictions put in place, many of my classes have been moved online. My teachers here at VT are ensuring that they adapt to each of their student's learning pace. The teachers want to make sure we are properly understanding the material, and are explaining the different concepts well, and in great detail."
Freshman,5,"The campus is a very lively, beautiful place. The architecture is amazing, and the buildings are made with a stone we call ""hokiestone"". The social life on campus is great, while also following the restrictions placed on us by COVID-19. Virginia Tech has been known to have some of the best college campus meals in the United States, and it definitely lives up to that expectation. The teachers also care deeply about their students, and all faculty want to see the students strive."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the scenery and overall atmosphere of the campus. It is a very relaxed yet vibrant place and I enjoy living here. There are many amenities and things to do, but covid has had a huge impact on the kind of events VT holds. However, I understand that VT is doing its best when it comes to COVID-19. I am very pleased with the guidelines put in place and their approach to testing. VT is a very large school full of people, but they have managed to keep cases stable. I hope that in the spring semester and in the subsequent years, the restrictions will be lifted and we will all be able to have the full VT experience."
Sophomore,5,"Overall It has been an amazing experience so far. There are a vast amount of opportunities available, like ROTC and the Corps of Cadets as well as an insane number of clubs and opportunities for community involvement as well. The education here is second to none for any major you pick."
Junior,5,Yes! I take my courses online this semester for COVID-19. Most university did not even offer the option to go online but Virginia Tech did! This means a lot to me and my family who have faced financial challenges with COVID-19 occurring. This semester I can continue  my education AND help my family by working!
Junior,5,"I have had an excellent experience at Virginia Tech! The professors and advisors are great, and I have really enjoyed getting involved in many extracurricular activities. The atmosphere there is incredible."
Junior,5,I have taken some classes online. The professors were very kind and flexible in the midst of the transition to online learning. The work load was manageable and there were plenty of options for learning and help.
Freshman,5,So far so good. The teachers do their best to stay active and in touch with the students. You are able to use the same resources and get ongoing help. It's a little different in scenery but it's still great.
Freshman,5,"This school is not only great with academics but is so encouraging in the students involvement in extracurricular activities and community service opportunities. There are plenty resources, the food is great and they help prepare you for after college."
Junior,5,I love Virginia tech! Tech has felt like a home for me and I miss it when I go back to my actual home. Tech always has great professors and a great football team too.
Sophomore,5,"I love this nice and clean campus,  everything is a walkable distance and plenty of places to hang out, eat, study, and have fun both on and around campus. The students here are very nice and there is a good engagement of clubs and activities that make you want to try them out. With downtown Blacksburg right by, there are plenty of shops and restaurants to go to without the bustling noise of a city."
Junior,5,All my professors were very accommodating and understanding when it came to switching to online.  One of them purposely took out time from our lecture to ask us how we were all doing and others created flexible HW and exam dates.
Junior,5,"Great Professors and academic advisors, very social school, great athletic events, and amazing food!"
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman but I am really enjoying my time at Tech. It is a great school and has amazing teachers who all care about the success of their students. It is also a beautiful place to live with amazing peers. There are tons of events to watch and you will never have a boring day while at Tech.
Sophomore,5,"I love Virginia Tech so much. The campus, food and overall atmosphere are amazing! The professors I have had have also been so helpful and I have just overall loved my time here."
Sophomore,5,"I think virginia tech has done a very good job at converting to an online format and the usage a alot of online services such as lab flow, canvas and zoom have made the transition smoother."
Junior,5,"After the Covid-19 outbreak, our classes were moved to an online format in a very quick fashion. Even though online learning is not the same as being on campus, the way Virginia Tech moved classes to a virtual platform was phenomenal!"
Alum,5,"The majority of the online courses I took were due to COVID-19 during Spring 2020 so it's kind of a unique situation when classes that are supposed to be taught in person are forced to switch online. That being said, all my professors were incredibly kind and accommodating because of everything else going on. Most professors were really good about communicating expectations. They all checked in on me and my fellow classmates, encouraging us to reach out if we needed extensions on things because of extenuating circumstances. While I realize this level of care and engagement isn't necessarily typical of the online class experience, I had professors who typically didn't rely on lots of technology or had never taught an online class and they worked really hard to master that technology and continue to provide engaging instruction. I think that says something about them as instructors."
Junior,5,I chose Virginia Tech because it is service based. Everyone attending can find a home at Tech. It has the best food and the prettiest campus. Talk to any students and you will see how passionate we all are. GO HOKIES
Senior,5,"Virginia Tech has been the best decision I have made to date. I absolutely love the campus, the people, and the academic ratings."
Freshman,4,"My professors have done their best to provide instruction however constrained it is. There are sometimes technological errors and drops in connection but this is inevitable due to the high volume of web traffic on Zoom. I appreciate the professors' tenacity when it comes to teaching however they need to. That said, online learning is a lot more challenging than traditional learning as it is not easy to ask questions or stay focused on the material. I definitely prefer a traditional classroom but Zoom is the best among alternatives."
Sophomore,4,"It has been a difficult adjustment transitioning to online, but it has been very doable. Some of the classes became much easier to learn while some became much harder. It has been a good learning experience overall and I have been able to find out a lot about myself and how I learn best."
Junior,4,"Overall, a really good institution. I have made some really good friends here and for the most part the professors are amazing."
Junior,4,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE & STATE UNIVERSITY MIGHT BE A LARGE UNIVERSITY BUT THE COMMUNITY DOES AN AMAZING JOB AT MAKING EVERYONE FEEL AT HOME.
Sophomore,4,"I really like the campus and the people there. I also really like the diversity there, it's a majority white but not by much from what I've seen. All of my classes are very good and very well planned. Online classes were a bit of a struggle but I don't know any college that didn't struggle with it. Overall, Virginia Tech is a great school and I'm glad I chose it."
Sophomore,4,I already had one online class the first semester because it is always online but once they switched to all online it wasn't too hard to adjust. One of my classes is a design class so we are constantly doing projects so it was a little weird not being able to show our professor our projects in person. We had to take videos of them so he could see it from all angles. Some of my normal lecture classes were a little hard just because it's a bit harder to ask questions and it was a bit harder for me to focus when it was online because I would get distracted easily. I didn't mind having online classes but I would say I don't prefer it.
Sophomore,4,"I decided to go to Virginia Tech because I really wanted to be a part of the huge community Tech has to offer. Living on campus was extremely nice but because of the over acceptance the year I went, I did hear that the living situations were not the best. Regarding the academics, I felt the classes were very structured and that was perfect for me. I enjoyed having a set schedule and working around it to get work done. Regarding the sense of community, I felt welcomed and comfortable navigating around campus. The football games were very fun and were always something to look forward to. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 I had to finish my first year online. I was able to schedule myself accordingly to keep up with my work but my grades did drop a little due to the lack of in person learning, something that I strive on. Overall, I have really enjoyed my first year at Virginia Tech and I look forward to the next three years."
Junior,4,"When we had transitioned to online learning, I saw a lack of engagement between my classmates. During one of my classes, I was the only student to ever show up and try to learn. There was definitely a learning curve that some people didn't get when transitioning"
Freshman,4,I personally don't enjoy online learning but I believe that VT is doing a great job adapting to the current situation. There are some issues with communication because we aren't able to visit offices but professors still hold times in the day when they are available for calls. It is difficult but everyone is trying their best to maintain a positive space to learn.
Junior,4,"Even though Virginia Tech is a large school with a lot of students, the environment on campus makes you feel at home and welcome. I am so happy I made the decision to transfer to this school!"
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my four years at Virginia Tech. I loved the campus environment and always felt like I was surrounded by people who really wanted to be there. All of my professors really cared about my learning experience and encouraged me to be a well-rounded person. Honestly, I've never felt safer than when I was at Tech. The only thing I would say against them is that I was really disappointed when COVID-19 hit and they immediately refused to consider an in-person graduation for an indefinite later date for the Class of 2020 (when every other Virginia school made promised to have one, even a year later)."
Senior,4,"Classes online have been okay. Professors are doing the best that they can, however it is obviously not an ideal situation to be in, especially for research and group projects."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love my school. It is beautiful, full of life and friendship, and I have made so many meaningful relationships. There are such a wide variety of courses available and my advisors are so helpful in my planning. My return on investment is kind of low because I have had multiple issues with the financial aid office either over counting my scholarships, over charging me, not giving me a just amount of federal aid, or decreasing my aid amounts. There were also insufficient refunds for the covid-impacted spring 2020 semester."
Freshman,4,"The student environment is very healthy! The overall passion of the university is to serve, which I found suited my interested very well. They also have many agricultural experiential opportunities and are very involved in research and extension. Be advised, however, that the party atmosphere may seem overwhelming as a Freshman. Still, there are many ways to be involved and to help the community while you attend school here."
Senior,4,People really love the school. There are chances to get involved everywhere you look. The academics can be great or subpar depending on the program you go into. Pamplin is a great business school but has been falling behind the past few years.
Sophomore,4,"Virgina Tech is a really great place to called your second home. I remember when I first applied to this school I was so nervous because of the fact that I was a minority. In the beginning, it was hard to find other people like me since this school was a PWI. The one main thing that virginia tech cares about is their students feeling like they belong as a hokie just like everybody else and they do that by having numerous inclusive events around the campus."
Alum,4,"When I first arrived at Virginia Tech, I experienced a lot of culture shock; however, upon finding my community, I can truly say that I am very grateful for my education and the connections that I was able to make. My time spent there truly transformed me into a greater person."
Senior,4,"I feel very safe and welcomed here, and I know everything I'm learning will be applicable in my future career."
Junior,2,Online learning absolutely stinks. I understand the desire to have kids back on campus but this weird half and half limbo that we are in right now is worse then being online fully. There are little to no expectations for teachers adn the amout of work from class to class varies vastly.
Junior,2,These are in a professor to professor basis. Some make online classes too challenging to make sure students dont slack for an online class and others are incredibly easy and boring  No middle ground between these in my experience.

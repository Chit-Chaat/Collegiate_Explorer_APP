Sophomore,5,Professors are understanding and willing to cooperate with varying schedules and the problems caused by the pandemic.
Sophomore,5,"It is the perfect blend of a traditional university campus and a small college like feel. Professors genuinely care about students and the community is close-knit and inspiring. Best place to learn, grow, and have fun!"
Sophomore,5,"Wake Forest is a place that is socially active while very academically competitive. From personal experience, the professors genuinely care for their students and want them to succeed. The social scene is primarily dominated by Greek-life, but there are many other ways for students to have a social life outside of that. Not to mention, the campus is beautiful and is well maintained."
Senior,5,"I'm a rising senior at Wake Forest University and have loved my time as a student here so far. The academics are rigorous but students tend to have a pretty good work-life balance. Most people you meet are very driven and motivated, but also enjoy helping others out having fun. Winston-Salem is a nice area to live in that is a good mid-sized city."
Junior,5,"It is an amazing school that allows many educational opportunities for all students! The campus is beautiful and creates such a welcoming atmosphere. Students are very involved both in terms of academics and student life. There isn't much I would change about Wake Forest. There is a good variety of food choices, but if I was to change something, I would add additional food options."
Sophomore,5,"I love the close-knit atmosphere of Wake Forest. It is a small campus, however it never feels too small. Th teaching is very hands-on and intimate, allowing professors and students to actually form respectful relationships in the workplace. This creates an accountability factor for students to do their work and perform their best, as their professors will call them out if they don't. However, one thing that could be improved about Wake Forest is its lack of diversity. It seems that the majority of students are caucasian who come from upper class homes. It would be nice to see an increase in diversity."
Alum,5,"I loved that WFU still offers a true liberal arts education. Professors actually care about you. The food is great, and lots of social and outdoor opportunities!"
Niche User,5,"I loved the school from the second my car drove past the small peak of the main quad and Wait Chapel to the parking lot. Wake is a fantastic institution I knew nearly instantly I wanted to go to (henceforth I ED'd, and will be attending next fall). The atmosphere and size was right for me. It had that perfect mix of individualized academic attention of a small liberal arts college and school sprit of a large state school."
Freshman,5,"I came to Wake for its rigorous academics which I was very much met with. I was not expecting the frat life that controls the social scene, but that one is on me. Overall, I am extremely happy with Wake"
Niche User,5,"Wake Forest is much more different than where I live. Since I was little, I dream and still do, of coming here. My expectations were so high about this school, and the next thing I knew, I love it."
Alum,5,"Applying to Wake Forest was one of the best decisions I've ever made. It is a wonderful school and community that has made me who I am today. It lives up to its ""Work Forest"" rep, but it is because everyone pushes each other to be there absolute best. It is a wonderful environment to grow and mature before entering the real world."
Niche User,5,"So far we have been very pleased with Wake. It's everything you could ask for in a college.  There's small classes, a beautiful campus,  a supportive environment and there are more fun activities than you will ever have time for.  Our child seems to be thriving,  which is what we were hoping for."
Freshman,5,"Strong academics, small class size, great athletics.  Wake is known as “Work Forest” for it rigorous academics.  The school does a great job hiring wonderful professors.  Students are well rounded, overall nice group of smart kids."
Niche User,5,"Wake Forest University is a college filled with opportunity for students of all ages. As a High School senior that is interested in applying to Wake Forest, I have been provided opportunities of a lifetime at Wake Forest University. In the summer of 2018, my dance team and I were able to go to a dance camp at Wake Forest that has helped us throughout the year and this following year. In November of 2018, I was offered a free opportunity by my anatomy teacher to be able to be a ""sister of science"".  Then just last week, I was able to experience the camp of a lifetime at the ""Wake Forest Summer Immersion Neuroscience Program"". 
Overall, Wake Forest University is a great college with great opportunities."
Freshman,5,It is a amazing school. It has so many clubs and activities available. The campus is so beautiful. I wish I could stay here for the rest of my life. The professors are really nice people and they are willing to help you with any problems.
Niche User,5,Everything is extremely clean and you definitely have a vast scale of opportunities. The staff makes you feel as if you are at home. The campus is beautiful and there are plenty of different programs to find one you like. The volunteer work is another amazing benefit to attending Wake Forest University because you get a chance to experience the real world. Every program at Wake Forest University is incredible with outstanding professors who truly care about their students. It is a D1 school while also being incredibly good for academics. Anyone who comes out of Wake Forest University will not be disappointed.
Junior,5,"I love this school with my whole heart. The campus is beautiful and welcoming, and I have met some lifelong friends so far during my two years as a student here. However, the school is small in nature, which takes some getting used to as it continuously gets smaller over time, in the aspect that there are increasingly more familiar faces a student can see in a given day. Wake Forest could be more diverse, and I think that would help the campus learn more from each other. Right now, to me, it seems like the student body is somewhat homogenous. I think that by admitting more students from different backgrounds, the school could only improve."
Junior,5,"I love the atmosphere, the connections, the relationships I've had with my professors, the campus, and pretty much everything there is to love about a school."
Freshman,5,"As a student that's coming from a Spanish speaking country the US, I felt anxious; many events, situations, and goals floated in my mind every time I thought about coming to Wake. Looking back at those moments makes me happy because I chose the right university because it is were I made amazing friends and found my girlfriend. 

All of my classes have been from great to ""wow I want to study more"" (except for one)
People are eager to get to know you and be friends with you from the day you arrive
From my point of view, the campus is beautiful. The only downside I might find is that it is NC weather (one day it's freezing, the next it's 90)
The cafeteria food is alright, but compared to other cafeterias it's amazing in the diversity of food and good taste (one of the top vegan friendly)
You are given other options apart from the caferia: Subway, Chick-fil-a, Moes, Zick's (good flat bread pizza), etc.
Almost all dorms are cozy and nice to be in (does not include Johnson)"
Sophomore,5,"The best part about Wake are the professors and the rigorous academic experience. As a student, I've had the opportunity to design my own major and to work closely with faculty and assist them in their research. The social scene is pretty good and Winston Salem has some cute areas and very good food."
Niche User,5,I really liked the welcoming environment and beautiful campus! It was great to see so many people who were passionate about learning and helping others.
Alum,5,"Wake Forest is an incredible institution. The professors are engaged, the atmosphere is fun, ambitious, and intellectually stimulating, and I met the best friends of my life there."
Freshman,5,Wake has gotten much better. Academics are excellent. Diversity is getting better considering how small wake is. Greek life is big here but you will find your place no matter what.
Freshman,5,Beautiful campus. Incredible academics. Low ratio professors to students. All courses taught by professors. No T/As.
Graduate Student,5,Admission's team for the DNP program were very friendly and helpful. The faculty are responsive and helpful.
Senior,5,"Wake Forest University has been the perfect choice for me. I have been involved in marching band, chemistry research, and volunteer opportunities throughout my four years. It has prepared me well to go into optometry school this fall and the school culture suited my lifestyle as well."
Freshman,5,"Professors are great and the people are fun. People dress very nice and professionally. The work is hard and everyone spends a lot of time studying. Wake Wednesdays are big and its definitely work hard play hard kind of school. There is also a big hook up culture, but probably not that much different from most colleges. Greek life dominates the social scene for sure and most girls rush. There is always something to do and there are good food options. However, the social life revolves around drinking and it would not be easy to be sober in this environment. So far I have had a lot of fun and found my classes to be interesting and challenging. The professors seem very engaging and seem to want to help all their students.  Downtown Winston is also nice and artsy. Theres a lot of different food options and a free shuttle. There are students from all over."
Graduate Student,5,I am in the Wake Forest MBA program and it's amazing! Wake has seemingly unlimited resources. I love that I can email our librarian to get help any time I can't find something. The campus is beautiful. The professors are incredible.
Sophomore,5,"Wake Forest University has a beautiful campus and passionate, talented professors. The workload is definitely sizable but with time management and hard work you can definitely succeed. The professors are always eager to assist you if you need extra help. All teachers have office hours, where they are in their offices solely to answer your questions. Wake Forest is definitely has the motto work hard, play hard. Though going out is fun, the library is always packed come Sunday morning. The new gymnasium is amazing and the university is starting to renovate the dorms. I love attending Wake Forest!"
Alum,5,"I loved my years at Wake Forest! I made connections with professors, found myself engaged in my classes, enjoyed the social scene of the school, and had valuable experiences both on and off campus. Wake is the perfect school for a student who is ambitious and driven, likes a challenge, and wants to get involved outside of the classroom in research, on-campus work, clubs, Greek life, and more. 

It's often said that Wake is a small school with big school offerings (like variety of class selection, career office, facilities, bad food, and D1 sports), and I found this to be completely true. The office of academic advising actively reaches out to students if they're struggling to help them find a tutor or work with their professors. The school also supports a large study abroad office and owns three houses in Europe that students can stay and study at."
Graduate Student,5,"I arrived at the campus and all of the building and lawns were beautifully kept and maintained. It is quieter during the summer.The newly built business school is on the main campus contains all the latest technology and has so much to offer students. 
They have a lot of resources for student career searches, the networking opportunities are amazing and because the school is smaller they focus in on the whole student and not just the grades. The program I am in at the graduate level has a 97% employment rate (within 6 months of graduating). 
The student housing options are amazing! They have newly renovated homes and apartments for multiple people willing to have roommates. The campus and surrounding area is patrolled mostly in the evening and security is pretty pleasant.  
The diversity on campus is decent for a PWI. The athletics and party scene are okay. I recommend getting involved and staying busy on campus to increase perspective employment instead of focusing on nightlife."
Alum,5,I love Wake Forest! You get so much opportunity and choice. The best things is that you're in Winston-Salem which has a lot of things to do. You wont get bored. LET'S GO DEACONS!
Junior,5,I love the atmosphere. The one thing that stands out the most is how dedicated the faculty and students are to collaborating and to giving back to the community. The teachers want to get to know you and help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,Winston-Salem is the perfect location for this campus. The University offers one of the top tier education opportunities available on the east coast. The size is small and helps to allow students to make better connections with professors who are more accessible and helpful than at a larger university.
Sophomore,5,"Just finished my freshman year at wake, and so far it has been amazing. The teachers actually care about your learning and success and will MAKE time for you in order to reach your goals. Social life at wake also great, there is a heavy influence of sorority and fraternity life on campus. I have found that if you need ANYTHING at wake and if you ask around, there will be people, friends, professors, and advisors that are willing to help you and find a way to accomplish it."
Sophomore,5,"Great atmosphere & great people. Also, the sorority and fraternity involvement on the campus is AMAZING! And even if you choose to not join one yourself, it is still amazing. Easily the best top 30 university!"
Alum,5,"The campus is beautiful, and the student to teach ratio is great. The professors are always available. The only thing I would change would be some aspects of dining services, healthier options."
Freshman,5,"I am so grateful for the opportunity to attend Wake Forest University. The teaches truly care for the students, and they would do anything to help their students. The strong focus on undergraduate teaching was extremely helpful in my choice to attend Wake Forest."
Freshman,5,"Love it! It is a wonderful college. I am currently a member of a sorority, and I love all the girl in it !"
Freshman,5,"I've only been at Wake for a semester but I already know I made the right choice to come here. The academics are tough but definitely worth it and not as daunting as it may seem. The students are a lot nicer than I expected, although one should still not come here expecting racial or social diversity. Also, don't expect a whole lot of financial aid."
Junior,5,"Wake's best asset is its small size combined with high level academics and diverse range of students it draws. Some intro lecture classes can be as large as 50 students, but for the most part class sizes are all under 20 students, allowing for personal connections with professors and plenty of in class discussion."
Senior,5,"Challenging academics, with professors who have high expectations and want you to succeed. Students care a lot about school, even when they say they don't- the work hard play hard reputation is DEFINITELY true. Come to Wake Forest if you're ready to learn a lot both in the classroom and about yourself as a person. For the past four years, I've been surrounded by incredibly motivated individuals who are all passionate about something, and that is so cool. Dining has improved SO MUCH since I've been here. Dorms are also getting better every year, with all of the 1950s buildings on the quad either already renovated or plans to do so within the next year. The one issue here is that housing selection is stressful. Getting a job before graduation is the norm- most of my senior friends and I are either already employed or planning to go to grad school. I didn't realize how special that was until I started talking to friends at other colleges."
Graduate Student,5,Wake Forest is a great school with great admissions counselors!  They helped me every step of the way and made the process easy.  I can see why this university has such a good reputation.  I am looking forward to starting the program next month.
Freshman,5,"I am overwhelmed with the professors at Wake. Their teaching is far more than I was expecting as is their involvment with student success.  The campus is drop-dead beautiful and the student body is engaged, hospitable and brilliant."
Freshman,5,"I had a great experience with Wake Forest. Although I visited the campus on my own, it was very warming and beautiful when I stepped foot on the campus. If I had to change anything about the campus it would have been to schedule a tour with a tour guide to have the full effect of the campus and what it has to offer."
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere of Wake Forest on campus. When I visited it was the week before finals but everyone was still super approachable and nice!
Freshman,5,"It is an amazing place! A school with big D1 spirit yet small school intimate education. On top of this, the campus is gorgeous with all four season and an excellent environment to spend four years of your life at."
Niche User,5,"I loved the environment there, the people were by far the nicest of the places I have visited. I also love all the opportunities that are available to students. I was very impressed"
Junior,5,"I transferred to Wake after spending my freshman year at a small university on the West coast. I'm from the Midwest, and knew I wanted to be no where close to home. Wake Forest, over the last two years, has been everything I ever wanted and more. I've had that literal ""college brochure"" experience in many ways--I've made great friends, had dinner at a professor's house, and sat on the Quad doing my homework. Wake has its faults, but all schools do. The atmosphere isn't overly competitive however, and students make time to have fun on the weekends. Overall, I don't regret transferring and I wish I had more time at Wake--I can't wait to see what senior year holds & where my time ""in the Forest"" will take me next."
Sophomore,5,"Great academics, socially-dynamic students, and sports that all seem to be improving.  Administration is trying to shake-up greek life by cracking down on off-campus parties, which is a big loss to the underclassmen, who pretty much rely on frat parties for their source of parties and fun when they're not studying."
Sophomore,5,Love the close knit community.  My professors are interested in my college pathway.  They tell me when someone is on campus that I might enjoy meeting.  They are aware of all my different interest.  I have so many opportunities to explore.
Sophomore,5,Love it! Professors and support staff are truly invested in helping you anytime. Weather is great and food is good.
Recent Alumnus,5,We have a separate police office and internal affairs department. The safety issue is organized very seriously on campus. I feel totally safe on campus.
Recent Alumnus,5,"In my school we can assure there is no discrimination for race, or nationality at all. Greeks live, study, have all rights, freedoms, privileges just the same as nongreeks do."
Recent Alumnus,5,"We have excellent soccer, football and other facilities and not only the students also other staff sometimes participate in big games, and our University teams are one of the best teams in the country!"
College Sophomore,5,Wake Forest has the perfect mix of everything & everyone
College Freshman,5,"Wake Forest is a well known school. Not only would a stranger know Wake, but alumni pride themselves on being a Demon Deacon. The career services is one of the main reasons I came to Wake."
College Freshman,5,I love Wake- from every teacher to students. Professors all support and care about my success and express their concerns. They were supportive when I had to miss class for family reason. I like that we have divisional requirements in all departments pretty much because I am forced to take classes I would never take otherwise.
College Freshman,5,"There has never been a moment on campus where I have felt unsafe, which includes walking home at 2am from the library and from a party."
College Freshman,5,"Wake Forest is unique in that it promotes the entire person. Academics are very important to all that are apart of the university, but it goes much farther than that. From teachers to fellow students, everyone supports each other. I find my teachers encouraging me to go and enjoy my time at college (rather that is climbing a mountain, spending time with friends, or at a party they do not know). In that, I have been challenged to balance life and school, fun and work, and many other important aspects of my life. Without a doubt, I would choose to come to Wake again and encourage others to come along with me."
Sophomore,4,"Though far from ideal for everyone, professors adapted very well to the online format. Professors put a lot of effort into accommodating students in such a time of chaos. Depending on the format of the class, they were taught synchronously or asynchronously."
Junior,4,"After the corona virus crisis occurred this past spring, my classes got moved online. I was taking 5 classes which all got put onto an online platform. While it wasn't ideal, Wake Forest did an amazing job of still allowing students to receive a great education and a welcoming class environment."
Sophomore,4,"I actually really liked learning online! Wake Forest did a great job of ensuring that there was still communication amongst professors and students to mimic a classroom environment. However, one thing I did not like was an increase in ""busy work"" that I noticed in my classes after we switched to online working. A lot of the work I was assigned did not contribute much of an impact to the courses I was taking."
Alum,4,"Wake Forest provided a great academic experience! The network is phenomenal and the majority of faculty are dedicated and passionate. Diversity needs to be improved, though."
Alum,4,"I tell many people that WFU was the best 4 years of my life. The professors are amazing, and thanks to the small class size, they actually know your name and face! Additionally, there are so many amazing students that I formed lasting relationships with. And finally, the campus is beautiful. Whenever I visit, I feel at ease as soon as I step onto the upper quad."
Senior,4,The professors and classes are amazing. The social aspect leaves much to be desired. The greek system rules everything here and everyone is expected to abide by the system.
Alum,4,"Wake Forest hands down prepared me for the real world with its challenging coursework and goal to push create, out-of-the box solutions.  

Sometimes professors were too focused on living up to Wake's reputation of being a ""hard grader"" where As are sometimes impossible due somewhat to only a handful of classes that used a curve.  This wasn't productive to our learning and, in fact, almost was more discouraging after putting in hours of work to succeed in the class."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and very easy to navigate. The dorms are hit or miss if you get a really nice one, but all very social and fun (you are not in your room very often). The academics are hard, but the professors are amazing! Ive met amazing people here"
Junior,4,Overall Wake is an amazing school in the academics department but Wake needs to work on being more diverse.
Alum,4,I wouldn't have wanted to go anywhere else. I learned how to face and overcome obstacles. I made the greatest relationships with my peers and professors. I would do it all over again if I could.
Freshman,4,All of the professors at Wake are very centered on their students success. It is very easy to visit with them and get help for multiple things not just schoolwork. The campus is very beautiful and you get to experience all four seasons. There are lots of opportunities to get involved on campus and meet people.
Senior,4,I'd like to see more integration between the Research component and the Liberal Arts education. Great academics and a very credible school. Small classes and notable professors along with a gorgeous campus. The local area is slowly developing and I believe in the next ten years this will be a top 25 school (US Rank).
Sophomore,4,"I loved my first year at Wake Forest. I've found great friends through a pre-orientation program, working on campus, and from living in a dorm. The academics were great for my level. I was challenged in every class but it's not like I took an impossible and unreasonable class. The only thing I'd change about Wake is to have more opportunities for the minority population to feel more included in a majority-white school."
Alum,4,"The worst part of my 4 years at Wake Forest was graduating and having to leave! As a Northern that transplanted herself to the South, I couldn't have asked for a kinder, safer, or more welcoming environment. I made the best of friends and was provided with many opportunities for class selection, extracurriculars, and study abroad. Now as an alumni, I would like to see Wake Forest put a little more effort into promoting career planning and skills for all majors and especially those in STEM subjects that might not know what the possibilities are."
Senior,4,"Wake Forest has its pros and cons.However, overall it depends on ""you"" to create your own experience here. There are plenty of Greek life for people who enjoy them, yet, various clubs and other campus organizations also put efforts on creating an environment for people who are non-Greek. Most time, the line between the two is blurred, Greek organizations participate in various philanthropy programs, too.  Yes, people complain all the time but people also enjoy Wake Forest. Professors are great, you would never get such close mentorship/friendship in a gigantic school."
Senior,4,"Wake Forest is a collaborative and supportive environment. Class sizes are small, so participation and preparation are a must. Professors are available and willing to help as long as you reach out. Wake offers a  variety of majors and minors and even has an innovation quarter downtown that houses the new engineering dept. Wake does have a very prominent greek life that brings more harm than good to the social life here; however, administration has been cracking down on societies. Wake's Office of Professional and Career development is relatively helpful, although I recommend using the resume templates provided to business school students. The office offers a number of stipends to support students taking on unpaid internships. There are lots of on-campus events and traditions as well for students to take part of, such as lighting of the quad, Wake 'N Shake, Project Pumpkin, and Shag on the Mag. All these events provide lots of involvement and leadership opportunities for students."
Sophomore,4,"Its a great school, but extremely expensive. The social life is very prominent  but not very diverse. Most weekends are spent in either the library or a frat basement. Professors are very accessible and the greek life is great!!"
Freshman,4,Wake Forest University has a fun environment that makes the workload much more manageable. The professors spend a great deal of time with their students and on the material. Wake Forest does a great job of planning fun events to relieve the stress of the academics.
Senior,4,"Wake Forest gives you the opportunity and resources to thrive academically and socially. Through peer tutoring programs, peer and faculty advising, free personal and career development programs and such, Wake will set you up to be successful. Additionally,  the small community environment has its pros and cons. Your classes are small and you gain great connections with both your professors and peers, but the small community can feel somewhat suffocating sometimes. Greek life is a major thing on campus, but whether you choose to be involved or not, you can find your own social niche. Overall it was a great experience."
Senior,4,"Since Wake Forest is such a small university, the number of students in each classes are roughly 15 students. College is not easy, especially attending a private university. Since the class sizes are not large, I am guaranteed that I will get any help I need from my professors. I'm not just a number in their classrooms. Professors actually get to know your name, they grab coffee with you, and at times invite you to dinners with their families. The professors at Wake Forest University are amazing!"
Niche User,4,Wake Forest is a great school for you if you like small campuses with a diverse population. The campus is beautiful and the teachers are very encouraging and the students are very nice.
Recent Alumnus,4,There are good career prospects after graduation of my program. Recent years more than 80% of grads got employment in their own interested job practice places. Our career center provides an excellent service and in our school lots of on-campus employment interviews are held..
Recent Alumnus,4,"This is what I dreamed about! Academic staff and my peers are very kind and friendly, helpful! They are all just strong and pretty intelligent people!! 

I would choose this school again if I could do it all over. Because I found my dream school where I have an excess to highly qualified academic faculty, legal clinics, pro bono projects and broad scale of my course options in my interested field."
College Sophomore,4,I'm excited to see what happens here
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is big at Wake. The majority of people are involved in greek life, however I do not believe it is the end all be all. You can get into a fraternity party (at least for girls) regardless of your greek affiliation. As a member of a greek organization, I have friends in other greek organizations and non-greek!"
College Sophomore,4,The University is constantly implementing new protocols to improve security.
College Sophomore,4,"WFU is great as far as academics, though social spaces need improvement. Class sizes and spaces are okay, though the science buildings need serious renovations rather than just moving Downtown."
College Sophomore,4,"I got to live in a newly-renovated dorm this year and the experience was acceptable. I was disappointed about not having a closet in the room and that my desk was rather small, but the suite is nice."
Recent Alumnus,4,Positive impact and way to de stress
Recent Alumnus,4,Being Greek is important but more so your first 2 years.
Recent Alumnus,4,Positive impact and great way to de-stress
Recent Alumnus,4,Some dorms are better than others but community and relation to classes is great
Recent Alumnus,4,Great Greek life but need houses.
College Freshman,4,I love living in Luter and having a co-ed hall. I've made some really great friends that are also my hallmates.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life here is a big part of campus, but you can still have fun and make it without being in Greek life."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy attending games, even though we are not the best at sports."
College Freshman,4,"Academics at Wake are impeccable.  You will get a great education, albeit with a large workload.  The workload is manageable and if you want to actually learn something in college go here."
College Freshman,4,The only good parties are those at fraternities.  If you aren't interested in this then this isn't the school for you.
College Freshman,4,The only good parties are those at fraternities.  You need to be a part of these organizations to have fun.
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, you will really only run into alcohol and marijuana on campus.  There are a contingency that does cocaine, but you don't need to smoke or do coke if you don't want to.  Drinking is pretty important to have fun and everything is pretty accessible if you are interested, but no one will push it on you if you don't want any."
College Freshman,4,"The great majority of classes that I have taken thus far at Wake have been challenging, but rewarding.  As cliché as that sounds, the courses force you to put in effort and if you put in effort you will get something out of the class.  With small class sizes, the professors are willing to work with you.  The difficulty of a class is solely based on the professor."
College Freshman,4,"There is a lot of diversity, but at the same time there is not that much diversity."
College Sophomore,4,"I know a handful of students who have experienced sexual assault, which is relatively low compared with my friends from other universities."
Recent Alumnus,4,Both the courses and the professors were engaging and challenging. The professors are friendly and passionate. The variety of courses is endless and the liberal arts degree is ideal for learning about a variety of topics.
Recent Alumnus,4,I feel very safe on campus but I always take precautions and am aware of my surroundings regardless of the security on campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,I would choose my school again because the professors are so passionate and accessible. They care about each student and they challenge you to push yourself and be better than you are. I didn't like how greek our campus was. Greek life was huge part of our small college community so it was hard to escape but I was not a particularly huge fan of that social atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,Wake Forest is a great community with lots of good people. I came from a small boarding school so the calss sizes were bigger than I was sued to but better than some of the class sizes I have heard from my friends colleges.
College Freshman,4,"Students are required to live on campus for their first 3 years, which I personally don't mind because there are student apartments that are considered on campus and overall I think Wake has really nice housing. I don't know much about off-campus housing but I think Deacon Station is pretty nice! I know a few seniors who live off campus and they love it despite the short commute."
College Freshman,4,"Winston-Salem is a pretty small town, but I've been to some really great restaurants I had never heard of before- they were reasonably priced and really cute places to get a little dressed up for and head out for a Friday night dinner with some friends!"
College Junior,4,"Greek life is pretty big, but there are options if you don't want to be a part of it"
College Sophomore,4,"From what I have heard and seen, off-campus living seems very nice, and seniors seem to enjoy it a lot. I probably won't live off campus, but there are a variety of options and off-campus houses are more ""real life"" than dorms."
College Sophomore,4,"I really like the places I have gone to off campus to eat, but I rarely go off campus, so this question does not really apply to me. I guess I don't really feel the need to get off campus, and I prefer to use my meal plan anyway. However, when I do go off campus, I feel like there is a good variety of nice restaurants. I have a few favorites, but I am usually able to find new places as well."
College Sophomore,4,"Personally, I haven't had much experience with strictness, but I feel like the general concept is that if you are not making a scene, administration will typically leave you alone. Underage drinking is policed mainly by RAs who are obligated to write up underage drinkers. Police will help out with severe cases of underage drinking that involve danger to the drinker, but they don't seek out to get people in trouble. Lounge parties occur on campus every weekend and anyone, regardless of age, can attend. The honor code is taken pretty seriously here, but policing it is fairly difficult. Those who are caught violating the honor code will typically face fairly serious punishments."
College Sophomore,4,"Wake is definitely a party school, which somehow isn't always the impression it gives off. Students here work really hard during the week, and then get hammered on the weekend. You don't necessarily have to get involved in this lifestyle, but finding other things to do on the weekends can sometimes be tough. However, I haven't really made the effort to find different things to do. If a student wants to go to parties and not drink, other students will not pressure that student into drinking. Greek life completely dominates the party scene, which is mostly fine, but non-Greek guys can have trouble getting into some parties. As a non-Greek guy myself, I have only ever had trouble getting into a party a couple of times at a maximum. The administration tries to keep parties on campus, but most students prefer to go to off campus house parties, which are typically more fun."
College Sophomore,4,"For being a small school, I think Wake has a lot of good food options. The Pit can get tired every now and then, but it still has pretty good food. The New Pit consistently has good food, and the food court has everything you would want. Also, having two sit-in restaurants is very nice."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus at Wake is absolutely beautiful and relatively calm. The dorms aren't huge unless you are in the new dorms, but all dorms have air conditioning, a microwave, and a fridge provided. Social life is dominated by Greek life, which can be tough for non-Greeks. However, Greek housing/lounges are incorporated into several dorms with both Greek and non-Greek students. I haven't had much trouble with the housing process because I have been lucky (pulled in by a senior for sophomore year and given a room for an RA position for junior year), but I have heard of many people having problems. There is a requirement to live on campus for three years, and the amount of available housing seems somewhat limited for all of the students that live here."
College Freshman,4,"Wake Forest has great varsity athletics, some of the biggest social events are tailgates"
College Freshman,4,"Winston-Salem has a surprising variety of restaurants, most of which are good quality."
College Freshman,4,"Great variety. Pit is okay, lots of options to choose from but not very high quality food. You can use your meal plan at food court restaurants though and each meal plans comes with ""food dollars"" to spend on snacks and/or delivery pizza if you want."
College Freshman,4,"Career Services is very helpful at Wake Forest, but you have to go in to see them."
Freshman,2,"I am a current Freshman at Wake and am transferring next semester due to Wake’s culture. While there are some niche groups of athletes, students in band, or theatre, Greek life is essentially the only social life on campus as Wednesday-Saturday nights are typically spent there partying. Additionally, the campus feels rather segregated. For example, My dorm has many international students, yet they are sequestered in the same hall instead of integrated with the rest of the students. Finally, the prevalence of wealth and importance of appearance is not what I desired. Many freshmen drive new luxury cars and only wear designer clothes which may make less affluent students feel out of place. I see that many here feel this is what they want out of their college experience, and if so, I feel I have no right to tell them what they should and should not do. I have written this review to give incoming students my observations about Wake, so they can make an informed decision for themselves."
Graduate Student,2,"I am a graduate student at Wake Forest University. Wake Forest certainly enthralls prospective applicants with a beautiful campus and respectable reputation. However, this school has largely become focused on shaking students for whatever pennies they are worth, at the detriment of the student well-being and academic experience. The university has made efforts to restrict access to resources for many graduate and medical programs because they don't pay directly into the Wake Forest undergraduate system, even though they are a part of the university. I cannot speak to the quality of undergraduate education but the overall culture is one that revolves around university income, not a friendly place for undergraduate students to prosper as budding professionals."
Niche User,2,"Do not go to this university, ESPECIALLY if you know you plan to persue a post graduate degreee. There are professors that have been on probation for failing too many students, yet they continue to teach.  If you are unlucky enough to have one of these professors your gpa will be RUINED while other WFU students who may take the same class with a different professor will be fine. Just remember you will need to compete with these people for graduate admissions.  Having the name of this US News top 30 university on your undergraduate diploma is NOT worth it. Graduate school admissions truly DO care about GPA (maybe a little about GRE, MCAT etc.) but where your undergrad degree comes from does not factor into the equation. All you will have to show for a four year degree from WFU is a lower GPA than students who were lucky in their professor selection or students who went to less challenging universities that curve and of course SIGNIFICANTLY less money. The campus is beautiful."
Freshman,2,"It is very easy to tell who is on scholarship and who isn't at Wake Forest. If you are on scholarship, like me, it is very easy to feel excluded. I love everything about Wake except for the social aspect. If I were to pick a college again, I'm not sure that I would choose Wake. They boast about their diversity, yet this is the most white privilege place I've ever been. "
College Freshman,2,"Athletics is the one part of Wake that is my least favorite. We lack school spirit when it comes to sports, and that stinks! That being said, intramural can be really fun if you have a good group of friends (greek or non-greek)!"
College Freshman,2,"Most of the kids here are conservative and are accepting of other races, religions, and sexual orientation.  No one cares what you are, but you will hear insensitive comments here and there, but nothing that you wouldn't hear from any other school and no one is outwardly screaming slurs at people."
Recent Alumnus,2,Greek life dominates the social atmosphere. Non-greeks and still go to the parties but the greeks never fail to make non greeks feel excluded. They have halls within the dorms reserved for the members of greek organizations so that they can live together but they organize their own off campus housing.
College Freshman,2,"Parties are pretty much the same thing at the same places with the same people. Greek life dominates the party scene, so usually there is either a frat lounge party or off campus house party every Friday and Saturday night. Some students also go out for what we call Wake Wednesday's, but honestly not that many people seem to go out on the weekdays.  If you're into this type of party, then Wake is great! However if you don't enjoy these frat parties, other parties are near impossible to find unless there is a Barn party going on, which you have to pay around $7 for. I personally don't consider Wake to be a party school because parties are hard to find on the weekdays. People study hardcore on the weekdays, and then party hardcore on the weekends. Work Forest life: work hard, play hard!"
College Junior,2,The newer dorms are nice. The older dorms are not as nice.
College Freshman,2,Greek and non-Greek tensions run high most of the time
College Freshman,2,I hate the freshman dorms. I am so cramped all of the time
College Freshman,2,student health is pretty packed all the time
College Freshman,2,"Very attractive, very preppy, very into appearances"
College Junior,2,"With costs of tuition going up each year it's pretty frustrating that Wake unilaterally lowers financial aid to most students every year.  What the most frustrating to me is that the 'magnolia scholars', the first generation college students are one of the extremely limited amount of students who get full rides to Wake, and other than that Wake isn't huge on ""merit"" based need"
College Sophomore,2,Literally almost no scholarships exist that aren't associated with financial aid.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Locals don't really like Wake Forest kids (not just WFU, but Winston-Salem State and college kids in general). Depending where you are in Winston-Salem, safety can be an issue, but Wake is very safe."
College Freshman,2,"There are barely any international students/minorities here. If you want to go to a mostly white Republican upper class school, this is the place."
College Sophomore,2,"This school is difficult. The nickname for this place is ""work forest"" because the workload is so heavy. I'm in the library most nights for hours doing just my homework for the next day, not to mention studying for tests. The grade deflation is rampant, with A's being nearly impossible to attain."
College Sophomore,2,"there is not much diversity on campus. Everyone seems to be well off, white, and republican. There is a lot of trouble for homosexual people to find acceptance, and people can be pretty hateful at times, but not always, obviously. It's just about finding your fit here, and there's a group for everyone."
College Junior,2,"You really need a car to get around Winston. Not a zip-car, not a public bus, and not a shuttle. You need your own car. However, once you procure a set of wheels, traffic is not too bad. The town is a little tricky to get around due to windy roads and scattered areas (there's a lot of good stuff, but it's not centralized). If you go out regularly though, you'll get the hang of it quickly."
College Sophomore,2,most of the minorities usually stick to themselves
College Sophomore,2,"Work Forest is not a joke. You have to work really hard, but when you apply for secondary education or a job, people will take that into consideration."
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman parking is way off campus, not enough parking on campus for upperclassmen, $50-100 parking fines if you're in the wrong spot."
College Junior,2,"The parking at Wake is average. It is very easy to complain about as the parking is undoubtedly limited. It is frustrating but it is important for all of us to remember that very few schools provide GOOD parking situations. We are thankfully mostly a walking campus, but having a car to go off campus is often difficult."
College Junior,2,They are all  pretty average. None of them are special or have any unique abilities.
College Junior,2,"They are alright. They do break down at times, and do not work."
College Junior,2,The university likes all parties to be on campus they built a party barn that organizations can rent out and throw huge parties on the weekends and during the week. They encourage fraternity parties to be on campus in their lounges to avoid disturbances in the Winston Salem area
College Sophomore,2,My parents have to pay quite a bit out of pocket. The money available is minimal. Less than 10% of the total cost.
College Sophomore,2,"Winston-Salem is okay, not great.  There really isn't much around.  Downtown is pretty small and there's a couple restaurants.  Hanes mall is nearby and is pretty nice, but there's not much fun around.  There's only one movie theatre that I know of.  For the most part, you'll stay on campus, and it's not too exciting."
College Sophomore,2,"Love it or hate it. I think 50-60% of the campus is Greek, and that has its pluses and minuses, like everything else. Rushing is a good way of finding group of like-minded people to hang out with. But if you aren't planning on going Greek at Wake, then you are going to have to work a lot harder to find friends, as once the rushing process starts, people start to stick to their fraternities and sororities. I'm independent, and there are times where I will look around the Pit or the Mag room and realize that I am the only person in the room not wearing letters. It's alienating at times, but Greek stuff is something you have to figure out on your own. "
College Senior,2,"OK Bars, Clubs Nearby – Downtown Winston-Salem has plenty of pubs and bars that are available to students that are 21 years of age or older. The bars, however, are pretty laid back and the dress code is casual. There are a couple of random things, like strip clubs, gay clubs and even a night club--but most people that are interested in those types of things usually go to Greensboro, which is about a 30 minute drive. Personally, I enjoyed Wake's nightlife because I don't like to drink heavily or dance a lot--however, if I wanted to go to a nightclub for a special occasion, there were lots of options, only 30 minutes away."
College Senior,2,The parking service employees are generally rude and there are limited spaces. Many students complain that they have even missed class due to the lack of available parking spaces.
College Freshman,2,Nice facilities. S****y people fill them. Snobbery leaks off the walls
Recent Alumnus,2,"Excluding the small group of scholarship students, the student body is not very diverse. The minority of people with a different race are from the same socio-economic background as all of the white students. Boringgggg."
College Freshman,2,"Pricey and Inconvenient for Freshman – Freshman are required to park off campus, and the permit is $300. You can bring your car on campus during the evenings and weekends, and there is a shuttle that runs between the lot and campus. Otherwise, it's about a 20 min. walk. I wouldn't say that a car is necessary, but campus can sometimes get stifling and it's nice to be able to get away. There are enough regional students that chances are, if you don't have a car, you'll know someone who does. I personally think that the permits and tickets are too expensive; a ticket can easily run $50. There are free off campus spots for commuter students. The on-campus permits for upperclassmen are $500."
College Freshman,2,My Taste Buds Are Dying. You will be sick of the 'pit' by the end of your first semester.  It is the only dinning hall on campus and it is very repetitious and bland.
College Freshman,2,"Not Much to Do – Winston-Salem, NC is a small city that doesn't really have much to offer. The city is basically empty after it gets dark, since there aren't really many attractions to bring students off-campus, other than the occasional parade or farmer's market. Winston-Salem does have some good restaurants that do deserve a visit, and there are a lot of different colleges in the area, such as Winston-Salem State, Salem College, and Forsyth Tech. Within an hour's drive are Duke and High Point, which are pretty fun schools to visit as well. However, unless you know people who go to these schools there isn't much of a reason to go to another campus. All in all, Winston-Salem is a boring city and most students stay on campus on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,It Truly Is as Homogeneous as They Say – I read a lot about the homogeneity at Wake Forest but it wasn't until I actually went to school that I noticed it. Coming from a very international environment it was a bit weird at first but the people are great and very friendly and I quickly adapted.
College Senior,2,"Hes Building – Old gym could use some improvement. The HES dept could use more space, and cleaner facilities. The outside of the building looks dead, why not put up something in our display case that looks to the road?"
College Junior,2,"Fairly Strict – The Wake campus can be pretty strict: parking tickets are frequent as are underage drinking tickets. The RAs themselves are not strict, but campus police is. If you get into legal trouble, get caught with a Fake ID, or break school policy, the administration can be extremely unforgiving."
Alum,1,"This is a pretty elitist place and not in a good way.  If you are from a lower-income family, statistics suggest you will not gain upward mobility here, as there are limited opportunities and they tend to be reserved for the cream of the crop.  

Career planning is minimal unless you're among the 25% who get into the B-school.  It can be difficult to register for the classes you need for graduation, making it necessary to cough up the money for summer school. 

Grade deflation is a serious problem here and although Wake loves to suggest that a 3.4 from Wake is the same as a 3.7 from other schools, this is simply not the case; be prepared to find yourself at risk for not being a viable applicant to graduate programs unless you were an academic superstar. 

At the end of the day, although Wake likes to project the image of being a wealthy school, their endowment is quite modest compared to similar schools and so amenities and resources are not as plentiful and tend to be rationed out."
Sophomore,1,"Absolutely a terrible school. If you are not apart of Greek life, there’s barely anything else to do. If you’re not an athlete or a part of Greek life, you are going to feel isolated and you are mostly going to have a hard time finding friends. Students work as hard as the ivies at Wake, despite not having the same name, prestige, or value as the ivies. Little to no diversity. Very white school with rich stuck-up kids. Housing is very expensive for horrible dorms with showers that usually have cold water. I personally attend Wake right now and I would not recommend this school to any of my friends."
Alum,1,"I graduated many years ago, before WF became ridiculously overpriced and filled with snobby, entitled elitists.  There is no way I would even consider going to WF today.  My first year's salary after graduation was 85% of my total 4-year cost to attend WF.  To match that return today, a person would have to earn more than $200,000 per year."
College Sophomore,1,Greek life for guys is surprisingly selective. Friends who you thought were friends after the first semester don't want to hang out with you if you're not in their fraternity. Greek life changes people.
College Freshman,1,"The university's policy for international students off-campus housing is absolutely nonsense. You cannot apply to move out unless you are at the end of your sixth semester and the dorm quality for lower class is unfair and too expensive at its value. Room space is quite limited. And, of course, you can hear noises like someone is running or yelling when you are about to sleep. It is almost a tradition for life in college dorms."
College Sophomore,1,"I moved here from KC. The food in Winston isn't up to par with the rest of the country. Also, there are various ""food desserts"""
College Junior,1,"I don't know much about the situation personally, but everyone is always complaining how tickets are given out for pretty much anything."
College Sophomore,1,there is very little financial aid offered to students here
College Junior,1,"Nightlife is kind of terrible if you're not Greek. Greek organizations have parties and mixers and date functions all the time, but they are often exclusive to that social organization. If you are in other non-Greek organizations, you can find house parties, which are fun if you know the people there. The downtown bars are bad, but not exactly geared towards college kids."
College Sophomore,1,The parking police basically live in the bushes... watch out
College Senior,1,Worst thing Wake Forest has to offer. Very expensive and limited. For underclassmen the parking lot is not even on campus.
College Senior,1,"Wake Forest advocates bullying. I'm a student with a disability, and I've been forced to drop several classes because another student has been harassing me, vandalizing my home, and assaulting me on campus and at campus events. I reported each instance to the school and they won't even give me a hearing or in away way act to make this bully stop. Just a week ago, this person posted online that I should kill myself. However, this student's family donates heavily to the university and so they have chosen to do nothing but ""speak"" to the student despite the ongoing harassment lasting over five months. If you like bullying your peers and having no consequences for your actions, I suggest applying here. "
College Junior,1,Parking at Wake is horrible if you are a freshman or sophomore. Put on your running shoes because you're going to go for a twenty to thirty minute walk to get to the lots. 
College Sophomore,1,"Literally my biggest complaint about campus.  Slow to get you in, and they can't diagnose anyone.  The amount of times they've messed up what people have should not even be legal"
College Freshman,1,We have to stay on campus three years now even though off campus housing is cheaper.
College Sophomore,1,"The people that run the parking are ridiculous.  They had freshman park off campus last year (which I was).  This year, when sophomores were supposed to be on campus, they told us we had to pay the same 300$ to park off campus again.  They also had the Freshmen this year park wayyy off campus down by the football field a few miles away.  There is a shuttle but the times are horribly inconvenient.  Not to mention they ""accidentally"" put quite a few sophomores in that freshman lot by the football field.  Also, they have 24/7 faculty lots that are completely empty friday-sunday.  Tickets for parking in the wrong spot at the wrong time, even for a few minutes are 50$."
College Sophomore,1,"The worst freshman dorm is clearly Johnson.  It's really old and run down and they're probably not going to fix it anytime soon.  South hall looks like a hotel and it's ridiculously nice.  However, the last two years it's been filled with the worst kind of partiers...
""The pit"" is our cafeteria and it's truly awful.  Every once in a while it's alright, but for example, the other day they served what we could swear was Chef Boyardee.  Sure enough, we saw an opened can of the stuff through one of the doors to the kitchen.  Benson is another food option with Moes, Chick Fil A, and Boars Head (burgers and sandwiches).  It's not bad, but it'll get old fast.  They're also currently expanding the subway. 

Campus is fairly nice to look at but there isn't much to do besides stay in your dorm.  The library is not bad for books and study, but forget taking your laptop.  There aren't more than a few plugs to go around.  

All in all, you'll feel pretty isolated."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is extremely superficial.  Every greek guy is exactly the same.  Polo shirt, croakies and sperry's...  They're always drunk wednesday through saturday.  It's really an awful part of the school.  No one will treat you badly for not being greek, but on the outside looking in, it's not appealing."
College Sophomore,1,"I have never had such difficulty with parking EVER. I paid $300 to get to park ON CAMPUS in the sophomore parking. These dumba**es issue too many parking passes to sophomores (probably on purpose because they're money-hungry bast**ds, even though they make plenty of money on tuition at $56k. And trust me, the tuition isn't worth it because they try to screw you everyway possible). I park RIGHT NEXT to the last parking spot available as many others have had to do, well out of the way (I even asked the shuttle driver if my spot was ok and he said it was fine).  I parked there rather than another lot because I learned last year that you'll get even higher fines for that. I get TWO citations because they didn't send me the email notifying me of the citation until the next day and by the time I was able to check my email and find that I needed to move my car, I had already received another one! I tried to appeal both. Both denied. Of you're thinking of coming here, go to your second choice unless you're not planning on driving anywhere and not bringing a car. If you're going here and you're thinking of bringing a car, DON'T.  They'll f**k you anyway they can."
College Junior,1,Most of the residence halls need renovating they are bug and pest infested. The housing selection process is a pain.

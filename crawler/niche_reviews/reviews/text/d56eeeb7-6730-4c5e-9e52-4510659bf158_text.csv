Alum,5,"I loved the small class sizes, leadership opportunities, clubs/organizations and Greek life! I participated in multiple clubs, joined a sorority, served as an orientation leader and group leader for our optional outdoor education based freshmen orientation at our environmental campus, Pine Lake."
Freshman,5,"I have has an amazing beginning to my career at Hartwick College. I have been provided many opportunities that I hadn't thought possible.  This includes being exposed to minors I did not know existed and am now firmly implanted into. I have also found internships local to the area in part to my professor's guidance. I have also found volunteer opportunities abroad that will assist me here at Hartwick with the Peace Corps Prep Program and eventually with my time in the Peace Corps. All of which is funded by Hartwicks amazing Emerson Scholarship which allows students to go abroad when they otherwise could not afford to do so and get credit for it. Alongside these opportunities, I have found myself to be connected with my professors on a level that I had not expected. Each of them has been deeply committed to my success but continues to push me. I have also been able to join a variety of volunteer and extra-curricular activities on campus."
Sophomore,5,"This college has given me the time to grow as a student. The college has a great program for nursing as you start clinical freshman year. They work you hard but in the end, you will be a great RN."
Sophomore,5,I love how small it is. Hartwick is a very personal community and it amazing because there is things for everyone there. everyone finds their own people and their own group and everyone comes together as a community. The staff cares about the students succeeding and everyone just wants everyone to grow. it is an amazing environment to be apart of
Alum,5,I loved my Hartwick experience BUT it took until the end of my sophomore year to adjust and really love being in Oneonta and at Hartwick. One ends their time at Hartwick after 4 years feeling attached and wanting more time there. I got a solid education there and one that gave me confidence in many areas including public speaking (seniors during my time at Hartwick were frequently expected to lead a class in their major area). Oneonta was a good place to become a responsible adult and learn independence and now it’s nicer and has more to offer than  during my time. The majority of my professors were awesome and I kept in touch with many of them for more than a few years after graduation.  Hartwick is a special place offering an excellent education and experience—just don’t expect it to happen overnight!
Freshman,5,"Throughout my application process, they made sure to stay in contact with me to answer any of the questions I might have had. They also made me feel as though I was important and that they truly cared for my success."
Freshman,5,"So far my experience with Hartwick has been amazing. Although I haven't actually attended this school yet (August 2019), the staffs have been extremely helpful! I sometimes feel annoying them questions every other day but they seem more than  happy to answer them."
Sophomore,5,The small size of the campus is nice because it promotes individuality. The professors are always willing to help.
Freshman,5,"Even before you start, your professors will get to know you.  Hartwick may be  small, but the opportunities to explore, grow and succeed are enormous!  Once I saw this campus and met the people, I was sold...excellent athletics and clubs too!"
Junior,5,"I loved being in a small, close- knit community at Hartwick College. The people are very friendly and there are lots of activities on and off campus for everyone to enjoy. The school has beautiful scenery and is located in the Catskill Mountains. The academics are great with a wide variety of fun classes for all to take."
Sophomore,5,"The dorms are extremely outdated, most of them look like tiny jail cells with all white walls and blue door. The science building is nice and has a great nursing lab and they just built another nursing lab, yet most of the other buildings need to be updated. Some of the rooms in one of the academic halls has mold in it. Some of the professors are really nice and really want you to pass and others do not care how their students do and don't care if they fail their students. Lots of hills on campus and could use some more elevators. The dinning hall food is always the same and gross."
Niche User,5,"Visited as a possible choice, the art department was excellent,  has a blown glass studio, small, ratio of students to teachers are impressive,  food was good. Offer vegan choices , alot of stairs, climbing, keeping you in shape, that's a good thing, security was impressive."
Freshman,5,Hartwick is such a great school! The academics are great for almost all majors. Psychology and Criminal justice are the weakest majors. The view is absolutely phenomenal and so worth it. The on-campus food is okay. It starts out good but since its the only dining hall it gets repetitive.
Freshman,5,Hartwick is a lovely campus with very accommodating staff members. The classes are great to be a part of and I have learned so much in such little time that I have spent there so far.
Alum,5,Hart wick professors are wonderful. They offer so many research opportunities for their students that it’s amazing that it’s only a College and not a research university!
College Junior,5,"As a member of a fraternity on campus; Greek Life at Wick has it's ups and downs. Most of the premier fraternities and sororities, such as Kappa Sigma, AOII, Phi Sig, Gamma Phi Delta and Tau Kappa Epsilon do countless philanthropic events each semester, hold high gpas and also throw great social events with a warm and welcoming atmosphere, though other groups that are unrecognized by the college, but still hold events of their are can be described as shady and drug-affiliated."
College Freshman,5,The professors here are one in a million- they really go out of their way to help you be successful.
College Freshman,5,Hartwick has fabulous professors - you get individualized instruction.
College Sophomore,5,I am currently rushing a sorority on campus
College Sophomore,5,"Campus saftety is amazing, however the health in the dorms isn't the best."
College Sophomore,5,I have loved all of my professors and they were all extremely helpful. They all look for ways to help you achieve your best and look out for your best interests. The class sizes are admirable and I enjoy the one on one capabilities.
College Sophomore,5,The degrees speak for themselves
College Sophomore,5,"I live in Oyaron house, even though it is far away from anything else I feel it is the best option for me. I love most of the people in the building and it is a nice quiet building to live in. I am in a double and enjoy my roommate's presence. The cost is a bit much but I still enjoy it."
College Sophomore,5,I personally am not part of Greek life but everyone I know in fraternities and sororities are very nice and do not look down on you for your choices.
College Sophomore,5,The Athletics at Hartwick work very hard and that definitely shows in their performance. Their success definitely shows.
College Sophomore,5,I have loved my time here at Hartwick and I am so glad I picked this school over any other one.
College Freshman,5,"I never feel unsafe walking around campus at night. Furthermore, I don't feel unsafe walking around Oneonta either. Generally speaking, it is a very safe community."
College Freshman,5,"Professors keep you on track and make sure you are not only knowledgable on the subject, but also knowledgable about where you stand as you progress through the course. The professors care. Their teaching style is very hands on and personal which is effective in learning. Finally, class sizes offer many benefits since they are small!"
College Freshman,5,Campus housing feels like family! Your floor is your family at Hartwick even including your RA.
College Junior,5,Always available and the best in their field!
College Sophomore,5,"I love living on campus! It's quiet, the RAs are really nice and caring. Everyone is respectful. The cleaning staff is friendly though the showers could use a better cleaning."
College Freshman,5,"There's a wide variety of majors available, and there's no extreme criteria for admission."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are good, and the registration process is incredibly easy. But, I wish I could have a heavier work load and have a greater opportunity of speeding up my studies."
College Freshman,5,"The food here is awesome to say the least, and the variety is even better!"
College Freshman,5,"The party scene is great! I'm not sure what goes on Mon-Thurs because I'm busy studying during those days, but the frat houses are just like the movies Friday through Sundays. Personally I think they should have a few more kegs at the frats than they do, but they suffice. There's a ton of options for partying. Numerous frats and sororities, both recognized, and un-recognized. The unrecognized frats throw some pretty crazy parties as well, and they're not super shady either.. Maybe just a little bit. You also have your bars and nightclubs downtown if you have a fake id or are of legal age. Dorm parties aren't super big, but the frats aren't more than a 15 minute walk so it's not a big deal anyways. When it comes to parties, Hartwick could easily compete with some of the larger schools. It seems to be kept pretty low key, but it's super easy to find  ton of parties every weekend. Hartwick is an unsung hero of the party scene in college"
College Freshman,5,"Oneonta is a small city, but it's a nice one.. It'd be really chill if there was a mall nearby, but the best Oneonta has is southside, and that's just your basic plaza with a movie theatre. There's a lot of places to eat downtown. Multiple pizzerias, a deli, Chinese place, etc.. I guess the people of Oneonta like the students, but I think a lot of kids piss off the locals by defacing property and throwing solo cups all over the place. I'm not preaching against partying, in fact I'm out every Friday and Saturday night having a good time, but that's no reason to be a jerk to the townsfolk. There's not really any sports teams nearby.. There's the baseball hall of fame in nearby cooperstown, but that's a waste of time unless you're really into baseball history. The cops drive around a lot, especially on the weekends, but they're pretty chill too. I've seen kids get arrested, but you'd have to be pretty belligerent to make the cops do anything. I've stumbled back to campus a few times, and the police have never said anything to me."
College Freshman,5,"There are a lot of decent eateries in the distance. It's a bit of a walk, but worth it! Sal's Pizza, Domino's, Oneonta Hot's, and Nino's are pretty much open all night, so there's a decent variety of places to eat if you're hungry at night, or want a bite to eat before heading back to Wick after going to a party. During the day there's more of a variety in restaurants, including a Chinese food spot, deli, and some others. The prices aren't too bad. A little more than I'm used to in PA, but I don't mind an extra dollar or two here and there."
College Freshman,5,"The Greeks are super-friendly. I've had an incident where I drank too much, and they literally picked me up drove me to my hall, and carried me back to dorm room, an it was my first night at that particular frat, so it was huge that they were so concerned with my safety, because I was in really bad shape, and they easily could've tossed me aside, and in that case I may not even be alive to write this right now. But every fraternity I've been to has been extremely nice, I've been treated very well at all of the houses I've been to. They're really all stand-ups guys."
College Junior,5,I feel no fear while on campus
College Sophomore,5,"Hartwick has given me so much scholarship money, and I am currently working with a faculty member on getting more assistant; everyone is super helpful."
College Sophomore,5,"It is hard to be a minority on campus, and most everyone is very supportive of the personal beliefs and choices of others. "
College Junior,5,Student life is from the students. We don't have a student union. We have multiple study spots available. We are such a small campus that the students create their own buzz and social atmosphere. 
College Senior,5,"Greek Life is highly regarded at Hartwick.  It isn't the only social sphere, but those involved in Greek Life are professional individuals with respectable morals and admirable characteristics."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm an Anthropology major, and Hartwick has a great program that I've really taken to. The department is small, but with a good group of professors who are all passionate about their work, anything can happen. A large variety of courses are offered considering the small size of the major, and non-majors help contribute to enthusiasm over the department. The close knit community fosters growth in the Anthropology field, and networking is very possible. The active Anthropology club gives us a voice on campus, and involvement with international organizations is common. The Yager Museum provides a plethora of archival artifacts, and the Pine Lake Field School gives an opportunity for Archaeology specialists to get experience."
College Junior,5,"The campus life is incredible - there's a multitude of campus resources ranging from study abroad, internships, volunteering, clinical experience and a variety of other departments that will help you succeed outside of the classroom."
College Freshman,5,Everything You Need – Hartwick has a building or room for just about anything you could need.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are caring and helpful. The academic standards are high and a lot is expected of the students, but there are many ways to get help and improve their grades."
College Freshman,5,"I Love the Nursing Program. I love the nursing program. It is difficult, but very informative. There are a lot of experiential classes and we are exposed early in the program to clinical experiences."
College Sophomore,5,"the spirit here is amazing. sports games as well as plays and dance recitals bring everyone out to support other students. the programming at hartwick is also amazing. not every program is interesting to you specifically, but there are always at least 7 or 8 a semester that are and you want to go to them. most students manage their course work (many are double majors) and also spent lots of time being involved on campus. pretty much every student is in at least one club or on a sports team."
College Sophomore,5,the professors care about the students and often involve them in their own research. they teach with passion and enthusiasum! the biggest classes at hartwick are the general intro classes that basically everyone need and those are always between 60 and 80 students. I hardly ever see classes over 30 students. hartwick also has a J-Term which is the month of january to spend however you like. students are not required to be in school that month but most take one or two courses for the month. The majority of students spend at least one of their J-terms abroad through one of the 30 programs to study off-campus.
College Freshman,5,Hartwick College has a range of parties both on campus and off campus. It has a regular program through the residential life which allows students to fell not overwhelmed. Party houses from sorority and clubs makes weekend better too
College Freshman,5,Parking lots are spacious and allowed in most of places
College Freshman,5,There are a wide variety of athletics offered. A majority of the students are involved in some way. There is great campus spirit at games and lots of fans cheer at home games.
College Freshman,5,The computers in the labs are easily accessible. The printers always have paper. There is excellent network reliability and the labs are always open for students.
College Freshman,5,I do not know a lot about the Greek life at my school. I do not think the Greek life affects the social atmosphere on campus negatively. Greek students are viewed by non-Greeks in an amiable way. I do not believe there are special Greek housing available.
College Sophomore,5,"There are very few on campus crimes that I have seen or heard of.  Campus safety patrols and after a year at Hartwick I have gotten to know a few of them by name.  There are blue safety poles if you are ever alone and need to call help and we were also provided the number of campus safety our first week at school.  Other than that, Hartwick is a place you could leave your laptop in the library without much worry your items will be taken."
College Freshman,5,Very Safe – I haven't ever had a problem with safety on campus.  Security is always checking on things and we have multiple blue lights across campus.
College Sophomore,5,Our J-Term program is a very unique opportunity. Students have the opportunity to study abroad or study on campus and concentrate on one subject for an intensive month. The study abroad programs are absolutely amazing!
Recent Alumnus,5,"Friendly Place to Be – There's every type of person here at Hartwick. Everyone accepts everyone. Obviously you have the random unaccepting person here or there, but it is seldom. 
  Orchesis (dance concert), clubs, and a slew of events, showcases the array of both ethinic, racial diversity, and sexual orientation. 
  Everyone is accepted for who they are here. Period"
College Freshman,5,General Campus Aesthetics – The campus is absolutely beautiful. The views from the campus are beautiful and the actual campus rivals those views on beauty. It is very well maintained and it just very pleasing to look at.
Sophomore,4,"Hartwick is a very diverse campus. Facilities are everywhere, which can make it a little confusing to navigate if you don't already know where you're going, but the students and faculty are incredibly helpful in guiding you to where you need to be."
Freshman,4,"Love Hartwick and the people I have meet there. Although the food becomes predictable and blend after a while. You will never get tried of looking at the view of the mountains. As far as academic the professor do care about the students and you will be learning a lot. They have a very unique set of core classes that all student must take which includes taking a physical education class, which have been one of my favorite class so far."
Alum,4,"Hartwick is set in a beautiful scenery of the hills in the country on New York. The campus laid across multiple hills with plenty of stairs to climb. A large majority of students participate in sports. Hartwick has a strong nursing program with a large group of faculty to support you. They have multiple program options. They had a traditional 4 year, a 3 year and 18 month programs offered. Hartwick has multiple students that come from different countries to create a diverse population."
Sophomore,4,Hartwick college is a place that provides you with the opportunity to cultivate the life you want. Things are not handed to you instead they are presented and it takes knowing yourself to master the ways of the college. The students are awesome and are from all walks of life. You will most likely meet plenty of people just like yourself and unite to build the future you want.
Sophomore,4,The campus is gorgeous. There is always something to do. Faculty are super supportive. Overall an awesome school
Alum,4,"I liked that Hartwick was very small, and was a close-knit community. Classes were small, usually no more than 20-25 students per class. Since the class size was so small, you were able to get to know your professors very well. I liked the liberal arts aspect. Since Hartwick College is a liberal arts school, you got the chance to explore all different types of studies and classes. I wish Hartwick had better food options. Many times the food wasn't very healthy."
Senior,4,"Hartwick college has by far one of the best nursing programs in the area. It is a 4 year bachelors degree that really focuses on nursing for all four years you attend the school. the classes are small giving the student more opportunity to interact and obtain help from professors. The politics of the school are becoming complicated, but the nursing professors do not let that get in the way of teaching the next generation of nurses."
Niche User,4,"After a visit, I was instantly sold. The recent renovations to the campus are very captivating and the staff treat you like family."
Niche User,4,The tour was satisfying. I enjoyed the environment and the staff and students were very nice. The only minor issue was the dorm size but everything else is beyond amazing! I cannot wait to start my fall term!
Freshman,4,"Hartwick wasn't my top choice, but I am glad I'm here. It was many things that I wanted in a school: small, not too far from home, and had a traditional college atmosphere with brick buildings and ivy. I worried about wanting to transfer, but I feel like I belong here. But I found people like me.

Wilder is a wonderful dorm, in the perfect location, has nice size rooms, decent bathrooms, and lounges on every floor. I really got a good dorm. Hilltop and Oyaron are far away from the rest of campus.

If you do want to get off of campus, there are nightly buses that can take you downtown or to the ""mall"" on the other side of Oneonta to Walmart or wherever, for free.

All my professors are wonderful and very passionate about teaching.I would say Intro to Chemistry is my largest class, in the ""big lecture hall"" in Johnstone, with about 30-40 people."
Sophomore,4,Its a very comfy little school. It has a beautiful campus and great programming. Not a huge school but big enough that you won't know every single person. Food is decent and there are lots of local places within walking distance that are affordable. Great study abroad programs whether you want to go for a year or just a month. Also great financial aid offered to a majority of the students.
Freshman,4,"Just finished my first semester as a freshman and I have to say I had a pretty decent year. I did not think I would like Hartwick due to it's smallness, what lack of diversity, and it's location. I was wrong about a lot of those factors. I made a lot of great friends, went out, partied, participated in a lot of clubs, and more. The professors are cool. The campus is beautiful despite it's smallness, but that's what makes it a close knit community. Much to my surprise, I'm already ready to go back to school."
College Junior,4,"I have had the opportunity to tour multiple campuses, but I do not feel as though there is another school out there like Hartwick. I've had many complaints about the financial aid office, but the student body and professors more than make up for it."
College Freshman,4,Hartwick has been a safe campus as far as I know. I feel very comfortable here.
College Freshman,4,Hartwick really tries to get students out in their career choice.
College Freshman,4,Campus Safety is always roaming around making sure everyone is alright.  They come to the rescue in a time of need.
College Freshman,4,The PSGE center offers so many opportunities and help for finding internships or just figuring out what path you want to take.
College Freshman,4,"I lucked out in terms of housing-great roommate, great surroundings, etc.  Although it's a little far away from may other areas I enjoy it a lot."
College Freshman,4,I try to attend as many sporting events as possible (mostly because I have friends on many teams and it's nice to be involved and support).  There is almost always a huge crowd out to support the teams (even when the weather isn't so great).
College Junior,4,This campus is safe when it comes to assault or crime. There are little to no huge incidents where to whole student bpdy should be concerned.
College Junior,4,"Classes here are fairly average with some being better than others, also due to the professor teaching them. Class sizes are ideal not too large where you aren't considered a number and people can get to know you and be heard with your thoughts and questions."
College Junior,4,The alumni network is pretty good here. Many students have made connections with alumni and have been able to find jobs in the field they wish to pursue. Also with he help from the career services and professors can help find where the ideal place you want to go to.
College Junior,4,Being an athlete myself I find that the athletics at our school are very involved and have pretty good facilities to use. Some fan support lacks for certain teams but the school spirit is there.
College Junior,4,My overall experience has been great. I have found my passion of what I want to do with my life and able to be involved as much as possible as well.
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors really took pride in what they taught and wanted their students to do their best. They were always there to help their students when needed. There were always a broad list of classes available to students on a first come first serve basis.
Recent Alumnus,4,Hartwick College is a safe college campus. Campus security drives around campus regularly and is accessable whenever needed.The campus is small so walking around at night you never had to go far by yourself.
Recent Alumnus,4,Hartwick College is a small school. The class sizes are small so the professors get to know each of their students very well. Professors expect students to show up to classes. One of my favorite classes I took at Hartwick was clinical psychology where I learned about multiple mental health illnesses and treatments. I would choose Hartwick again because of the great education I received.
Recent Alumnus,4,Hartwick College has many sports for students to become involved in. Hartwick is known for their girl's water polo team and their men's soccer team. Many students at Hartwick are involved in a sport. There is alot of fan support and school spirit. Many students enjoy attending games during the week and weekends.
College Sophomore,4,everything that is offered is open to everyone
College Sophomore,4,so far its been really great
College Sophomore,4,this school is great! I love the small family atmosphere. Everyone knows each other and it is really wonderful
College Freshman,4,"If you want it, it's here."
College Freshman,4,Anything you want is basically available to you at Hartwick!
College Freshman,4,"It's very similar to high school. It's great though, very beautiful."
College Junior,4,Always feel safe no matter what time it is on campus. Campus safety is all over campus at all hours of the night.
College Junior,4,Career opportunities are expressed through the experience of each professional on campus. Each professor goes out of their to help each student like myself.
College Junior,4,All the Greek activities around campus are fun and most of my friends are either in a frat or faturnity and I am not. It makes it that much better that Greek life doesn't just seclude themselves to their own sisters or brothers but also campus as a whole.
College Junior,4,"Always look forward to attending all sports events, such a great way of bringing everyone together. Supporting friends and teams as a whole help them get win after win."
College Junior,4,The resources Hartwick make available made Hartwick one of my top choices. After being here 3 years all the tutors and review classes have grown and each and everyone of them have helped me excell in all my classes. The stairs are sometimes a killer but they are good to keep in shape and burn off all the food we eat when being stressed. If I had to do it all over again I would absolutely choose Hartwick I've made great friendships and grew as a person and enjoy the Nursing major I am pursuing.
College Student,4,I really love it here the people are great and the teachers are so helpful.
College Freshman,4,It is a very small school so you get lots of personal attention. They are also very hands on
College Junior,4,"When I'm at school, I feel like I'm at home. I'm free to be whoever I want to be. Although it's a small school, and drama is easy to find, I've managed to keep my social life in order. School work always comes first."
College Sophomore,4,"The classes are small so the professors are able to get to know the students. It's a safe-feeling environment and has a great view. There are also many opportunities for activities such as out of state trips and studying abroad during J-term, a unique mini semester at Hartwick during the month of January. Another plus is the extensive list of clubs students are able to join, including one that involves raising and training seeing eye dogs. The only down side is the cost of tuition and I do wish I had attended community college before jumping right in."
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of small places to eat. Great local pizza places. Great deli's and Brookes BBQ is a must.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus safety is very nice, they can be grumpy but they're human. Noise complaints are handled promptly and the administration is usually very good."
College Sophomore,4,From what I can tell there are a lot of options and I hear a lot of them are haunted. I prefer on-campus housing
College Sophomore,4,I don't know much about the party scene but if there is nothing going on at the townhouses but SUNY Oneonta always has parties going on.
College Sophomore,4,"Most of my experience has been over email, they are kind but they do take a while to respond sometimes.

Tip: Be polite and patient. Know that they want to help you, they truly do but sometimes their hands are tied. Be kind and thankful."
College Sophomore,4,"Personally, I usually enjoy the commons. Some nights there aren't a lot of meat options though and some times the meat there is available isn't cooked all the way. Table rock is definitely great though."
College Freshman,4,Most places deliver which is great.
College Freshman,4,I got what I expected but would have liked more
College Freshman,4,Everybody loves the sports teams at Hartwick -- it's all people seem to talk about after frat parties.
College Freshman,4,"Its a division three school for everything but womans water polo and mens soccor, which are division one, but 75% of campus is involved in a sport"
College Freshman,4,"The girls are okay! The pretty girls outweigh the ugly ones by a decent margin, but there's still some pretty ugly chicks on campus. Way more girls on campus, so that's a plus too. A decent portion of the girls are also into athletics, so if you're into girls like that, this is a good place to go. There's not a ton of relationships on campus, mostly just random hook-ups, which has it's downside if you're actually just looking for one special girl.."
College Freshman,4,"I think that the administration is pretty fair socially! I was in a dorm after a party the one night, and campus security was pretty angry, because we were being pretty loud, but they were respectful about it. They don't really care too much if you drink here. I've had a few beers in my dorm room before, but drugs are pretty frowned upon. A lot of kids smoke weed in their dorms and I haven't heard about any busts or anything like that, though they make it clear that drugs aren't really tolerated. I've had girls overnight in my room before, and the admins don't seem to mind.. You're supposed to fill out a sheet so they know whos there overnight, but they don't really care to be honest. We're highly encouraged to get out and start new clubs if you're not seeing anything you like, which is really cool! Attendance is relatively strict. Can't miss more than three days a semester without a special reason, which is hard during cold and flu season."
College Freshman,4,"I love the campus, Hartwick overlooks the city on Oneonta, and it looks beautiful at anytime of day pretty much! The gym is pretty nice, I preferred my high schools, and the staff could be better with teaching people who don't know how to use the machines. I find myself teacher kids how to use machines and do certain exercises more than the staff. The library is pretty expansive! Haven't used it much yet, but they're super-helpful. The parties are mostly off-campus, but just a little walk a way, or like a 5 minute drive, and they're pretty awesome! The staff at hartwick also tries to organize a lot of campus activities for students who aren't into partying, so that's good too!"
College Freshman,4,"It was decent. I applied pretty late, so I didn't exactly get a ton of cash, but that's more my fault than the schools..."
College Junior,4,"I honestly think that Hartwick has a lot to offer. Although, I do wish they could offer more courses because the student population is growing and it's very difficult to get into courses every semester."
College Junior,4,"I absolutely love being a sociology major so far. The professors are great and really want to work with their students. I used to be psychology, but it's too difficult and some professors depend too much on their TAs."
College Junior,4,Hartwick students and faculty take sexual assault very seriously and are very strict with enforcing policies to keep everyone safe.
Alum,2,"Online classes at Hartwick College depend on what professor you have. The school doesn't outline for professors what they should and should not expect, leading to some classes being very manageable and some being an absolute mess. If you are coming to Hartwick and they move to online, save yourself the money and go to a SUNY. You will get more resources, more help, pay WAY less money, and have more class options."
College Junior,2,"There have been a few instances of vandalism and petty theft on campus, but for the majority of the time, crime is non-existent. The police rarely make arrests in the case of alcohol-related incidents(they're more likely to get you home safe than give you a citation). Though they seldom get involved, police have been known to raid unrecognized fraternity parties."
College Junior,2,"Their is very little space in many of the dorm buildings, some of the dorms are quite the walk, which takes some getting used to when it's winter and constantly below zero or snowing, some of the bathrooms are ABSOLUTELY disgusting, though it's not necessarily due to the cleaning staff, which work hard each and every day to keep the bathrooms clean, it's more due to ignorant students who refuse to clean up after themselves in the slightest and leave food to rot everywhere and anywhere."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Greek life is very big at Hartwick College. Many non-Greek students at Hartwick view Greek students to be very snobby, throw multiple parties during the week and weekends, and be very involved in greek life. Many Greek students live in houses off campus once they are sophmores."
College Sophomore,2,everyone smokes and everyone drinks
College Junior,2,"Never had a great experience since being at Hartwick. Housing selection is horrible always dread it, they never make it easy and timing is horrible. Cleanliness is low, could be better, bottom line the buildings need to be updated. Have been without heat, hot water, electronic keys, washer and dryers in the past few years. Spending too much to have things break and be out for a while in a building"
College Junior,2,"I think that Hartwick si very generous with scholarships, but they don't even cover half of what you have to pay to attend here. It's difficult to get money for housing and outside of what they initially give you. As a junior I'm struggling to get more aid just to stay in school ."
College Junior,2,"Off-campus housing is too expensive for what it's actually worth. The nice apartments are really expensive and the ""okay"" ones are usually gross. There's no way you can afford to live in one without two or three roommates."
College Sophomore,2,It is too small of a town.
College Sophomore,2,"The WiFi is very unreliable, especially in the dorm rooms. An EtherNet cable is a must if you plan on doing anything on the internet. And you have to pay for printing after a certain quota is met, which is met fast in my current major."
College Freshman,2,The bus on campus only runs in the evening in half hour intervals.
College Freshman,2,They are trying to improve the WiFi but there is still a long way to go.
College Freshman,2,"There is so rarely hot water and heat which is horrible considering how cold it gets here. I have done homework in my room wearing a wool hat, mittens, thick socks, and my winter coat."
College Freshman,2,"They claim to be an international and diverse school, but there are a lot of white people."
College Sophomore,2,ITS PRETTY AWFUL! THE GUYS ARE BLECH
College Sophomore,2,The OPT only comes nights Tues-Sat. The driver is sketchy
College Sophomore,2,Not very much. Mostly white people.
College Freshman,2,"The school is expensive, even with the scholarship I received and I do not believe I got enough funding for my family's financial situation."
College Freshman,2,"Hartwick College is a safe environment, however, the city of Oneonta is a hot drug spot and is pretty sketchy."
College Sophomore,2,The sun hardly ever shines and it feels like winter never ends.
Alum,1,"Horrible. That is Hartwick. Students attending the other college in town refer to Hartwick as ""Hartwick High School"". The students quickly form cliques, and treat each other horribly. 

The actual professors are wonderful, and the education is first rate. The problem comes when the administration staff become involved. The Campus Safety are all retired cops, and take a perverse pleasure in tormenting and harassing students. 

The town of Oneonta is designed to fleece the students of every penny possible. 

This is a D3 school, don't go here for sports. 

Food is good. But the serving staff will aggressively enforce their policy of not allowing students to take food from the cafeteria (I was chased around the cafeteria). when this was reported, no action was taken against the staff member in question. 

This 'college' is only a place to go if you can afford a lawyer, for when the administration staff drag you into their infamous kangaroo court."
Alum,1,"Online learning was not offered when I was a student. Online or not, this is not a college to attend, as the administrators often pull dirty tricks to threaten and coerce students. 

Campus Safety are the worst offenders. They will follow students around, force students to be interrogated by their head of campus safety (a EX-cop). Campus Safety officers will force students into college vehicles, and parade the student around the campus. 

Forget reporting the Campus Safety 'officers' to the local Police or DA's office. The local DA and police protect the Campus Safety 'officers' as they are all ex-cops.

Do not attend this college. Your money and time are better spent elsewhere."
Sophomore,1,"Administration is an absolute joke- they have a very difficult time communicating messages between departments and they make a lot of errors all around. I have been told on two separate occasions from the Dean of Academic Affairs that at Hartwick ""you pay for credits, not for an education"" which is vastly disappointing considering this college costs over $60,000 a year. The college itself is falling apart from the inside out and I do not think that anybody should waste their money here. Many of the faculty flat out lies to you for their personal advantage and it is a shame what this school has become."
Sophomore,1,Everyone who goes here hates it. Most transfer during or after freshman year. Parking sucks. If you don't like to drink you will have nothing to do here. Better off going somewheres else. Nursing is awful. Professors are verbally abusive to students. Administration does not care as long as they get paid
Freshman,1,"This school has zero sense of happiness and school spirit. Everyone around you looks depressed and spends all their time inside their dorm rooms. It feels like an absolute prison.
The social life may be the only thing that I can attest for, there's a handful of bars for kids to go to and they're lenient with fakes. Legends is the Hartwick bar and gets old quickly. Greek life at Hartwick is also an absolute joke, got a bid to a fraternity going to one rush event without even trying and had kids stalking/harassing me to join (I didn't). But the parties here are all just high school parties all over again. Academics? A joke. Also if you're thinking of transferring out DO IT ASAP,  a lot of credits at this school will not transfer to many schools (my situation). 

I was a very active kid (played soccer, went out a lot, had good friends) and I feel embarrassed to say that I went to Hartwick. It's a dying school. Don't send your kid here if you don't want him/her to be depressed."
Niche User,1,"Nobody is happy on campus. The 'welcoming of all religions' prayer center is small as all hell. Bullying started. Staff did nothing. Made several complaints only to be ignored
Video about Holocaust (GF grew up Jewish, is a history buff) reported and removed by Security.
Staff is known to harasses students on Social.
Got suspended for exposing. Rushed off Campus. Took a bus home, spent night in motel.
Can't sue, Hartwick immune due to laws on Private schools.

If you value  your future and your mental health, stay away!"
College Sophomore,1,No help for my major
College Sophomore,1,I was kicked out by the housing when my roommate broke my things and accused me of being mean.
College Sophomore,1,The school made bad executive decisions about my life there that when the dean found out was speechless about when I informed him when I decided to transfer.
College Freshman,1,"The social atmosphere here is terrible. Adults in college call a section of the dining hall the ""loser section"". Many people here have terrible attitudes and are very mean. Its very cliquey, feels like early high school. Too small"
College Sophomore,1,We aren't allowed to live off campus for the most part unless we are commuters. We have the option to enter a lottery during junior year
College Sophomore,1,"While Oneonta is not very far upstate, the weather begs to differ.  Most of the winter, the campus is covered in snow, and although they do a good job plowing, it seems the weather is relentless, and ice is a real risk, considering the school is a haven for stairs. Literally, they're everywhere.  During the Autumn, it's quite gorgeous for a few weeks, however the rest of the time its rather dreary. The same goes for Spring, rain and clouds seem to be the two most common forecasts for Oneonta."
College Junior,1,"The housing is definitely not good enough for what you pay for it. The atmosphere is usually good, but that is because the people here are great. But as for size and cleanliness, it's a failing grade."
College Junior,1,The wifi is incredibly slow if you are even able to connect. Computer labs are always available and printing is cheap but when it comes to using your own laptop it's hard.
College Freshman,1,"There is one dining commons and its quite bad . There is little variety and the food is not the best. Be prepared to cook, order or buy food elsewhere,=."
College Freshman,1,"At first, it's amazing. You are stunned by the food and the options..... but once the second week of school comes along, you're already bored. You try to avoid it all costs."
College Freshman,1,"Signing up for a major was easy but it was taking classes for that major that is a pain. 
Hartwick College is a liberal arts school, they make you take a class on EVERYTHING!!!!! No joke. 
I'm a double major in Biological Sciences and Math with a minor in Spanish. They had me in classes like Geology(learning about rocks)... which served no use to me.
If you're undecided, COME HERE! They'll help you out. If you've decided what you want to do in your mind(like me), RUN!!!!!!!!!!"
College Freshman,1,"I come from California so I might be biased in my grade. However, it is either hot and sticky or cold and teeth-chattering. The weather is one reason that I am going back to California. 
It is a pain climbing up the thousand flights of stairs while its hailing or raining."
College Senior,1,"The parking is terrible. The department of vehicle registration gives out more parking passes per dorm than there are spots; the way they get away with this is ""overflow"" parking lots which are located on the opposite side of campus: This is not very convenient. The parking passes cost $50/year. Since the parking is horrid, tickets are not a rare occasion and can range from $20-$100."
College Freshman,1,The computers in the library are almost always used. Thankfully there are also computer labs in other buildings that are usually empty.  The internet/wifi here absolutely sucks! There was a weekend where there was NO internet at all!  You NEED an ethernet cable.  Even with that there are issues. Skype has a hard time working here so keeping in touch with people back home is difficult.

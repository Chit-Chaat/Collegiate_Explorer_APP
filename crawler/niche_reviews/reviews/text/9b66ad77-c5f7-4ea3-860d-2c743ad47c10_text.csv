Alum,5,"Enjoyed online learning. Prefer in person, but in these challenging times on-campus not always possible. University has been excellent with online learning experience. It is obvious that faculty have taken great steps to make on- experience inviting and challenging."
Alum,5,"Outstanding collegiate experience. Academics are rigorous. TCU changed my life as I also enjoyed a long career working there. TCU allows you to be part of the “Purple Family” long after graduation. I have found the TCU student body to be “winners” in life. They come from many places,  but have a competitive drive and a passion to succeed. This Spring, 2021, our family and extended family will possess 11 TCU degrees. TCU is forever!"
Niche User,5,"I’m just applying because I am a senior in high school but I have seen the programs that they have and they look really good and I look forward to hopefully going there in the fall next year. I chose Texas Christian University, because they have there priorities straight and they have been very supportive and helpful to me while applying."
Niche User,5,I like how helpful the staff has been to me when applying. They give great advice and tell you ahead of time what you need to get ready. Texas Christian University is a very good college to me because they are so encouraging and want you to do great.
Junior,5,The switch to online learning was pretty sudden but all of my professors did a wonderful job of adapting and helping us adapt to our new way of learning.
Alum,5,"I did not take any online courses during my time here but they are requiring me to write something here. I've heard that the online courses are great, though."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my time here and I highly recommend it if you can afford it/get a good scholarship. If I had to go though college again, I would choose TCU again."
Alum,5,I have not taken online classes at TCU but they have done a great job at adapting under the current circumstances.
Alum,5,"Tcu was a great school to attend! Top notch professors, beautiful facilities, and great sports! The campus is gorgeous and they really prepared me for my future career. :)"
Junior,5,"TCU I feel tries their hardest to get the students involved on campus, by either going to concerts or sports games, or by being involved in clubs or Greek life. They recognize college isn't just about academics, it is also about making connections with others and evolving as a young adult. Although academics are taken seriously at TCU. I chose TCU over SMU due to TCU having the fast-track MAc Program where I will only need to take an additional year of schooling after I earn my bachelor's to get my master's and prep needed to take the CPA exam. Specifically for the Neeley School of Business, they make sure to prepare their students for life after college by providing them with the resources and experience needed to excel in the work force. The student body and faculty overall are friendly with each other and it isn't hard to make a new friend everyday. I am looking forward to the remaining time I have on campus."
Junior,5,TCU is such a welcoming home to all. I fell in love instantly the second I stepped foot on campus. It is overall a well-rounded school with professors that are willing to go out of their way to help their students.
Junior,5,Faculty helped provide students with a smooth transition to online courses. They were very flexible for those in different time zones. We were still able to meet with professors one-on-one via Zoom for office hours.
Alum,5,There are no online learning experiences because all classes are in-person.  All work that is done online is easy to manage and has a classroom element to it.
Alum,5,"You are likely to have a great overall experience at TCU.  Life isn't just about academics, athletics, or the endowment.  TCU is about getting the most out of your college experience and preparing you for a life after graduation in the ""real-world"" where people won't always look, act, think, or speak like you.  You will be a better overall person after your time at TCU if you take the time to get involved with some of the community groups available on campus."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed my first year at TCU, it's an amazing school with a great sense of community. The faculty and students are awesome and TCU does a great job of making you feel at home. Furthermore, the campus is beautiful and the local restaurants are nice. Although it may seem like a big school, it still feels small at heart."
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID-19 I had to take my classes online, but I'm happy to say TCU made the transition super easy!"
Junior,5,"TCU is the best school in the area. They are committed to educating their students on a personal level in order to make a global impact. It is a small, family feel with enough students on campus to make it feel ""big"". Purple works for everyone too."
Junior,5,"During COVID, TCU transitioned to online classes smoothly. They offered so many resources old and updated to assist students. Teachers were always willing to go above and beyond for students."
Sophomore,5,TCU is an amazing place. The community and atmosphere are very welcoming. There are always events happening on or near campus. The professors are so supportive and want the absolute best for each student. The school spirit is unmatched. It is quite an unforgettable experience.
Sophomore,5,"My online classes were very manageable. Each professor was very flexible and worked with the students. They took the students suggestions very seriously and listened to us. They continued to teach at a good pace and kept in touch with us. We often had a zoom class at least once a week, some classes did two or three meetings depending on the needs."
Sophomore,5,"TCU is by far the best college you could choose. From student involvement to ability to get a job, TCU has it all. There are so many opportunities for students to be involved in campus whether it be in our 150+ clubs on campus or in any of our TCU student run organizations. TCU also has a 90% chance of students receiving a job within six months of graduation and that number jumps to 96% after a year. TCU has an amazing community that allows students to feel like they always have something to do. The 800 events held on campus over the course of the year allow students to connect and meet new people. The restaurants on and off campus are all amazing and Fort Worth offers amazing food options and things to do all within a 15 minute drive! Whether you decide to go hang out at Sundance Square or go line dancing at Billy Bob’s your nights will always be filled with friends and fun! Choose TCU and become a horned frog!"
Sophomore,5,TCU is incredible in just about every field imaginable. The resources available to students are seemingly never-ending and the staff is great at ensuring students have everything they need to be comfortable and successful. The culture on campus is astounding and its difficult not to make friends and fall in love with the university.
Sophomore,5,Texas Christian University is a great four-year institution that allows individuals to fulfill their potential and discover their passions to becoming well rounded individuals.
Junior,5,"I love TCU, I am having a wonderful experience there, the academics and professors are amazing and I love what I study. In addition, the facilities and resources are wonderful and extremely helpful and living on campus is a great experience."
Freshman,5,"I love going to school at Texas Christian University. It is the perfect size; not too small, but just big enough so that you always have the opportunity to meet new people. The campus itself is not very big, which makes it very easy to walk around and get from class to class or even from class to dorm.  In my opinion, I think TCU attracts the nicest and most genuine people and that is exactly who I ant to be surrounded by for the next 4 years of school."
Senior,5,"I love the small-occupany classrooms because I am able to build a better relationship with my professor, and my professor is able to help me more 1 on 1. I love all my professors I’ve ever had and I cannot say a bad thing about any of them. The campus is always clean and well kept up with."
Freshman,5,"When I visited TCU and made my decision to attend there in the fall I immediately felt like I was at home. The admission process was very easy, the tour was great and very informative and I cannot wait to spend my next four years there."
Freshman,5,"From the application process to my first tour on campus, Texas Christian University has been wonderful!! I have no complaints other than trying to diversify the campus:)"
Niche User,5,Texas Christian University is a very good school and it's really good for medical majors and they have people there to always support you when you are in need.
Senior,5,TCU is one of the friendliest campuses. The class sizes are smaller so you really get to know your professor and they get to know you. There's plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus. Being located in Fort Worth brings plenty of fun. There's lots of restaurants and shopping to help relieve any stress.
Junior,5,"TCU has a very nice campus, and many of the students have a great college life, since many of them are involved in extra scurriculars"
Freshman,5,TCU is a great school.  Everything is brand new and the big but small school feeling is something that I really enjoy.
Alum,5,The most amazing experience I could ever ask for. Fort Worth is one of the best cities in Texas and the city really supports and loves TCU.
Freshman,5,My experience of Texas Christian University was a good one yfgydfhyfghgh hghuhghshgudh hduihgudhgudhg gdkdkdjgdkgjkdkgdjgkdgjdjdjs gdjhshgjgkghhdskhg dsjhgjdhjgshgshgdjskhgj ddhhjshgjkhjgg dgjhgjk
Alum,5,Education is great. It is not a diverse environment. So minorities have a hard time fitting in. Great school for minorities if you want to go to school then come back home. Also great environment if you you fit in then the campus life is awesome.
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere of the campus gives off such an at home feel for me that I fit right in when I visited the campus. Also the school has a great fine arts program especially the vocal division, which is what I plan on minoring in."
Junior,5,I like the sense of community that this university offers is like no other place that I am a part of.
Freshman,5,"My experience here at TCU so far has been really positive. I love my professors this semester. They are all very friendly and helpful. They don't want to see any of their students fail. While the professors are great, I always have a ton of work to do for each class. There are so many opportunities on campus, and everyone is so friendly here."
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus and very friendly people! The academics are very rigorous and challenging. Students are prepared extremely well for the ""real life"" transition into the work force. Many begin working in their field obtaining in the field training during their time at college."
Freshman,5,"I love the Texas Christian University atmosphere. Every student I have met has been really nice and fun to talk to. People at TCU are very welcoming and always invite open-minded conversation. However, something I would change is how the business school approaches their students. Because so many people are in the Neeley school of Business at TCU, the academic advisors, and sometimes the professors, can seem un-empathetic and cold."
Freshman,5,TCU is an amazing place. From the academics to the school spirit to the friendly camaraderie between the students I couldn’t have asked for a better University to attend.
Sophomore,5,"The staff at TCU is fantastic. Many professors and advisors go above and beyond for students. The campus is beautiful, with the only annoyance being the long walks outside in the Texas heat. But that’s impossible to avoid. I have no complaints."
Junior,5,"When I started my education at TCU, I picked Computer Science. Over the first 3 semesters, I discovered that programming is not for me, compounded with the fact that the CS program is not very good. I am now pursuing a BFA in Graphic Design which I can say is the best program on campus. We all love our instructors dearly. They are also committed to providing the best guidance to every one of their students."
Alum,5,"I was truly challenged intellectually by my profs, but was also given substantial feedback that helped me improve academically. I also found true camaraderie here in being a part of the Frog Family. At this university you are not just another number. The faculty invests so much of their time to help you succeed. TCU has opened so many doors for me and I am a FROG for Life. GO FROGS!!!"
Niche User,5,"TCU is a great place, with excellent professors and lots of school spirit.  There are many students from out of state, and lots to do both on and off campus."
Sophomore,5,A small school that feels like a big school. Everyone is truly so nice and friendly. It is my home away from.
Sophomore,5,Love everything about the school. Smaller school with big spirit. Class sizes are small which is a hands on environment.
Sophomore,5,"Lovely campus, great academics, and wonderful student life. There are always events on-campus to keep students active, strengthening the overall experience. It is a small, compact campus, which makes it easy to walk anywhere in a short time. Although it is small, it still has a large campus feel, which I truly enjoy."
Junior,5,"TCU has curriculum designed to enabled student's success for their future careers. I feel more than prepared in my area of study, and despite the more difficult course work I am grateful for the challenges which this school has pushed me to conquer."
Niche User,5,I am not a student at Texas Christian University yet but I love visiting. I have went to visit the school and went to just about all the football games with my Uncle and father. The scenery is unreal. The atmosphere at the games are just mind blowing and so fast paced it keeps you smiling and happy all at the same time.
Junior,5,TCU is a great school. I feel like they truly care for their students and work to provide many things for students to do on campus.
Niche User,5,"The campus is wonderful, it feels like a home away from home! The university students that attend have been amazing in helping high school students understand what college is actually like. The school itself is beautiful and the academics top notch."
Junior,5,I have loved my time at TCU. A s a dance major my colleagues have become my family and my professors have been my greatest role models.
Sophomore,5,I had a great ecperience at TCU. Although i did transfer in the spring semester making it hard to adjust to over all classes and making frineds. Everyone had their friend groups already so it was harder to get to know anyone.
Niche User,5,It is a nice school. The students and teachers are very welcoming and i really recommend the school. The sports teams are very motivated and full of energy.
Sophomore,5,It is an amazing University. Everybody is nice and helpful. The campus really does feel like one big happy family. If you ever need help there is always someone there to help you step by step and if they are unable to help they will find someone else to help you. They will never you alone to figure out something alone.
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful and everyone I met was extremly nice. TCU is in a great area and is a very safe campus.
Junior,5,"While it costs a pretty penny to attend TCU, you get ecac what you pay for. Prettiest campus, devoted professors, world class facilities, and quite possibly the best college experience. With athletics on the rise, TCU will be a top ranked university world wide in years to come"
Sophomore,5,"I just transferred to TCU and my experience has been amazing. When I first got there, the advisors helped me so much with working with the credits I already had, and what I needed to do. Specifically, the health department linked me up to amazing connections in preparation for Dental School. Right away i got involved in AED (a treasurer now), the Pre dental club, and the overall Pre-Health volunteer coordinator. Just arriving in January, I already have so many observation hours and great Dental connections that will help me get into Dental School."
Freshman,5,"I love TCU because of the friendly atmosphere and that it is not too big but it is not too small. I really enjoy walking across the beautiful campus. The academics and professors are amazing, and I feel like I am getting the best possible education I can get."
Alum,4,"Texas Christian University is a great school appearance wise and academically. Very scholarly university. Diversity isn't the best at all, nor taking into consideration of their minority student's thoughts on issues or racial issues related on campus."
Alum,4,"Due to COVID-19 and everything having to go virtual, TCU did an incredible job with the transition and catering to the student body. The professors were fairly good as well, depending on the professor. Overall, they took and did the necessary steps to take care of the transition."
Junior,4,This school is a great place to be overall. I wish it was more diverse. The professors seem to care about their students. The sciences are known for being difficult here so make sure you know what you're signing up for.
Sophomore,4,I like how beautiful the campus is and the amazing sports atmosphere displayed at all of the sporting events.
Junior,4,"There were some growing pains for both the student body and the professors who had to adjust their schedules and overall way of teaching to cope with this new medium of learning. I missed being able to interact with my classmates and walking on campus. All things considered, from my point-of-view the workload wasn't too harsh as my professors sympathized with their students, and they still emphasized on showing up to the zoom classrooms to receive instruction. I did hear from friends however that certain teachers gave ""busy work"" and just more reading materials with no actual instruction or zoom conference to actually teach their students. A lot was learned during this process, but overall I enjoyed the remainder of my schedule considering TCU didn't cancel altogether."
Sophomore,4,TCU really did well with allowing students to succeed. Individual professors struggled to understand the meaning of an online classroom but overall the experience was helpful.
Freshman,4,Classes went very well and my teachers were all very supportive. They made sure everyone had the opportunity to succeed.
Freshman,4,I liked the campus and school. It’s beautiful. The students are very different from where I come from
Junior,4,TCU has provided me with ample opportunities both on and off campus that have pushed me to think critically and work effectively with members of my community. I have formed personal relationships with my professors due to the small class size and have benefitted greatly from the small student body and close knit community.
Junior,4,I have loved every minute of my college experience at TCU. The intense school spirit is one of the strongest aspects that drew me to the school in the first place.
Freshman,4,"TCU wasn't my top choice when applying to college but I am so happy I ended up here, it's hard not to love it! Tailgating during football season is my absolute favorite, and the bars on 7th can't be matched. Only thing that I dislike is the food options. Freshman year meal plans with BLUU are brutal and the only fast food really on-campus is chik-fil-a. Not too many good, healthy options."
Junior,4,Beautiful campus. Small classrooms encourages student interactions and participation. Numerous activities. Could improve communication about school events.
Sophomore,4,"Personally I really enjoy TCU. There's great professors and wonderful connections here. As a speech-language pathology major, there's a clinic here for me to do my clinical senior year so I find that to be a very good thing. Also, there's many opportunities here whether it be wanting to join a club or leadership opportunities. Overall TCU so far has been a great experience. The people are lovely (despite the lack of diversity), the professors are excellent, and the school is beautiful. My only complaint is that the food sucks."
Sophomore,4,"There is an amazing sense of community at TCU! It feels like home, even if you're far away from where you grew up. Everyone has a smiling face and is very welcoming!"
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed the professors that I have met. They are all kind and willing to go out of their way to make sure you have the right tools to succeed. The biggest thing that I would like to be changed about TCU is their diversity. The majority of students that attend TCU are caucasian- mostly attributed to those students' economic status that covers the tuition rate. TCU does a great job at giving out scholarships, but I would like to see more scholarship opportunities for minorities so that tuition doesn't seem like an intimidation factor when considering TCU."
Sophomore,4,Texas Christian University is a very open university that offers just about everything for everyone. There is lots of help in every department and they always make you feel at home.
Junior,4,"Texas Christian University has been a great school so far. It is a small school experience without losing any of the perks of being a big school. Unfortunately, it is very expensive, but it also comes with a lot of perks. The diversity is lacking but they are working diligently on it."
Junior,4,I love TCU and think academically it ranks one of the highest universities. Everyone is so nice and friendly and there's always something to do. There isn't much  would change about this school other than more parking.
Freshman,4,TCU is a lovable campus. Student involvement is heavily prized on campus and in the community. Professors are very tough but are willing to help you out at anytime to get you the grade you need.
Sophomore,4,"Texas Christian University is a great school where everyone wants to see you succeed with the occasional professor that does not fit in the box. Students have a voice and are actively involved in what they can do to make college life at Tcu better. Tcu listens to its students and constantly makes conscious efforts towards the better. At times Tcu feels like a bubble where parents send their adult children to daycare, but the professors counteract this stigma by challenging the students with academics intensity. Overall the university is a great place to be but it is too expensive. I love being on campus and the teachers I learn form but I do not understand where all of my money goes."
Senior,4,TCU allows you to make great connections. Its reputation adds value to not only your resume but your work. TCU is a competitive schools with a lot to offer.
Sophomore,4,I wish there was a little more involvement but overall it is an amazing school!! The classes are difficult but it is worth it because your know your getting quality education.
Freshman,4,"Ft. Worth is amazing! Cannot say enough good things about it! It is a very tough school, but I've it dearly! Most professors are more than happy to help with anything you need, and while greek life is pretty big, you do not have to pledge/rush in order to get involved by any means!"
Junior,4,"TCU is a great school. Small classes are a plus and the professors seem to genuinely care about their students. It's a great community and there are lots of opportunities whether you are talking about academia, sports, social activities etc."
Freshman,4,"A couple of things that I like about Texas Christian University is the southern hospitality that is provided in the atmosphere. While looking for prospective colleges, I knew that feeling like I was home away from home is something that held a great amount of weight in my decision. Being from the South, I can attest to this to be factual. Something that I would like to see change, is the diversity, equity, and inclusiveness here at TCU."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time at TCU. The campus is nice and the professors are knowledgeable. Fort Worth is a fun town but not too big.
Sophomore,4,The professors really care about their students and aim at making sure all students succeed. Most classes are interesting and the overall environment is great. They put a lot of money into fun activities and events so students can stay engaged.
Senior,4,"Texas Christian University embodies a unique social and academic culture that has allowed me to grow in more ways that I would have ever imagined. Students are confident and passionate to pursue their deep desires. I love the wide variety of opportunities the school offers to be involved on campus or in the Fort Worth community. Class size is medium to small, which is perfect for discussions and getting to know the professors. The population is small enough to feel like a family, yet large enough to get the full ""college"" experience. TCU can also be challenging, because you are surrounded by high achievers and competition. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming to compare to people around you, but ultimately it has spurred me on to be the best version of me. TCU is a world-changing place!"
Niche User,4,"I like the closeness of the campus and the surrounding area. I like the dorms, but would like more freedom to find a good roommate because for the first two years, students are required to live on campus."
Senior,4,I have enjoyed taking classes in multiple subject areas. All the professors care about you individually and help you succeed for your future. I couldn’t have picked a better school!
Junior,4,"I've signed up for a field trip to campus visit to TCU. The campus is very nice, its big and seeing students everywhere is a good vibe in the campus is really great. This place is traditional, safe, and spritual."
Niche User,4,"This experience visiting was amazing.The professors work  well with you.Also, the atmosphere was exciting and something new everyday."
Junior,4,TCU is very good academically and I feel like I've learned a lot in my chosen field of study. The professors are knowledgable and make the classes engaging and I feel like I'm getting my money's worth. I do wish that Greek life wasn't so in your face. It sometimes feels like if you aren't in a sorority or fraternity that making friends and connections is a hundred times harder.
Sophomore,4,"I love Texas Christian University. I am a sophomore and a first generation college student. TCU has a variety of classes to offer and are firm believers in providing their students with the best resources available. However, I would like the diversity within TCU increases sometime in the near future."
Freshman,4,"The student atmosphere at Texas Christian University blows all other schools out of the water. By having the feel of a large school yet only having around 8,000 students creates a strong sense of community while still having a tremendous focus on education. Coming from a high school that pride's itself on its sense of brotherhood (all boys Catholic High School) the jump from high school to college did not seem like a jump at all."
Junior,4,"Texas Christian University has the amenities of a large school, such as great programs and D1 sports, but still retains the small school feel. Professors take a personal investment in their students and really wish for you to become outstanding global leaders."
Sophomore,4,TCU is a great school with a great atmosphere. The only downfall is lack of diversity because of how expensive the school is.
Junior,4,I love the size of the campus; not too big or small. The atmosphere here is great for people who prefer a smaller community. There's always something to do on the weekends on campus and off. I made some of my best friends here by getting involved in organizations on campus.
Junior,4,"Texas Christian University is a spectacular school with a wide variety of the best professors, tons of cultural events, and different campus activities. The campus life is an unforgettable experience, especially on Saturday’s during football season. However, I would like to see more advertisements and opportunities for minorities on campus."
Junior,4,Professors are Great and you do not have to worry about getting a job right after college. Athletics are great and the student body is very dedicated to balancing both an athletic and academic culture. There is a great alumni base as well.
Alum,4,"TCU is amazing! I loved the small class sizes, the attention paid to each student by professors, the growth that is encouraged, the amount of ways to get involved on campus and in the community, the delicious food in the cafeteria area, the safety precautions taken, the friendliness and general camaraderie of staff and students, and of course the football! The only thing I was concerned about is the lack of diversity. As such a small school, I expected for there to be more of a mix of cultures and ethnicities to learn from - of course there are opportunities all around as far as cultural learning goes, but the cultural immersion is just subpar I'd say."
Niche User,4,I visited the football athletic facilities during a camp in the summer of 2017. The experience was incredible and I hope to participate again in the near future.
Senior,4,"Sororities were a big deal here which I personally did not like, as it made the social scene a bit restrictive. All the professors were great, though, and most all of my classes were small, allowing for in class discussion, which I find beneficial to learning."
Niche User,4,I am a high school student . I came and toured here and would love to go here for college. People are nice. Campus is clean and beautiful. I love it here.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus, the academics, and the sports! However, personnally, it felt like if you weren't involved with Greek life, it was hard to get involved in a lot of other aspects as well. There are tons of other organizations and clubs to join, though!"
Niche User,4,"I wouldn't change anything - well, maybe the cost however the campus is gorgeous, the academics appear to be top notch."
Freshman,4,"TCU is a great university! I got accepted late this fall and they have been so helpful! The professors really care about you, not just your grade in their class. The housing office is also so helpful and I am so grateful that they're so accommodating and easy to work with."
Freshman,4,"TCU is great because it is a growing university that has yet to explode onto the national scene.  The campus is beautiful, the parties are fun, and it is a phenomenal place to get a college education.  It is not the most diverse university, the population mostly consists of white people, but it is more diverse than it is given credit for.  The class sizes are relatively small, and the professors are always willing to help out- both in and out of the classroom.  The athletics are top-notch, TCU is consistently near the top in baseball and football and is improving as a basketball program as well.  The food on campus is excellent with various options to eat.  Overall, TCU is an amazing school, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is applying for college."
Sophomore,4,"So far, my time at Texas Christian University has been an exceptional one. The professors are amazing and they care more about the students actually learning the material, rather than focusing on how many exams to give out. The sports teams here are some of the best in the country. The amount of opportunities and networking provided by the school is another plus. The social life on campus is great, as well as the party scene. The food is sub par but there are plenty of options on campus. The one thing I would like to see change about the school is the diversity. They stress this every year but nothing ever changes. Now compared to previous years, it has gotten better, but it could still improve."
Senior,4,I love the passion and enthusiasm everyone has for this school. Everyone attending and the whole city surrounding the college knows the name and is a fan. There is constant renovations which could be a negative but it means the school is constantly reinvesting in itself which is very encouraging and positive.
Niche User,4,"The food is delicious, real nice campus, and great sports team! What I love most about TCU is the school spirit at football games. The students support their teams and show up to games. Another thing that I love about TCU is that it is in a nice city were there are many fun activities to do."
Niche User,4,Texas Christian University is a beautiful campus where it is safe to receive your education. The professors and coaches are all dedicated to their students and athletes.
Niche User,4,When I went to visit this campus it seemed so alive. I enjoyed their volleyball team but never got a chance to see how they did academically. One thing I'd like for it to change is to have some of the classes close to each other and not so far from each other and to get to know more of their academics and not just their sports.
Junior,4,"Fall of 2016, I transferred to TCU. The transition on campus had a lot of ups and downs. For the most part, the transition was okay. My three suite mates were also transfers so that allowed me to get to know the campus with them. Although, as the year went on, it was harder for two of us to make more connections and find places to fit in on campus. Our other two suite mates joined sororities but when they invited us for outings with them, some of their friends who were also in sororities would make my other roommate and I, who are minorities, feel uncomfortable. As far as academics, majority of my professors and my advisor were more than understanding and helpful. They would answer any questions I have even if I asked the same question 50 times. As the year came to an end I was definitely more comfortable and felt more involved. I love being at TCU."
Niche User,4,"I'm not a student at Texas Christian University but I have gone multiple times for school field trips. The campus is very beautiful and well put together. The food is also great, they have a variety of foods to choose from so if you're a picky  eater than no problem! The only problem is Texas Christian University isn't that much diversed. But the school is great overall, they offer many majors and summer ready programs for students whiich is very helpful."
Niche User,4,I have had the opportunity to visit the campus multiple times which helped me view how the school works and see how the students live.
Niche User,4,"TCU has an amazing campus as it's gardening and landscape is always well kept and well taken care of. The overall atmosphere is very open and inviting and the campus has outstanding pride in their school. Every where you go, if they can make it purple or put a horn frog on it, they will!"
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at TCU has been amazing! The atmosphere the faculty and students create is so welcoming and makes you feel right at home. I enjoy the size of the school as well as the location, it is a smaller university, but is located in a large city. There are always activities available to the students and tons of free merchandise and food, which is awesome for college students. The entire faculty is also one of the best features of the school, because they do everything they can to make sure you succeed and achieve your goals. TCU is also has a great athletic program and all the sporting events are free for students, unlike some schools where you have to purchase passes. All the facilities on campus are of the  highest quality and have the best equipment regardless of the building. Its an incredible school and it would be a great choice for any student looking to join the horned frog family."
Junior,4,TCU is a great place! not too small and not too big. 10k students on campus so you get to see someone you know everyday. Top of the notch buildings and very modern technology. The percentage of whites at TCU is around 70+ which makes a minority like me feel out of place at games/class/parties.
College Freshman,4,"TCU has top notch professors, all of which truly care for their students as you can see with their teaching and voiced concerns. They are always available through email, or office hours - and some even provide a personal number to contact them with. They really want the best for students, and are extremely knowledgeable in their course, but sometimes the explanation of material is difficult to understand."
Freshman,2,"if you're rich, straight, and white this place is probably the greatest college in the united states, but for the rest of us it's absolute hell. Unless you're greek you don't get invited to any parties/events, it's impossible to make friends if you don't look exactly like everyone else, and the teachers just aren't all that good for the vast majority of majors."
Sophomore,2,I took 3 classes online; they were very difficult as the professors began to assign more work as class transitioned to online.
Graduate Student,2,"I believe for most departments, TCU offers a great experience and education. I was unfortunate enough to attend during a tumultuous time in the kinesiology department when a good majority of the professors behaved in quite unprofessional ways. My advisor left during my final semester when I was 90 pages into my thesis, delaying my graduation. Several in my cohort never finished. If I had paid for my education at TCU, I would have been devastated. Overall, I learned a lot about how to teach myself and how to deal with many nightmare-like situations."
Alum,2,"Our daughter entered this school a smart, popular, athletic, confident girl.  The rush process was cut throat and the girls  enter TCU in groups from high schools around Texas. Be warned, these kids have been prepping for rush since they were babes (strange what is important to some).  If you are not Greek or an athlete it is the kiss of death socially.  We thought all the Land Rovers with monogrammed stickers belonged to parents, they actually belonged to the kids, along with Jimmy Choo shoes strewn across beds and Louis Vuitton luggage.   Reeks of privilege, pompousness and the  comments about homosexuality and minorities were shocking.  The school has made some big mistakes in the way it is run and it is sad.  The education here is great if you can put up with all the bullshit.  Our daughter switched to another school to get the education without the drama and save her soul."
Sophomore,2,"TCU really lacks in diversity

They make students, who don't live close enough to commute, live on campus their first two years and pick from very specific and unnecessary meals plans

Although they seem to have a lot of campus activities to do, they are often very similar type of activities and are hard to get into and connect with"
Junior,2,Campus is not safe at all. An eight year old girl was kidnapped two blocks away from my apartment. Also a student was robbed across the street from campus. The teachers want to fail the students and don’t want students to get into the business school.
Sophomore,2,"I met great friends here at TCU and the party scene is unreal. Unfortunately, coming from the East Coast I found myself having a hard time adjusting to the ""southern ways"". Also, it is extremely hard to get into the ""good"" majors at the school (nursing and business). If you are any other major it is pretty much a joke. But Texas is beautiful I just couldn't see myself here anymore, so I am transferring."
College Sophomore,2,"I think that Greek life at my school has negatively affected my personal social experience, but I'm sure it has enhanced so many others'. The student body is almost 50% Greek, and many people have friends on both sides, but Greek does have an overwhelming presence on campus."
College Freshman,2,"the school is mostly white, middle class-wealthy people"
College Freshman,2,"its definitely very prevalent

but you can avoid it"
College Freshman,2,It seems as though the selection choice of who receives scholarships is very skewed. Majority of the people I know who were qualified for scholarships were passed up by students with less qualifications.
College Freshman,2,This is a very stressful process for all students.
College Sophomore,2,"First of all, I'm not some hypocrite who ""is just bitter because no sorority wanted me"" (something several people have accused me of). I didn't rush simply because I'm a pre-med major and my schedule was way too busy and, honestly, I am SO glad I did not. Don't get me wrong, I love TCU, but I definitely think their overemphasis on Greek life is a negative. I do have friends in sororities and fraternities, so I'm not saying that everyone who is a part of it is snobby and stuck up but, well......a lot of them are. I've seen perfectly normal girls pledge sororities and come out as stuck up snobs who've been taught by their ""sisters"" that they are better than all non-Greek people. I'm not saying that there aren't positives to sororities and fraternities (I'm actually in a non-Panhellenic service sorority which I really enjoy), but I do honestly think that, when it comes to TCU at least, Greek life tends to do more harm than good. Just remember to proceed with caution."
College Freshman,2,"For freshmen, you are forced to park your car on the far side of campus past the stadium which is an inconvenience."
College Freshman,2,"Greeks dominate here, so unfortunately if you aren't into fraternities or sororities you are stuck with bars which might seem fun, but they get real old, real fast. One can take only so many drunk shallow conversations and stay sane. If you can find a organization that isn't afraid of throwing a kick-ass party, that is gold because you avoid the downsides of greek parties. The bars are mediocre at best and honestly the fun times are at the houses. Downtown is too expensive and rarely ventured to by underclassmen."
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid process has been a struggle for me because they only offer scholarships based on ACT scores, not your GPA or a combination of the two. This is very frustrating for anyone who doesn't do too well on their ACT. They also do not offer many scholarships at all once you are here, so you have to look for outside sources. In the financial aid department they are very willing to work with you and give you as much information as possible. Biggest tip I can give having learned the hard way is to take your ACT as many times as it takes to get a good score (at least a 28) or an even higher score because that is the only way to get a scholarship coming in."
College Freshman,2,"I don't partake in those kinds of activities, but from what I have been told and can see, drinking is a big problem at my school. There have been multiple cases of alcohol poisoning, and underage drinking is very prominent"
College Freshman,2,"Academic advisors were not willing to really talk to me about changing majors; it can be really difficult to switch majors without needing to take summer classes, even as a freshman. It is very difficult to pry information about the different majors from any faculty"
College Freshman,2,TCU majors are no as highly regarded as they would have you believe. I would encourage people to look at rankings of TCU's majors from a third party
College Freshman,2,Fort Worth doesn't really do public transportation
College Freshman,2,THE GIRL TO GUY RATIO IS TERRIBLE.
College Freshman,2,Greek events are dominated by all females. It is terrible. The bars are crowded and not a good place to meet people. They don't know how to party at all.
College Freshman,2,The public transportation is terrible and is barely useful at all. All other forms of transportation are expensive. It is best to bring a car or have friends that have cars.
College Freshman,2,I wish that I had chose a school that was not as centered around greek life. I also feel that there is a large difference in the culture of the midwest vs the south.
College Freshman,2,"Because of the high price tag, TCU is not very diverse as a whole. There is quite a lot of diversity but you won't see it very often. "
College Junior,2,important criteria: ifso many classes you can handle and do you have time for job searching
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive any money when I really need it
College Freshman,2,"This is very little diversity at TCU, outside of the athletes and international students. There is also still a heavy bias toward Texas residents. I found high school to be more diverse than TCU. Great "
College Junior,2,"There is not enough parking for the amount of student TCU has, if you get a pass you are still not guaranteed a spot. It is too expensive for TCU Grandmarc. The main reasons I still don't have a car as a junior."
College Junior,2,"Honestly, TCU is way more strict than any other school my friends go to about partying, alcohol, noise, visitation, and more."
College Junior,2,Parking on Campus is really bad if you live off campus! If you live on campus it isn't terrible but there are very few lots that fill up very quickly and you often have to move you're care for athletic events and other activities! There are a few lots that are a good proximity in dorms but there are some that are pretty far however they do have a shuttle service to bring you back and forth! If you don't want to deal with the frustration of being late to class and never finding a spot I would advise not living off campus or living in walking distance!
College Junior,2,If you live on campus parking is OK but not great.  If you are a commuter student like me it is a horrible experience.  There are limited parking areas and you have to arrive on campus AT LEAST an hour early to find a parking spot.  If you have the option ride your bike or live on campus and don't get a car just use the great bus passes they offer free to students
College Sophomore,2,"For a Christian school, the students don't act like it. Alcohol is not regulated like it should be. The rules regarding drinking are not well enforced so the students get away with it."
College Sophomore,2,The parking is terrible at TCU. there is one freshman lot and every home football game you have to move your car to a lot that is miles away from campus. There are a couple other parking lots but lots of people park illegally and get parking tickets. There are shuttles that can take you from the lots to campus but sometimes they take a long time to get to you.
College Freshman,2,"There are quite a few different religions and races on the Texas Christian University campus, but the vast majority of people are whites. With most people being white, a lot of times people stereotype TCU as being full of just rich white kids, when really there's a large amount of diversity among even the white students within our campus."
College Freshman,2,"Multiple parties with alcohol every weekend along with multiple bars and clubs in the area lead to a lot of visibility. No one will pressure you into drinking or drug use, though. It is just very widely seen and comes down to your personal choices."
College Freshman,2,"Unfortunately, they have not been particularly helpful for me.  You need to continue hounding the financial aid office.  Though they were unwilling to give me before, there is hope for merit financial aid because I did well in first semester"
College Junior,2,"The off-campus housing selection is poor. The housing quality is average looking at high-quality apartments being overshadowed by poor quality apartments. what makes housing off-campus horrible are the prices. Since TCU is already so expensive, I don't believe the prices for off-campus housing is fair for minorities such as my self who are low SES."
College Freshman,2,"TCU is not too diverse. There are a few latinos and europeans, but everyone is mostly white. However, as an international student it;s not hard to fit in."
College Sophomore,2,"There is parking on campus for everyone... if you are willing to walk. The normal parking lots fill up fast and you may have to park in overflow. So if you are a commuter, get there early. If you live on campus and your lot fills up.. you may have to walk 15-20 minutes to get to your dorm."
College Freshman,2,There is not much diversity at all at this school.
College Freshman,2,"TCU is not diverse which is it's biggest downfall.  All the students are primarily white from extremely wealthy backgrounds, with exception to the athletes.  They are starting to focus more on this, but it is a long way away from being diverse.  With that being said, minority students are not treated any differently.  I have visited some other southern schools where racism is prominent and at TCU all students are accepted and racist comments have no place here."
College Sophomore,2,"The room advisers are strict if they suspect you have been drinking. There doesn't have to be physical evidence of alcohol to get a violation. One alcohol violation results in a fine on your student bill, and multiple violations are punished by community service, letters to your parents, and possibly expulsion for more than 3 violations in one year."
College Sophomore,2,"Not what I expected – When I chose TCU, I was expecting something very different from what it turned out to be. When I got there for freshman year, I joined a sorority and quickly became involved in tons of things on campus. I really enjoyed first semester. The longer I was there, though, the more I disliked it. I quickly realized how conservative and close-minded many of the students are. I come from the west coast, where everyone is down-to-earth and open to other personalities. At TCU, I almost felt like little clones were walking around. Girls all wear sorority t-shirts and Nike shorts, guys where khaki pants, sperry's, and polos. I don't think it's a bad thing because I think people should wear what they want...but I almost feel like the students dress this way because they want to ""fit in."" I quickly began to feel very different than the rest of the students. I just think TCU is more of a bubble than the real world. TCU (not all, but the majority) students are going to be hit hard when they realize they have to get jobs and daddy wont write them checks anymore. This is a school that is not realistic about life and the future. You can't stay in college and party with your frat/sorority for the rest of your life. Wake up. "
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much to Do – So, Berry street is the only street in walking distance that actually has activities on it, the next closest is Hulen but the walk to Hulen takes 45 minutes. The city buses stop running at 8pm monday through saturday. and 6pm on sunday. So basically if you don't have a car you are screwed. The only great thing about the surrounding areas is the ability to have frog bucks. That is rather convenient so you don't have to carry cash."
College Freshman,2,"WASP Majority – Most of the students here are white and upper/upper middle class Republicans. Christian is the dominant religion, but is not as much of a driving force as other religiously affiliated colleges. We are required to take three hours of religion, which ranges from the New Testament to Buddhism. Greek life dominates the campus. As a lower class, Hispanic liberal that's not active in a sorority, I often feel like a loner."
College Sophomore,2,"Construction Issues – Construction on the stadium takes over some of the already limited parking spaces. I am getting along fine without a car; would mostly only use it to get home on holidays. Free public transportation for students! Many people complain about the parking, but I have definitely seen and dealt with worse."
College Senior,2,Lots of White Students – Greek life rules at TCU and it is difficult to find individuals that are willing to mingle with internationals. Foreigners and Americans do not generally get along that well.
College Junior,2,"Good, but Could Be Better – Aid for TCU only happens when you apply to the school. They have a few scholarships here and there during your time at TCU, but the biggest chunk of your aid comes once you receive your acceptance letter. Also -- TCU constantly increases their tuition. Keep that in mind when you are factoring the cost of the campus. Tuition could increase by $2000 over 4 years, but your financial aid will stay the same."
College Sophomore,2,"Can't Get Anywhere Without a Car – The only places within walking distance are some college bars, lots of restaurants, and a grocery store. Other than that, you pretty much need to have a car. There is virtually no public transportation. Getting a ride to the airport also can be expensive, as you have to get SuperShuttle or a cab or get a friend to drive you (it's about 30 minutes away).

Around campus, though, there is really good transportation with a shuttle service, golf cart safe rides service, etc."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not Very Diverse – There are many different races and religions at TCU, but they are a definate minority."
College Junior,2,Soo Frustrating! There a not enough lots and they are not big enough! They have taken away several lots in the past years for construction and have not compensated for this loss. I am a commuter and have decided to park on the street everyday instead of trying to find a parking spot.
College Senior,2,Social Scene – I would say the strictness for parties is pretty average.  Campus police do a pretty good job of keeping that under control.
College Junior,2,"They need to build more parking lots at TCU, especially since they recently closed down a whole lot in order to build a new building.  The plan is that in 5 years TCU will have built a parking garage, however that's not convenient for us who are currently there now."
College Junior,2,"Although the school has said that they are looking and planning solutions to the parking problem, it is still there and apparent. The campus police are irritating and we tend to ignore parking in favor for newer buildings. TCU just needs to get smarter about parking."
College Senior,2,"Everyone is very preppy, and they all dress the same. Guys are looking for one thing and so are the girls. Finding normal, genuine people can be hard, but is very possible."
College Senior,2,"Appartments Are Expensive – There are alot of appartments around TCU but the cost is so high so living on campus makes it more convinient. You have the chose to living with your parents your first year if you want to safe money, but then there's the trade off with college experience. You'll fall in love with the residence halls at TCU, you have everything you need there at a walking distance."
College Sophomore,2,Not enough parking spots for everyone attending classes...you need to get there early enough to beat the crowd. if you are unable to get a spot in the numerous lots around campus there is luckily a shuttle that will pick you up at the football stadium parking lot and bring you closer to campus.
College Junior,2,"Very Important – TCU is without a doubt a Greek campus. They tell you its about 40% of students in the system, but it usually feels like 60%. Also most Greek groups don't socialize outside of their associated organizations."
College Sophomore,2,"You probably won't get busted by the campus police...OR your RA. The campus police are around to (a) keep you safe and (b) ticket your cars.

Your RA, on the other hand, will probably never come to your room/apartment unless it's for a safety check, which means that you can come home wasted or sneak alcohol in (if you're still underage) and never get caught unless you're ridiculously, excessively loud.  Also, the RAs NEVER look in your fridge and won't go through your drawers, so there are plenty of safe hiding places for booze.

The alcohol policy, of course, looks acceptably strict, but nobody ever bothers following it."
Niche User,1,"Warning: This is only from the perspective of a visiting prospective student.

Being from Minnesota, I was looking for a college that felt like Texas. From the moment I walked on campus, I lost interest. It felt snooty and despite it only being a campus tour, I felt underdressed. Over half the student body is in greek life and it felt like if I had attended it would be 4 years of high school all over again (from a social life standpoint)."
College Sophomore,1,Lol everyone is rich and white
College Sophomore,1,Greek Life is way too predominant
Recent Alumnus,1,"Sadly, date rape is VERY prevalent, one email per week"
Recent Alumnus,1,"I'm recent alum and I have to say some of the negative reviews are true.  

TCU ""paints"" a picture of something it isn't and IF YOU DO GO HERE, you will find that out the hard way like I did(and I was still in a fraternity).

When hanging with my high school buddies who went to UT, SMU, Baylor, etc, when out in public... THOSE guys generally had people ""high fiving"" and congratulating them from going to a ""top school"".  TCU is NOT a top school lol.  

I graduated from TCU this past winter, and I have to admit that TCU is NOT a top school, it isn't.  Period.

It was difficult for my fellow alum and others coming from Neeley to get a job, unless we got a CPA through Accounting(that's probably true for any school though honestly lol)

Hot girls(for us guys) yea they're here, but that's also VERY TRUE for schools like UT, SMU, Baylor, Texas Tech, Texas State, UTA, A&M, UNT, etc... I don't understand why that is so overblown here.  It's nothing special.  

Now, the majority of my fellow alum are stuck with $80,000 to $120,000 in debt and a $40,000/year job..

Was it worth it?  You do the math"
College Sophomore,1,"This is where this school is VERY misleading.

Only Neeley actually ""places"" and even then, after going here a year I can tell you that the job placement is a LIE.  The school website for placement includes those (and there are A LOT whom place like this) who work for insurance companies(not a real job).

The Nursing school also places too with NCLEX examination, but EVERY nursing school does that, is that surprising? lol

Top students with a BBA in Accounting with CPA place... but that's the SAME at ANY school.

You could be a ""good student"" at Texas State and get your CPA and place with Deloitte... it DOES happen

So how is TCU any different than TX State??

It costs 5 times as MUCH lol.

Laughable.. really"
College Sophomore,1,"I wish I had used more of these sites when I had looked...

When you honestly consider TCU, you have to ""take a step back"" and be HONEST with yourself.. This school is WAY TOO expensive, and it is NOT even TOP 5 in it's OWN STATE..

It doesn't do you any good or give you any particular ""advantage"" over any other school.  A degree from here, and I can vouche after speaking with recruiters, is BARELY(if at all) looked at as any better than say Abilene Christian/UTA/UTD.. There is ZERO actual ""advantage"" in getting a degree here... in terms of what you're wanting for it OUTSIDE/AFTER school.

Furthermore, TCU does NOT HAVE a good ""social"" reputation outside of the ""TCU bubble"".  It's sad but what happened to Trevone Boykin is a direct correlation with TCU.  Good on the ""outside""(pretend), but in REAL LIFE... will break the law(punch a police officer).  Ask ANY of the other schools in Texas or ""major cities"" what they think of TCU... and it's not very prestigious nor will it give you any ""advantage"""
College Sophomore,1,"degree is valued the same as a state school... NOT prestigious, tough to get jobs when talking to alumni"
College Sophomore,1,lots of creepy guys and old machines
College Sophomore,1,"You've seen the news, seen the national rankings... you see SOOO MANY bad things about this school on the news...

This school is NOT Christian at all FAIR WARNING!!

ladies check your drinks

If you plan to be unemployed or a criminal some day, COME HERE (i.e. Trevone Boykin)"
College Junior,1,bunch of creeps everywhere on the gym
College Junior,1,"Trevone Boykin... nuff said


Texas Criminals University"
College Sophomore,1,Texas Creepers for a reason... ladies watch your drinks... FAIR WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!
College Sophomore,1,Texas Creepers for a reason. ... ladies be careful
College Sophomore,1,"TCU = Texas Criminals University ... or Texas Creepers University 

Those would be better names... trust me this school is NOT Christian."
College Freshman,1,"Runs the campus, also FILLS UP my TCU email with crimes and alerts"
College Freshman,1,Lots of creepy guys in the gym
College Freshman,1,"My biggest mistake was coming here!!

Please do yourself a BIG, BIG favor and read all reviews, ask around, and see the history/legacy of a school when deciding where to attend college.

This school is WAY overpriced for not being that good, and unless you plan to join Greek Life(i.e. become a rapist), do not come here"
College Sophomore,1,Do NOT go to Greek parties unless in a group... HUGE use of Date Rape and Drugs here!!!
College Sophomore,1,"Very very poor here.. I have NEVER ran into a TCU alumni... unless they worked some service job, changing oil or working in a warehouse... or fired"
College Sophomore,1,It sucks... waste of time and money
College Sophomore,1,Very outdated and dirty.... creepy gym workers
College Freshman,1,"If you plan to get ARRESTED then join Greek Life at TCU, no joke!"
College Freshman,1,"If you plan on getting sexually assaulted while working out, come here!"
College Freshman,1,"If you can't get into a better school than come here... This school isn't worth it ""prestige wise"" i have found out the hard way.  It also isn't worth the money unless you just plan on wasting money.

No that DRUGS and DATE RAPE are VERY VERY common at this school!! You've been warned!"
College Junior,1,"From a FIJI chapter that isn't respected nationally, to Lambda Chi that BEATS UP guys at parties(look it up), to racist SAEs(again look it up), to Phi Delts that aren't successful(again look it up)... the Greek Life at TCU is a joke"
College Junior,1,"If you plan to unemployed and/or a registered sex offender someday... come here!

I am NOT joking, do yourself a favor and GOOGLE: ""TCU rape/TCU racist/TCU arrest""... you will get a multitude of responses for the aforementioned subjects.

I came here ""hoping to get a quality education from a prestigious school... didn't get either. 

If you consider getting LOTS and LOTS of Extra Credit to get ""easy"" A's and having ""some"" and I literally only do mean ""SOME"" parts of Fort Worth(ONLY Fort Worth) who show respect/admiration in you wearing TCU gear/colors... then I suppose you could count those two as well, lol.

I guarantee you, and being from Texas I have good friends who went to BETTER schools UT/Rice/SMU/A&M/etc, that whenever we go out to the ""better/best cities"" in Texas, and by those I mean Dallas, Houston, Austin... TCU isn't anything

It's probably a step up from ""Texas State"" LOL.. but who isn't?? LOL

Date rape and drug culture is VERY apparent here too, come here and find out yourself!"
College Junior,1,"They suck, bunch of sickos going around hitting on girls when they're working out, get a life!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"So I am recent alumni..

I wish I had never come and applied to more schools, I also wish I had known of this site when I was applying lol.

First things first, there's a huge over emphasis on Greek life which isn't that important AT ALL AFTER YOU GRADUATE, unless you figure to be a dousche and wear your letters when going out in the ""professional"" atmosphere.  In which case, you will most likely get laughed at(just being honest)

I had a VERY, VERY difficult time finding a job upon graduation and I finished with a 3.81 from the Neeley School.  Actually... many of my colleagues had trouble finding a job and what happened to many are:

1. They went back for a second degree; most to other schools like Texas State(lol)

2. Worked some crap job packaging packages for some mail company

3. Took some crappy job selling insurance(that is why the ""job placement %"" is so ""high"" for the Neeley School... it is a LIE and over inflated)

You must know that this school isn't that prestigious.  In, and being a Texas native myself, the top 3 cities in Texas: Dallas, Houston, Austin (no particular order btw)... TCU isn't considered a ""top 5"" or ""prestigious academic"" school at all.

I have yearned and searched for a strong TCU alumni base, and haven't found one.  If I planned to stay in Fort Worth then that may help, but even then.. I have ran into A LOT of UT, SMU, UNT, UT Arlington, and Texas Tech in Fort Worth AFTER graduation.  

This school blows!!!!!!"
College Junior,1,"So I wish I had read the reviews before deciding to come here.  First off, if you are ambitious and want to succeed, that is LOOKED DOWN on at this school.  This school is not very ""prestigious"" honestly, and it is by far NOT the most prestigious in the DFW metroplex.  The football team is good though.

Coming from Dallas, I had wanted an academic environment where I would be pushed to succeed, to network, and to have a strong alumni base.  After spending a few years here, the alumni network is VERY WEAK at this school.  It is almost non existant... EXCEPT at football games.  I have hardly ever ran into or met a TCU alumni in the DFW area or anywhere in Texas for that matter. Being that I come from a well connected family (not to brag) all throughout Texas, I would have been the ONLY ONE to attend TCU in my family.  By far the WORST SCHOOL that my whole family has attended.

Looking at the price that my parents(and myself) have spent to go here has been an utter shame looking back for a school that isn't even all that impressive(honestly) on a resume. I just have to be honest.  The admissions are lax, and the predominance of racism and DATE RAPE are true at this school.  That kind of stuff is VERY VERY TRUE at TCU.  Myself, being a member of Greek Life here at TCU, am ashamed to be associated with it honestly.  Just consider all reviews when deciding a university."
College Freshman,1,"So I am a new out of state student.  I'm a white, upper middle class male from Southern California (typical I know).  TCU had become the ""trendy"" school for some in my area if we couldn't get into a UC. There are some things that they don't tell you about before you come here...

I came and rushed a fraternity and got a bid and am pledging in a so called ""top house"".  That's cool I guess, but coming from Cali, I see a real lack of diversity and, I suppose, social awareness within my fraternity.  The things they have us do and what goes on in parties is NOT ""Christian"".  I have spoken with pledges in other houses and my own house... and drug use is DEFINITELY true at this school.  I was even asked to get some Rohypnol for our own house and another house.  If you don't know what that is, I suggest you look it up... because I didn't know it either lol.  Also the way some of the guys treat women here, honestly, I don't agree with.  It's a damn shame.  You would have to be a part of a fraternity here to witness it yourself.  The brotherhood is nice, but i heard that one of the fraternities actually ""beat up"" a guy at a party here.  Really stupid.

The metroplex is awesome though, and I had a high amount of friends go to SMU and so I find myself frequently there honestly more than with my own brothers at TCU lol.

I am looking to transfer to a UC or USC(hopefully) very soon."
College Sophomore,1,"From the outside looking in you may not realize the facade that is TCU.  If you want 4 more years of high school then this is the place for you.  My whole family went to Baylor and I decided to be different and come to TCU, biggest mistake of my life.  If you look at the national rankings, Baylor actually IS a better school.  If you don't go Greek here, then you're nobody.  That is how unreal the social scene is.  As, I guess, a typical attractive blonde haired blue eyed girl, many assumed I would enjoy it here.  However, coming from a big city, I realize how UN real this school is.  TCU is NOT Christian by any means, let me say that as well.  I was invited to several parties from fraternities and can almost guarantee (without a doubt) that my drink was spiked.  Where's the morality in the guys that go here?  Knowing, hearing, and reading about guys who SPIKE/DRUG girl's drinks here is a reason that i DID NOT want to Greek here, lol.  I will be transferring out ASAP, this Spring actually.  Sometimes family knows best."
College Junior,1,"Honestly, other than the Neeley School, this is probably the WORST decision of my life.  Texas is a big and great state and I love it.  I applied to many schools and got a near full ride to TCU because of grades.  I come from a good family as well, but the social life and REAL LACK of diversity is what really destroys this school.  Even the athletes, whom I talked to here would admit it; but the athletics department is great here.  For a school that isn't even ranked in the TOP 5 in Texas, the tuition is OUTRAGEOUS.  You can get the same ""name"" if not MORE from Texas A&M, for example, and pay ALOT LESS.  Furthermore, the predominance of Greek life and date rape, there were TWO SEXUAL assaults the FIRST WEEK of school here, make this school anything BUT ""Christian"".  The irony is that there are so many other schools that surround TCU and the ""TCU Bubble"" that it is best not to get involved in the bubble.  It's a big world out there... After visiting numerous parts of the DFW metroplex, I can say without a doubt that SMU is DEFINATELY a better choice as well.  More ""name recognition"" and just a different atmosphere, I even met many in the Dallas area who TRANSFERRED OUT of TCU to SMU... go figure lol.  TCU was the worst decision of my life."
College Junior,1,Fair warning: If you are not a pretentiously ignorant and spoiled child then this place is definitely not for you. Excessive amounts conformity and arrogance are necessary to survive here.
College Freshman,1,"I'm a freshman girl who didn't rush a sorority -- I felt it wasn't my scene. I generally have no problems making friends, but at TCU everything is different. There are many girls who won't even glance at you if you're not a member of their house. It's extremely difficult to make and maintain friends as a non-greek, as the greeks hold a lot of exclusive activities and events. Many girls are very cliquey; TCU is great if you want 4 more years of high school. Even with the scholarship and financial aid TCU has offered me, I'm planning on transferring next fall. Attending TCU is my biggest regret."
College Freshman,1,I applied but did not receive any financial aid.  Its super hard on my family and it makes me want to go to another school where I was offered more money
College Freshman,1,"There is pretty much no diversity, anywhere. Fort Worth can be pretty diverse, and there are technically diverse students at TCU, but you never ever see them around or get to meet them"
College Freshman,1,"The Greek scene dominates at TCU. If you are a guy, being independent significantly limits your options. In many ways, it's like being in high school with the same cliques---right down to houses eating at the same tables in the dining halls. Your opportunity to meet and socialize with new people is sharply limited.  Parties are closed to non Greeks, unless you are female. 

TCU has recently expanded its enrollment but the number of available bids did not increase proportionately. Even if you want to go Greek, you may not be given an opportunity---a situation which makes for a long semester.  Many of the bids are given informally before rush even starts. "
College Freshman,1,"Every time I applied for some kind of aid, something went wrong and I'd have to reapply or was denied. FAFSA took forever and I don't think I was taken into that much consideration. From TCU, I'm a part of the 1% that are Disciples of Christ which is the religion that TCU is affiliated with. Usually there is a large scholarship for this, but this year they did not give out as much as years past. "
College Junior,1,"Diversity is definitely one of TCU's major downfalls. Although There are students from all types of backgrounds there are very few. The majority of students are all very much the same, which can be nice sometimes but you feel like you are seeing and meeting the same people over and over again. It is partly attributed to the Greek life being so big that a lot of the greek students come from the same background, have the same priorities and lifestyle."

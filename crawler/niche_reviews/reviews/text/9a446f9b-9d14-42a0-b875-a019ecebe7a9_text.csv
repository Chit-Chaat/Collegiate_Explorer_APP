Freshman,5,"I like Rosemont College a lot because it's small which makes it a tight nit community everyone kind of know each other. The Professors are really good as well and take pride in their jobs as professors. I also like the gym I spend lots of time there when I don't have any work to focus on, The new community center is very enjoyable due to the fact that it's very futuristic."
Sophomore,5,"Rosemont College has been everything I had hoped and more. I chose the college for their small class size and phenomenal Biology program. After finishing my freshman year, I can honestly say it was the best decision I have ever made. The professors are great and always willing to provide one on one time if you need help in specific areas of the course. The tutoring offered helped me pass chemistry my freshmen year and made me much m ore confident moving forward into my pursuit to a medical career."
Junior,5,"Although I have not started, as I am a transfer student, everyone in Finance and Admissions has been enthusiastic and readily helpful. It makes me feel like a part of the Raven family and I have not stepped on campus yet."
Alum,5,Rosemont is a Great College.  Love that it is still a small school with a lot to offer.  A great place to grow up for young people.
Freshman,5,"The campus is small, with lots of nature and trails to walk on. It's beautiful! Besides being a gorgeous, safe campus, the school offers unique experiences like studying abroad and taking classes at other colleges for credit, such as the University of Pennsylvania. One can also apply to a dual degree program, in which the student can receive their bachelor's and master's degree in just 5 years!"
Alum,5,"While I did not appreciate it at the time, I really enjoyed my experience here. I made some of the greatest friendships that I could. We had a lot of fun partying at Nova, or going into Philly. I enjoyed the breakfast food (AM classes), and liked the option of cooking my own food. Absolutely beautiful campus, and I liked the ""haunted"" stories that came with it. I was on RamSquad and apart of ALA and loved it! My classes were really great; and I really liked my professors as well. I felt like they were preparing me for life as an artist. I loved my dorm! And the library had some awesome hide-a-way spots!"
Junior,5,I really enjoy attending Rosemont.  This school has placed me in a position to succeed in my life and career goals.  I have nothing but positive feedback towards Rosemont.  I currently work full time for a health insurance company called Independence Blue Cross. I have been able to take the lesson and apply them to my current position at work. I love going to class and networking with other students.
Freshman,5,"I think that Rosemont College is a hidden gem. It is completely possible to challenge yourself academically here. In the science department, the professors are very highly qualified and teach the material very well. The staff here are all incredibly helpful and approachable. Rosemont is a small community where people all around campus know each other. People here genuinely want you to succeed. For undergraduate science students, research opportunities are incredibly accessible which is not common at large universities. I am only a freshman and already know the chair of my department well and plan to join her research team sophomore year. There are also many hospitals and medical facilities in the area where students can get volunteer hours. One thing about this school that is a positive aspect for me, but not everyone, is the lack of a large party scene. Overall, I would recommend Rosemont College to students who want to go to college to learn in a tight knit community."
College Freshman,5,"FInancial aid was a bit of a hassle because of the organization of the process. Other than that the school offers great financial aid. If not the best, it is definitley, without questions, among the best."
College Freshman,5,"The athletics here are stellar. Everyone loves the athletes, they are treated like professions, despite only being a D3 school. However the gym equipment is poorly maintained and not up to date in the slightest."
College Senior,5,Computer Labs – I like that the Graphic Designers have our own private lab. Since we need more time with computers and access to them more frequently.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I have not started at Rosemont yet, but I like what I know so far about their french program. I have been told that there are not many french majors at Rosemont, which has many Pros and Cons. A pro being that the teachers are more personal with french learning students. A con being that there are not many students to work with in our common goals. Being as though there are not many french majors they make up for it by having many upper level french classes at the school next to them."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I have not been on campus much, but my time there has been safe and secure place to learn. I cannot think of a better place for me."
College Sophomore,5,"No Drugs! I have not notice any drugs on campus while I was there. I do not like drugs or users of such things, I hope never to see any on my campus."
College Sophomore,5,Campus Life – Amazing! It is so peaceful the scenery is GORGEOUS!
College Freshman,5,"Lots to Do – Since it is just a train ride away from Philly, you really have a lot of options in terms of food and fun. Love the safety of the rich residential area we are in, but just walking down Lancaster gives you a bunch of options. One of the biggest upsides here."
College Junior,5,It Is Ver Diverse – roisemont is a very diverse campus and the student to teacher ratio is 10: 1 pretty close and more personal
Graduate Student,4,"My program recently went online due to the coronavirus, and I found this to be more convenient than meeting in person as an adult. It gives you more spare time during the evening to work on schoolwork or other things. I never thought I would enjoy online, but it gives a student more freedom and accountability than if it were in person. I didn't give it 5 stars, because some instructors could be more organized, but then again, nothing is perfect."
Senior,4,The Professor definitely go above and beyond to help you succeed. I think the dorms should be updated and renovated.
Junior,4,"Rosemont College has decent academic opportunities considering that it is a small, private university. Rosemont gives students the opportunity to  express themselves by creating clubs that include shared interests of other students as well. It also gives students the opportunity to build their resume in which there are many different jobs around the campus."
Sophomore,4,Very small school with lots of opportunities. Undergrad research is available early on and professors and staff help students seek internships and other resume builders starting even in Freshman year.
Sophomore,4,"The small classroom sizes and 11:1 student to professor ratio, allows the students to get 1 on 1 attention when needed. Also the close environment makes the community members of Rosemont College close."
Freshman,4,I just like the area a lot. The tutors are free. The nursing program is connected with big names like Temple University and Drexel University
Graduate Student,4,The college has great communication and helpful advisors. Nicole is my graduate advisor and she is awesome!
Freshman,4,"Rosemont is a small college with small classrooms which is a good place for someone like me who loves learning in a classroom where you can personally interact with the professors. The building structures gives the campus this beautiful look as if it were from a painting. The campus is clean and is very small as well. The only thing that Rosemont can work on is ugrading the classrooms, give more choices of food and have more activities to choose from on campus."
Freshman,4,"I like the small school atmosphere. They could use an overall update regarding buildings, facilities, and technology."
College Freshman,4,The experience at my school is great so far. I was given the opportunity to start up a dance team that fell inactive within the last year.
College Junior,4,"Rosemont has grown with their athletics. Since becoming a co-ed college, sports have grown into a much bigger part of student life on campus."
College Junior,4,"Rosemont is a very small, tight knit college. Class sizes are no bigger than 15 students, which allows you to connect and learn more from your professor. At Rosemont, you are a name not a number."
College Freshman,4,"Really diverse. However, cliques are based on skin color."
College Junior,4,Rosemont has a small campus with a well knit community of students and staff members. The professors offer office hours throughout the week as well as almost always being available via email. The library is a great resource but is not always open late at night.
College Sophomore,4,It is small however that can be very helpful. I don't regret it I just hope it all pays off at the end of my college career
College Sophomore,4,They make sure where safe
College Sophomore,4,I obtain a lot of material in my classes
College Sophomore,4,It is an active small town that provides a lot.
College Sophomore,4,Its not too cold or too hot
College Sophomore,4,We have good access majority of the time
Sophomore,2,I want Rosemont to get better deans because they lack the care to actually tend to the needs of the students.
College Freshman,2,"A lot of roommate situations happening, and they do not always settle they sort of become worst."
College Freshman,2,People only really drink on Thursdays and there are no parties.
College Freshman,2,"The train system is expensive, you need to travel by car to get into the city, people only ""turn up"" on Thursdays and the lack of events, parties, etc. is trifling!"
College Freshman,2,Rosemont College is a division III school: let that simmer.
College Sophomore,2,It's too expensive and then college bills are even more expensive just better to live on campus.
College Senior,2,They basically serve the same thing all throughout the week with a little variation between the vegetables and starch. the meat selection isn't always the best either because who likes eating burgers everyday?
College Freshman,2,There are no equipment for the students to use. Everyone has to bring their own technology and there isn't much of a tech department. 
College Freshman,2,"The parking is good because although everyone is allowed to have a car on campus, mostly faculty use the parking"
College Freshman,2,"The school offers a very attractive to incoming freshmen, but quickly decreases as you progress through the years, so much so that by senior year you're entirely on your own."
College Senior,2,The campus housing is very overpriced and the facilities are not up to par.
College Sophomore,2,"I have not ate off campus, since this will be my first semester in ther fall. I do hope for some awesome Asian places off campus."
College Freshman,2,"The Food Sucks – You get pasta and chicken everyday. the chefs try to be creative but it really doesnt work out because their concoctions are uneditable. Its not ideal. if your into great meals, our dining hall is not the place for you."
Freshman,1,"Rosemont is not what you expect. They have no programs for all diversity groups just for those of their religion or color. The dean of residence life(which the dorms are in horrible living conditions) has no respect or connection with freshman class. They have a very bad way of welcoming, and their transfer rate is so high they try to trap people here. It’s not what you expect or not what they show at open house days at all."
College Junior,1,Rosemont College does not have Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life
College Freshman,1,The financial aid process for us was the worst! I realize this when it was to late. Rosemont sent a wonderful financial aid package but every time I would get money from scholarships Rosemont would take back little of the money they originally gave.
College Senior,1,we don't offer greek life at all
College Freshman,1,"All the students get away with everything. It's almost as if there are no rules against anything here. At least, none that are enforced."
College Freshman,1,No student at Rosemont has off campus housing. Your options are to live on campus or commute while living with your parents. 
College Freshman,1,There's nothing good about the dorms here at Rosemont. One was even shut down for an asbestos threat.
College Freshman,1,"The food at Rosemont is not very good. It's poorly prepared, there is nothing healthy there are maybe one or two vegetarian options but nothing that caters to any other needs"
College Freshman,1,"It's very miserable here. Everyone knows everything about everyone, there's no privacy anywhere. There is hardly any protection, if you're local, it's easier to just go home. There are barely any clubs or societies to entertain anyone. If you don't play or support a sport, you stand alone. "
College Freshman,1,"My school has no student life. If you are not a part of one of the D3 sports teams, you will not have a good time here. Despite being architecturally attractive, the facilities are very poor and not up to date. With the exception of one or two buildings, it isn't very modern. There is only one computer lab, and it is only open to the students with declared science majors"

Alum,5,Under graduate and masters degree from MSU. I had a wonderful experience and received a job upon graduation! MSU has the best education for teachers that I have ever seen. Their community outreach and hands-on learning make this University second to non!  Go green!
Alum,5,"I did 99% in person and a few online classes. All were great! Profs were helpful, a few gave a little too much of there political views, but other than that it was great! The student life was a great balance and the school worked with you on all types of issues that come up. I had some staff go above and beyond for me."
Alum,5,"MSU was an early adopter of online lectures in their medical technology classes.  I was able to attend lectures remotely, which was a real gift."
Alum,5,I loved all online classes. Very thorough yet still attainable on your own time. Very convenient. There are very many choices on which classes you can take online. Some of which have the option for you to take exams in person or online. Very flexible. The professors either upload their lectures or lecture you through the video and have office hours either online on the video which is also very convenient to be able to choose whichever one works for you. They usually use desire to learn which is an online schooling website which is fairly easy to navigate but also has very good tech support if you should ever need to receive technical support.
Junior,5,Michigan State University has been the best thing that has happened in my life. It has opened my eyes to understand the real world.
Alum,5,Michigan State University offers something for everyone.  I had an excellent introduction to university life and it just kept getting better throughout the four years I attended.
Alum,5,"I did not take online learning at Michigan State since it did not exist at the time, however, the technology in the late 80s was definitely ahead of it's time.  This exposure to various applications was excellent training for the transitions that would arrive throughout my career."
Alum,5,I did not take classes online so have no idea but assume they would be decent just like the in-person experience.
Alum,5,"Michigan State had great academics, but also a great social environment. I really enjoyed their campus and the variety of things you had available."
Freshman,5,Teachers are very helpful and resources will all the information needed The teacher assistants are also very helpful when needed
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman and haven't had much experience but so far I love the school environment and the resources provided.
Alum,5,I loved my time at MSU. I made great friends that will last a lifetime and was involved in Greek life.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at MSU so far is great. The campus is amazing, I think it's the perfect size for me. There is some space between classes but not enough where it feels too big to make it to class. Student Life and the party scene is another big highlight. There is a lot of school spirit around campus with the students, and the parties are a great way to meet new people around campus."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently learning with all online courses because of COVID-19. Teachers were very helpful in this change, with posted schedules and deadlines to help stay on topic while stuck at home. Class material is similar to the material given in class with presentations, live Zoom quizzes, and live discussions."
Alum,5,I don’t understand why they want to learn about online learning when it was not a part of the curriculum when I went there.  Please disregard this portion of my review.
Alum,5,Amazing college experience in every aspect.  I have made a terrific living as a result of the social skills developed at MSU.  Go Green!
Freshman,5,"The campus is amazing and I can't wait to be on campus! When I went there last year over the summer, I was so amazed."
Sophomore,5,Great campus and good learning experience. I am involved in many clubs and there are a wide range of classes to take so you get a good idea of what you want to go into and if it is the field for you. The professors and advisors are extremely willing to help in any way they can and want to see everyone succeed.
Sophomore,5,"Well going to MSU, I have had great experiences with most all of my professors and TA. Always willing to help out in any ways that they can. There are many opportunities to get involved in clubs, to learn new and try new things out and get that college experience."
Alum,5,"Best 4 years of my life! Between the academics and social life, there is no better school. GO GREEN!"
Sophomore,5,"I thought that my online learning experience was great. Although it was not ideal, it was very organized and easy to follow."
Junior,5,"professors online love to talk and face time, if you have any questions. always there to help you. Just try to make an appointment with them because they could be busy with other family things. Most i have took was easy understanding, professor always available to help with any questions."
Junior,5,"The professors are understanding at least the ones i took, season color changing it just beautiful, so many clubs to join. I know for sure you will find one. Every one spirit and pride for this University is just amazing."
Alum,5,I took two online courses. Physiology and biochemistry. Both were tough classes but professors were great!
Alum,5,School is extremely large so it took some time to get used to. But met a lot of great friends here. Classes were competitive but very doable.
Sophomore,5,"Everything I've experienced with MSU has been phenomenal, and my college has been extremely helpful in teaching as well as providing out of class opportunities."
Alum,5,"While at MSU I did take a few online courses, usually during the summer semesters. I found them to be easy to understand and participate in. The professors were available to help and they were organized in their instruction."
Alum,5,I attended MSU for 5 years. I loved every second of it. MSU is a wonderful community and they create an amazing college experience!
Senior,5,"It feels like home! I love the campus and faculty. I genuinely enjoy all of my classes, it’s easy to get help from professors, and I’ve been able to connect with so many fellow Spartans. I couldn’t imagine attending a different undergraduate school!"
Senior,5,"Now that most classes are online, I’ve had quite a bit of experience with them. I definitely don’t enjoy online as much as in person, however MSU has made it easy to adjust to this new format."
Freshman,5,"I have taken online courses at MSU, and I feel that the college does a really good job of maintaining the feel of a real classroom in online ones."
Freshman,5,"I love the school and everything that they do to give back to the community and to make sure that students remain safe, I am very appreciative of them and know that they are doing their best for us students during this pandemic."
Sophomore,5,"I fell in love with Michigan State the moment I got there. The campus is beautiful, there are so many surrounding shops and places to eat. There is always something to do, somewhere to go, or people to see. The environment just has this way of making you want to stay at State forever. The dorms are nice and the food is even pretty good. The sports games are always a blast as well."
Freshman,5,"MSU staff have been more than generous and understanding of everything going on in the world today. They've helped myself and other incoming freshmen feel comfortable with online learning and material. I can say with confidence that my online learning has gone extremely smoothly because of MSU staff, faculty, and current students attending the university."
Freshman,5,"I'm in love with this campus. I've visited the school countless times for tours and sporting events, and my opinion still stands. I'm beyond excited to start my Spartan journey in East Lansing in the Fall of 2020."
Sophomore,5,The transition was very smooth from in-person to an online learning experience at Michigan State University. Many of the classes offered similar times for classes and most of the coursework was the same or lessened a little bit.
Sophomore,5,"Loved the professors, people here, cafeterias, courses offered, and all of the opportunities available for avid and ambitious students. I myself, just after my first year of college, have already joined multiple clubs, am involved in independent research, and have made many close friends already. I am truly excited about the future and what I hold as a student at Michigan State University."
Freshman,5,"I have been given many tools to have a positive online experience. I haven't done much, but I can not complain about the things I have done."
Junior,5,"I love Michigan State University and would not want to go anywhere else! The support system, the people, the professors, are all really amazing and I could not be happier."
Sophomore,5,MSU offers a myriad of academic options taught by world-class professors while offering a great campus atmosphere from sporting events to clubs to dinning halls.
Sophomore,5,MSU offers a myriad of academic options taught by world-class professors while offering a great campus atmosphere from sporting events to clubs to dinning halls.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed my first year at Michigan State University. The atmosphere was amazing and everyone was friendly had welcoming. I really liked wandering around at night not knowing where I would end up while at the same time exploring and getting to know the campus by heart. Everywhere you go, I feel that there is always something to do."
Freshman,5,I liked the way that Michigan State organizes their online learning environments. All of my professors still held office hours and provided us with all of the necessary materials to succeed in the class. It really made the shift from in person learning to online very smooth and easy.
Freshman,5,"Stunning campus, amazing resource centers. Any question you have will be answered right away, teachers are wonderful and the student body is kind and full of school spirit. This is the college of my dreams!"
Junior,5,"Michigan State University helped me feel like I belonged. The diversity and community here is something to be appreciated. From the moment I stepped foot on campus I knew that I was finally home. My program in Criminal Justice studies is extremely close-knit. We push each other to our greatest abilities. Since attending MSU, I have become more outgoing than ever before. I found lifelong friends and attended classes with professors who care more than I have ever known."
Junior,5,"I love the atmosphere at Michigan State. The layout of the campus makes meeting people easy and fun. There are so many good study spots around campus as well. There is also a feel of companionship among the students that I haven't seen at any other schools. There is so much school spirit among everyone and I truly love it there. The academics are also great. I have had a handful of amazing professors who go above and beyond. The only critique I would have is to vet the TA's better. But overall, the school does a great job."
Alum,5,"MSU was an all around great choice for my Bachelors degree. Top academics with a thriving student life , and lots of opportunities along the way."
Alum,5,"I had an awesome time being a student here. The sports are amazing, night life is awesome at a school like MSU."
Sophomore,5,"I went to Michigan State University for a psychology degree and so far I have loved my time spent there. Everyone from the advisors to the professors to the many employees in the dining halls have helped make my experience wonderful. Within my first year I went on a study abroad, and have had several opportunities for internships and on campus jobs. I've stayed in the dorms and have had an average dorm experience, but by staying on campus it helps me feel connected to my schools community. While the courses might get challenging at times, I have been able to maintain a good GPA by using resources on campus such as the math help room. All while I have participated in a multitude of clubs and organizations from Michigan State University."
Graduate Student,5,Going to MSU was the greatest decision I have made. Not only making lifelong connections and memories but giving me the skill set I need to navigate through life.
Junior,5,It’s a great school!! There is a lot of activities on campus and everyone is super nice. People care about you at MSU! The environment and atmosphere is awesome and i feel like home.
Freshman,5,"I love Michigan State University - it truly feels like home to me. Being a freshman finishing up my first year, I am confident MSU will give me the proper education to follow my path and continue on to Medical school. I love everything about it and I am excited to return for Fall semester 2020."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I love MSU! I am finishing up my first year there and its been a great experience. I felt adequately challenged in my classes, all my professors are very helpful, and the student life is great! I joined a couple of clubs and have met tons of friends."
Freshman,5,"Everyone is so nice on campus. It really feels like a family, the professors really care about their students."
Alum,5,"The most impactful part of MSU was the connections with professors that, five years later, I still communicate with on a regular basis.  As an education major, I worked with the most talented professors in the country who have shaped me into the educator that I am today.  I thoroughly enjoyed campus life; East Lansing is a fantastic city with plenty of food, art, and culture.  The area has plenty of diversity, with urban Lansing to the west, rural Bath to the north, and suburban Okemos and Haslett to the east.  I always felt comfortable traveling in the local area.  The housing options were slightly expensive but created enjoyable environments for myself and my roommates.  The people I met at MSU are still my closest friends, and we regularly meet at football tailgates in the fall.  I am proud to be a Spartan!"
Freshman,5,"MSU is a fantastic place to have your college experience, with opportunities everywhere and world-class education, MSU provides a very welcoming family for all it's Spartans."
Freshman,5,"I went to Michigan State’s debate camp and it was an overall amazing experience with cool people, intellent professors and leaders and a very diverse environment."
Senior,5,"Very good university with great people from all over the country. Professors are mostly great, and the university has some of the best programs in the country."
Freshman,5,The energy at Michigan State University is amazing! The professors really care about student success and the Spartan community as a whole are all supportive of each other.
Freshman,5,"endless resources, majors, clubs, and things to do. It is easy to take a big school like this and make it small and personalized. Great staff, facilities, and again, the resources they give students are fantastic."
Alum,4,Excellent school.  I've gotten two BS degrees here.  The nursing school is excellent.  I absolutely love the campus.
Alum,4,Wouldn’t have had it any other way besides my  journey being plagued with the sexual assault scandal and Trump presidency. That really changed the climate at State.
Alum,4,MSU provided me with the knowledge I needed to get a career in the horse industry. I wish that Academic advisors were easier to get ahold of.
Junior,4,"The online experience has been a great method to learn, it is a little difficult to communicate with the professor through email."
Niche User,4,"I loved living on campus being away from home was a little hared at first, but the community that MSU offers is wonderful. There are so many different types of people you can meet its very refreshing."
Alum,4,"I took a few classes online. None of them involved recorded lectures, just reading, quizzes, and exams."
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere and the city life of campus are nice and refreshing. The campus is beautiful, but also varies depending on your location. The classes can be very large lectures or intimate classes. Both options help to create the college atmosphere."
Senior,4,"With the onset of COVID-19, I had my first slew of online classes at MSU finish out in a virtual setting this past spring semester. There was a learning curve for many professors, but overall the semester was carried out successfully."
Senior,4,"I love the attentiveness to students that the faculty/staff at MSU provide. While it is a large campus, student organizations make it a bit easier to navigate. I feel that I receive a quality education here and am a valued student."
Junior,4,"So far so good, the D2L system is well organized and fairly easy to use. Professors will post updates or notifications that will be emailed ot you as well as show up on your D2L homepage."
Junior,4,"Writing this during fully online classes due to COVID-19, but the transition to online has been decent. Campus is pretty much closed so no sports or intramural clubs. I'm dissapointed MSU did not reduce tuition at least a bit due to the plethora of on-campus services that are no longer available."
Freshman,4,"MSU offers helpful tools to contact their offices and staff. I usually get fast answers which is nice. However, their informational emails are rather cluttered and hard to comprehend."
Junior,4,"What i liked best about My experience at Michigan State University is the relationships you build.  Not only with other fellow students but also with Professors.  I look forward to building on those and creating life long mentors and coaches.  In addition, the gorgeous campus and the variety of programs offered at the school.   I am in the Nursing program and my education thus far has been second to none.  I’m honored to be a student at MSU.  Go Green/Go White!"
Junior,4,My teachers were understanding and helpful. I was able to always connect them and have zoom meeting for extra help.
Junior,4,"The online experience is solid. When the internet is cooperative on both ends, it isn't that different."
Junior,4,"Currently a Junior and I'd say MSU is a pretty solid experience for anyone. You'll find your people that fit your interests and many more. As for education, if you manage your time well, you should get what you put in. The on campus experience is welcoming as well. They do a great job making incoming fall freshman welcomed but spring semester students have it tougher to adjust."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Michigan State University thus far was amazing. The first year on my college experience was memorable. I was able to meet a lot of great people. The academics are sometimes challenging but the university offers a lot of resources to help you succeed. Michigan State University is a Predominantly White Institution but is very inclusive with the people of color on campus. With that being said, there have been a few racial incidents that have happened on campus that the school could have handled it better as far as taking action but the is a strong student board all over campus that help our voices be heard. When it comes to athletics we are a Division 1 in all of our sports. Football games and basketball games are fun and I would recommend going at least once. The dorms I lived in were nice and spacious I would highly recommend they only thing I was not very fond of was the community bathrooms. Overall when it comes to campus life, food, parties it is always memorable."
Sophomore,4,I prefer to learn in person and be able to go to office hours and have one on ones with my professors but with the transition my professors did there best to make online classes like how they were in person. They provided as many resources as possible.
Junior,4,"MSU is a really great University! Great education, Great athletics, great fun! It's great great great!"
Junior,4,I think Michigan State handled the transition to online classes tremendously well under overwhelming circumstances. Saved my finals grade too!
Freshman,4,It's okay but I really miss the in-person experience and talking to teachers face-to-face. Really can't wait to be back on campus!!!
Sophomore,4,"Life changing experience, met a lot of great people and had great experiences. Learned a lot about myself and how to be independent. Learned how to manage my time and many new skills."
Junior,4,"To start off, this is one of the prettiest campuses in the country, especially during the fall. In addition to this, I feel like most of the professors are really there to help you learn and watch you succeed. This is something that isn't necessarily true in some other places. Spartan athletics are a big part of the experience too! Whether its basketball or football games, there's always an event taking place somewhere. There's always something to do. Michigan State allows for the perfect balance between academics and a social life. There's no college I'd rather attend."
Sophomore,4,"With the switch to online classes, they did a very good job on short notice and made sure they were able to help as many people as they could. General online classes are also on top of what they are doing, though some professors can have a hard time structuring the class in my experience. overall very good with online classes."
Sophomore,4,"My learning experience at MSU was very good. At first it was a little rough, professors figuring out how to do their class online in a way that worked for them. Many professors were very flexible with classwork with the circumstances of the world, and allowed for us as students to still be able to get our education no matter where we were at."
Alum,4,"I only took a few online courses through Michigan State, but they were always thorough and professors were always available for questions virtually"
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience at Michigan state University was amazing. The campus is beautiful, there are so many class options and clubs/groups you can get involved in. COVID-19 made my first year experience a bit different, but overall it was great."
Junior,4,I took online classes during the coronavirus pandemic. Overall I thought that the online experience in some classes was even better than when I went to class. It forced some professors to make power point presentations and more thoroughly teach the material. The main criticism would be that there should be more universal guidelines to doing this which I hope will be better addressed in the upcoming fall semester. During regular university time I have not taken an online class though.
Sophomore,4,"Learning online was a learning curve for everyone, students and teachers alike, so everyone did their best with it."
Junior,4,"They have a pretty good online system that doesn't cause too many issues, it is simple which makes it easy to understand what you need to do for your classes."
Junior,4,"Very good college experience, they are currently reworking their computer science program which I appreciate."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes were a struggle at first as everyone was figuring out how to transition. Within one week, all my classes were up and running again with so many different resources to aid in our new learning method. The professors did wonderful with the transition and were always there to help with any questions I had. I was very concerned about moving to online, but the professors made everything easy"
Sophomore,4,"Professors effectively transitioned to remote learning when COVID19 happened, using zoom and the d2l platform as well as supplementals like Tophat."
Sophomore,4,"The professors I have had so far have all seemed to genuinely care their students are learning and actually understanding the material, and they are also considerate of the work load they give us for the most part. The campus is very large, which has its pros and cons."
Junior,4,"They, for the most part, were run well and were enjoyable. There were some issues, but for the most part they worked out well."
Junior,4,"So far, it’s a very good university. The professors I’ve encountered are all kind and very helpful, and the RAs in the dorm are nice as well."
Freshman,4,I haven't gotten much experience yet because I am a freshman. I can say that I recommend getting in to a specific college or program in order to have a more genuine experience with a counselor.
Senior,4,I love all the on-campus farms!  I was able to work hands-on and learn how to drive draft horses.  The parking can be a challenge and there is little to no free parking.  The commuter lot is almost off-campus and the bus can run late.
Freshman,4,Most of my professors easily switched to online and it became easy for me to do my work on my own time. No complaints.
Junior,4,"My learning experience online this semester was definitely a huge transition as I was mainly taking all science courses. I took chemistry, biology, biology lab, and a general education course that had been online all semester. Chemistry, biology, and the biology lab were all classes that were extremely difficult to do online but the support and efforts from the community at Michigan State University was amazing and I am thankful to be able to go to such a supportive and caring university."
Senior,4,"I have taken classes online, the homework system in place is a good way to make sure you are on track with the lectures and are not falling behind.  Additionally the presence of online help room hours is helpful if a student is stuck on a certain problem."
Senior,4,"I personally have enjoyed my time at Michigan State University. It has taught me a lot of things and made me into a better person. Despite being an international student,  I feel at home, and can proudly say this is my home away from home. 
One thing I would like to improve on is the connection of clubs on campus. I remember sparticipation happening during fall but not during spring semester. If they have something likes participation during spring, that would be amazing."
Junior,4,The online classes are structured well and are very easy to follow. In the classes I’ve had you get to work at your own pace and the due dates are usually far in advance.
Freshman,4,"Although it was difficult trying to attempt all of my classes online, there was consistent updates and communications between the students and the professors and the administration so it was assuring. Professors found a very fair middle ground with being lenient with the difficulty of the assignments and exams."
Senior,4,I’ve enjoyed my time at MSU. I have received a high quality education on a beautiful campus. The only downfall is the size of the student class which can make you feel like you aren’t as cared about as you may be at a smaller institution.
Senior,4,"I am now a Junior majoring in kinesiology with a minor in health promotion. I have enjoyed my three years so far here at MSU due to meeting new friends, learning more about myself, and the opportunity to work on my skills. Being at MSU gave me the chance to become a tour guide and learn interesting facts about the campus, help others hear the student's perspectives, and enhance my communication skills. MSU has always been my dream school; it has prepared me more for the real world,  and I look forward to walking across the stage next year."
Freshman,4,Michigan State really does try it's best to offer so many resources and there is no shortage of people pointing you in the direction you need to go. Professors are friendly and really interesting people and reasonable! The workload has been just fine even for me at 16 credits. There are many options for food and I'd say many good people to make friends with. As long as you put yourself out there opportunities will come and many peers will inspire you to do extraordinary things.
Freshman,4,"Welcoming environment, amazing student government, and lifelong friends. Helpful professors for the most part."
Freshman,4,"My older sibling went to Michigan State University and she had a great education there. I'm following in her steps and getting a better education for myself. Without even having my first year of college yet, I can already tell State is not only going to be a perfect college for me, but also a place I can call home."
Junior,4,Michigan State has challenged me academically both in and out of my area of focus. I have loved diving deeper into the sciences while gaining a broader understanding in the humanities and social sciences. The professors are genuinely interested in student learning and show great passion for teaching.
Senior,4,I enjoyed the activities and classwork for political science. I think some of the building structures could use some improvement as well as parking.
Freshman,4,"Amazing professors, diverse campus, amazing clubs, and the food is great too! Everyone has a place at MSU and a way to feel at home."
Freshman,4,"As a first year student, I haven’t gotten the full “campus experience”, especially with Covid-19. But in my short first year, I have been able to experience a lot and learn even more at MSU. The campus and resources available are well worth the cost of attendance. There are many opportunities to receive complimentary resources that would be a separate fee at other universities. As a minority student, diversity and equity can be a bit of a problem, but in the grand scheme of things, this university provides more resources and a larger minority community that most other universities in the country. The balance between academic and social life is nearly perfect and maximizes this experience. Overall, I am extremely proud to be a Spartan!"
Alum,4,I transferred to Michigan State as a Sophomore. I was impressed by the school spirit and vibe at Michigan State. A great environment to spend time and meet new people. Beautiful campus. Professors were easy to contact and communicate with even though some class sizes were very large. Huge alumni network helped make finding a job after graduation easier.
Senior,4,"I have had a good experience at MSU. All but one of my professors has been excellent, my online classes specifically have been excellent as well. There is a very active student life here with many clubs and groups. There is an active party scene and good food on Grand River north of campus"
Freshman,4,"I think that my first year at MSU was okay. It was definitely better during my first semester as classes weren't online. I think that most of the professors were okay, but there were some that definitely shouldn't teach."
Freshman,4,I like how diverse Michigan State University is compared to other schools. There are so many different kinds of people there. I also have enjoyed all the professors that I have had there. One thing I would like to see change is racial issues on campus. I feel like race is something that is not talked about enough so some students and professors make offensive decisions because they are not educated properly on the issues of race.
Alum,4,Overall my undergraduate experience was favorable. I enjoyed it. The campus is large and beautiful with old buildings and fresh landscapes.
Freshman,4,"I love the amount of opportunities on campus and how easy it is to meet new people and get involved. I also think they handled COVID-19 better than a lot of universities. We got a partial refund for our on campus housing and meal plan, but we were not refunded for tuition.  We also have an amazing sexual assault prevention program. This, of course, does not erase the university's history of racism and sexual violence, but I do believe that the student body is working hard to transform our institution."
Niche User,4,"Msu is filled with spirit and fun, while the academic side is slightly lacking. Sports events and events on campus are fun, the dorm life is a okay (the dorms are a bit gross but mots dorms are), and the students course load isn't to vigorous. Overall Msu is a good school with much to offer."
Freshman,2,"Even though my online experience hasn't started yet, I am still very confused. I have no idea how class will look like or how it will work."
Sophomore,2,"Online is very different to in person, it is harder to get your point across, often emails take way to log to be replied to or even ignored. Way harder to learn from online than in person and takes away the majority of the experience."
Niche User,2,My online experience with MSU was not the best. I was thrown into is very quickly due to the Corona virus shutdown. I felt the school was not prepared at all to be offering online classes and as a result the classes were all over the place. Many teachers didn't have lesson plans for weeks and when they were made were very confusing to follow and caused many issues with my learning. Overall the experience was very hard an tedious due to the lack of organization and lack of readiness.
Freshman,2,"Michigan State is a university that doesn't care about their students, most of my classes were filled with un-enthusiastic professors that had TAs or LAs do a majority of the course load via teaching and conducting smaller sessions. The school sets up certain blocks to cause failure in the student's path via adding a coding element to Calculus 2, for no reason other than to make the class harder than it needs to be, so more students fail. The STEM school is riddled with prerequisite classes that aren't about teaching you material and leading you to the next level that you need to obtain your degree. This school's level of difficulty doesn't appropriately test a student's knowledge, all it does is shove work at people, which doesn't either appropriately asses what a student needs to work on, but rather throws just enough at a student to push them to the point of a five-year degree versus a four-year degree. Because of how unprofessional the school feels, academics are not the priority."
Freshman,2,"Some instructors were better skilled at delivering content in a conducive manner.  If you were not structured or need direct interaction, online classes can be overwhelming"
Junior,2,This school is NOT worth the tuition they charge. They charge a lot more than other colleges for just the basic classes. They always talk about diversity but this school is VERY VERY RACIST. I would not recommend this school to minorities because of the way we are treated and the way our hardships at this school are looked down upon and are not taken seriously. I am very upset to have to go to a school where I am not accepted by the entire MSU community because of the color of my skin. Also there does not seem to be any safety measures being put into place for the theft that has been occurring on campus almost daily. Overall this school is very overrated save your money.
Senior,2,"I transferred to Michigan State University in what would have been my third year of college. That first year here was terrible for me. The dorm I was in was awful, it was by itself far away from every room near me down its own hallway going to the main entrance to the building and the dining hall. I signed up to get a random roommate but they never paired me with anyone. So I was by myself in my own room and had to put up with the unrelenting traffic that went by all hours of the day. Also directly outside my window there was what was labeled as a ""cardboard recycling"" dumpster. Everyone just filled it with trash however and it would smell. It also got dumped every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 6 am which was very nice to wake up to. 3/10 experience here."
Freshman,2,"There is a rhyme and a reason why Larry Nassar was at this school for as long as he was, it is part of the culture.  This is not a transcendent university, academically OR Socially.  Shoutout to Marty Spranger for respecting your job and holding an academic standard!  I did have a few other good professors, but not one that was notable asides from Marty.   You will not meet other eccentric kids unless you are really willing to venture, so If you are going here you will want to join as many clubs and interests to find people who are not just rocks.  I found few people in Brody/Emmons who looked at me with some life, love, and energy.  Guess what? those people are transferring, as am I likely. You WILL be an outcast if you are striving for excellence.  ask yourself what you want out of college? Shoutout to Jen Hayes and all her employees at yoga state for being a shining light in East Lansing!  There is a lot of Bogus Noise going on at this school, pay ATTENTION!"
Senior,2,"The culture is not one I am proud of given recent events. I also was not given proper advising from my adedemic advisor. As the first born child, my parents and I did not know much going into college. There are also many foreign graduate students who are not professors but teach the course, and are very hard to understand. I Even when I took action to meet with a department about this problem I experienced, nothing was able to come of it. Yet, I was able to change my major but I was ill-advised as to which major would be best to meet my future goals."
Senior,2,"Michigan State is focused primarily on the profit students provide for the university rather than the wellbeing and education of the students. Everyday necessities like campus transportation, printing, etc. are an extra cost and not included in tuition like they are at many other schools. Safety is a very big issue, with violence, sexual assaults, and robberies being a weekly occurrence. The buildings are not updated enough as the money students pay for tuition is rarely used to better campus facilities."
Freshman,2,"I am not really a party person, so it was really hard to live on a campus so focused on the party aspect. The people on weren't that nice overall, and the administration issues right now are humiliating."
Sophomore,2,"My experience was alright, a lot of the engineering classes set you up to fail. I'm someone who will put in the effort to do well but when spending 24 hours every weekend to pass a class, they clearly don't want students to prosper. When going to the help rooms and they would reluctantly help but make the student feel stupid for not understanding topics. The students are all drowning and depressed, it's not a good school or a good environment."
Junior,2,I really enjoyed my classes and my adviser.  I was especially excited to take my Soil Sciences class!  The career fair was a bit unorganized and I had no cell service there.  The financial aid office and registrar are not enjoyable to deal with.
College Senior,2,Living on campus is very expensive ($1000+ a month) the room I was assigned was an ok size for a single but would not work as a double. The room was very hot and there was no AC. It also leaked in the winter. the best part of living on campus was the proximity to class and having somewhere to go in between class.
College Student,2,The dorms don't look any different than the ones my dad stayed in in 1979.
College Freshman,2,Its alright but we had a lot of break ins this year
College Senior,2,"Greek life is pretty obnoxious. It started out at ways to make friends and network and help with jobs, and it still does that. But Greek life at MSU is known for the parties, drugs, sex, and alcohol. All the girls wear the same things each season, and the guys are pretty easy to spot depending on what they wear, body language, and how they talk. Most Greek people are rude and snobby and rich which just adds to it. They are basically just paying for a friend group, which is not what college is about. Many greeks I know after maturing and growing up by senior year realize that Greek life is just another high school clique full of popular wannabes in a college setting."
College Freshman,2,I am not a fan of the dorms. I am in Hubbard. It's too far from everything and it's dirty.
College Freshman,2,"I would never walk alone at night. There is a trail coined ""the rape trail"" because of how dangerous it is-- that tells you something."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not have much personal experience with Greek life. Being a music student it's basically like a fraternity/sorority already, you work with people in the operas and in your music classes and you're with them all the time and you don't have to pay any extra to make friends like Greek life."
College Sophomore,2,"Overall, I have not been impressed with the social greek life on campus.  I enjoy learning about new sororities and fraternities that are based on academics that also do good work for the community.  However, I do not know much about how often the social greek life sororities and fraternities give back to the community."
College Freshman,2,Very expensive for very little space. I live in Abbot and it is old and disgusting
College Junior,2,I have never participated in Greek life. It just isn't my thing.
College Freshman,2,"In general the financial aid process was not the best, I have a single mom of 3, and although she is a nurse making $50,000 a year, after taxes, house payments, car payments, and keeping her kids clothed, college is just not in the budget. So when I saw I only got $3,000 while I was thankful, I worried me...how will I be able to pay for my dream college? will I even be able to go?"
College Freshman,2,This school doesn't easily give out scholarships so apply early.
College Sophomore,2,"I barely get financial aid, its hard for me to go here because I really can't afford to keep paying out of pocket."
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive any scholarships from Michigan State, and it has cost much more than I anticipated to attend classes there."
College Sophomore,2,There are little to no scholarships or aid handed out.
College Sophomore,2,The quality of buildings are average but the cost is far too high.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not enough financial assistance for most students. Unless your parents are divorced, you're a vital athlete, or you're a minority there is almost no way to get scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,Confusing and didn't receive much aid
College Sophomore,2,"It was fairly easy to gain the financial aid I needed, but scholarships are very hard to come by."
College Junior,2,Most everything is owned by DTN Management and their prices for anything somewhat convenient or nice are astronomical! I have friends at other university's that have off campus housing double the size of mine and far closer to campus that pay half of what I pay a month
College Junior,2,"I think non-Greeks take their education more seriously. There are some (a few!) exceptions, but the vast majority of Greeks seem to value the social scene more than academics. I have no problem with Greek societies but from what I've seen and encountered in my college experience, I consciously choose not to participate in their events or what they do."
College Sophomore,2,Everything is football and basketball. Everything.
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive anything other than loans from the school which is very difficult for my family
College Junior,2,Good luck getting a scholarship
College Freshman,2,"Many students care way too much about partying, and it halts their ability to do well in school."
College Sophomore,2,"Many of the off-campus housing options at Michigan State University are expensive. In order to get a cheap apartment or house, a student must live about 20 minutes off campus which isn't ideal for getting to class, the library, study sessions, or tutoring. Many of the apartment complexes are along Grand River which is right across the street from campus which is extremely convenient. However, 40,000 plus students attend the university and there are only about 10 apartment complexes close to campus which makes attaining one very difficult and frustrating. Many of the apartments do not offer private rooms or bathrooms so it is similar to living in a dorm again which many students do not prefer."
College Senior,2,Every semester I have problems with my financial aid being correct or going through at a decent amount of time.
College Sophomore,2,The process never seems to be over. There are always emails saying something new about any loans I have.
College Junior,2,I would like to get more scholarships and grants rather than relying on Federal loans.
College Junior,2,Dorms are the worst to live in becuase they need to updated and need city water not well water. your sink and toilet turn orange color and when you take shower omg your hair is rought . (well water is suck in the campus).
College Sophomore,2,Don't hope for any scholarships. You will most likely only receive loans.
College Sophomore,2,Students can get away with pretty much anything as long as they do it in their rooms because there is never checks or anything of the sort.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Michigan State University is a Big Ten school and occupies a large amount of students. Alcohol visibility can be seen daily, and on some days, out of control amounts are consumed or visible throughout campus."
College Junior,2,"The school spirit is unreal. You can't help but love the place and everything it represents. But - the people make the experience, and I only had about 2 people who were willing to branch out from their old high school friend they had known forever and take the time to get to know me. Everyone is comfortable with the people they've known forever, and while you almost can't blame them for it, it makes being an out of state student a ridiculously lonely experience."
College Junior,2,"I love history. LOVE. I'd always planned on being a history major and working at a museum someday. My dreams were crushed the -first- day of college, though. The head of the history department began a speech telling us to get excited for the program with, ""If you want to study history your only option is to teach. Institutions don't have any money anymore, so its teaching or work for free for a really really long time."" Well oh."
College Junior,2,"When I first visited, the guys were all super good looking. Too bad I found out later they had all graduated. What's left is… decent. The girls far outrank the guys in looks. Everybody that goes to MSU is from Michigan so they pretty much all date the same person from high school throughout college, so all the cute good guys are taken. What's left? Raunchy frat boys and boys who are too scared to speak to you, and instead drink until they fall all over you - literally. Rick's is the place to be if you want to get drunk and get laid."
College Freshman,2,"We have a very large campus, and although the side walks and roads are always shoveled, it is still a very long walk to class in bad weather. The university takes care of the weather problems to the best of their ability."
College Sophomore,2,I was previously in a finance major that I just recently switched out of because of the difficulty of the workload. All of the classes are massive lectures in which the professors most often don't know your name or that you even exist. However I have recently switched to an advertising major that I am expecting to be a much better fit.
College Sophomore,2,"I lived in the dorms on campus for two years.  I enjoyed my first year dorm experience, but not my second.  My first year, I lived in the only dorm on campus that had larger rooms than everywhere else on campus, so downsizing my second year was a large adjustment that I did not like.  The first year, however, I made most of my college friends in the dorms and cannot recall having a bad experience.  Both years I was about the same distance from my classes.  Living in the dorms is very expensive at MSU, but the ease in living there and amenities included can sometimes be worth it.  Not having to worry about paying rent or bills or paying for food is really convenient, but it is definitely cheaper to live off campus."
College Freshman,2,"The buildings are so old and outdated that there are health concerns (asbestos tiling, sharp wooden splinters). The social community is great, but it's hard to get past the rough amenities."
College Freshman,2,Snow plows could do better.
College Student,2,People here drink on a regular basis.
College Student,2,Make sure you do it early and complete it the first time.
College Sophomore,2,"rough winters,, takes a while for spring to kick in.. fall is beautiful can't beat it"
College Sophomore,2,The bus drivers can be very rude and the taxi drivers are not familiar with the area so they are very slow.
College Sophomore,2,My university chooses for the students which scholarships best fit them for the student. My situation with my parents who only help me out with a very small portion make it hard to receive these benefits because of FASFA. I am forced to apply for loans that have outrageous interest rates so I can receive an education.
College Sophomore,2,"This winter was a pretty brutal one for students on campus. Classes can be as far away as 20 minutes and when the weather is below 20 frostbite becomes a large issue. Our campus has transportation, but because of the amount of students some buses only let a couple students on at a time because  of the over crowded ness on the buses."
Senior,1,"I am in the college of engineering and I know it will vary depending on the school I am in, but the professors in engineering (majority) could care less about you, most of them are there for research and don't care to really teach and help guide students with material, instead of generating very simple powerpoints and assigning problems, this problem may have stemmed from the Deans though but, online a lot of my peers are not happy either."
Freshman,1,"Once coronavirus took hold in America, all of our classes were moved to online. The feedback of the execution received by the student's was horrible, resulting in a need for pass-fail class system, because professors couldn't adapt when put in the spotlight."
Senior,1,SCHOOL IS VERY RACIST SCHOOL IS VERY RACIST SCHOOL IS VERY RACIST SCHOOL IS VERY RACIST SCHOOL IS VERY RACIST SCHOOL IS VERY RACIST SCHOOL IS VERY RACIST SCHOOL IS VERY RACIST SCHOOL IS VERY RACIST
Freshman,1,"IF YOU ARE OUT OF STATE DO NOT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL. The curriculum is awful, the only reason that I am able to suffice is because I (thankfully) remember material from my high school career. The professors are okay, however most of them have terrible ratings. Financial aid is terrible, they are not very informative, always claim to have their hands tied, and the school does not have scholarships for those who have good academic merit. They do not care about you as a student unless you are poor or an athlete. They pride themselves on athletics and do not keep up their housing. Cafeteria food has gnats and bugs in them as well. IN ADDITION, I was dis enrolled five times due to miscommunication and lies being told by financial aid. Also, the campus is very boring, old, and there is nothing to do in this town of East Lansing."
Niche User,1,"This school supports the sexual abuse of women, it takes no responsibility in protecting a sexual predator.  SHUT THIS CESSPOOL DOWN"
Alum,1,"Most high school students in Michigan set their sights on either Michigan or Michigan State.  You might get the idea watching college sports that the schools are about equal.  But  academically, except for certain majors, MSU is just awful.  Freshmen spend their time reviewing the classes they took in high school.  Students sleep in class, when they aren't too hung over to attend and need to learn little to graduate.  The place is a party school and women are not respected.  It's hard to find a job in your field after graduation.  There  is a reason Larry Nasser was able to prosper at this college.  Nothing has changed since then.  Competitive football and basketball teams and a party culture have given this place a false reputation. Save your money, have your kids commute to a local college and buy them all the booze they can drink with the savings.  Or insist on a school that values academics over making the final four."
Alum,1,"One star is overrated, since you could not check zero.  Junior high level work.  Intellectually dead students who only care about sports, which are the bread and circuses diversion so the dupes don't realize they are not learning anything. I was 4% stupider on national tests my senior year than my senior year of high school.  This school is to be avoided at all costs."
College Junior,1,"I didn't have the best experience in the dorms. My hall was not as social as I hoped it would be. I also did not get to choose my roommate so that was the worst experience I have ever had to deal with. I was stuck with a roommate who had qualities I was praying my roommate would not have and it was extremely difficult to deal with. I was unable to switch roommates but my roommate ended up moving out so it kind of worked out, but it was super stressful. But I did make some friends in my hall and have been close with them for the school year."
College Freshman,1,I hated living in a dorm. Its so small and cramped and you can't get away from your roommate if you need space.
College Freshman,1,"This school has far too many students, not enough interesting classes, too small of dorm rooms, etc. It is not that great at all. Come here if you have school spirit and love MSU, but otherwise it will annoy the hell out of you."
College Freshman,1,"I did not want to go to this school--it is too large. There are so many students, and unless you're in a residential college, your classes will be 500 people and you will never get to know your professors, let alone have them know your name."
College Freshman,1,"I'm a huge fan of combo exchanges! Sadly, I am unable to say the same as far as cafeteria food. As said previously, I very much enjoy cooking so when I come to the cafeteria and have mediocre cooking it doesn't set well with me or my stomach."
College Sophomore,1,"Coming from a student whose parents are no longer supporting him through college, I find it upsetting that I can't get any form of financial aid based off of my parent's income. My own income is close to nothing and I do not qualify for subsidized loans which makes paying for college even more of a hassle than it already is. If you really want financial aid, pray that your parents get a divorce, are from a minority group, and/or come from the lowest-income neighborhood in the country."
College Freshman,1,If your an out of state student don't go here unless you have scholarships because MSU doesn't care about you and even if your parents don't make that much money they still will want you to come out of pocket. Financial Aid here doesn't help you at all.
College Sophomore,1,The cops are really strict even if the problem is small
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any financial aid.
College Freshman,1,"I applied for financial aid, but didn't get it. Its frustrating because my parents are not helping me with paying for school."
College Sophomore,1,"The only students who seem to get assistance with financial aid are of minority races and ethnicities. Students like myself, are also in need of financial aid and scholarships to help cover the cost of tuition, books, transportation, and food. It would be helpful if ever student was required to meet with a financial aid consultant at least once a year and were shown scholarship opportunities and options. At Michigan State, students are mostly expected to search out scholarships and financial aid without assistance."
College Sophomore,1,There aren't many opportunities for scholarships there and I need some badly. My parents are helping me pay but are struggling financially. I wish there were more options especially since I have good grades and have been raising them every semester.
College Sophomore,1,"I was given nothing good when it came to scholarship nor grants, I am paying most of my school out of pocket"
College Junior,1,"Did you hear about the polar vortex? Snowpocalypse? Yeah… that was us. If bad weather gets you down, don't come. Locals make light of it, but -30 degree windchill isn't just a little cold. It's painful and miserable and there is no such thing as an easy winter at MSU. Also winter lasts pretty much the entire school year. You get one nice month at the start of school, and then by the time you hit spring and finish with finals, you're lucky if the weather breaks 50."
College Junior,1,"Boring boring boring. Maybe I am jaded because I'm a city girl, but even for those who don't expect much from their college town would not expect the barren wasteland that is East Lansing. Freshman year - forget it. Not having a car meant 2 hours on the bus to get to the grocery store, and if you wanted to see the mall? Jokes on you. If you are from Michigan you'll be fine, but being from out of state - and across the country - makes East Lansing seem miserable. The Eli Broad museum is the only one you'll hear of at all, and its mainly student exhibitions, which range from boring to disturbing. The museum is usually used as a fancier conference room for the school to raise money and show off the building. There are a few small obscure places to eat, but if you are the kind of person who likes to explore new restaurants and fun places to eat - EL is not for you. It's predominantly chains, and the small restaurants they do have are well, not great. It's a very basic mid-western town, and you really have to search to find your few good places."
College Freshman,1,"It really, really, sucks to try and get any financial aid, need or merit based."
College Freshman,1,I have been working on my financial aid for 8 months. It is finally finished..for fall semester.
College Sophomore,1,"The Snow, the Storms, the Hail, the Cold Rain, Negative Degree... I miss Florida"
College Freshman,1,There are always police officers everywhere.  It makes it very hard to not get caught during the four years that you attend college.
College Freshman,1,Michigan weather is the worst ever. I hate it.
College Freshman,1,Got absolutely nothing but loans that will pile up.
College Junior,1,"MSU police as well as East Lansing Police make a living off of giving out parking violations. If your meter expires at 4:30, you will get a ticket at 4:31!"
College Freshman,1,i dislike my school very much. it was not my first choice and i do not like it here
College Freshman,1,"there is rarely a wifi connection and sometimes its too slow or crashing. the printers are a hassle to deal with, but the tech support is really helpful"
College Freshman,1,its not the best. the people here are really arrogant and mean and not always the most helpful
College Freshman,1,its kind of difficult and no one likes to help each other
College Sophomore,1,"Walking isn't very safe, and the maintenance is slow to fix problems like black mold that is growing in your dorm."
College Sophomore,1,There is no parking for classes. You must park far away and take a bus to classes.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid process is pretty rough. I received no aid two years in a row.
College Junior,1,"Hey, it's Michigan.  Great if you love the four seasons but the weather is very fickle and the winters are absurdly cold!"
College Sophomore,1,Parking is terrible. I once saw someone getting a parking ticket at 2 in the morning. Freshman are not allowed to bring cars. The parking passes are very expensive.
College Sophomore,1,"Permits are very expensing, parking police will gladly troll around looking to give tickets to whoever they can. A car is definitely not needed if living on campus. Parking spaces, even if you have a $200 permit, are not easy to come by."
College Senior,1,"Parking is awful. Permits to park in the lots are expensive, the lots are not in great locations, meter spots are ridiculously expensive, the parking enforcement police are swift and unforgiving"
College Freshman,1,"It's cold most of the school year, which limits how much you can go out on weekends. Also, it makes it less desirable to go to class in the snow."
College Senior,1,It's pretty difficult to park here but very easy to get ticketed!
College Sophomore,1,"There is never anywhere to park on campus and if you do find a spot, you will most likely get a ticket. Parking on campus is extremely inconvenient."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking on campus is awful. Be ready with quarters, and if you have a long class you will have to literally get up and go put more change in your slot which can be EXTREMELY inconvenient and rude when attempting to participate in class/lecture. P.A.C.E a program designed to ruin the days of everyone on campus patrol campus like hawks ready to write up a ticket wherever they can. I literally saw a P.A.C.E officer wait by a meter that had a minute or so left and then write the ticket. Parking is doable if you do it a certain way. 

You HAVE to leave early. Wanna leave last minute and get a spot? Good luck. 
You HAVE to have change. While this can be a hassle, it beats the ten dollar tickets that are handed out like hot-cakes."
College Freshman,1,"I mean it depends on who you hang out with, obviously, but I mean they are busting students in the dorms for drugs constantly. There have been at least 5 busts on my floor alone since I've been here. I hear a lot about drugs now, too."
College Senior,1,"Of the other in state Universities I've been to (UofM, GVSU, CMU, and NMU) we have the worse parking by far, the persistence of the parking police drives me insane. I have 2 tickets, 1 when I parked legally at 4.24 AM to drop off coffee to someone for five minutes and one on St. Patrick's weekend when I went to play Frisbee and parked on the ""bus side"" of the lot by Shaw and Farm Lane, bus side ??? At least of UofM I can pay to park somewhere, here there can be no parking for more then a mile."
College Junior,1,"Honestly, I am disgusted at the prejudice I have personally experienced while trying to get financial aid during my college years.  I have never received any scholarships, pell grants, or grants of any kind actually.  MSU offers SO MANY scholarships to Asians, the LGBT community, blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, single mothers, returning older non traditional student, etc... it is very frustrating to look up all these scholarship opportunities and not qualify for any because I am a white woman, who isn't a single mom.  My father told me he will not help me pay for college and he won't, yet I have to claim his income on FAFSA and therefore don't get any aid except the subsidized loan anybody can receive.  I am a good student, who attends all my classes, I am tried really hard my whole college experience and ended up graduating high school early and am a very young junior (19) and STILL can't get aid.  I am quite frankly, disgusted in the screening process, and I don't think there should be aid for different races.  There's none for white people, and if there were it would be racism.  I don't like the double standards there."
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life is stupid and frat guys and sorositutes are a bunch of stuck up douchebags
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus can be rough. Often times it is extremely hard to find a spot, and once you do you have to fish for change in your wallet or car. The prices are ridiculous, parking in a lot for 30 minutes can be as much as $1.80. Doing this a couple times a week can add up. Also the parking enforcement is extremely strict. Often times you will get a ticket while walking out of your class."
College Freshman,1,Underage drinking happens all of the time and everyone is aware. It is a major problem.
Recent Alumnus,1,"While you don't need a car if you live on campus (bus service is good), it is pretty much a necessity if you live off campus, as many upper level students do.  The parking on campus is pretty awful, depending on what area you have class.  Expect to get a parking ticket pretty often - even if you think you put enough change in the meter, if you miss it by one minute the parking enforcement will have already doled out a fine.  They're everywhere!"
College Junior,1,I live off campus this year and it is miserable. Completely unacceptable. They make it obnoxiously expensive for students to commute. And the parking police are jerks. I had been two minutes (no joke) late to my car that was parked at a meter and had a parking ticket. They literally want to fine people. I feel totally abused as an off-campus student.
College Senior,1,Don't get caught with your meter run out or in a bad spot! You WILL get a parking ticket.
College Freshman,1,"It's Michigan. The weather is unpredictable and it is highly suggested that you have an umbrella or extra jacket/hats/gloves in or on your backpack. One day it's 50 degrees and you only need a hoodie, next it's 20 and you need all your winter gear. Also don't ever put summer clothes away because you never know when you'll get a nice sunny day. It tends to rain or at least be cloudy quite often."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is so expensive, and hard to get to you're better off walking or riding your bike, or taking a bus, but driving is just terrible."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is one of the most stressful things around. I would NEVER advise parking on campus for an interview, class, test, or anything else that you can't be late for, or that has the chance of running over it's time limit. The MSU Police or PACE will absolutely leave you with a ticket. If you're commuting, I would make sure and look into getting a parking pass offered at one of the several lots available. 
If you're visiting/ staying at the dorms for the weekend, make sure and get to the parking lots at least 10 minutes before they open (6 pm on Friday) because they go quick!"
College Freshman,1,The lots close to everything fill up fast. But if you park near the outer edge of campus it's fine.
College Sophomore,1,"The Drug scene at Michigan State University is not big. It depends on who you are with, it always good to have good friends next to you. Students party a lot here, therefore there are a lot of drinking and smoking activities, but most of the time the police settle the situations."
College Senior,1,The parking meters around campus usual have a like 30 minute limits. And parking is very strict here. It almost seems as though MSU doesn't support their students driving to class.
College Sophomore,1,"Thinking about taking a car? Forget it. The nearest parking spots are lots on the ends of campus and it is just not worth it, not to mention it costs an arm and a leg to park there anyway."

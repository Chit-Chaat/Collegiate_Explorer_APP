Junior,5,"During COVID-19, PSU took classes online to protect students and staff from the virus. We experienced top notch learning and opportunities from our online courses throughout the uncertain process. My professors were helpful and loving in the insane time. Online classes are simply a more convenient way to receive the exceptional education at PSU."
Freshman,5,"So far, the People who work at Pitt have made me feel extremely welcome and made me less nervous about this school year, as it is my first in College. With COVID-19 in motion, the Dean and rest of the staff have taken the right precautions to make sure everyone is safe and in good hands."
Graduate Student,5,"Learning virtually has been easier than I thought. If ever there was a question, the professors are fast to answer. So far I only wish there was a platform to communicate to the other students."
Graduate Student,5,All the professors I have been in contact with have been very thorough and helpful along my journey. They have all been readily available to answer any questions. I am an online student and have been really impressed overall with the content and professors.
Graduate Student,5,"Pittsburg State University is the best college you could ever go to. Their community is the best ever, everybody is super welcoming and they would help you in whatever you need. Also, their campus is beautiful. You have to walk around 3 minutes to go to class and walking through campus just makes your day so much better, and mostly if it is Spring, because you can see the tulips and they are beautiful.
As for education, the staff is the best you could ever ask for, they would help you at any time, even if it is during class time or not. Most professors have office hours, but all professors are available at all times, through email and through their phone number, even at night. 
As a biology major, the staff and facilities have been the best. Their motto is to learn seeing things, so laboratory classes are very important so you are ready to go into the real world and most of the techniques that would be used for the future, you already know them. 
I would recommend going."
Freshman,5,"I have had regular online classes with Pittsburg State University, which have turned out to be really good. With the corona virus and all classes switching to online, it made some of my classes more difficult. However, I was lucky enough to have understanding professors that worked very hard to make the online switch and experience as smooth as possible. I was really fortunate to have that. They were all always available and encouraged us to ask for help if we needed it through the tough time."
Freshman,5,"Pittsburg State University provides an array of resources, dedicated professors, and many opportunities for student involvement."
Sophomore,5,"I have had a great experience at Pittsburg State. Awesome professors, awesome campus! It's great bang for your buck!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere of Pittsburg State University. The campus is beautiful and well taken care of, the professors and Graduate Assistants care about their students' learning, there are many different opportunities for success, and the teacher to student ratio is very good. The university makes all of their students feel accepted and supported. I have been able to excel in academics, athletics, and socially during my first year at PSU. During this time I was on the Dance Team, rushed the sorority Sigma Sigma Sigma, achieved the Dean's Scholastic Honors, was inducted into Phi Eta Sigma National Freshman Honor Society, and invited into the Lambda Sigma Sophomore Honor Society."
Graduate Student,5,Pittsburg provided me with a very diverse environment and allowed me to become adjusted to different learning styles.

I look forward to this University and hope I can improve on all my subjects exponentionally while attending this University.
Niche User,5,"I will be actually attending this school in the fall, but my experience so far has been magical. It is small school. Which means that the professors are easy to contact and even have a causal conversation with. There are a ton of extracurriculars so you are never bored. And Missouri gets in-state tuition! I knew the first time I visited it was my dream school. Now that I have become accepted my dream is a reality."

Freshman,5,"My experience with Pittsburg State has been great already! I have been welcomed by so many people. The flat rate tuition is the best part. I can take 18 hours and still pay the same as someone would for 12 hours. Overall, through my short experiences there already I think Pittsburg State is a great school."
Junior,5,"Pittsburg State University is one of the most diverse and exciting colleges I have ever seen. No matter where you are, you will have a plentiful amount of support form staff and students. The possibilities at this school are endless. It is a fun and safe environment that is welcome to all students, faculty, and families. The campus is beautiful and the overall vibe of this school is awesome! It may be a small town, but Pittsburg sure is involved in every way. Pittsburg State University is the place to be  as it ensures a bright future for anyone willing to work together and put in the effort. I wouldn't change a thing...except maybe the food."
Senior,5,"Such an amazing college to go to! There are so many different options for degrees, programs and activities! The professors and personnel that work here are so amazing and help with everything!"
Freshman,5,"I visited Pittsburg State University with the intention of only to visit for my parents enjoyment. However, once I stepped foot on campus it truly felt like home. The atmosphere is AMAZING! My one ""want"" for college was reasonable class sizes, and Pitt has exactly that. The most I've ever had in a class is about 20 people. I love Pittsburg State University"
Sophomore,5,Pitt State has a great environment and an administration that cares for students and tries hard to help them succeed.
Senior,5,This has been an amazing institution that has made me feel included in all aspects. I believe that this university is one that all people would benefit from at least considering. I have felt like such an included part of a community.
Freshman,5,I really love my school. I wouldn't really change anything except for hiring newer professors who understand my generation better than the older professors we have here now.
Senior,5,I love everything about this school. It taught me everything I need to know about being a great person and a good scholar
Freshman,5,"Pitt State is the best college I could have picked! I absolutely love the small town college vibe. There's not a ton to do, but you make up for that with all the amazing people you befriend! The professors are helpful, the campus is constantly beautiful and well taken care of, and the campus living is so nice."
Alum,5,The professors were fantastic and the academic advisors were extremely helpful. The classes had good teacher to student ratios. The university provided many opportunities that I would not have had elsewhere.
Junior,5,I have met some of my closest friends and had some of my greatest experiences. It's all because of the people
Sophomore,5,"Great learning environment, teachers are always willing to help, and small classes which is very nice."
Niche User,5,"What I like about Pittsburg State University is it is family friendly. Also, the professors, athletes, and students around campus are really nice. Great environement to go to school in and the sports games are very energetica and hyped."
Junior,5,"Pittsburg State University is a very friendly, welcoming campus where everyone can find where they fit in. The students and staff are relatable and are more than willing to work with you. Pittsburg is a close knit community that has a small town feel yet has many options for dining and entertainment. Parties are quite frequent here but only if you make it that way."
Alum,5,I always had such positive encounters with professors from every department. The sense of community at Pitt State is like no other!
Sophomore,5,Everything is awesome! Campus life if great! Students are diverse and very nice! Professors are amazing too! Advisors are very helpful too! They help you find the right path for your degree!
Graduate Student,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here at Pittsburg Sate University. The professors and students in my program have been awesome and great to work with. I have learned so much and have made life long contacts in my department.
Sophomore,5,"Pittsburg State University was honestly a great experience for me. The people I met the stuff I learned. It was perfect, and being there helped me grow into the person I am today. I never thought school was fun until i came here. I always loved class even if it was in the early morning. When the summer hit I was actually the opposite of happy. It almost put tears in my eyes when I had to leave. I met the love of my life and it didn't work out this summer because of the distance and I don't think well ever be the same again. Anyway this school  is the best in the world!!"
Junior,5,I love my professors here. The construction department is so nice and everyone helps everyone. They help students find internships and jobs like no one else
Junior,5,Great college and great environment to be in. Everyone is always so helpful and you know your receiving the best education around.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is warm and friendly. Smaller classes and more one on one time with teachers. Dining hall on campus sucks, but if you don't live on campus you don't have to worry about that. We are constantly doing renovations to improve the campus.  For a four state college, we have one of the lowest tuition rates in Kansas, plus it's flat rate tuition.  That was a real factor in choosing to go to Pitt.  You can take as many classes as you want and it'll cost the same as 12 credit hours.  We have great facilities and huge local support.  Just about every business in town has a gorilla statue out front.  Sounds creepy but it grows on you."
Junior,5,Pittsburg State is nothing like I imagined it being not only in the classroom atmosphere amazing with everyone being so kind and helpful including the very understanding and reasonable teachers but the campus life really helps mold you into your own person.
Freshman,5,"Pittsburg State is the college of my dreams that has a beautiful campus. It's exciting to continue to see new renovations always going on. With Pittsburg being a small community, the entire town is very supportive of the college which is amazing. I love getting to brag about my school. The only thing I would change is the university housing contracts. The rule that you must live in dorms as a freshman is a burden due to cost but I do like that it forces me to interact with students who I wouldn't otherwise."
Sophomore,5,I love how the campus isn’t too spread out and everything is mainly in one general area so you can walk from place to place. The campus is really pretty and nice.
Junior,5,I absolutely love Pitt State. I am so happy I chose to come here over my other options. It is a smaller college in a small town in the middle of nowhere. The students are so close to each other and the professors are all so nice. Literally everyone is willing to help if anyone needs any sort of help with anything. There are also so many different opportunities for people of any ethnicity. We have many many students from all over the world. We also have the chance to study abroad pretty much anytime of the year. Clubs and groups are a big part of the school as well. And also fraternaties and sororities. They are both a big part of the college life. Pittsburg State is the best and I would recommend it to everyone.
Niche User,5,I spent 2 years of education at Pittsburg State. I had a great experience and loved being a student there. The educators were excellent and I enjoyed my classes.  I learned a lot in my 2 years. I still enjoy going back to visit. The atmosphere is unexplainable. I met many new people and became very close to them. It was a great experience.
Junior,5,It is a very relaxed college. Fun but very educational. For being in a small town they are able to provide many options to fit everyone's needs. The staff are very friendly! The campus is beautiful!
Graduate Student,5,"I am getting my Master's degree in math  while simultaneously working as a full-time teacher in Kansas City. The professors and school have been incredibly accommodating, and have worked around my schedule-offering online courses and summer courses with my goals in mind. It's a small, friendly community where I felt welcomed immediately."
Freshman,5,This is my first semester here but I love it! My teachers have been very supportive and helpful and have encouraged me to continue my education. The advisors can be a little careless but some of the faculty and upper management people are very smart and integrated into the daily life of the students. There are tons of scholarships and financial help through loans and they really help with finding internships and job exposure definitely would recommend the tech center and construction program!
Alum,5,This is a great university in a smaller town with easy access to all things in the community.  A great home town feel.  Decently priced and relatively inexpensive to live here.  Great access to many restaurants and shopping.  Safe town to send your kids to college!
Niche User,5,I love the campus and the teachers are very friendly and caring. The College of Technology is incredible and impressive. I cannot wait to go to this college
Junior,5,"I love Pittstate and I think it is a interesting university. It is very good university to make new friend, learn more experience and opportunities."
Freshman,5,"Professors are great and really care about your education, and all around vibe at the school is great."
Sophomore,5,This school is different from the rest. The family aspect that every students feels with attending is nothing like anywhere else. From athletics to clubs to Greek life you will find a diversity of people. There is a fantastic foreign exchange program and everyone is always welcome!
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Pittsburg State University. Everyone I see on campus is amazing and very helpful. The classes are wonderful, even the much larger classes of 150+ students. They really enjoy hands on teaching techniques which I love as well. One thing I would like to see change is more parking. They did recently add more parking but it still doesn't seem like enough. I am grateful for the parking they did add."
Junior,5,"The teachers, faculty, and fellow students are so well involved and eager to provide help if a student is struggling or needs extra time learning. They are quick to write/call you back. The only downsides are the parking, lack there of and that the school buildings are so far from each other. Otherwise, it is great!"
Freshman,5,"PSU is a tight-nit family from all over the world united under one common love for education and growth. I love it. I could not be more excited for the years to come at PSU, and the relationships I am to build because. Gooorillas!"
Junior,5,I really enjoy my campus and the friendships that I have made during my time at this university. I do have to say that the first impressions you leave on the people are very important because the college family is very close and you'll see the students and professors all over the place outside of the campus and classroom life and they can be very helpful with guiding you through the unknowns of college life.
Freshman,5,I love the school! A lot of my friends go there to and they seem to like it! 10/10 would recommend this school. The food is good and you are treated very well.
Freshman,5,"I've lived in Pittsburg my whole life and couldn't wait to go to PSU. The university has a great variety of academics, sports, and as well as student organizations. Also gives great opportunities for on-campus jobs, off-campus jobs, and internships."
Freshman,5,Pittsburg state is an amazing college with all the tools necessary to help its students succeed. The teachers are amazing when helping students in need. The class sizes are overall small making it easier for students to have 1 on 1 access with their teachers.
Freshman,5,"Pittsburg State is the epitome of the great American melting pot. With students from all over the world, the campus has a great amount of culture and diversity. As it is placed in the middle of a comfortable sized town, it welcomes students coming from different states and areas. There are many organizations for students, with more being created every year. With knowledgeable professors in all departments, each student is able to receive an education that will better their future. I have been interested in Pittsburg State for my entire life, and although I have only been there for a year, I am full of pride when telling others about my school. I feel confident in the skills I am being taught, and I am being rewarded for my hard work. I look forward to graduating and becoming a proud Pittsburg State alumni in a few years."
Freshman,5,"Pittsburg State University has a small campus that is both beautiful and easy to navigate. The class sizes are much smaller compared to other state schools, which is a big plus. This allows for more interaction between the professor and student."
Freshman,4,"Although online is not how I expected my first year of college to be, it is not terrible. All of the teachers are learning how to manage it as well so you are not alone. The teachers are also very understanding. Overall, online learning is pretty manageable."
Freshman,4,"Pitt State is a very pretty campus, especially in the fall. It is the perfect size, not too many people but just enough to where you meet someone new everyday. Although covid has changed the way Pitt State normally functions they have handled it very well. Everyone wears a mask and the is hand sanitizing stations in every building. Overall I really enjoy going to school here."
Junior,4,"I have had a great experience at Pittsburg State University. Staff has been very helpful throughout my transfer process. I was able to transfer smoothly and begin classes with no issues. Tuition was affordable, and plenty of assistance was offered for anyone who needs it. PSU has many programs and degree paths that left many doors open for me to choose the correct future for myself. PSU is much less about attending a college, but rather being apart of a community. I have found family at PSU. You may find a good education elsewhere, but never the community that is at PSU."
Graduate Student,4,"I took 1 course online, my senior year. Prerecorded lessons were used to teach and we interacted through canvas board live at least a couple times a week. Quizzes, discussions, critical thinking, etc..."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the size of the campus and classrooms, it felt intimate. I would change the lack of african american representation."
Freshman,4,"My orientation was online, which I was nervous about thinking I would be left behind or lost in information, but that was not the case. I had a one on one meeting with my Advisor and a small group to better understand every dynamic."
Senior,4,"I personally do not like online classes; it is easy for me to get A's but I do not retain the information without an in person lecture. A lot of my classes have labs so it was hard to do them without the proper tools. Most of my professors did a great job transitioning to an online course, but some courses felt a bit repetitive every week."
Senior,4,"I enjoyed my program once I got to the higher level classes. The dorms were not as nice as my first school, but they did a good job if you had a maintenance request. It was hard to meet new people if you were not involved in a sport or in Greek life. My first semester was rough but it got better the longer I was there, and now I really enjoy it. My advisers are great and helped me a lot, but be prepared when you go to an advisement meeting or it will be a waste of time."
Graduate Student,4,"I took some classes online, before, the ones that were ready to be taken online and they were very god, I learned a lot even if I didn't have to go to class.
With the coronavirus, professors had to adapt to the format and they adapted very well. It was important for them to make students still learn the material for the real world, and they did. As a student that Spring 2020 was my last semester before graduating, it was very important for me to still learn, so I am very appreciative of the professors and their effort of adapting for me to be able to keep learning."
Sophomore,4,"The staff around campus are very knowledgable about their subjects, the surrounding community, and the campus. They are willing to help the students. The housing can be iffy at times, but overall okay. There are many services for the students on campus like massage chairs, mock interviews, and a pantry for struggling students."
Niche User,4,"I took a college visit here and ended up being late. Instead of having me wait another hour for a group visit, they had one of their tour advisors give my mom and I a personal one-on-one tour. Although this is not the school I intend on going to, I really do appreciate all they did to make my visit at Pitt State a great one. They’re a great medium sized school with a small towns that revolves around it. If I could give it a 4.5 I would."
Freshman,4,Pitt State has been a great experience so far. I have met tons of people with a great mindset of success. The party scene is crazy fun and the tailgates are unforgettable. I live in the dorms and the walk to classes are a reasonable distance. They recently renovated the library and it is a great place to go and bust out some studying. There is always tons of activities going on on campus constantly. The food at the dining hall could use some improvement.
Niche User,4,I have visited Pitt and my small time there made me feel like I was at home. I was greeted by many  nice people walking around campus. My parents are alumni and show me things that were not on the tour but make me like this place even more.
Freshman,4,Very good! Everyone is super friendly and welcoming and the teachers are all very helpful. The community supports the University in everything.
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed the fact that the university wasn't too large and not too small. All the buildings are just beautiful. Also everyone there was so helpful and so positive, it was very informative and reassuring."
Freshman,4,I like the atmosphere of the campus the most. It is extremely calm and relaxing and it has gorgeous scenery in the central courtyard. I also love the staff and professors I have had a chance to really talk to so far. They are extremely helpful in various aspects and are willing to drop everything if that means their students will succeed.
Junior,4,"All of my teachers know my name and I enjoy the college town feel. Sometimes, classes feel a bit limited though."
Sophomore,4,My experience with Pittsburgh State university has been very excited. I had a great first semester and the people were pretty friendly. The staff members were awesome and I made some great relationships with some teachers as well. I got the chance to get really close with classmates and teammates too!
Senior,4,"I liked all the activities that are offered along with student life. There are fun activities hosted throughout the year to bring students together to have a fun time, it really helps relieve some stress."
Alum,4,"The professors in the FACS department and College of Education are exceptional, and I can still count on them today when applying of scholarships, graduate school and new teaching jobs. 
Pittsburg State is very welcoming and has so many options for students to find their niche. The price is extremely competitive and I am happy that I chose Pitt State for my undergraduate education."
Niche User,4,"As an exchange student, I can tell the international office puts a lot of effort into expanding their international exchange opportunities and activities."
Junior,4,My experience at Pitt State has been very easy. All of the faculty and staff are there to help you get what you need in order to succeed.
Freshman,4,"I love how enthusiastic everyone is throughout campus and how encouraging the staff can be to push you to your goals. However, I do think that Pitt State could spend a little more money repairing things around campus instead of just semi fixing them."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful Campus, and many great people. Lots of international students to meet, and tons of activities1"
Senior,4,"Pitt State is a very small university. This can have both pros and cons. It is best for students who want that one on one learning experience with their professors versus being in a huge lecture hall with dozens of strangers. Pitt State has many clubs and organizations that help all the students come together as one. However, there is a lack in diversity in most cases and since Pittsburg is small, there is not much to do. But, being in a small town also has perks. Everything is where you need it; supermarkets, gas stations, many good restaurants, even a little mall. For Kansans, and other Mid-Westerners, Pitt State is a good choice, not only because it is usually close to home, but also because the programs help you become prepared for the future."
Junior,4,I like the smaller classes at PSU which allows the professors to see when students are struggling with a concept and make sure everyone is keeping up.  I wish more class times were offered in the upper level classes so it is easier to balance work and school.
Junior,4,"The environment is smaller so it is more personal and so the people are great. The town around the school is underdeveloped but do not let that sway you, the city of Pittsburg Kansas has a lot to offer, students just have to be willing to find it. The dining options on campus are not super great but there are options. Dorm life can be a place where students find thier closers peers. Overall great small town school!"
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the atmosphere of Pitt State. The class sizes are perfect size and I never feel like I get lost in a crowd.
Niche User,4,"My experience at Pittsburg State University was very memorable. The staff and people there are super nice and helpful. The campus is gorgeous, and it felt like a place I could see myself continuing my education. I have heard many great things about this school; the teacher and student relationships I heard are great and very beneficial."
Sophomore,4,The small class sizes help you connect with your professors and  build a good relationship with them.
Graduate Student,4,"Graduated with a bachelors from Pittsburg State University, and also worked as a student employee in the International Office.  Pittsburg State University is the heart of Pittsburg, KS, and the town focuses on making sure the college has ample funds and accessibility to thrive.  The town is very accepting of all students.  Many opportunities for student employment, various majors of all types, lots of opportunities to get involved, and great housing options.  Professors really care about their students.  Pittsburg State University is a place with a great opportunity to excel."
Freshman,4,I love all the new people you get to meet from different backgrounds. Also the professors are very kind and understanding people. However I would add more parking.
Sophomore,4,"I love this school! The community is amazing as well! There is nothing like game day in The Jungle! It doesn't matter where you travel, it is not hard to find a Pitt State Alumni."
Sophomore,4,I find the staff to be polite and very helpful and the students are polite and unique. The campus is kept clean and had various places to lounge between classes.
Junior,4,"Pittsburg State University is an all around great school.  The campus is small enough where you see someone you know walking, but not like a small town. Football season is so fun here too! The chemistry department needs some work though. It should be shaping our future doctors, not forcing them to teach themselves lessons."
Freshman,4,There is a lot to do on campus and it very interactive with students overall a great place to attend.
Alum,4,"This school is very much a gem! For the students who don't want to just party, then this is a good school for you at a very affordable price. The professors are amazing and very caring for the students, almost all of them are very approachable outside of class. Their is a big diversity of internationals and people of different cultures on campus. Even though I just graduated this past semester, the party scene was pretty consistent over the years. Its very easy for most students to find parties with ease. The local pittsburg community is okay, that's probably the biggest draw back I have, because their isn't many places to go hang out besides the bars. Though their has been an increase in fast food joints in the area which makes things easier. Still new students should be aware that late ""taco bell runs"" are a big thing here. 

Overall the best part about pitt state is the tradition, because when you are at the school you really feel like you apart of something."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy how much the campus feels like a home away from home, and it is absolutely beautiful. The professors are all very friendly and willing to help you with any questions about school work or even about life. The dining hall is very nice for a college campus. I have never felt unsafe on campus, and there is always something fun going on."
Freshman,4,"Love the college, great campus, swell food; however, internet is lacking, parking can be a hastle, charged for every little thing. Overall, very superb university."
Junior,4,I love PSU campus. The advisors are great and really work with you. The community is great too. The RAs in the dorms really work to get everyone involved in the activities on campus and in the dorms. I like that they are the only university in the country offering a 4 year degree in Wood Technology!
College Freshman,4,The professors in my major are awesome. They are always willing to answer dumb questions and point me in the right direction.
College Freshman,4,The safety is pretty good.
College Freshman,4,"Pitt State has been amazing so far. The financial process has been super stressful & it takes Pitt State a while to get financial aid to go through and what not, but it is a beautiful place, with many professors who pour into their students & want to see them succeed in the future. That is the university I've been looking for."
College Freshman,4,The classes are engaging. The people are friendly and the teachers are the best!
College Senior,4,I know for a fact that several Pittsburg State graduates go on to work for some of the top organizations in the country. I feel confident about my ability to find a wonderful job shortly after I graduate.
College Senior,4,"Living on campus definitely has its perks, they're close to class, well built and give everyone the opportunity to make friends. Some of the downfalls have to do with usual dorm style living such as, roommate drama and enforcement of quiet hours. Other than that living on campus is a pretty descent experience."
College Junior,4,I haven't heard of anyone being sexually assted on canpus.
College Junior,4,I'm not part of greek life but most of my friends are. They are great people. They do alot for the community and help out alot but since President Scott doesn't like Greek Life he hires people that are like minded.
College Junior,4,"So far, in my two years at Pittsburg State they have been filled with tears, good and bad but through that I have found my family. I am glad I choose Pitt State because without this college I wouldn't have been my forever friends."
College Freshman,4,"All the teachers are great, especially in the tech center."
College Freshman,4,The facilities available to both students and athletes is amazing
College Freshman,4,"Our campus police are great and help keep us safe, although there are usually no crimes on campus. I think everyone feels really safe and comfortable on campus. There are cameras all around the school and police near by. They also have emergency phone stations all around the campus. I feel perfectly safe walking alone on campus and have no problem at all."
College Freshman,4,"Classes are very comfortable with small sizes anywhere from 10-60 students. The courses are very easy to pass if you follow directions, show up, pay attention, and do your work on time. Professors are very helpful and are willing to do whatever is needed. Most classes are very relaxed and are fun and enjoyable. There are tons of different classes to take. There is a ton of variety and the options are endless."
College Freshman,4,"The school is really good at giving students job opportunities and experiences. Once you get your name out there, people will be asking about you. Knowing alumni is very beneficial because they are well connected to the community and school and are most likely able to get you a job. There are multiple recruiting events on campus and they have a large variety of companies to choose from. It is nearly impossible to not get help finding a job. If you ask, people will help."
College Freshman,4,Greek life at Pitt State is pretty cool. They aren't the stereotypical frats or sororities that you see on TV. They are just normal everyday people. They get very involved in the school and community and try to help out as much as possible. I think they represent the school and town very well and are very beneficial. There are numerous houses for Greeks for girls and boys. Greeks are not viewed any different than nonGreeks. Sometimes you can't even tell who's in a frat/sorority and who's not. Everyone seems to mind their own business and not judge anyone else based off of what they choose to do.
College Freshman,4,"The sports at Pitt State are great. Our football team is one of the best and has won numerous national championships, making it really popular for the town. Every game day the stadium is sold out and the parking lot is packed with tail gaters. Basketball and Track are also a big deal and they are very successful. Everyone works as a team and treats each other like family. The fan base is more than supportive, even if things don't go our way. School spirit is one of the best I've ever seen. Our mascot really gets the crowd going with his personality, games, and entertainment. All of the students get decked out in our school colors, most of them head to toe. Game days are the best days of college."
College Freshman,4,So far my college experience has been good. The teachers are very helpful when you need them and there are a lot of programs that try help as much as possible. The environment is very comfortable and fun. The school spirit is outstanding. The whole town gets involved in showing their pride and game days are very enjoyable. I would choose Pitt State over and over because it feels like home.
College Freshman,4,There is always lots of fun things going on!
College Freshman,4,Everyone is invited to parties at Pitt. I like that no one is excluded.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of foreign exchange students, and they help us learn a lot about their culture,"
College Freshman,2,Greek life isn't great. The young men and women who participate are usually snobby and don't care as much about academics than partying and going out.
College Freshman,2,"The big fraternatis on campus are wild. They are known for allowing underage drinking at their parties and no law enforcement cares. My main issue with the frats is that their members trash the dorms regualrly. trash and food stuffs in the halls and rubbed into the carpet, being loud and blaring music all night."
College Sophomore,2,"I personally believe Greek life at Pittsburg State negatively affects the social atmosphere of the campus. Generally speaking, they act like they are better than everybody else and it quickly becomes an annoyance."
College Junior,2,"I hate going into the financial aide office and having to call up there. I feel like I never get a straight answer. If they need more information from you, they won't let you know."
College Junior,2,"There is very little difference in the people around Pittsburg. With the exception of the international students, everyone is from similar areas. I wish there were a little bit more diversity."
College Junior,2,"There are giant potholes all over campus. This means that every time that it rains you have to swim to class. I know that there are worse problems to have, but I would like to be able to walk across campus without getting water up to my knee. Most other weather circumstances do not have much impact on daily life."
College Junior,2,There is very few transportation options for students without a car. Most bike or get a ride with friends.
College Freshman,2,"I lived on campus last year, and one thing I am not looking forward to for next year is the parking. Pitt State needs more parking spaces."
College Sophomore,2,Finding a rental house is a frustrating process. From shady landlords to past tenants who have ruined it for the next tenants. Contacting the Realtor is a task within itself. The nice houses go quick and you have to be willing to pay.
College Freshman,2,Everyone is always complaining about the parking but I live on campus right now.
College Sophomore,2,most of the scholarship searching is done at home
College Freshman,2,everybody is your stereotypical frat or sorority guy or girl.
College Senior,2,Pittsburg could definitely use more parking.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is just alright!!! For the most part the Sororities are pretty nice. But on the other hand Frats only hang with their brothers. Some frats are cool and some are just jerks. Most frats have closed parties (only girls allowed) which is not cool. They need to bring Black Greek life to campus because they would throw better parties and they would allow everyone to come.
College Sophomore,2,Pitt is really trying to work on the diversity. There are a ton of foreign exchanged students. The main thing I hate about Pitt is that they don't have black greek life.
College Sophomore,2,"Not the best, but it could be worse.  You will find yourself walking quite a bit, especially if you live at the dorms on the end of campus opposite the dining hall."
College Freshman,2,The nightlife at Pitt State is mostly for students 21 or older. So if you are younger there isn't much to do off campus.
College Junior,2,"""Safe Ride"" will take you home & to parties (if it's a cool driver they'll tell you where they've been dropping everyone else off)

- Depending on who's driving will be the difference in whether you'll be picked up to go home or not. I once spent an hr calling their line & 10min before it was going to be closed a guy answered, said they would be there in 45min. When I mentioned them closing soon, they said ""Oh ya, I guess we are"" & basically laughed at the fact that I had to walk. 
It wasn't like that a couple yrs ago which sucks. 

-For the Broadway bar area there is a bus that constantly circulates from S of town"
College Freshman,2,"Parking on campus isn't the best. Usually if you live in the dorms parking isn't usually bad, you'll learn specific times and days when parking is easier then others. Also there is usually the stadium parking and other side neighborhood roads that usually are there for parking, which are helpful when there are no parking spots left. Most incoming Freshmen don't bring their car just because the campus is small enough and close enough to just walk everywhere. Living off campus parking is worse, because you have to buy a specific color parking spot which usually are taken up by the students with early classes. I would say we need more parking."
College Student,2,"I find the process to be dysfunctional for students who are coming into school with no financial help from their parents. FASFA is designed for the parents information and is the sole key to gaining financial aid, but this does not work if the students is on their own, because according to FASFA their parents make too much money so the school cuts the cost they give to students to pay for school tuition/books, housing, food, etc. There are many students who struggle with this system and financial aid just tell them sorry there is nothing we can do."
College Sophomore,1,"Pittsburg State is great, it just wasn't, and isn't where I belong."
College Junior,1,Pittsburg needs a lot more options. We need more healthy and vegetarian friendly places.
College Junior,1,Parking at PSU is horrible. There are not enough parking spaces for the students at PSU.
College Junior,1,There is literally no way that you can go to this school and not know where a party is happening. There are very few people that do not participate in a drug of some sort. I find this very unfortunate. Maybe if there were more dry activities.
College Freshman,1,The food tastes like jail food.
College Freshman,1,They get mad over silly things and they all think they are better than everyone. I have had my safety threatened by people loving in the dorm and I CANNOT wait to get our of the dorms next year.
College Freshman,1,cheap houses are a couple miles away but anything close is super expensive and the houses are trashy.
College Junior,1,"I f***ing hate trying to find a spot to park. I am late almost everyday to class because of how s****y it is. If you havea  10 oclock class and drive to campus at 9:40, you will quite literally spend a half an hour driving around just waiting on other students to get out of class and leave, and then it is a mad dash to their parking spot. Awful!"
College Sophomore,1,Its a one step process but I never get a response if I receive or I don't receive any scholarship items.
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife here at Pitt is really hit and miss unless you're 21. You get dressed to go to a party and the party never ends up happening. They nightlife is good for GIRLS, FRAT BOYS, and ATHLETES. So if you're looking for party school this SCHOOL IS NOT A PARTY SCHOOL!!!"
College Junior,1,There are alot of drug and alchol visible here on campus after and during hours
Recent Alumnus,1,"I drove from another state each day to attend Pittsburg State University. My family thought I was crazy since there was another university right down the road from where I live. I regret it each day that I made that choice. 
The university did not put my best interest first and instead of standing by me like they should they just told me to ""tough it out."" they made poor choices and I had to pay for it. I wish I would have went to the university by my house because student there that had the same problem as me were backed up by there university supervisors. I would recommend that if you are going in the Education program to look into other universities. There are MUCH better programs and staff that will be looking out for YOU! I did not get what I paid for!"
College Freshman,1,"I recieved some financial aid, but I was still left to pay a hefty fee on my own. The financial aid office never contacted me to tell me my information was missing, so I didn't recieve any financial aid at all until three weeks into the school year whereupon my classes were threatening to be dropped. I would go into the financial aid office and they would provide little to know help in my application process."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare, especially in the evenings. People who live on campus and are trying to find a parking spot might spend fifteen to twenty minutes searching and then wind up parking off campus. When driving to class it is important to either show up very early, or a little late otherwise finding a parking spot is impossible."
College Senior,1,"It depends on the weekend but overall during the week it isn't the greatest. I don't drive my car unless I absolutely have to because I feel like there isn't enough of parking around campus, especially during lunch and dinner time."
College Junior,1,Nope They Are Not – The dorms at Pittsburg State University are small and only seem to be for freshmen.
College Sophomore,1,"I am a commuter, I drive forty-five minutes to school everyday and when I get there it is almost impossible to find a close parking spot. Sometimes I have to park several blocks from my classes or arrive early enough to drive around looking, waiting for someone to leave so I can take their space. What upsets me the most is that the students whom live right there on campus in the dorms, get to park outside the dorms within a fifty yards of their classes. All they have to do is roll out of bed and go to class. We commute, find parking and then have to walk to campus just so we can go to class. I guess it show how much we want our education but really it doesn't seem right to me."
College Junior,1,"The Process Has Issues – So after you fill out the FASFA, they have you verify everything. You have to take your W-2 to the Financial Aid office and a few other things. A lot of people recieve their aid late. 
A tip to get your aid on time is to be ridicuosly annoying to the Financial Aid office. Call them a lot to make sure they have everything. Also, when it is a week before school, call and ask how long it will be to you get your money, repeat until you have your money."
College Senior,1,"There is not much room for parking. However, that is mainly because all of the buildings are fairly close to each other. So most people just walk."

Freshman,5,"Absolutely Wonderful! Although we're only online right now, they have done an amazing job of  creating a sense of community."
Senior,5,We had online classes post March. I feel Pratt did a Pratt good transition to online classes. The professors delivered the information to the best of their abilities.
Freshman,5,"I didn’t feel any different because we changed to the online classes. Maybe we were lack of some materials but we still can did it on digital, and I became good at using them."
Freshman,5,"Pratt Institute is the only art college in New York, which has a campus. The school environment is perfect and safe.The teachers who taught me are all nice and responsible. The courses are interesting and value so I can learn a lot from them."
Graduate Student,5,I’ve never had an online experience. But the staff always answers full filling and in time. Pratt has very convenient online interface
Graduate Student,5,The great program. Always responds quickly. Good rviews from successful professionals I know. The best investment in your future career. I’m going to take a Master’s degree and while my registration I saw professors with a valuable background
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman 3D animation major and I absolutely love this school. Professors care, they are knowledgable and talented, and make class enjoyable yet challenging. I personally don't have anything against foundation year, but I am excited to move on to major-specific classes. Students here are very friendly, and I have made a very close group of friends. The location is great. Pratt is expensive, and I have seen several people I know transfer due to financial issues or just due to the difficulty of classes, so that is one thing I would like to see change. Pratt is a very diverse campus. My dorm, Emerson Place, was not finished at the beginning of the year, but it is a nice dorm and is basically done now."
Graduate Student,5,"It’s an excellent school, teachers are wonderful and famous in their field. Although facilities are kind of old...atmosphere is great, everybody concentrate on studying."
Niche User,5,I say. Pratt? YES Love it. Yep.  A R T  S C H O O L?   H E C K  Y E S  M A A M ok gotta get to one hundo characters soooooo beep beep boop bop
Junior,5,Pratt has amazing professors willing to help and offer year round opportunities on internships and others connections to help the students get involve into their career choice early in their college path. I would like for those one credit class to change since it can totally messed with your schedule and put the student at a point of paying more tuition. Overall Pratt is an excellent school and you will be prepare to face the real world of art.
Niche User,5,"My daughter went to the pre-college summer school in 2018, and loved it. The classes were amazing and she learned so much in a such a short period of time from her teachers."
Graduate Student,5,"Pratt changed my life. It's beyond the best school ever. I could won a lot of competitions under my professor's instruction. During school years I could have so many chances working in various companies located in Manhattan which is the center of the world! After graduation, I got a job in Manhattan. Now I am a creative director in New York. I love Pratt so much and appreciate everything from Pratt."
Graduate Student,5,Leonel is the SES department head and he's been great to me! I moved all the way from CA on a partial scholarship and have been welcomed with open and helping arms. I have a few semesters left and plan on staying in Brooklyn for work!
Graduate Student,5,Pratt is a great school. They have a wonderful Information Science department that has been very informative.
Junior,5,Currently Pratt is on the rise! Everything from the people to the professors are amazing. It’s currently the best place to be in art by far.
Sophomore,5,"So far, I really enjoy attending Pratt Institute. Classes are nice, professors allow creative freedom with some guidelines, and good critics. Gen. Eds. are alright, variety of classes to fulfill requirements. Foundation year was fine but wish there had been a major specific option. I commute, but from experience in the dorms, some are better than others due to aging dorms. Campus food is alright, decent options. It's good somedays and average others. Student body has good diversity. Plenty of extra circular activities to partake in. Greek life is small but present and active. The party scene isn't big like state schools but there are parties that happen every weekend for the most part. Clinton Hill is a great neighborhood nowadays, crime is low, nothing like the past Brooklyn of the 90s, especially Mrytle Avenue. Up to now, Pratt has been a great experience."
Junior,5,"Pratt was the best decision I ever made. I love everything about it. The campus is a gem of places in such a big city, I've loved almost every professor, the classes are stimulating, and the fellow students are amazing. I'm in my third year of the architecture program and I already feel more than equipped to enter into the working force."
Graduate Student,5,"I like to learn here. Along with a high academic level, all the professors, I've met was a very smart people to communicate. The combination of the high academic level of professors very well organized opportunities through facilities and rich history makes Pratt a unique place to get education from."
Junior,5,"I transferred to Pratt 2 years ago from a state college and I love it! My experience here is so much better, especially considering it is located in NYC."
Niche User,5,I am a current High school Senior and will be attending Pratt beginning in the fall of 2018. Overall I think that this school is one of the best art institutes out there. Its campus is gorgeous and located in a perfect spot if you love the city but don't want to live right in it. It has an amazing arts program and I am very excited to be a part of all of it in the fall.
Freshman,5,"Pratt has a gorgeous campus. Surrounded by the concrete Jungle of Brooklyn, Pratt's campus offers an escape with its trees and sculpture gardens. Everyone I have met is friendly and open to appreciating other people's work. Pratt not only teaches you more about your craft but also helps you find your unique style."
Niche User,5,"the campus is beautiful, i love the work area that this school provides. The students are friendly and the professors are great with the students"
Freshman,5,I think that the reviews on Niche of Pratt Institute are out dated. Pratt has come a long way in just a few years and the reviews are very inaccurate. It is a great school with great professors. An amazing campus and an amazing surrounding area
Sophomore,5,"LOVEEEEE. The students, professors, staff and the cats are amazing. Everyone feels comfortable, free, and happy. Classes are of high quality and students really learn and do their best efforts. There are so many extremely talented people. I currently go to Pratt and I love it. I couldn't be happier anywhere else. An environment like this makes you feel confident and want to learn and do what you need to do. The dorms are not amazing but we're art students, we don't really care, because either way we'll make it cool and beautiful with our art. I believe Pratt gives the best education there is and after graduation I'm sure every graduate will be  incredibly successful. Unfortunately I can no longer attend Pratt because of lack of funds, but I will do everything I can to go back. This is why I'm applying to scholarships."
Niche User,5,I went to Pratt for a pre-college program and I really enjoyed it there. I am actually going to college there because I liked it so much!
Freshman,5,Love Pratt. It gives me the opportunities to expand my design skills and being in New York City really inspires students to do exactly that!
Niche User,5,"I went for a campus tour, and the experience was great! The reception was very nice, got us on a tour very fast. Two tour guides (students studying at Pratt) took us on a 2-hour tour, answering our questions while giving great information about the institution. The campus is beautiful, definitely a calm getaway from the busyness of New York city, with inspiring sculptures around a very green area. The studios looked very professional, and the security system is very fast and trustworthy."
Sophomore,5,Pratt is a great school. It is pretty rough getting used to the workload and the stress but all in all the teachers really know what they are talking about and are great mentors.
Sophomore,5,"Pratt is amazing in just about every way. Work is challenging but manageable. Profs are mostly accessible and know what their doing. Dorms are good, great if you consider the fact you get to live in the heart of Brooklyn! Food is fine, you can always step off campus when you need a change. Campus is adorable. And I love the hipsters. They are not pretentious and most are pretty smart."
Sophomore,5,"Pratt is the best. For me it's got the art focused curriculum and campus/student life I was looking for. I live in the dorms and am part of Greek life and have had a lot of great professors. Yeah the work load is a bit intense sometimes, but Pratt is worth it. "
College Junior,5,Courses and professors are extremely helpful in the learning process
College Junior,5,I degree from PRATT is very helpful after graduation.  It means you are fully prepared for any job .
College Junior,5,"The area used to be pretty bad in the last 30 years it's gotten a lot better, I feel very safe walking around alone."
College Junior,5,Pratt is very challenging and demanding but ultimately you get out of it what you put into it
College Junior,5,The place where you can express yourself fully.
College Sophomore,5,"Not really there. Except if you like to participate in the frat parties. One frat has amazing beginning of the year and end of the year parties, that is it. The other is always in the townhome and it's okay."
College Sophomore,5,"Pratt Institute excels in each program. All professors either practice in their fields or a well known theorists. All professors in New York are shared within all institutions. Meaning, each professor you have is probably also teaching at Cooper or Columbia or Parsons. Study abroad programs are major specific and are there to help excel your academic career."
College Sophomore,5,Very diverse community. Many international students as well as many different sexes. No one is looked down upon and all is accepted. Unique is encouraged.
College Sophomore,5,Pratt has a lot of security. Makes you feel very safe/
College Sophomore,5,All alumni want to employee each other. Come and get the insider scope.
College Sophomore,5,Best dorm housing in all NYC. Have many options and all are spacious and give a true college experience.
College Sophomore,5,Pratt is a dynamic school which is truly the center of art in NYC. We allow for all different disciplines and integration between the fields similarly to that of the Bauhaus.
College Sophomore,5,"So so many students have landed amazing internships during their time at Pratt. Alumni are proficient in their fields and many of my teachers are Pratt Alumni that are extremely successful and are giving back to the school through their teaching. I have no worries for my career after Pratt. As long as you work hard and put in all the hard work and time required, the real world will be a breeze."
College Freshman,5,Pratt has a wonderful team of security guards 24/7 all throughout campus and beyond campus by making sure nearby streets are protected as well. The security headquarters allows students to register electronics and bicycles in case of theft. I feel extremely safe walking alone and at night on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Emails are constantly sent out about internships and jobs going on around campus, I am constantly exposed to all of the possibilities that Pratt offers us. Also, constantly reminded about how many successful people graduated from Pratt and that we can achieve that goal too."
College Freshman,5,The courses are challenging and can be overwhelming but in the end theyre a great experience and helps one build on their creativity and own personal works. The professors really want you to improve and care about you even outside of a classroom environment.
College Freshman,5,I was worried moving in to campus but Pratt hires the friendliest residential advisors and creates a positive atmosphere within all dorms.
College Freshman,5,"The greek life on campus is very friendly and unique, nothing like a cliche frat or sorority house. They help out the community and campus and do really great things. They have open arms to anyone who wants to join and will gladly accept anyone regardless of race, color, religion, origin, or grade."
College Freshman,5,"They offer a wide range of sports for those who want to join a team such as tennis, basketball, volleyball, etc. As well as many different types of work out equipment for those who wish to be more athletic and fit."
College Freshman,5,"Pratt's motto is ""be true to your work and your work will be true to you"" everyone encourages you to create past a salary, they want you to surround yourself and interpret art to its true potential."
College Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed Pratt it's been like a family to me, it has helped me so much in what I want to do in my career."
College Freshman,5,"I feel like I have found the school of my dreams.  I am doing what I love in New York, the place i have been longing to be my whole life.  It is perfect for me and I couldn't be more happy with my experiences.  It is great to be able to be doing what I love and learning so much along the way with such helpful directed guidance from the talented professors."
College Junior,5,It's pretty good since all down the street are restaurants.
College Sophomore,5,"Don't party too hard, kids. If you get lower than a 2.0 GPA at Pratt, they'll expel you."
College Sophomore,5,"the things that the admin should see/control all seem sensible to me, and make me feel safe"
College Freshman,5,Brooklyn is a great place to live in because we are a couple stops away from  Manhattan and although it is urban the area in which Pratt is located in is nice and refreshing after a long night in the city.
College Freshman,5,A billion different types of restaurants
College Freshman,5,"I'm a writing major, it's definitely one of the smallest (and for sure the un-coolest) majors at Pratt. The program has it's own foundation year and you take roughly 95% of your classes with other writing majors. As I said before, it's a teensy-tiny major, we started the year with 35 freshmen and I've consistently heard over and over again about what a ""big"" class we are. The smallness of the program definitely lends itself to insularity/cliquey-ness but that's kind of to be expected. Overall, I really like it."
College Freshman,5,"I'm a writing major, it's one of the smallest programs on campus. We started the year with 35 freshman and I've heard from several people that this is apparently a ""big"" class. We have our own foundation year and take 95% of our classes with other writing majors, which makes it feel a bit insular at times. Overall, however, I love it! It's a really unique program (Writing BFA) and the way it's structured is pretty cool."
College Freshman,5,"Brooklyn is bomb. Yeah, Myrtle Ave is can get pretty sketchy after dark, but overall the surrounding area is pretty great. There's lots to do/see within walking distance of campus & the rest of Brooklyn/Manhattan is super easily accessible via the G train."
Freshman,4,"Absolutely Wonderful! Although we're only online right now, they have done an amazing job of  creating a sense of community."
Sophomore,4,"Pratt is a really good school! I love being in Brooklyn but still having a physical campus with a green space. I especially love the Pratt cats that live on campus, they're super cute. The majority of the classes I've taken are very challenging but in a good way. It's important to push yourself in these classes and make them what you want them to be. A lot of assignments are open-ended and have room for interpretation - use that to your advantage and make your assignments things you would want to see in your portfolio."
Senior,4,"Pratt has a lot of creative energy from all fields of design that keeps you constantly inspired. The professors are from all walks of life, and they are experienced and professionals which is great for students. I love the fact that I can take classes in any design course other than my major and get exposure to new skills. The campus is great however the campus life could be a little more active. The students could be more involved to make the best experience."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed the community at Pratt.  You truly get out what you put in, as everyone is generally helpful and caring.  Professors can be a hit or miss though, it's important to plan ahead when choosing classes in order to get the most out of your education.  Since art/design tends to be on the more subjective side, its almost imperative to have a good relationship with your professor to receive a decent grade.  If you're willing to work hard and spend countless nights in studio for your dream then it's a wonderful place to be."
Freshman,4,"Very expensive, but a very good education thus far. I'm really enjoying my college experience so far and I hope to continue my education here. A lot of work but if you are passionate about art, much of it will not feel like work. It is easy to truly commit yourself to your work/art and spend quality time on it. If only the food was better!"
Freshman,4,"My judgement of Pratt is a little skewed because I'm an architecture student, so I spend most of my time in Higgins separated from the rest of the school, so I'll mainly talk about my experience in Architecture. 
Most of the teachers I've had or I've seen are very good and competent; there aren't many bad teachers. 
The classes are hard and the workload is extremely intense, although I think it will be tough regardless of where you study. I do feel like I've learnt a lot though and that I'll continue to learn more. 
The sports facilities are good, but we're a D3 Art school so it's nothing incredible, but from what I've seen the coaches and everything is good. 
Depending on where you dorm you'll have different experiences. I'm in the newest Emerson building which is very nice but some of the older ones need some renovation.
The school is very expensive, which is unfortunate, and the housing and meal plans are also quite expensive, so lots of students live off campus in later years."
Junior,4,I was expecting the school to be more rigorous and intense however it is the opposite. The classes are extremely chill and the teachers are very lenient. The students are also very relaxed with their course work. The stress is still high but not enough to lose sleep.
Freshman,4,"The students and faculty are both helpful and friendly. My only complaint is how expensive everything is (food, supplies, etc.). But then again, most art schools are like this."
Freshman,4,"Pratt is only campus school at Manhatten. With 3 pratt cats, my school like was better than I expected."
Junior,4,"Pratt is a small but very diverse community of talented individuals. I have learned a lot from both my professors and my student peers. If you ask, many professors will go out of their way to help you succeed in your education."
Sophomore,4,"Pratt is great. The campus is beautiful, the community is positive and who doesn't like cats? The teachers care about their students and really try helping them towards their goals."
Freshman,4,My experience with Pratt was amazing. I loved the people. I loved the food. I loved learning new things. My favorite part about the college was that I made a lot of friends. The people at Pratt were very warm and welcoming. The professors taught me everything that I need to know.  I was involved in workshops and clubs. The parties are also great. You can meet new people there and have a great time. I loved that my classes were small. It was more of a one-on-one environment. It really helped me learn better. Taking walks in Central Park during my breaks was also fun. The fresh air and trees were really calling my name. I have nothing bad to say about Pratt. Enjoy your time there and it will be worth it.
Freshman,4,Really unique garden style campus in the middle of downtown Brooklyn. The food and housing are mediocre but the professors are knowledgable industry professionals.
Freshman,4,"I've only attended Pratt for a semester and a half but so far I am very happy with my life here. The student body is very diverse and accepting, classes are challenging but makes you improve, the food is acceptable though could definitely be better. Pretty sure most people choose Pratt mostly due to its campus and location, which is excellent especially for artists looking to network or get inspiration from the dozens of museums in the city."
Sophomore,4,"As a student of Pratt Institute, student to faculty ratio is awesome. Because of small size class group, students here get numerous advantages and close assistance from the professors. Professors are also very friendly. The only downside of Pratt is the burdensome tuition."
Junior,4,"I love my school! The best thing about Pratt Institute are its faculty. I feel that the Professors genuinely care about their students and help in any way they can to help us succeed. The cost of attending Pratt is rather high, however I receive a substantial amount of financial aid but even that does not cover the entire tuition."
Sophomore,4,"A beautiful campus with a good amount of diversity. While not known for sports, the creative opportunities Pratt presents to its students is commendable. While I still have three years to look forward to, I can safely recommend this school for those pursuing a creative career, especially ones who wish to work with like-minded individuals."
Senior,4,"It’s a great community that is build within your class and your major. Although the years are tough, the stress is high and the sleepless nights frequent, I have gained a lot of experience that can help me and prepare me for the future."
Freshman,4,Overall the school is really nice. The students take their work very serious and they don't slack off. Everyone is on top of their design work
Sophomore,4,"For me, Pratt was the beginning of my interaction with the art world. The school has taught me how to respect, evaluate, and practice my profession in the context of our current societal state. Without my great professors, I would be completely unprepared in beginning a career path."
Junior,4,"Pratt excels at most everything. It's a great school with amazing professors who know their stuff and treat you like an equal, rather than a student since they acknowledge that you'll be competing for similar jobs as you make your way into your respective fields. 
The only problem I really have with Pratt is that it's not as competitive as I'd like it to be. The critiques on work feel like their there to make students feel good about themselves rather giving them helpful feedback that will lead to stronger work. However, it's still a very constructive environment where everyone helps each other out."
Junior,4,"The education is what you make of it, but the social life is harder to get into. You get what your money is worth if you make the effort and have personal motivation for innovation."
Freshman,4,"So far it is has been a good experience, I haven't had any negative experiences and most of the facilities are physically accessible to people with disabilities. The campus is in a nice area, and there are a lot of entertainment options. It's pretty cool."
Senior,4,The best thing about Pratt is the students. Everyone is so hardworking and you meet many people that are so talented. The bad thing about Pratt is that it is expensive and they don't really help with financial aid.
Junior,4,The Fashion department is great. I think Pratt's registration periods need help though because as of now it is really hard to get in to the classes you want. Also the way its set up is annoying.
Graduate Student,4,"At Pratt, opportunities to challenge ideas and explore new potentials are overflowing. I first became interested in Pratt when I saw their groundbreaking work in creating the first graduate program in Museums and Digital Culture in the world. I knew immediately that I wanted to be able to say I was part of something this fundamental in the future of our museums and libraries. It wasn't until the end of my first semester when we had elected a new president of the United States that I realized how important it was that I was in school, and not just any school, but that I was at Pratt. Right there and then, my mission expanded into a call to action through my education and to arm myself with the power to protect the voices and the communities of museums and libraries. The professionals who have supported the academics at Pratt were also there to provide that support to those students who were ready for the fight."
Freshman,4,So far the classes are good and I feel one can make the transition from student to the workforce easier.
Freshman,4,Pratt's campus is the best in New York City and one of my favorite things about the school. The courses and professors are good so far. The food and dorms are mediocre.
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed the educatio at Pratt Institute. I learned more anout the world and my own self, and I still utilize the skills I learned through my own personal and professional life."
Freshman,4,"Pratt Institute, from my time being here so far, is a wonderful school. All of my instructors are well-versed in their field and active in their respective field, bringing experience with them as a supplement to the concepts they teach. They're always willing to help, and they're open to new ideas and ways to solve problems. The campus is gorgeous, however some of the freshman dorms could be improved- Cannoneer Court specifically does not have ""work rooms"" properly equipped to deal with art students' demands. There are no sinks to wash out brushes and paint without clogging the drain, there are a limited number of desks, there are only two rooms designated for work- so they get crowded fast. Also, sometimes the administration can either be slow or ineffective, and some of the hours of somewhat important resources, the nurse especially, are incredibly inconvenient to the average student's schedule."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at Pratt Institute, I am currently in the foundation program  that gives students access to the basic knowledge and skills which will be used later during sophomore year. The program have a helpful and professional group of faculty that lead the student step by step into the art world. From drawing to film, students get to experience and work in all kinds of medium and find the right path for themselves and find who they really are as artists."
Alum,4,With my time at Pratt I was able to explore a wide range of artistic idea and platforms that lead me where I am today. The school itself is located in Brooklyn which puts it in a reasonably priced living area while also being shouting distance from manhattan. It also is one of the most beautiful campuses you will see with an ever growing sculpture garden and red brick in every direction. The faculty care about the students and I still receive emails from the head of my department about any job opportunities that are presented to them. The food is what you would expect of a public school but most people eat off campus and as long as there is coffee the students are happy. Overall the experience at Pratt helped shape who I am today and has put me on the right path for the jobs that I want.
Freshman,4,I'm having a very good time. I love all my classes and am comfortable in my dorm. The security and staff are personable and I love all my professors. Phenomenal library and studio spaces.
Freshman,4,"Overall, the campus is beautiful. The professors are alright but some are inexperienced in teaching. The food isn't the best. And as a student, we spend way too much money on art supplies."
Junior,4,Pratt is a really great college for art and design. There is a wide range of students where you can learn from each other also with the guidance of professors. One thing that I will like to change in the institution is its high tuition. 
Sophomore,4,Freshman year was rough but those of us who stuck through got a lot out of it. I think a lot of the complaints are just people doing their best and voicing concern instead of skipping out on their education. Sophomore year feels more like I'm starting my career. I'm curious to see how the rest my years here go. 
College Freshman,4,It's a lot of work and sometimes you get really harsh crits but it's all worth it. They're just trying to get you used tot eh real world.
College Freshman,4,They all are very passionate about what they do because they all are working artists themselves. They aren't just teaching because they can't get work anymore they do it because they love it and they have the passion for it.
College Freshman,4,Having a degree from Pratt will be good. Having that name alone is pretty damn amazing.
College Freshman,4,"I would choose this school again because it is challenging nd it is a lot of work but when you look back at stuff you made at the beginning of the year to stuff you made for your last final, it's amazing the progress and growth you see."
College Junior,4,Security and cameras keep us safe all day long.
College Junior,4,Learned a lot and hopefully more in the future to.
College Junior,4,Jobs aren't as hard as some people think they are.
College Sophomore,4,I am in Industrial program right now and there are great professors who lead the students to dynamic learnings.
College Freshman,4,"I feel quite safe on campus. I enjoy the, albeit gentrified, neighborhood as well."
College Sophomore,4,"I've seen the health and safety departments grow in the past 3 years that I've been attending this school and I believe it will continue in the right direction, slowly but surely."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek Life at Pratt is a small community of well rounded students who are all friends. A lot of the Pratt community know Greek students but are unaware of the Greek community. Greek Life at Pratt strives to help campus life thrive to better the Pratt community and surrounding communities as well. The Greek organizations do well in collaborating with other community clubs at Pratt, and I am a proud member of the Greek community. I have gained tremendous experiences and leadership skills through Pratt Greek Life. I highly recommend students who are interested in Pratt Greek life to join, and the community is always welcoming."
College Sophomore,4,"Weed is a big thing, but it's an art school so it should be expected."
College Sophomore,4,It seems like a great place to be.
College Sophomore,4,I have been offered an assistantship to teach in my field and overall it seems like there is a strong network here.
College Sophomore,4,To my understanding it's generally safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Seems like a wonderful place, but I'm starting in the Fall do I really don't know yet."
College Sophomore,4,"The variety of classes is amazing! There are so many electives I want to take in and outside my major. The class sizes are also small so your teacher is really able to get to know you and your work. Styles vary by teacher and major, but as for COMD, most classes are crit style. Foundation year is usually half in class working and half crit. Professors are all amazing! But I have heard of some people having issues with profs. As long as you value your professors quality over the time when scheduling, you'll have no issues."
College Sophomore,4,"I am in my Sophomore year at Pratt Institute and so far I am loving my professors and classes. The first year is very basic in foundation, but I loved the focus on fine arts. You learn a lot of basics that are applied to all majors and make friends from nearly every major in the Art and Design schools. Sophomore year I am finally entering my major and taking courses that apply to it. I enjoy them a lot, but it is similar in a foundation structure. Junior and Senior work is amazing, so I am looking forward to how my skills develop through the program."
College Sophomore,4,"There is security everywhere, so it's definitely a safe place."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, my experience at Pratt has been lovely. It's easy to make friends here because of how foundation year (freshman year) works at this school. The campus is rather small, with many sculptures dotting the grass and many updated facilities to help you do your work. I only wish I came to Pratt first rather than transferring from another school."
College Senior,4,small classes so there is always a one on one
College Senior,4,There are guards and ID machines at every turn
College Junior,4,Its very conceptual and moderate.
College Junior,4,Fine art teachers are the best they inspire you.
Graduate Student,2,"Pratt is a mess. I am graduate architecture student and whoever runs facilities there is extremely ignorant and is wasting everybodys time. Things could've been managed more efficient. There is a paper sign up sheet to laser cut? Whole world already figured out how to use simple online booking system. It is disrespectful to charge ridiculous amount of money and make you wait entire day to cut your file. Other schools solved that. Pratt is outdated and old-school, not “experimental and innovative” as the market themselves."
Freshman,2,Very clique-y. The facilities are in shambles. None of the professors had the best intention of the student in mind.
College Sophomore,2,No one really cares about each other and school spirit is quite low. There are no sororities that divide people up.
College Sophomore,2,"Since it is an art school, no one really cares about it."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life at Pratt is very limited. We have one frat and two sororities. The frat will throw one party a year and the sororities just do community service and stuff together. They aren't very elite because they struggle to have pledges every year.
College Sophomore,2,"Pratt has little to none when it comes to sports. Only those who play the sports really care for the teams. As far as the gym goes, its about the size of a four bedroom apartment and doesn't have a lot of equipment. There around 10 ehlipticals, 10 treadmills, and then one of each miscellaneous machines. There is a dance studio used for a variety of classes offered every day of the week. And there are tennis courts and a basketball court in our field house. Pool at LIU is available to Pratt students, but its about a 20 min walk. The gym is used by a large amount of students, and most don't have an issue with it. It is just nothing compared to the facilities at larger schools."
College Junior,2,I personally did not know Pratt institute had a Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"I dont eat much and the freshman meal plan defintely isnt for me. I was forced to pick one and I got the smaller plan but I still had around $300 dollars at the end of the 1st semester that I had left to spend, and I would've had even more if I didn't go to the C-store almost every week. The food from the Cafeteria is almost never hot, maybe slightly warm, and there isn't a large amount of variety. The pie shop does have fresher food like rice bowls and crepes but the pizzas are usually cold and they dont always heat them up long enough. The largest problem I have with the campus food is that it is too overpriced. I could easily go to myrtle and find another 20 restaurants that are cheaper and fresher and healthier but I can't go there because I was forced to get a meal plan"
College Freshman,2,"I may be wrong about this but I believe all the freshman dorms have the same cost which is completely unfair if you live in the Can. I was lucky enough to have the room almost always to myself in the first semester but there is barely any walking room or free space. The room I have also has an incredibly squeaky floor. The walls are thin and the lounges are tiny on the first floor, but if your lucky they'll have this place torn down because it is temporary."
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid office and bursar has a way of avoiding answering the phone and calling you back. In fact, my financial aid officer in particular has messed my finances up in particular with false information and constantly shows a lack of interest. From fellow classmates complaints I would assume most of the office is the same way. For the price of Pratt, it is disappointing and upsetting."
College Freshman,2,"I have never really looked into off-campus housing because I find the dorms the best choice for me because of proximity. I have been to student's apartments who live off campus and they live in a variety of poorly maintained spaces, average spaces, and very well/newer spaces."
College Junior,2,the allow police to arrest students humiliatingly
College Freshman,2,Maybe I just don't know about them yet but there aren't many parties on campus
College Freshman,2,"Ugh. Financial aid is made way more complicated than is necessary. The bursar's office is confusing & miserable. Also, if a bursar hold is placed on your account, they don't inform you. Most people only find out when it comes time to register for the next semester."
College Freshman,2,"On-campus housing ranges from rough to super-rough. As a freshman, I'm really only familiar with the three freshman dorms Stabile, Pantas, and the Cann. Of those three, here's a quick breakdown:

Stabile: one of the newer buildings, it's probably the most aesthetically pleasing of the three. Features decent sized suite-style rooms and a really pretty, super zen lounge. Right next to Cannoneer, it's a pretty inconvenient location--about as far from classes as possible. There seems to be an above-average number of international students living in Stabile compared to the other two freshman dorms. They have a pretty serious roach problem.

Pantas: located in the oldest building of the three, right at the center of campus. It's known as the ""best"" dorm, presumably due to it's convenient location and slightly-larger, suite-style rooms. Rooms on the 7th and 8th floors have really pretty views of campus. However, the hallways are super prison-y and the basement (where the laundry room & workroom are located) is horrific. Smells like weed 24/7. Has roaches and mice.

Cannoneer: the worst dorm in all categories. The rooms are teensy-tiny and the restrooms are shared with everyone in that hallway. There are workrooms on each floor that are actually pretty decent. The building itself was originally intended to be temporary and you can totally tell. Has the same vermin as the other two buildings, plus wasps. Literally there is a wasp infestation in the Cann. Wasps."
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't a lot of parties, at least not until you get into your junior/senior year. Most upperclassmen will not invite freshmen/sophomores to parties, kind of going with the whole isolated feel that everyone has who goes there."
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms are dirty, small and not worth the money. I ended up learning more about how to sway my teachers views of my work during critiques than the actual material itself. I went through the entirety of freshman year on 4-5 hours of sleep a night and never felt safe going out alone unless I was on campus. Ended up transferring to a different school because the school is not like how it's portrayed at all."
College Freshman,2,"I feel safe on campus but some parts off-campus are super sketchy. Like when a man chased me on the g train, that was fun"
College Sophomore,2,"The food is bad, but the servers are wonderful."
College Sophomore,2,"The drink selection and smoothies are great. The food is horrible. Well, not disgusting, but it's usually tasteless or I just feel like I should not eat it because it seems unappetizing or that it's over/undercooked. I would just rather eat off campus and go to the grocery store to make my own food."
College Sophomore,2,"People do participate in sports teams and go to the gym, but hardly anyone ever really goes to watch the games. Mainly because we go to an art school and athletics are not that significant."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's almost nonexistent, but it's beginning to gain some attention!"
College Junior,2,I would not eat from school. They're too expensive for what they're worth.
College Junior,2,"It is cheaper to live off campus; however, it being New York City, it is very hard to find an apartment that is reasonably priced if you want a safe and clean place."
College Junior,2,"As an international student, it is very hard to get an aid from school. Not all international students are wealthy. It shouldn't be this costly to get such an education."
College Junior,2,We have two fraternities and sororities. People can careless about them. Although they look like they do a lot of philanthropies.
College Junior,2,"It's an art school, so it can only go so far."
College Junior,2,Your dorm is small and most of the time you have to share it with one or two other people.
College Student,2,"I eat really healthy, and I am never satisfied with the food here. They over-salt or over cook things. They offer little to no veggies, and when you find something you like that isn't terrible for you, they don't keep it in stock. There is no consistency (we once went two weeks without fresh fruit) If you don't have to get a meal plan, DON'T!"
College Freshman,2,"You have 4 on-campus options for food: the caf, the pi shop, the starbucks station in the Pratt Studios, and the c-store. The pi shop has mediocre pizza, crepes that I haven't tried, smoothies, ice cream, and a small assortment of other foods of questionable quality (my roommate found mold in her pasta). The caf has mediocre salads, mediocre wraps, mediocre sandwiches, and mediocre expected foods like fries, chicken strips, burgers, and pasta. None of this tastes good, except for a few of the things that're really bad for you (waffle fries, chicken strips). I'm lactose intolerant, so I complain more than other people due to my limited options. I know a lot of people that think the caf is totally fine, but I'm really tired of it. The starbucks station has decent sandwiches and bagels. The c-store has easy mac and cereal and all the college student food your heart desires."
College Freshman,2,"Nobody really cares about sports here. We have a limited selection of options, and no facilities for baseball, football, or soccer. I have no problem with it, though. The gym has a decent workout room, as well as a variety of free classes. No complaints from me."
College Sophomore,2,The people are okay but rude
College Sophomore,2,Housing is pretty bad if I had the money I would move off campus
College Sophomore,2,The facilities are pretty okay for what we have. But there are only certain sports. Most of them being not very popular for the students attending the school.
College Freshman,2,the cost of printing is expenisve and takes alot of time and there arent alot of competition or alternative places to go and they will always steal your money
College Freshman,2,the school is really really really good about asking you to pay your admission on time however be prepared to wait two to three months to get your refund
College Junior,2,"weather doesn't really affect the campus, its new york so it has all kinds of weather, sometimes its cold sometimes its hot, sometimes its windy, list goes on. but access to the campus is easy and effective so the campus is within areas of trees and shelters."
College Junior,2,international student not acceptable for financial aid 
College Junior,2,"Well as a graduate we don't really have time for school spirit and being apart of the school activities but from i have see its pretty good, everyone comes out to support when they can."
College Junior,2,"well its pretty average for the diversity of the campus, they are a lot of different cultures and Religious background but mostly Asian students, other than that everyone is pretty friendly and does there own little thing, if you want to get involve their are main events and things to do. some of the challenge for the international kids from countries what english isn't there first language it takes them awhile to express themselves properly if they are proficient in it "
College Sophomore,2,"Ugh Palermo's Pizza if you have no car,which most don't. if you do, then you still have a bit of a drive before ""good"" food. Utica just isn't that poppin."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms at Pratt are average and the options are ok. The social atmosphere was very awkward and uncomfortable during my first year. The cost's is reasonable, and the housing process was somewhat frustrating because of the lack of guidance from my school"
College Sophomore,2,The Cann is disgusting and smells bad and its awful
College Freshman,2,"Most people are wealthy--it is an expensive school--but not everyone. Not very diverse racially. Everyone seems pretty liberal, but it depends."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot of parking, can be a nightmare. Spaces are limited and it's very expensive to have a car on campus. Freshman aren't even allowed cars."
College Senior,2,"The G train isn't always reliable, and it's the only way to get into the city. They run pretty smoothly in the morning and afternoon, but the later it gets, the longer the wait becomes. Buses do run around the area though, and may be a better alternative. Pratt does work with a car service though, if you can afford to take a cab."
College Freshman,2,The weather up in Utica typically gets snowed in a lot but school never gets closed down. Though if it isn't snow everyone hangs out outside. SInce Utica is a pretty place
College Junior,2,"Only train nearby is the G, and the G is always slow and under construction. Not too reliable. You always have to transfer to another train to get to anywhere."
College Junior,2,"Parking may go from 5 minutes up to 20 minutes or more. The annual parking I believe is $200 per year which is not bad (I just don't have the money!). The parking ticketing are ridiculous and the fine expensive $45.00! I use a car because it is very inconvenient to get to Brooklyn from NJ. It  takes 3 trains and many times 4 to get to Pratt and the ""C"", ""G"" ""A"". Take forever. The total trip by train is almost 2 hours and if there is delays it would take more time. Versus driving in by car, it will take much less time; but no matter what it is better to live in campus or as close as possible. Commuting is a hassle!"
College Junior,2,"Finding an apartment in New York is next to impossible. It is extremely difficult, expensive, and time consuming. I recommend coming way before school starts if you want to find something good instead of settling."
College Sophomore,2,"Very Expensive -Fun Themes – if u chose the right things it can be very good - there are a lot of options
and taco tuesdays and mongolian bbq wens!!! 

also veggy lowmein is good!  and waffles are great esp if u pick up a yogurt on way out w fruit cup to layer on top. coffee is awful. pie shop is horrible only get cheese slice. pastas r overcooked with too much sau5"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Because my portfolio was good, I got a huge amount of help from Pratt. And I'm thankful for that. But I don't see a lot of financial diversity on campus. I don't care about talking about the racial diversity, or lack thereof, because I feel like that's racist in itself to say that ""Pratt needs more black students."" I feel like the most important thing that a school can do is to allow many different students with all types of financial backgrounds to attend. I had to keep quiet about how poor I was, how my mom had to put up a second loan on our house to pay for school, and how I couldn't go out with my friends as much as they wanted to because my part-time job went straight to rent. Religious beliefs range from atheist to agnostic to Baptist to Jewish to Catholic to Protestant, and most people  open to their peers belief. We have a very strong Queer Pratt group that meets every week. But the fact that no one that I know, except for me, has had to reconsider going to school for another semester because of the debt they'll be in drives me crazy. Why can't more students will financial need be accepted and helped through Pratt's financial aide service?"
College Freshman,2,"Artist Not Atheltes – It's a art school, most of us what to make it big in the NYC art scene.
Their is hobbist who are athletic."
College Sophomore,2,"Its Brooklyn – Don't drive in Brooklyn unless you either grew up here or have lived here for several years. New York is no place to be driving anywhere because of the terrible traffic which is made worse by the lack of parking spaces and an abundance of parking meters. The subway is much faster and cheaper in the long run.

There is literally one parking lot that surrounds two of the dorms in the very back of campus. If you are living on campus, you don't need to park, if you live off campus, ride your bike or take the train."
College Junior,2,Where Is the Ride? There is no transportation provided for us. It would be nice if there was.
College Sophomore,2,Its blah. it could have a lot of potential if it just cleaned up its act a bit. it has a lot of kinks to work out before it reaches full capability.
College Junior,2,"The majority of the people here are White or Asian, with a sprinkling of all the other remaining ethnic minorities.  Of the Asians, most are Korean.  To be honest, it seems like half my classes consist of Korean students, carrying on in their native language when the professor's not talking.  As far as economic background goes, it seems like most everyone here is really well off, and if they aren't, they're rather good at hiding it and fitting in like they have lots of money to throw around.  Political beliefs definitely lean on the liberal end of the spectrum (heaven forbid you snark on the Occupy Wall Street protests, ha ha), and religion (or discussions thereof) usually amounts to cynical scoffing or apathy.  Sexual orientation hardly ever gets brought up, but there's a dorm floor for that, I believe."
College Senior,2,"There are no athletics at art school.  I once went to our ""big game"" in basketball against RISD, because I was friends with the girl who did the scorekeeping.  There were 5 people from Pratt in the audience and some friends of the team from RISD.  Our gym is pretty nice though.  I hear it's one of the biggest sports facilities in Brooklyn."
College Sophomore,2,"Many students fit into the artist drug use stereotypes.  Alcohol and Marijuana are commonplace but E, coke, acid, prescriptions are all present."
College Junior,2,"You are paying and receiving only the education, the education is stellar. The social life at Pratt is completely up to the student, which for some is fine, but some need a bit more in their area because they aree new to the city.  THe school almost refuses to put on concerts, open up our pool, or give a reasonable grant/budget to clubs or the radio station.  Minority clubs are always embattled to survive despite the claims that Pratt employs ""many"" minorities, the truth is they are only support staff and not instructors-who have to sue to get in."
Senior,1,I don't exactly fault the institute for its poor online education. It is just not possible to truly have serious art classes online.
Alum,1,"My experience of Pratt was pretty horrifying. I was recruited on a full ride to Grad school & decided to go but then was subjected to abusive behavior by the students in the program. At the time, I was the only out transgender woman in the program & one of the women in the program & her husband decided to call me a pedophile. Later they sent me video footage of half naked children. I filed multiple complaints & Pratt covered it up & threatened to have me arrested. The faculty at Pratt who initially recruited me were not professional nor skilled enough to handle the situation. Needless to say it had a devastating effect on me. Ruined my art career. I had a lot going for me before I went to Pratt but since going there my life was ruined. And the people who attacked me & got away with it continue to profit from acting violently. I guess Pratt is geared towards violent bigots. If that's what your looking for...."
Freshman,1,"If you plan on going to the school with financial aid expect them to fight you for it all the way until move in day and probably after, also no one in the financial aid office knows how to run their ""system"" so expect tons of calls to only be answered on deaf ears."
Freshman,1,"I am currently a freshman at Pratt Institute, and my time thus far has not been what I was anticipating. The staff and faculty are disorganized and unfriendly, and the students are left overworked after 9+ hour school days on top of 5+ of homework daily. The attendance policy is unrealistic and far too strict."
Freshman,1,"Really disliked going here, wish I had transferred. Most people are hipsters, but not friendly hipsters, and if you are not as hipster as them they take notice and isolate you. I would recommend Pratt if you are very liberal and don't care about the job you're getting after you graduate, but other than that, waste of time."
College Sophomore,1,"Freshman dorms are considered the ""nicest"" even though they are ridiculously small and have mice. Don't even consider living on campus for sophomore-senior. Upperclassman dorms are dirty, small, have poor lighting and just overall grungy. If your room doesn't have 50+ layers of paint on the walls consider yourself lucky."
College Sophomore,1,Brooklyn is tough. You won't feel safe and if you do you probably shouldn't feel that way. In a city like that you always have to be on your guard and if you go out with friends who aren't you end up worrying about theirs as well as your own safety. There's been a lot of iPhone thefts on Myrtle Ave (right next to Pratt) as well as other small crimes in the area recently.
College Sophomore,1,For single ladies it is the worst. Attractive straight men at Pratt are as rare as unicorns. There is a general lack of normal attractive guys and girls. Most people are hipster and kind of out there.
College Junior,1,they are very bad returning phone calls and do not seem to care that you need money. 
College Junior,1,"Pratt has a gym, I work there. There is basketball, cross country, and tennis. Most people are on a team to get a group workout. We don't win a lot and no one really comes to support the teams. A lot of people work out though and go to the fitness classes."
College Junior,1,There is one active frat and two semi-active sororities. Not a huge presence on campus.
College Junior,1,There are very little listing for off-campus housing at Pratt Institute. I have seen more posts on craiglists and their own web resources.
College Freshman,1,"The Campus Dining at Pratt Institute leaves a lot to be desired.  CulinArt is the third party company that supplies the majority of dining options, and their overpriced, and terribly gross food made me realize that I wasted money by signing up for anything more than the most basic of required meal plans for my first semester.  The best use of your meal plan is on the Starbucks Coffee on campus and the C-Store below Willoughby Hall where you can get normal groceries at double the price."
College Senior,1,Not somewhere I feel safe walking around in. People constantly are yelling or trying to talk to you. Police are always going up and down the streets we are close to. My dorm is right next to a drug trafficking house.
College Freshman,1,"I'm going to be very honest. The facilities are very old and very dirty. For a school that has such high tuition, they should use the money for better facilities. The bathrooms have a very strong odor, even certain hallways. When it rains it only gets worse. Most of the classrooms are old with black and white chalkboards, and the desk and tables are all worn out."
College Freshman,1,"I study at Pratt MWP in utica. There is a pub 5 mins away from campus, but obviously you must be 21 or older to get in. There isn't a whole lot of places open in Utica at night. Utica is mainly a place where refugees go to relax and where the elderly go to retire. There isn't much to the town. except for the pretty abandon buildings and the graffiti art. Also seeing the vines of nature taking over the buildings. There are a lot of dorm parties though and those are alright sometimes. Your best bet is to go to the Tram coffee house where they have a poetry open mic house every thursday night."
College Junior,1,"It's an art school.... a lot of people are going to do drugs. I feel like Pratt kind of just gave up and accepted this fact because they do nothing to stop it. Drugs is a casual topic here, even between the professors and students."
College Junior,1,"I hear about the sororities and fraternities maybe once or twice a semester. They don't do much, and even when they do it's not that great."
College Sophomore,1,"Expensive New York – Staying outside of school is very hard. I have seen friends struggle to find a decent place. They start their search at least 4 months in advance. Needless to say, the prices are sky high. It is not possible to have an own apartment around school unless you are extremely rich."
College Freshman,1,"A Whole Lot of Nothing – If athletics are an integral part of you choosing a school, you may want to skip over Pratt. There are no real teams here aside from the Cross Country team, and even they only have meets about 2 months out of the semester. It isn't that hard to find people to get together for a pick up basketball game, but good luck getting much else."

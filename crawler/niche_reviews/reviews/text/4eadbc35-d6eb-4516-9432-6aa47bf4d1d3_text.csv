Junior,5,"I never really liked to have online classes because I had the terrible mania of procrastinate everything, however when I had to take my first online class on SDSU it was the most amazing experience ever. First I could do my class at my own pace any time I wanted. Then my professors were always available to chat on email or have a zoo meeting to clarify any questions or concerns I had. In my online class i always had different and interestings assignments that always challenge myself to improve some skill or make the process of learning funnier and more interesting. Without any doubt I would take more online courses."
Junior,5,"South Dakota State University at first could be an intimidating college with a lot of students, however the most you live the experience there more you like it. I love my experience in SDSU because I feel like home even though I'm thousands miles away. Everyone is so friendly, all the facilities are super nice and equipped for the best experience you could ever have being a classroom."
Junior,5,"SDSU has an absolutely amazing campus. Not only is it beautiful, safe, and super easy to get around, it is also a home to me. SDSU is where cookies and cream ice cream was invented, and has its own dairy bar where they make their own ice cream right on campus! It has an awesome array of food choice from Einstein Bagels to Panda Express. The class sizes aren't too intimating and the professors are super caring. My professors always help me when I need it and send out reminders to turn in work. They genuinely care about my wellbeing. I have met some great friends here at SDSU and would recommend it to anyone."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, SDSU is a fun, diverse college. We have courses, clubs, and resources dedicated to the diversity of our school and awareness of global issues. The students and professors are all extremely friendly and made me feel welcome during my first year of college. Plus, the food and housing being great is a welcome bonus."
Junior,5,"I have taken a few online course and my professors did a great job. Online learning requires lots of self motivation, but having a good professor helps a ton."
Junior,5,South Dakota State University is a fantastic place. The professors are amazing and there is a great variety of classes to choose from. GO JACKS!
Sophomore,5,Love the environment I feel very welcome on campus.  The dorms are very nice and clean. Professors are very understanding.
Alum,5,All of my courses were online.  They were consistent every semester. Every wednesday assignments were due and every Sunday discussions were due. There were major assignments that forced students to collaborate.
Freshman,5,"They make you feel like family, not just a number. Please consider this college; it may seem small but at least you can get to know people easier."
Sophomore,5,"SDSU is a beautiful campus with lots of pride! It is incredibly affordable. It's liberal arts live in the shadow of its STEM degrees, but SDSU is known for its degrees in fields such as nursing, engineering, and the like. The professors are very helpful and knowledgeable, there are literally countless ways to get involved in clubs, and Brookings is a wonderful community! It could use more campus events on the weekends so there is more to do on campus when there is no class."
Sophomore,5,South Dakota State University has been an outstanding experience so far. I look forward to my next three years here in Brookings.
Sophomore,5,I have taken one class online so far and it was an outstanding learning experience. Would definitely recommend taking online courses through SDSU.
Junior,5,"Wonderful Staff, and peers and this schools. Professors really do take the time to help their students learn the material to make their classes easier. The people there are kind and hardworking whether it’s the custodial staff or anyone else!"
Niche User,5,"Great professors that always willing to help! The many sporting events allows you to never be bored. There are always construction areas on campus but that means they are constantly working to better themselves! Great school, great state."
Niche User,5,"I am a high school senior and have chosen to go to SDSU.  The reason is their great Animal Science program!  When I went for my visit they did an amazing job of showing me what they have to offer!  They have so much to offer in all areas academics, athletes and student life!"
Freshman,5,"I have loved the majority of my time here so far, the school has provided a very inviting environment for new students. There have been many events held for new students to allow them to get involved on campus, with clubs, and to meet new people. I would say that I haven't had a great experience with my first year advisor. There just hasn't been great communication with the expectations for my success here. There also isn't very much diversity here, I wish there could be more, or at least more acceptance. I sometimes feel like we are a divided campus."
Freshman,5,"When I visited SDSU I was amazed by the campus and the friendly student community! The only thing I think they need more is financial aid for international students, but apart from that, the school is great!"
Freshman,5,Very student friendly and staff are great. Great campus all around! Wouldn't want to go anywhere else!
Sophomore,5,"South Dakota State university is a great college. There are many opportunities for students on and off campus. The student union has a variety of different places to eat. The student union is located by the SDSU wellness center so you can head to the gym to burn off the calories. The wellness had rock climbing, basketball, racquetball, and much more for intramural sports. The campus is beautiful, and spread out. All building are usually a 10 minute walk or less depending on which dorm you live in. This college is not huge, but has over 10,000 enrolled undergrad students. It is a perfect fit for anyone."
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the professors and I feel as though it is a perfect fit for me. I also really love my major and the classes I am taking for it
Junior,5,"SDSU is a great school, the nursing program is amazing! SDSU has a safe campus, great food, and great dorms. SDSU has many opportunities to grow as a person and become a better student. SDSU campus is in the great distance to every building on campus. SDSU allows students to make new friends and has a great environment so you feel safe. I love SDSU and the community I have made."
Niche User,5,Big campus with a small town feel! You get the big school vibes without the big city! Everyone is very friendly and you will never run out of things to do In Brookings.
Sophomore,5,South Dakota State is an excellent place to go to college that has the greatest return on investment of any 4 year university in the Midwest.
Sophomore,5,South Dakota State University is awesome I have met friends I will know and be in contact for the rest of my life. They are always there for me when times are rough.
Freshman,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my tour at the South Dakota State. I got to meet with the head director of multiple fields that I am interested in. After the tour you get to have lunch and some of their world famous ice cream on them! The SDSU campus truly makes you feel at home. If you are unsure of where you want to go or what you want to do, I highly suggest South Dakota State University, they have most major fields and they make sure you are achieving the goals you set for yourself. I am going to be attending their campus to further my education in the fall of 2020. The only change I would recommend would to have an additional parking lot, finding spaces can be a bit tricky. But overall my experience was fantastic!"
Niche User,5,From my visit I could tell that it was a great environment for learning. The faculty and students were kind and helpful. I would definitely recommend checking this school out.
Niche User,5,"The environment and the atmosphere and the people were a huge standout to me, I really enjoyed my time spent there"
Freshman,5,"South Dakota State University was my first choice. When I visited campus, it made me feel like I was still at home. Brookings, Sd doesn't have a lot of places to shop but Sioux Falls is only an hour away."
Alum,5,I loved it! The teachers were amazing and they wanted to see you succeed. There were constantly things on campus to do! The town is amazing and very safe. It was definitely the best college experience I could have had. I wouldn’t change it!
Freshman,5,South Dakota State University offers an immense amount of support in working towards your degree. All of the staff and professors are more than willing to answer any and all questions you could ever have.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. Everyone here is so passionate about helping you reach your goals. You never feel alone or helpless, someone is always there holding out a hand to pick you up off the ground. It isn't hard to find somewhere to fit in, as there are a wide variety of clubs and activities available. The food is really good, and the people are even better."
Freshman,5,I love walking on campus and the calm outdoors. The winters are fierce but are okay for people acclimated to it! The stadium offers lots of space for viewing and the games are always fun to watch. The wellness center is a great area to stay in shape and is open to the community.
Junior,5,SDSU has been nothing but helpful and making me feel like I am going to succeed. My advisor has been amazing in making my transfer smooth and less nerve-racking. I recommend this school to anyone considering it!
Graduate Student,5,"The university is just the right side- not to small and not too big. The professors have all been amazing and really care about their field. It makes students really care too. Practicum and internship opportunities also provide great chances for networking as well. The town of Brookings is also wonderful. It is a small town with many different restaurants, study spaces, coffee shops, bars, etc. Housing and apartments are priced well and are very close to campus."
Alum,5,SDSU was a second home for me.  It made me feel included.  I loved the atmosphere and I loved the people.  Once a Rabbit always a Rabbit!  GO JACKS!
Senior,5,"There are a lot of hands on labs. It is a medium size campus, not too large not too small. Professors are very willing to help students out and work with your schedule."
Senior,5,"I have enjoyed the personable class settings. With the first couple of years the classes will be big and there will not be a lot of interaction with the teachers, but once I started my major specific classes this changed. I currently have the phone numbers of both of my two major specific teachers and they are quick to reply whenever I message them."
Freshman,5,I like how everyone is very friendly. Also I like that the campus has very good security and the staff is always concerned with the students safety. I also liked that they even have an app to help keep students safe. I like the diversity and how no one is left out. I also enjoyed how they answered all of my questions and if they couldn't figure it out someone did. I enjoyed the numerous amount of club options.
Niche User,5,"South Dakota State University is a home away from home. All of the people were super nice when I visited the campus. Even though the campus is of a larger size, it still is very compact and close together"
Alum,5,"I absolutely love this university including housing, jobs, academics, programs, professors, campus life, student activities, and fellow students. I met my best friends here and so many other people who are dear to my heart. Campus is spacious and safe enough to walk around. They offer a variety of classes within each program."
Freshman,5,"I love SDSU, the campus is a very manageable size - especially for freshman! The faculty and staff all just want success within their classes and will help in anyway possible. There are also so many resources for you to take advantage of, like, the tutoring program, S.I. program, campus clubs and informational meetings. Overall, I really enjoy the school and everything that comes with it!!"
Freshman,5,"I love how SDSU is a decent sized school, but it has the small town feel to it. It has a very strong agriculture department to make great classes. It's a nice faculty to student ratio that allows you to get to know your instructors."
Niche User,5,"I gave SDSU this rating because the school provides hands-on learning experiences as a freshman. Additionally, internships, work experiences, and research opportunities are available to undergraduate students. Finally, I will have access to the academic knowledge I need in a format that works best with my learning style and that all of my completed coursework can prepare me for certification with national organizations that will benefit me in my search for a career after graduation.
I did not like the fact that I have to live on campus for the first two years and that I have to purchase a meal plan."
Freshman,5,So far so good!  Everyone has been very helpful and willing to answer all of my questions.  I have had to call and email for help multiple times and everyone has been kind and supportive.  I can't wait to attend next year.
Junior,5,My experience has been great with the school. It is a very big and diverse campus just how I like it. One I wish they would have is free parkings.
Works Here,5,"The university is large enough to give it a big-time feel, yet small enough that students feel at home. Opportunities exits for those students seeking a long and prosperous career."
Freshman,5,Every since my first visit to South Dakota State I have loved it. The college has so many great opportunities. South Dakota State is well known for having strong academics and the on and off campus actives are wonderful. Overall South Dakota State is an excellent college with great perks for anyone.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the campus and everything that it offers. Maybe one thing to change is to let sophomores live off campus, instead of being in the dorms for two years. Otherwise everything else is excellent of very good with this campus."
Sophomore,5,"South Dakota State University has a lot to offer. I enjoy their student involvement programs, food, and the hands-on learning they have to offer. They have many clubs that students enjoy getting involved in and the athletic events are a great way to spend an evening. In addition, all the housing has air conditioning and each hall has events going on weekly to help involve the students living there. If I were to change one thing, I would propose that they have underground tunnels. It may just be me hating the cold in the winter, but I think it would increase enrollment here at South Dakota State University."
Sophomore,5,Great diversity and ample amounts of opportunity to connect with both the students and the community!
Junior,5,"South Dakota State University is full of wonderful students, professors, and other helpful faculty members. It is an excellent school for the cost of attendance, which is by far one of the cheapest tuitions I have seen."
Freshman,5,The nursing program I am going into is great. They have a lot of resources to offer to Native American students.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy South Dakota State because it offers an atmosphere that is very open and accepting of all people. Nearly all my professors have impacted my life in a positive way. The citizens of Brookings, South Dakota are some of the nicest people I've met. They welcome the students into their community."
Sophomore,5,So many different friends and organizations to choose from . Its pretty easy and convenient to get around the college fun activities. And I feel very safe here and crime is low. And the residents of Brookings are so nice and helpful when needed.
Junior,5,South Dakota State University overall is a great university.  My only recommendation is making the process of changing instate and nonresident tuition requirements.
Alum,5,"My four years at South Dakota State University for my undergraduate degree were some of the best years of my life. I was able to meet a lot of great people, work with great staff, and be presented with amazing opportunities. SDSU set me up with a great foundation to be able to go onto graduate school to obtain my Doctorate in Physical Therapy."
Freshman,5,Super welcoming and supportive community. Staff really reach out and do what they can to help you succeed. Many resources on campus that are super convenient and a great help.
Sophomore,5,"I'm an online student at SDSU, and I'm absolutely loving the experience. They make online learning so easy since I don't have a lot of time on my hands. They allow the flexibility I need for my hectic adult life and I'm so happy I chose SDSU."
Junior,5,I absolutely love going to SDSU. I find that the professors are very knowledgeable and very helpful and want to see their students succeed in all classes. I would highly recommend going to SDSU. I find that being a student at SDSU has made me a very dedicated student and I set high standards for myself because I want to succeed in all my classes and be able to graduate with high honors if possible.
Freshman,5,I love the environment there and the teachers are super easy to get along with! They also have the best nursing program in the state!
Junior,4,"I did take classes online and I thought they went well depending on the class. Some professors are definitely better than others and it may be important to check out which one you have before taking it. Most classes involve a lot of discussion posts and short papers, so aren't completely difficult workload wise. I have gotten good grades in all of my online classes!"
Senior,4,The academics that are found in my major are some of the best in my area. The faculty are usually pretty helpful unless they are extremely busy and do not have the free time available.
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID-19, I had to take the remainder of my classes for the second semester online. Overall, all of my professors were extremely helpful and provided us resources to aid our mental health during online learning as well as to help our academics. I had trouble adjusting to online classes personally, but SDSU did as best as they could."
Sophomore,4,I took one class online and that was very easy.  Most of my professors were easy to get along with. f
Sophomore,4,"South Dakota State is a great college for any student. I have found my home away from home in Brookings, South Dakota. I feel very safe being five hours away from home and I feel that the community would do anything for the college students."
Sophomore,4,Taking any online classes can be difficult for many students. I personally sometimes struggle with learning online and finding my drive however SDSU makes my learning easy and you can tell your professors really care about your progress as a student. I feel very comfortable every semester taking a course or two online.
Alum,4,South Dakota State is just what hard nosed academics are searching for. The programs are based on research and trends of today's issues. Most teachers are willing to assist ans support your endeavors but only if you are willing to work toward your goals and do the work.
Sophomore,4,I like the feel of the smaller campus but not too small. I like the classes. I just wish they would make on-campus living more affordable.
Sophomore,4,This past year we had great online experience with online! There were somethings that could use improvement but for the short time they had I thought they did an excellent job.
Freshman,4,"I took anatomy online and although we weren’t able to see cadavers, they did their best to supply us with labeled models in hopes of getting close to the same experience."
Freshman,4,The academic aspect is high quality. To get to a party takes longer than desired because of distance
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student from Utah and chose South Dakota State University as the college to complete my undergraduate prerequisites towards a Nursing degree.  So far, the university has a been a great fit for me; they made my transfer here a breeze and offer a plethora of academic tools for you to be successful.  I did have a challenging / difficult professor, but you will experience at least once throughout your academic journey."
Senior,4,I really enjoyed that even though it’s a bigger university you can still build good relationships with your professors and get one on one learning. They provide a variety of classes that I believe will help me in my future career as a conservation officer.
Sophomore,4,"The student community on campus is amazing, there is a group or club for everyone to be involved in. The teachers and counsellors are amazingly helpful, if you have a problem someone will always do their best to help you fix it or find an alternative. If you are failing or are having trouble in a class, you are not looking for help. There are so many resources that it is almost impossible to fail a class unless you don't try. The campus is usually well maintained, sometimes the sidewalks are a little icy so to be sure to bring your winter gear (it is South Dakota). Most of the dorms are nice, some are a little old, but if there are any problems with the rooms, maintenance workers are very quick about helping to fix it. The food on campus is fairly good, but sometimes the options get boring. There are C-stores to buy ingredients to cook for yourself which can help not make food time boring. Overall this is a wonderful campus to live your college years at and gain education."
Sophomore,4,From the first time I visited South Dakota State I felt welcomed by the facility. There is so many amazing opportunities. The professors and instructors are always helpful with any questions you have.
Freshman,4,I enjoyed meeting all the different people and being able to get to know my professors 1 on 1. Many of my professors knew who I was and were willing to help me reach my goals.
Niche User,4,"The college was very well kept and offered great opportunities for students, but parking is far from the dorms and there is  little student parking on campus. Most of the dorms have been well kept over the years and the living community is very nice and put together."
Junior,4,SDSU is a solid education at a good price. There are always things you want to change but a focus shift away from athletics and the importance of money would be nice. Students should receive some more benefits for what they are giving to this university.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about South Dakota State University is how agriculturally orientated the campus is. Being from an agriculture background, I felt it was an easy transition from high school to college. What could improve is the snow removal in the parking lot and sidewalks and the food options around campus."
Junior,4,Better parking would be great but the professors all care about their students and their students' success.
Sophomore,4,"I think that South Dakota State is a very beautiful school. The environment on campus is beautiful, however the off campus entertainment is minimal. As for the professors, they are always willing to take the time to help in any way possible. There are also a lot of on campus resources that are available to help with your studies. I would recommend this school to anyone who is able to find their own entertainment. The sporting events and on campus activities are very fun and have a really amazing environment. The only other negative is it gets very cold and windy during the winter. Overall, I do recommend South Dakota State."
Alum,4,One of the best experiences I've ever had. Many opportunities to get involved and meet new people. Highly recommend checking out the ROTC program.
Freshman,4,"South Dakota State University is a rather nice place to study. The campus is a welcoming place and all of the staff are friendly and helpful. Although the temperatures are nice during the fall and spring, they get a bit frigid. Overall South Dakota State University is a good, affordable college, but the harsh winters may be a turn off for some."
Sophomore,4,South Dakota State university has a very beautiful campus. I would like to see them try to get more students involved. I also wish that there was more options for healthy food.
Freshman,4,"Overall, for my first year, the experience here has been pretty good. The campus is average, if not small, so it is easy to navigate and travel. They have many degrees that are hard to find in other colleges, for example, engineering degrees like civil engineering. I haven't had a bad experience yet with my professors, and most seem eager to help me understand the content we are learning. However, one of the negatives is the food options on campus. For those living exclusively on campus, the choices for what to eat are sparse and mediocre. But overall, it was a pleasant experience."
Sophomore,4,South Dakota State University gives students the opportunities that large universities offer while being located in a smaller town.
Sophomore,4,The price is excellent for the quality of education. The work load is relatively manageable and the professors are quite knowledgeable about the content they present to the students.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy how welcoming the administration and the students were. They have an amazing nursing program that ensures success! The campus is very safe and at anytime all students have access to the campus police if a student has a night class and doesn't want to walk home alone. I highly recommend going to SDSU!
Sophomore,4,"I love the community that SDSU creates for its students. Everyone who goes to state is proud to be a jackrabbit, and going to a school with so much pride creates for a really cool college experience. There are so many things to get involved in, and so many clubs and organizations that are unique to SDSU."
Freshman,4,"The campus is great small, but also larger enough to hold a lot of different majors, free tutoring for classes and extra help is always given if needed along the way."
Sophomore,4,"Pros: athletics, academics, people, professors
Cons: campus food options, student parking, diversity, weather"
Graduate Student,4,"I had a great time during my four years at South Dakota State. The party scene isn't bad, it is more of a bar school as opposed to a house party school. Most of the classes have a pretty good professor to student ratio after you get out of your general classes. I believe that I was really well prepared to go into a career after graduation. Now that I am going back for my masters degree I think that I  will be even more prepared for a career in the sports industry.  For a mid-major school the athletic teams are extremely competitive with schools that are much bigger. The town as a whole is a great college town with about half of the population being college students when school is in session."
Sophomore,4,Good community but would enjoy a more personal experience with professors. There is a wide array of classes offered which allows students to tailor their education to their individual needs.
Senior,4,"Overall, I couldn't see myself going to a different college. The campus was a good size for me and easy to navigate and it's reasonably priced. Professors were willing to work with students and it was easy to balance school work and a part time job."
Sophomore,4,South Dakota State is a great school where you can focus on your studies and not parties.  If you're serious about your education then this school is the place to go.
Freshman,4,"SDSU is overall a great university to attend. It is small enough that you get to know your professors if you try. It isn't so big that you just feel like a number. SDSU values their students. There is always something to do on campus from academic clubs, to sporting events, to other school events."
Freshman,4,"So far at South Dakota State University, I have have been quite content with what they have to offer. When I first started out back in August, I had no friends around. I had no clue what to do because I was officially on my own. But when classes rolled around, things started to change. I met someone in my first-year seminar, and we talked like we were friends before college. And I am grateful for that seminar because I would have never met a better friend than her."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus here! There are so many ways to stay involved in extracurricular activities and clubs to join. The professors want you to do good in your academics and will help you be successful. There are also lots of opportunities for extra academic help like the free tutoring program, supplemental instruction sessions, review sessions, and study stops. The Wellness center has many counseling services for all types of needs as well. The facilities on campus are amazing."
Freshman,4,My experience here has been great so far. I have had a lot of support by the professors and other students. I am always able to get help with any of my work no matter what the subject. I sometimes get sick of the food but there is lots of chooses when picking were you want to eat so it definitely gives you a variety. Most of the dorms are pretty nice and they keep up with making sure they are clean and safe to be in. All dorms are locked at all times so you need to have your student ID to get into the building. They provide parking for us as long as you pay for it. The parking lot is about a 10 minute walk from the middle of campus so that is not the best. I think overall that SDSU is a great school and i would recommend it to anyone.
Freshman,4,I like South Dakota State University because it feels like home here. Everybody is so welcoming. The professors are nice as well. They make it easy to talk to them about any concerns.
Junior,4,South Dakota State University is a fun and safe environment for students to continue their education. Good teaching staff and many activities to get involved in.
Sophomore,4,My experience at South Dakota State has been very interesting. The people and students here are very nice. The campus is beautiful and almost every weekend there is a new event that brings people together.
Freshman,4,At South Dakota State University I was able to find people that I truly fit in with this is something that I have been searching for my entire high school career. SDSU is an excellent AG school.
Sophomore,4,This is a very diverse campus with some really great professors who want to see you succeed. There is always someone around to help if you need it. There are many opportunities here at south Dakota state university and I highly recommend this School to anyone who wants a friendly open campus to call home.
Freshman,4,Why I chose to come to SDSU was simple. I liked the size and look of the campus and the environment was something i've never experienced before. I love SDSU the only thing I would change would be the cold winters.
Sophomore,4,They have a wide range of majors and are committed to student success. It would be nice if they had more schedule options for distance education students.
Junior,4,"Overall I had a good experience at SDSU. The on campus dining options are sub-par. There are many clubs and activities available every day of the week, so you can be involved as much as you want to. Most of my teachers were very knowledgeable and kind."
Niche User,4,"Very nice nursing program with lots of great opportunities! The involvement between students, academics, sports, and organizations is amazing. There is always something available to every student to keep them involved. Absolutely love this college choice."
Junior,4,"South Dakota State University is academically strong.  Primarily professors teach courses and little Teacher Assistance. The atmosphere is friendly and people on campus are approachable. It's a safe campus and the community is all about the college. There are plenty of activities to get involved with.  One thing that would be helpful is to have more activities during the weekends, especially for Freshman. Overall SDSU is a great university to earn a degree and build memories."
Freshman,4,"South Dakota State University is a very beautiful looking campus, which a select choice of foods on campus. The dorms are quite nice and are well kept. It would be better if there was more help in finding where classes are located."
Senior,4,"SDSU does one of the best jobs at encouraging their students and the community to be involved and try their best in school. The community is incredible and full of students who is chasing the dream, and doing their best for themselves. SDSU also is a safe and great community, and students and faculty are friendly."
Senior,4,It is a great school in a great town. Many different job opportunities to go from even after school. The university itself is nice. Nice campus and really not too expensive all things considered.
Sophomore,4,Love the school! Have met a lot of friends and enjoy the diversity of the campus. Most professors are willing to meet one on one to help. Make sure to get involved and be active in your dorm and in other groups.
Junior,4,"I like that the school offers serveral different majors and programs. I like that the school continously tries to enhance all their programs. I like the repuation that SDSU holds, espeically in a professional career."
Senior,4,"Overall I believe that SDSU is a good school to attend. The people are nice, class sizes are too large and the professors actually care about you and your success."
Freshman,4,"The school has a great campus with lots of very happy, energetic people. Never a dull moment. Good food choices right on campus and many just down the road. Large variety of clubs and activities."
Sophomore,4,Great campus with lots of extremely kind hearted people.  Ample opportunities to get involved with not only on campus activities but also out in the Brookings community. Would love to see more branching of students and professor.
Sophomore,4,"The dorms are crappy unless you can afford a really expensive one. The food is alright. There isn't a wide variety of majors, but it isn't too scarce. There's a lot of school spirit."
Junior,4,I enjoy the campus life and clubs available.  I like the intramurals and work out areas.  I enjoy the kindness of the other students and facility.  My advisors are excellent and helped me in making sure I was on track from my major and minor.
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed how easy it is to get involved on campus and in the community! Something I would like to see change would be the diversity on campus, but I am slowly seeing the university implement new programs to make this happen."
Freshman,2,"My experience so far has been okay. I would change a lot of things about the communication as far as emailing, zoom, etc. I also found meeting times with other students to be difficult with the time zone difference. Also my advisor including a lot of my professors often take a long time to get back with me whether it be questions, responses, etc."
Sophomore,2,Very little student opportunities. Not a welcoming environment for international students. Campus layout is horrendous. The educators are all on tenure and do not provide a quality education.
College Sophomore,2,"Some professors are okay, but Ronald Hirko is an absolute  nightmare to deal with. He wants his students to fail, he will do anything to get you kicked out of class, and he is an absolute pervert to female students.  Hirko makes life as hard as he can for the freshman students and has even tried to sexually assault me for me to get a higher grade."
College Sophomore,2,"The Greek Life is a complicated set of days and trials, it's not very easy to make the time for the recruitment."
College Freshman,2,There are not a lot of opportunities in Brookings
College Freshman,2,Greek life is pretty lame at SDSU.
College Freshman,2,"The food options are not very good, because of the options. You have to go to Panda at a certain time of the day to get good quality food, Pita doesn't have a lot of selections for people who like plain food, Eisenstein's has no gluten free options, and Weary's serves cold food and takes too long to be made!"
College Freshman,2,I got not enough financial aid and have to struggle to find the money or else I can't go back to school.
College Freshman,2,"I would recommend healthier options, more lean meats, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Many of the foods I eat at home are not available to me with my meal plan. Add better products to the convince store. Open up a smoothie/protein shake shop."
College Freshman,2,There a few number of local scholarships available to students who are already attending college.
College Freshman,2,you have to know certain people to get in
College Freshman,2,it's mostly big fast food chains such as McDonald's and Arby's.
College Freshman,2,"After a semester, everything tastes the same. There is nearly no variety for healthy food, and Panda Express will make you ill after a few months."
College Freshman,2,You basically have to know somebody to get in.
College Freshman,2,"Brookings is a small town. There is not much too do here. Unless you are 21 this town does not offer much to college students. There is essentially no great places to go shopping. The locals in this town are pretty decent, although there is not a whole lot of interaction between the students and the locals. It is as if the campus is in its own town."
College Freshman,2,"I think the Greeks make college into a big joke. Most of us don't have to pay for our friends, we just find them."
College Junior,2,"The school pours money into football, but we simply aren't that good. And they are spending tons of money on new sports facilities, but no one except athletes benefit. Non-athletes feel like their money is not being used wisely."
College Junior,2,"The process in general is fairly simple, but the outcome of it is not very helpful, paying for college is very stressful for me and I often wonder if I can really afford to go to school anymore. The Jackrabbit Guarantee rules are ridiculous too, in order to make 30 on campus credits to keep it is very difficult when some of your classes are only offered online."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the available restaurants are not near the campus and hard to get to without a car. Most are very unhealthy.
College Sophomore,2,I think the school could do more for helping students connect with one another.
College Sophomore,2,"The school would rather have students staying on campus, so they do not provide much information about off campus housing."
College Freshman,2,"Super competitive, hard to get into, lots of people trying for it."
College Junior,2,Snow makes parking a disaster.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you're into the white farm kid look, it's tough pickings here."
College Sophomore,2,"The town itself is charming enough, but there's absolutely nothing nearby. The only major retailer in town is Wal-Mart and the only town on the east side of the state is over 30,000 is an hour away. The town basically depends on the school and Daktronics to survive."
College Sophomore,2,There isn't a lot to do aside from drinking at the three or four bars on Main St or the periodical parties on campus
College Freshman,2,The temperature goes below 20 so not fun during the spring semester. But during the fall there are parks inside brookings. The Mount Rushmore is in South Dakota so maybe pay a visit. The nearest Shopping Mall is 45 mins drive from here. The local people treat very good to students.
College Freshman,2,"There is only one bar which has underage parties, but only during the three day weekend. During the Fall semester, many people have house parties, but during the spring its mostly cold below 20."
College Junior,2,They need to offer more options to students especially to those living off campus.
College Sophomore,2,Theres a beta bus? I don't even know what that is honestly I've just heard people talk about it.
College Sophomore,2,You're sol if you want to drink and you're not 21. The cops have nothing better to do that drive around and bust every party there is and give out as many minors as possible. You would think they would be a little more lenient in a college town but like I said the town isn't big enough and they have nothing else to do.
College Sophomore,2,"This is a HUGE commuter school and the social scene consists of farm boys and athletes. The weekends are completely empty because everyone goes home. For the few of us who live on campus and have a real college experience it can get pretty lonely at times. If I could do it over I would go somewhere where I could get a sort of culture shock. The school and programs are great, it's just not the right fit for me."
College Sophomore,2,The smell of weed is always in the air.
College Sophomore,2,Some buildings need more TLC than others.
College Sophomore,2,There are a fair share of racism that goes on here.
College Sophomore,2,Very little is to offer for theses activities.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a very touristic place. There's little to see and not much to do, especially during the winter times."
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus housing is not the best, and technically our school does not offer any off campus housing."
College Junior,2,Most people go to bars at night. One nightclub with dancing. All the bars are in downtown within walking distance from each other is the only perk.
College Junior,2,"For the most part, you're on your own with finding scholarships."
College Freshman,2,South Dakota weather is horrible. Especially in the Winter time.
College Senior,2,It is often very cold or snowy during the winter.  The campus is a walking campus and many have to walk a good distance in poor conditions.  Driving and parking is also an issue during the winter months.  Many students get stuck multiple times during the winter in the campus parking lots because of deep snow.  
College Junior,2,They don't hand out much for scholarships and you are screwed if you don't have over a 3.0
College Junior,2,It is cold and windy in the winter and their is no shelter from the wind
College Junior,2,There is a lot of underage drinking
College Student,2,I mostly don't like it here because not drinking excludes a lot of potential friends and activities
College Student,2,"Most parking is either far from everything and is a decent price, or its kind of close and costs a ton."
College Student,2,It reaches 100+ in the summer and once it hits winter it's 0. Almost every day is extremely windy. 
College Freshman,2,Its pretty dead and unpopular here. 
College Freshman,2,Cops are bad here and during homecoming its terrible.  
College Freshman,2,Dissapointed In the lack of events on a daily basis. There are clubs that do things often but nothing open to everyone for fun.  eVeryone here is from a small town and thus has been dating their SO for years. So there is not a wide selection of partners. 
College Freshman,2,"The price is a little high and where my parking permit is, it sucks when I have to park in the way back and carry things all the way to my dorms. The parking is on the outside of campus and my dorm is somewhat in the middle of campus."
College Sophomore,2,The parking passes are expensive and tickets also.
College Sophomore,2,The hours for campus dining locations are not good
College Sophomore,2,"Off-campus housing is very difficult to achieve, mostly because of cost. Brookings housing is incredibly expensive for monthly rates, and honestly, I'd much rather stay in the dorms throughout all four years of school than pay high monthly payments for rent."
College Junior,2,"Greek life is there mostly for parties and some other events, but it doesn't dominate at South Dakota State University. It doesn't matter much to people if you are in it or in any other club. Its not a really a status thing."
College Sophomore,2,"I have heard a lot of complaints about the parking, but it has never been a problem to me!"
College Sophomore,2,"This school is just a college, with nothing special about it, Maybe this year I will discovere new things."
College Student,2,"If eligable, everyone in the same grade gets about the same amount. The forms were kind of annoying to fill out, and they take it away after not doing so good in a semester."
College Student,2,"The campus CA's can be pretty strict about alcohol and noise on campus. I've gotten in trouble with my friends a few times for getting in trouble with noise, but then they find out we are drinking in the room and make a huge deal out of it. I owe the school $100 for getting caught once, and being accused of it once. I don't think they are fair about it, because some of the CA's have favorites and let them get away with everything."
Freshman,1,"As I stated before, my experience so far has been okay. I would change a lot of things about the communication as far as emailing, zoom, etc. I also found meeting times with other students to be difficult with the time zone difference. Also my advisor including a lot of my professors often take a long time to get back with me whether it be questions, responses, etc."
Junior,1,"SDSU has all the opportunities for you if one of your only priorities is partying or going DT. The school does not have a lot of school support for life fulfilling opportunities and it has TERRIBLE parking. For example the 3 parking tickets I have received were from there being no place for me to park outside of the chapel. The other two were when I was parked outside the wellness center. I get there are rules for parking by WHY would there not be more parking for people who live “technically on campus” a mile from the wellness center in negative degree weather? They will do anything to exploit students and make more money.   What makes SDSU a decent college is some of the people there have the kindest and most beautiful hearts. SDSU has an awesome Catholic community right off of campus so there are opportunities just not specifically school supported. The Nursing, Agriculture, and Engineering is solid but some of the other smaller departments are pushed aside."
Junior,1,"The college curriculum is stuck in the past and the engineering career fairs are awful. It's almost like this college wants you to fail and could care less.  Sure SDSU has new buildings with nice things in them but the curriculum sucks and most of the professors don't care. For example, I worked for corporations with some awesome tech and hated my job because the people are vicious. I also worked for companies with some of the worst equipment known to man but enjoyed it because the people are awesome.

Notes:

Most of the professors I had are from Brooking's and never left South Dakota. College inbreeding anyone? 

There's a 1-4 good professors and they're the only ones I learned anything from. Without them this college would be in trouble. 

The Chemistry and Physics departments are awful and the professors don't present the material well. 

Just remember: A few bad professors and a bad curriculum will prevent students becoming  engineers, doctors, nurses ect."
College Freshman,1,everyone is white and christian and republican.
College Sophomore,1,There are no transportation options.
College Sophomore,1,We have long winters here and it gets really old.  Everyone gets tired of it.
College Sophomore,1,"The school is almost entirely white, small town kids. Any ethnic, religious, or national diversity is marginalized. Most noticable is the Chinese and Nepalese graduate students."
College Sophomore,1,"Everyday at all hours of the day, someone is complaining about the weather and how unhappy it makes them."
College Junior,1,Winters are damn cold in SD...just sayin'.
College Junior,1,There is mold and the landlords trick you into signing a lease
College Junior,1,There is no public transport for the most part
College Junior,1,The wireless internet doesn't work half the time
College Junior,1,The cost is really high for the crappy food
College Freshman,1,"It has not dropped down to the negatives yet, but it tends to get very cold here."
College Student,1,"The weather in South Dakota sucks during the winter! Especially when you have to walk all the way across campus in blizzard conditions. The whole year I was at school, they cancelled  class once."
College Freshman,1,Small town. No public transportation. Airport is 60 miles away.
College Freshman,1,"Granted there's a lot of construction going on, but it takes me 10 minutes to walk out to my vehicle, and it's too far to haul bags out there, there aren't enough 20 minute parking spots close to the dorm buildings."
College Sophomore,1,Windchill Warning. -35 degree temperatures with windchill. 20mph hour wind. About 10 minutes to get frostbite. Required to walk to every class. Classes are still not canceled.
College Senior,1,There are beta buses students and other people in the community can use but it costs money and you have to call them to come and get you. The only good thing is the Bus that runs on the weekends at night to stop drunk driving.
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is not big at SDSU at all. There are only a couple sororities and fraternities. Whether you are in a frat or sorority or not, does not affect your social status."

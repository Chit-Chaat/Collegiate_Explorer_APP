Freshman,5,"HMC is a great place! The 5C Make it even better! You can find almost everything you want at HMC. If not, then it definitely can be found at the other 5C. That is true for classes, majors, clubs, parties.The professors are very understanding. LA is nearby"
Freshman,5,Harvey Mudd manages to be a very supportive environment while being a rigorous STEM school with a liberal arts focus.
Sophomore,5,"HMC is a great place! The 5C Make it even better! You can find almost everything you want at HMC. If not, then it definitely can be found at the other 5C. That is true for classes, majors, clubs, parties.The professors are very understanding. There is a nice town a mile away, a walk with friends is a good way to take off attention from the work load. Parties are held only during breaks, Friday or Saturday nights with a set time limit from 9pm to 1am. On other nights the quiet hours start at 11pm accomodating students' schedules. The dining hall has a great variety. If you get bored of it, you can go to an other dining hall. You can check their menus on a website."
Alum,5,"Attending Harvey Mudd College was a humbling experience. I was able to explore science, technology, engineering and mathematics with peers who were similarly passionate. There are boundless opportunities to take courses both on campus or at any of the four other undergraduate Claremont Colleges that are all within a 1-mile radius, just a short walk or quick bike-ride away. I had the opportunity to pursue summer research projects and engage in a thesis project during my senior year. The campus encourages students to present their research across the nation at various conferences. It’s not uncommon for the department sponsoring your research project to also sponsor your attendance at research conferences including paying for hotel, airfare, and a food stipend! Last but most definitely not least, the advisors are passionate about your success and meet with students frequently. I personally met with my advisor on a weekly basis. I am grateful for this amazing undergraduate institution!"
Junior,5,"Academics at Harvey Mudd are exceptional. It is rigorous and not always rewarding, but at the end of the day, you learn a lot. Plenty of exciting classes to take, both at Mudd and at the other 5Cs. Mudders are easy to get along with. Only major issue with Mudd is the lack of grade inflation which can hurt your chances of getting into a top Grad school program. Getting a job after graduating from Mudd is easier and very rewarding."
Freshman,5,"I'm only just a freshman, but I'm loving my time here. I don't ever regret coming here over my other options. Theres a vibrant social culture if you want one, and a huge amount of dedicated students if you want to just grind on work for a while. There's some amazing people here and I'd totally recommend it, but the workload is a lot so be ready."
College Freshman,5,Campus security does a fantastic job staying in contact with students when there are threats.
College Freshman,5,Our small student to professor radio makes it an easy and fantastic experience to become close to my professors.
College Freshman,5,Going to Mudd allows me a great deal of opportunities even before I graduate.
College Freshman,5,"We don't have greek life, dorm culture makes up for it."
College Freshman,5,The school promotes a strong work life balance.
College Freshman,5,"Harvey Mudd students have some of the best graduating salaries of all the colleges in the country. We're small, but we get a lot of attention from apple, google, microsoft, etc. It's common for students to get internships at those places, and there are 2 career fairs at Mudd every year with reps from a lot of big companies."
College Freshman,5,"Students party when they want to party (usually every weekend), and if you don't, you can easily find like-minded friends who like doing other things (i.e. board games, video games, going off-campus). Mudd has quite a few themed parties, which makes them more exciting."
College Freshman,5,"It's more convenient to just eat on campus, but the off-campus options are pretty good, too. I occasionally eat off-campus on the weekends or for special occasions."
College Freshman,5,"The Honor Code basically says ""Don't be a jerk."" That includes academic honesty in take-home exams (which are wonderful), respecting people's opinions, and common sense. Though no form of administration is perfect, Mudd does a great job in creating a friendly community. For example, I don't have to worry about people stealing my laptop if I leave it out in the campus center. I can express my opinions and people will not castigate me for them (rather, thoughtful discussions would arise, and that's perfectly okay)."
College Freshman,5,"People complain about Mudd's dining hall mostly because of repetition (which every college dining hall struggles with), but in terms of quality, the Hoch is one of the better options on the 5Cs. There are plenty of food options to choose from, and the staff is very courteous and is willing to make accommodations for those with dietary needs. Sometimes, the lines are long, but that's usually because of a really good dish and because students from the other 5Cs tend to flock to the Hoch."
College Freshman,5,Dorm culture is the best part of campus housing.
College Freshman,5,The administration is awesome. You can really tell how much they care about the students.
College Freshman,5,"I think we're very lucky that we have the options that we do. Not a lot of schools have the variety and quality that all of the 5C's, especially Mudd, have."
College Sophomore,5,You feel completely safe no matter what time of night you're walking around at (even if you're alone).
College Sophomore,5,The administration is the best part of Harvey Mudd. They truly care about the students' well-being and safety.
College Sophomore,5,"It's challenging... work hard, play hard."
College Sophomore,5,"Safety is awesome on campus, I always feel safe."
College Freshman,5,"Dorms are set up for students to hang out in common areas or on the grassy quad.  Students definitely spend time outside and use outdoor spaces, which is nice.  The dorms might not be that nice looking, but they're full of character and personality."
College Freshman,5,"The most special thing about Mudd is probably the honor code.  It means that you can leave your laptop out in a common room all day and still find it later, take your final in your dorm room whenever you want, and that our parties don't get shut down unless they are actually out of hand.  The administration really trusts students and treats them like adults, and Mudders respond by organizing awesome parties and activities."
College Freshman,5,"Mudd is an extremely safe campus, mostly because of the honor code, which means students respect each other and their property.  Campus security patrols the campuses but I have never interacted with them and I don't feel unsafe if they aren't around.  Generally, they leave parties alone and just deal with drunk and belligerent people."
College Freshman,5,Profs have high expectations and you learn a ton.
College Freshman,5,"Students get a lot of freedom, administration trust"
College Junior,5,"Great academics. Very tough load. It is possible to do the work, but the reason why it is so hard is that it is hard to consistently keep up the studying for the entire semester when u will likely be sleeping late every week."
College Junior,5,awesome. Each dorm has its own trait so there are many options for what type of dorm you want to be in.
College Junior,5,"A+, hands down – Academics is the heart and soul of Mudd culture. Everyone here takes (most) classes very seriously, including the profs. I'm very disappointed when I get a good professor instead of an AWESOME one; I've gotten used to all of them being funny, smart, engaging AND instructive. Homeworks are almost always a collaborative effort between classmates, which is a great way to get to know kids frosh year (and beyond) and a great way to learn. Tests are almost always take home, which I find takes off a lot of the pressure and stress, especially during finals week."
College Junior,5,Administration Treats You Like an Adult – Lax rules. HMC students are smart enough to take care of themselves 99% of the time and the administration gets that. If you do something at a party that's really stupid or harmful to yourself or others then there's consequences (ex: I have a friend on drinking probation for a semester) but outside of that nobody cares. Part of the reason so many students live and want to live on campus is that they don't feel like they have to get away if they want to drink.
College Junior,5,"Great DIII Sports Atmosphere – I'm on varsity swimming and it's really a great atmosphere. Especially because you can get serious about it without having to make such a big commitment that it detracts from schoolwork or social life. In fact, most of my best friends are on the team. The team has won conference 5 years in a row and usually finishes 10-20th nationally. You're not going to be filling stadiums (unless everyone on the team turns out to have 50 parents) but frankly that's not the point anyway.

Also love intramurals."
College Sophomore,5,"Best School Ever – Harvey Mudd is amazing. We work extremely hard and party hard too. There are all kinds of people here, even though it's such a small school, so everyone can find the people they want to hang out with. The classes are vigorous, but interesting, and the homework takes forever but when done with friends, it seems to fly by. The honor code makes us who we are - we are trusted with take home tests often, so we can take them at whatever time of day we feel ready. The parties are amazing (we have the best parties of the five Claremont colleges)."
College Freshman,5,"Difficult, but Well Worth the Challenge – It's not difficult to tell why many of the students at Mudd are here, the academics are second to none.  Challenging, engaging courses fill up pretty much every minute of the day and well into the night, but I don't know of anyone here who would have it any other way.  Worth the workload, even if it is a large adjustment."
College Freshman,5,"Lots of Places to Eat – If you ever get tired of eating at Mudd then you can always go to one of the other dinning halls in the 5Cs. However, Mudd is one of the best dining halls with a big variety (however, sometimes for the best there is a line). Flex can be used for meals or to get midnight snacks at Jay's Place."
College Sophomore,5,"The People Are Awesome – One of the main reasons I picked this school over other intensive science schools is the atmosphere and community. The people are friendly and helpful, and there is rarely ever any competition between students since we are encouraged to work together. Everyone is very supportive, which is essential in surviving the challenging workloads of Harvey Mudd."
College Sophomore,5,"Dry heat! Desert weather, so bring a variety of clothes. Winter has rain and can get pretty cold, but summer is hot and nice. It's nice weather, even the rain makes people happy."
College Sophomore,5,A Lot of Space – Behind the dorms there are parking spots. Generally Platt Blvd has some spots for parallel parking along the inner dorms but those spots are limited.
College Junior,5,"Awesome Campus – Most Mudders live on-campus for the first two years. Everything is very close by: walking to the academic buildings on-campus from dorms takes about 10-15 minutes if you're from Outer Dorms, 2-5 minutes on a skateboard or unicycle. A wide number of living arrangements are available, depending on which dorm building you pick during the room draw process. There are doubles, singles, and suites of various sizes. Each dorm as a distinct social atmosphere."
Junior,4,"Social life is pretty lit. Met some really great lads here. Profs are the most awesome people ever; genuinely cool people who care a ton. Workload is rough tbh but if you’re motivated, it’s manageable. Forget about non-STEM extracurriculars, unless you’re ready to absolutely murder your GPA. People don’t talk about world issues as much as I’d like, but I’m a political science/philosophy nerd so take that with a grain of salt. Overall pretty great, though it’s not for everyone."
Freshman,4,The academics are very rigorous and it’s definitely difficult. The culture is incredibly supportive and collaborative. Offer interesting and engaging classes.
Alum,4,"HMC is a challenging school, that will definitely push you to your limits. However, the community of students, faculty and staff are some of the most supportive, kind and engaging people you will ever meet."
Freshman,4,"Overall, it's a great education. No matter your grades, it will not be hard to find a job as a HMC graduate. However, core is hard, there are issues with diversity and mental health, and people are overworked and often, very unhappy. It's a four-year intensive boot-camp that will break you down."
College Freshman,4,A lot of the team spirit comes from intramural.
College Freshman,4,"The student to faculty ratio at Mudd is 8, first of all. There are a lot of classes to take, and great teachers to teach them. And if there's something you want to take that isn't offered at Mudd, you can enroll at a class at one of the other Claremont colleges. There's a whole lot of stuff you can do. I hear this one guy majored in dance."
College Freshman,4,"Although Harvey Mudd is very difficult, and teachers will definitely push you with hard coursework, I've so far rarely felt alone. Teachers are accessible, there are always other classmates to work with and get help from, and the environment feels very positive in general, with a lot of interest in the wellbeing of the students. It's a great challenge."
College Junior,4,"Great academics, but balancing life in general can be tough."
College Freshman,4,"Yes, Harvey Mudd is very expensive, and even with some financial aid, my family still pays a lot. However, it's fair because my family is on the borderline of not receiving aid. Still, the financial process was smooth. My recommendation is to apply for non-school-based scholarships but also appeal to the financial aid staff, explaining your current situation."
College Freshman,4,I love working out in the LAC and at the Scripps gym. There is a lot of quality equipment for everyone to use. I wish sports were a bigger part of the Mudd culture. The only reason I've ever gone to games or anything was to support friends. Otherwise I wouldn't have even known about the event.
College Freshman,4,I love going off campus for food if I can. There are awesome options (there's a wonderful all you can eat sushi place in the village) and the food is high quality and affordable.
College Sophomore,4,"Off-campus dining in The Village is so good, but is a 20 minute walk away and tends to be pricey."
College Sophomore,4,Many people from the other 5Cs rave that Harvey Mudd has the best parties.
College Sophomore,4,"Food is good, odd hours for college students though"
College Sophomore,4,Most students who have aid are on work-study.
College Sophomore,4,We love math and science!
College Sophomore,4,"Everything is great, but the workload gets hard."
College Sophomore,4,"You're free do to whatevers, just don't be stupid"
College Sophomore,4,Most students live on campus
College Freshman,4,"In general, drinking and smoking is not shut down automatically, but only if someone is going to get hurt.  We have proctors instead of RAs and they will party with everyone else and just make sure no one gets seriously hurt.  This environment means that students take it upon themselves to drink more responsibly.  There is also no peer pressure at all to do things.  I have friends who don't drink, I myself don't smoke, and it never causes uncomfortableness.  At parties there will often be nonalcoholic drinks as well so everyone can take part."
College Freshman,4,The academics are demanding but the best you can get.
College Freshman,4,"Small town but lots of dining, thrift shops, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Well, it is a science-y school, so if you don't want to deal with students who care about the sciences, don't come here. Some people let their perceived smartness go to their heads (mostly the guys). 
That said, there are plenty of sporty or preppy or quiet or lively students on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Mudd has the best food at the 5Cs. My one complaint is that, like all colleges, the food is the same from week to week. That said, it's good food, with a steak night, a sushi night, and of course ice cream."
College Sophomore,4,"Many people claim that Mudd is not a pretty place, and if all you want are looks, don't come here. And, of course, it's an expensive school.

That said, the people here are incredibly nice. Since it's a small school, you get to know a lot of people, and there is no dorm that is inherently ""better"" than the others. They just all have their own distinctive personalities."
College Sophomore,4,"Claremont, although a small town, is bustling with activity. There are many quaint clothing shops, as well as more well-known brands. It also has a movie theater and lots of food options–from pizza to sandwiches to fancier fare, and of course ice cream and frozen yogurt."
College Junior,4,There are many people who will go beyond classes and will talk about their specific majors.
College Junior,4,There are a lot of space for parking. Freshmen cannot get a parking space though unless there's a special permission.
College Junior,4,"There is not really any enforcement. The dorm proctors who are your RA will also drink or smoke with you. Whether there is a drug or alcohol scene entirely depends on which dorm you live in. But besides Linde, even if you live in a dorm that drinks or smokes a lot, it won't be a deal if you don't."
College Sophomore,4,"The printers historically break down frequently, though they seem to be improving, and B&amp;W printing is free. Color printing is harder to find, and not for free. Almost everyone has a laptop, which is especially convenient since the Wi-Fi is reliable campus-wide and you can print from your laptop to the public printers. The tech support seems to be competent and readily available, and if you have a problem some other time, there are any number of computer-savvy students around."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Very Tough, but You Will Come Out Knowing a Lot! Really, HMC is no piece of cake. You take every tech class imaginable, and to top it off, they're 10 times tougher than anything you've ever seen. But the education you get from it is amazing, and the professors are very supportive throughout it all."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Everyone Lives Together! - And I mean it! I lived in a suite of 9 people with a mixed group of (coed) seniors, juniors, sophomores, and freshmen. Housing is guaranteed all 4 years. Rooms are fairly average, though most seniors do get singles. However, I love the community that is promoted by the group housing, and we have dorm attendants that clean our common areas and rooms occasionally."
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of Options – Being part of the five Claremont Colleges means that Harvey Mudd students can eat at any of the dining halls at the Claremont Colleges as part of the meal plan. We have 8, 12, or 16 meals a week plans, and also gives you ""flex"" - dollars you can spend at places around the Colleges, such as the late-night Jay's Place at Mudd, or the Pomona Coop, etc, for food/snacks. Mudders get flex that expires and is refilled every week (either 8, 12, or 16 flex dollars depending on meal plan). By the very end of the year, I was getting kind of bored of the food (it's a lot of mexican food), but I didn't visit a lot of the dining halls because I was too lazy to walk any further than the Mudd dining hall most of the time and change it up. Everyone must be on the meal plan, unless they are an upperclassman living in Sontag dorm, which have kitchens in the suites."
College Sophomore,4,"Something for Everyone – Harvey Mudd places freshmen in all of the dorms, based on where they would fit in best with the dorm culture. Very few frosh are placed in the wrong dorm, and they usually end up either moving to or spending all their time where they want to be anyway, using their own room only to sleep. Sophomore room draw is tough - they have the lowest priority because rooms are reserved for freshmen in all the dorms. Our room draw is complicated (pre-mock draw, mock-draw, actual draw for all three upper grades, rules about pulling, in-dorm status, etc), but works out so everyone is usually happy. The dorms are not very attractive, but they have culture, and we don't really care how they look because it's all about the people. We have cleaning people for every dorm, but it's nice to clean up after our own parties for them a bit."
College Sophomore,4,"First, and most importantly, free printing on campus. We have full access to computer labs, all you need is to swipe in with your ID. WiFi can be a little patchy in a couple places, but has been strong for me in the dorms and in classrooms. Most people have their own computers, but there are plenty available and you can survive without one. We have labs everywhere, so there is always a computer available. Unfortunately, our printers seem to be broken half the time, so occasionally you have to run around to three or four of them to print something. The school computers also have all the software we need for CS or math homework (so you can code or graph things without downloading the software yourself)."
College Senior,4,"Mudd Is Pretty Spiffy – I love it here. The academics are amazing, the professors are friendly and always available to help (or just to chat), and the students are interesting intelligent people. We know how to study and how to have fun, and pranks are particularly prevalent on campus. You do have to do a lot of work to keep up, but if you can manage your time, you'll be fine. Students tend to collaborate, so it's easy to find help if you're struggling, or to just have a friendly study group. Oh, and Innertube Water Polo is the best sport ever."
College Freshman,4,"Good, but Limited Availability – The food is generally good and there is a wide enough selection, but the restricted times for meals can be a bit of a nuisance."
College Freshman,4,"Hard Work but People Are Always There – I knew that Harvey Mudd was not an easy college to go to. I have dealt with the long nights and the constant knocking on teachers' doors. However, everyone at Mudd is there to help you. Fellow classmates are in the same boat and study groups are common. Teachers are always available and if your teacher isn't available then there is another one that is willing to help."
College Sophomore,4,A Lot of Options – The LAC (student center) has a computer lab which has about 30 PCs with two monitors. The CS department has 2 computer labs with iMacs. The CIS department makes sure each student has access to a laptop and they're generally ThinkPads tablets/MBP that they lease out. Sprague Library also has a classroom set of new MBP and some iMacs for students to use. Computers are everywhere and indispensable at Mudd!
College Junior,4,"These Girls Are Not a C – As a guy at Mudd, I have to say that the girls in Suite Booty in Linde Dorm are pretty hot. They are a legacy suite that throws parties such as Lingerie, Anything But Clothes, and Red Light District. Those girls alone can change the grade for girls at Harvey Mudd from a C to an A!"
Senior,2,"Harvey Mudd has the potential to be a really good school. If administrators proactively listen to students more and are more willing to listen to student groups, the campus atmosphere would be a lot better."
College Junior,2,"Can't Get Anywhere Without a Car – Love HMC and the 5C community, and off-campus Claremont is ok, but LA area is downright boring, and horribly inaccessible unless you 1. have a car and 2. are willing to drive 45 min+ one way to get anywhere. Nearest grocery store is a mile, so good luck carrying a significant amount of food unless you have a car or outfitted your bike for it. Same goes for if you need to buy pretty much anything else, so I end up ordering a lot of stuff from Amazon.

The one good thing is hiking/skiing 20-45 min away, but again, you need a car."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Very Helpful – The tuition is expensive, and there are not many merit based scholarships."
College Junior,2,"Not Fantastic. Not really any kind of fan support or school spirit for athletics teams. Student involvement in the sports teams is very limited. However, ballroom dance, as both a social dance and a competition dance, is quite popular amongst many Mudders. Just about everyone at Mudd is a dancer her/himself or knows someone personally who is a dancer."
Works Here,1,I truly did not enjoy my experience at Harvey Mudd. My best friend was attacked by a random professor's dog.
Senior,1,"Freshmen core classes are too hard to pass if you did not go to an exclusive high school or take college credits in high school. Freshman year they make you take 7 classes, which is basically hazing--and many dorms have their own hazing rituals on top of that. 

The campus is ugly and depressing. The work culture is depressing. The majority of students are depressed. I would transfer out if I could.

Housing is a mess but other reviews here cover why that is.

I would give zero stars if it weren't for the faculty in the engineering department, who take care of me."
College Junior,1,"No one has heard of the school. The workload is hard and the people are mean and peculiar. It is better to go to a bigger, cheaper school where you can get the same education, end up a the same place, and end up with less debt. If you go to a bigger school then you might find where you belong more."
College Junior,1,They don't care about the students. The psychological help department is the worst.
College Junior,1,"No greek life but the dorms are kind of like greek societies because they are exclusive, try to bar people from living into their dorm through Room Draw, and parties are thrown by dorms."
College Junior,1,Very few people at Mudd are sporty or athletic.
College Junior,1,"Mudd is a prison. It prohibits students from living off campus unless they are living with a relative, in which case the school will take away thousands of dollars from your financial aid."
College Junior,1,You have to walk a mile to go any where and there are very few options because it is a ver suburban area full of old people. The community has to be quiet at 11pm and the stores close at 9pm.
College Junior,1,They force you to rat out your peers if they do something wrong and they call this the Honor Code. It is not followed very closely even though they make the tour guides make it seem like it is to prospective students. All the teachers jump to accusing students of violating the honor code very quickly even if they are just checking answers and there is something wrong with the homework problems.
College Junior,1,"The first year seemed like the best financial aid deal, but then the subsequent years tacked tens of thousands of dollars."
College Junior,1,"The cafeteria is very unhealthy: a ton of oil and fat even on the salads that they make.

They are only trying to steal your money:

- There are 3 meal plans (the 8 meal plan where you get 8 meals a week, 12 meal plan, and 16 meal plan) but there are no 14 meal plan which is the perfect number of meals that most students eat. 

- Each meal works out to be $15. (The 8 meal plan costs $4,000). 

- The number of meals and the amount of money you get to spend per week on food DOES NOT ROLL OVER TO THE NEXT WEEK. The school steals money from you every single week because no one uses up those last 20 cents. That's $150 at least they make a week off of unused food money from its students.

- The prices of food that you can buy with your meal plan is super expensive."
College Junior,1,"On the outside, Mudd housing might seem passable. Heater provided, AC provided, a maid that comes and clean the lounges and bathrooms on a biweekly basis... but it all really depends on what dorm you end up in. Most of the dorms have people or legacies of being disgusting. 

The most troublesome dorms are West, North, and Linde. They have broken glass in the courtyards. The smell of weed is always present in the dorm. There are bottles of alcohol left in the lounge and when people get drunk, they spill alcohol all over the floor. They play beer pong and they leave the cups out there for days, for the cleaning people to clean up. 

Sontag, North, and East are dorms that are very exclusive and unless you are a part of the culture there, you should never go there or you will be ostracized. In short, the social atmosphere at Mudd is stifling.

The cost is ridiculous. It costs over $1000 to live on campus PER MONTH. That goes for if you are in a single, a double, a triple, OR EVEN A QUAD (where there are four people to a room that is the size of 2 doubles). You will never be allowed to live off campus because they are building a new dorm, so it is guaranteed that the school will do everything they can to force you to live on campus so that they can make the most money they can.

Convenience is horrible, there are no places to eat out that are less than a mile's walk away, and you get tired of the meal plan quick. It is extremely hard to get off the meal plan at Mudd.

The worst thing about Campus Housing at Mudd is how you get your room. There is this thing called Room Draw that breaks up friendships, causes betrayals, and forces the quietest, most innocent students to live in dorms where people smoke weed and other serious substances right outside their room doors, where drunk people pee in the bushes right outside their doors, and where they have to leave their dorms because there is rock music blasting right next to their rooms at 1am on a Tuesday night."
College Sophomore,1,I'm applying to transfer out. Harvey Mudd students tend to be very cliquey and hyper-focused on their work.

Junior,5,"Santa Clara is a beautiful university that takes great care of its students by offering great professors, resources, athletics, and opportunities. This school is the perfect bled of collegiate life and rigorous academics,  all set in the fast paced Silicon Valley."
Sophomore,5,I loved my online learning experience. The teachers were very helpful and accommodating with schoolwork regarding the switch from in person learning to online learning.
Sophomore,5,"I love this university not only are the students very friendly, but the teachers genuinely care and will take their time to help you if needed. I also prefer the small class sizes which allow for closer relations to staff and a better understanding of the course materials."
Sophomore,5,"As someone who didn’t particularly “fit in” in high school, I was nervous about going to college. However, SCU was like a dream come true. I met my best friends, took amazing classes, and got to spend every day on the beautiful campus. You really can’t find better quality people than at SCU. Academically, I have no doubt that I will have the education and tools I need to succeed after graduation."
Sophomore,5,"For what it was, Zoom at SCU was pretty good. It’s hard t take online classes, but SCU did everything they could to make it a smooth transition, even offering free therapy and support services for students having a hard time with everything going in. I feel like I learned a lot in my classes, even though they were online"
Sophomore,5,"Very welcoming environment, great Career Center for connections to the workforce and the school genuinely cares about their students."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Santa Clara university. I made life long friendships with amazing people, and felt that it was also a great choice in terms of the education that I received. Professors were kind, fair, and understanding. It is also a beautiful place to go to school!"
Alum,5,"This school is absolutely fantastic. It's hands on. Opportunities are endless. Honestly, I truly feel like I grew into a leader at this school and would choose it again a thousand times over!"
Senior,5,I enjoy it. I enjoy it.I enjoy it.I enjoy it.I enjoy it.I enjoy it.I enjoy it. I enjoy it. I enjoy it.
Junior,5,It's great.                                                                                                                                                                          Not really sure what else to say.
Freshman,5,"Santa Clara is filled with challenging curriculum and welcoming people. This is my first year and many resources are readily available. The culture is chill, and inclusive. The food at Benson is okay but has improved. There are many good professors, but the math department is lacking."
Niche User,5,I had the opportunity to go and stay at Santa Clara university for my Freshman orientation for high School and it was the best because we got to stay at the dorms. I as well had the opportunity to go again to be an ambassador and got to take a tour of the campus and the history of Santa Clara University.
Freshman,5,"The experience is great. This is the place you want to be at if you want to get internships; being at the heart of Silicone Valley presents you with a multitude of internship opportunities, and Santa Clara University is excellent in facilitating your growth to prepare for these opportunities. The professors are excellent and since classes are small, these professors really get to know who you are as long as you are participant."
Niche User,5,SCU is a great school and is definitely worth the money. The campus is beautiful and the teachers are pristine.
Freshman,5,"My first quarter experience has been everything I could have wanted. The academics are intellectually challenging, but fair; the social scene wonderful; there is a place for every student here."
Sophomore,5,Going to Santa Clara has been the best decision I have ever made! The Greek life is fun and the academics are tough but rewarding.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Santa Clara University has been very positive and encouraging. Nearly all of my professors to be very helpful and knowledgable. Thus far, I've felt challenged but supported in my academics, which is exactly what I was looking for. Additionally, there are many on-campus clubs and organizations that are available to students. I am a part of a dance team, a body positive group, and a first-generation student group, while also working as a tutor, an in-class peer educator, and a desk assistant in one of the dorms. I am very thankful to have found all of these groups and the wonderful people that are a part of them.SCU has also provided me with access to great health care and therapy, and I've been able to make amazing friends. I have learned that the more effort and awareness I put into college, the more benefit I receive out of it. Ultimately, I know SCU was the right choice for me, and I continue to be thankful for the opportunity to attend every day."
Freshman,5,My favorite thing about Santa Clara is definitely how it's primely located next to some of the biggest companies in the world. The networking opportunities you can find here are unmatchable.
Alum,5,"Smaller school that has the advantages of easily accessible faculty and clean facilities. Experience will be major-specific, but the STEM fields are strong and provide a supportive student experience."
Freshman,5,"Santa Clara is a Jesuit University in California. My uncle went there a number of years ago and has taken me around the campus two times. Both times, I’ve fallen in love. The environment is perfectly beautiful and the university builds their students to be good people. They help the community and provide them with so many opportunities to make a difference in the world and set them up for life."
Senior,5,"Wonderful community with an overwhelming amount of support. Located in Silicon Valley, this marvelous college has opened the doors to many employment opportunities."
Sophomore,5,"Santa Clara University is amazing! the academics, profs, campus life, and party scene all culminate into the best university experience one could ask for. If there isn't something happening on campus, there are plenty of surrounding activities such as sharks games, 49ers games, ice skating, and more!"
Sophomore,5,"I've enjoyed my time at Santa Clara so far, everybody is so friendly and makes it an enjoyable experience."
Sophomore,5,"I am a rising sophomore at Santa Clara University, and my experience thus far has been amazing to say the least. Coming into a four year university as a Latinx first-generation student was nerve-wracking at first; I wasn't sure how well I would adapt to a new environment. However, I was immediately received with open arms in a community that prides itself in acceptance, diversity, inclusion, and bronco spirit! Throughout my first year, I became involved in activities such as Associated Student Government, Mecha-El Frente, Campus Ministry, and the Office of Multicultural Learning. I have been able to find an incredible support system, long-life friends, outstanding professors, a social residential learning experience, and an active student life. In addition, the academics are extremely strong as professors prioritize their students, meaning that they put the well-being and success of those they teach in order to prepare them appropriately for future careers."
Freshman,5,"Santa Clara University is a great school that will set you up with helpful opportunities and connections, such as its proximity to Silicon Valley and the grand extent of talented professors."
Senior,5,"SCU is a tightly knit community of ambitious students who you will see in the lib until 6am one day and at parties the next. Professors aren’t just lecturers, they are mentors and readily available outside of class. It’s a school small enough to give you a valuable education with a budget large enough to support any of your academic and extracurricular endeavors. 
And have you seen the quad?!"
Freshman,5,One of the main reasons Santa Clara has been a success is getting involved with the Ignatian Center. I don't come from a Catholic School background so everything discussed was totally new to me.
Freshman,5,"Every class I have taken has stretched me intellectually without being too much work. The small class size also allows for lots of discussion-driven classes, which are always way better than huge lectures. The frats and sororities aren't super cliquey either so the party scene is really fun but also not overbearing. The food can be repetitive, but there are lots of really good/healthy options! There are lots of opportunities on this campus, but you have to have to be proactive in getting, internships, awards, grants, and so on."
Niche User,5,"I have visited the campus several times, and truly loved the ambiance that comes with the campus and especially the people there. It's a place you can envision yourself in; happy."
Freshman,5,"I will be a freshman at Santa Clara University during the next fall semester. My brother also attends SCU and is going to be a senior. We both love California and all of the opportunity the school has to offer. It is a private, jesuit university that has an amazing education, diversity, location, and food! You will love your experience, and I'm looking forward to mine."
Senior,5,"Too many exclusive clubs at this school. Compared to my undergrad days, it seems to me that many undergraduates aren't that socially connected like at other top schools. Academics are fine."
Works Here,5,"As a professor at a Top 10 university on the West, I personally believe that the combination of SCUs core curriculum, location and world-class faculty makes it the first or second best university on the West in the United States"
Works Here,5,"You really can't imagine how much goes on not only on campus, but also in The CITY. As someone who has lived in a suburban setting for most of my life, this was unimaginable before, but a pleasant surprise as I got here."
Sophomore,5,"Santa Clara U is famous for its undergraduate 'Great Books' courses, which are taught by world famous professors of philosophy, literature, sociology, anthropology, and so on. These courses confer an intellectual and analytical ethos to the SU student body that isn't present at the other schools ranked in the top."
Alum,5,"I am a African American and an Alumni from Chicago. What I learned after attending Santa Clara University is that it is an excellent school; it gives a student everything he or she needs to succeed; the only thing they have to have is a vision. So if you come to SCU without any drive, determination or passion for what your are doing. This is not the school for you. This is a school for visionaries and leaders."
Works Here,5,"You must be very independent in Santa Clara, whether from the academic or social life aspect. The Core can be extremely annoying if you are not interested in it."
Graduate Student,5,"My acceptance to Santa Clara changed my life. I still regard those four years as the best of my 40+ of living. I learned, I listened, I grew, and I became the person I am today. I wish everyone had an undergraduate experience like we had."
Senior,5,"I am grateful for the education I received at SCU. It is incredibly elite like all the other schools ranked in the Top1 on U.S. News West. While my professors and classmates were driven and super-bright, Santa Clara as a whole maintains an exclusionary culture. I come from a low-income background and was at times belittled for not being able to afford expensive excursions into San Jose, having less than glamorous clothing, and even for what my parents do for a living. The fact that a segment of Santa Clara's student body is majorly right-wing conservative (bordering on racist/discriminatory) certainly doesn't remedy the exclusionary culture. If I could do the college process all over again, I'm not sure I would pick Santa Clara."
Senior,5,Small class sizes with excellent teachers who are always readily available to help you as needed. Great academic programs that are both challenging and interesting. Lots of extracurricular activities to get involved with. Tons of diversity and friendly faces. Great facilities and student resources.
Junior,5,"Santa Clara university is one of the beautiful school I have ever seen with an academic aurora. Every student is lucky to have a opportunity to get a degree from this school. But when thoughts and speech are feared and shut down by your organization, maybe you shouldn't call yourself a university. You are more like a young adult daycare center."
Junior,5,"I had an outstanding time at Locatelli hall, enjoying the special Multi Cultural Learning Centers 17 annual welcome event. Great people, great food, and fantastic entertainment by the Latin Heat Band!"
Sophomore,5,I've always called SCU as my second home. Every summer I can't wait to go back to the beautiful campus and hang out with the best friends I've ever met. My favorite spot on campus is definitely The Multicultural Center (MCC). Great vibes!
Senior,5,"I am in love with this place!! The campus is beautiful and the people are very friendly and accepting. I am an international student from the Philippines, and I can proudly say that choosing SCU was one of the best decisions I have ever made!"
Junior,5,"I will cherish my undergraduate education at SCU forever! Santa Clara cultivated my mind, expanded my worldview, challenged my beliefs, and filled my spirit. Thank you for the greatest gift of all. ""Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all."" -Aristotle"
Alum,5,"A fantastic academic institution—not only a university, but a community as well!! I’m an alumna ( B.A. and M.A.), and have alumni family members also. I attribute much of my professional success to the education and support I received at SCU. Go Broncos!"
Alum,5,"Overall, SCU has a wonderful environment and atmosphere and is a wonderful place to attend with incredible people. The professors are incredibly helpful and supportive, as they want you to succeed. Administration provides some challenges, but it gives students the opportunities to fight back and makes the changes they want to see within the college."
Alum,5,"I love my time at Santa Clara University though it was not easy. As an alum is when you realize the power of Santa Clara, and can fully appreciate the Santa Clara experience, I would recommend Santa Clara. However, I do recommend a campus visit before deciding to attend."
Alum,5,"Overall, Santa Clara is a great place to be for any student. Class discussions are vibrant and interesting, the professors really care about both what they're teaching and the people they're teaching to, the campus itself is incredibly beautiful (exploring is a really soothing way to spend a few stress-free hours). They also do a better job than most of taking care of students with dietary restrictions or other health needs, which shows just how much the administration cares about its student body."
Junior,5,"SCU is an amazing and extremely special place. The academics are great. It's a diverse and supportive environment overall. There are so many opportunities for growth, both personally and academically. The campus is also beautiful."
Senior,5,I hate it but I still love it and I really want to graduate from here but I don't want to actually go through the 4 years here. The academics are off the charts but the social scene makes me cringe and on Santa Clara city sucks because everything is expensive.
Junior,5,"An amazing place where work hard, play hard is embodied in every way. Students are eager and ready to learn, professors are dedicated to their work, and there are so many amazing ways to be involved outside of the classroom as well. One of the most gorgeous campuses I have ever seen as well!"
Senior,5,"I love this school, however, the social scene is a little challenging. Joining a sorority, though I didn’t want to at first, definitely helps this. Academics are extremely rigorous. Saying this, the professors are very accessible and want you to succeed for the most part."
Alum,5,SCU was my dream school as a child and I feel incredibly luck to have been accepted. It is very expensive and slightly uninhabitable at times when trying to find off-campus housing and food but I don't regret my choice to come here. The professors are amazing and care about the students learning. I wish I had more time to be in the school.
Alum,5,"Santa Clara University has a wealth of knowledge and opportunity at one's finger tips.  Unless student's are naturally inclined to being outgoing and seeking out places that they can make a difference in or even call home, it will take a considerable amount of effort to find the people and the opportunities that make Santa Clara University a most memorable place. Furthermore, Santa Clara University has very rigorous academic programs, so students should not be terrified if they receive their first end of semester report filled with low marks. Along with just showing up to class and external appointments, these meet ups offer students a chance for research opportunities, internships and even future careers."
Alum,5,There are a lot of opportunities on campus but many students don't know about. So it is important to always go out and look for what interests you on campus to take advantage of all opportunities the college has to offer. I enjoy the class sizes they are like high school class sizes. This helps get that one-on-one with the professors so they really get to know you and helps when students need to ask for letters of recommendations. The campus does have lecture halls for certain class sizes shrink and have another professor to help with the subjects taught in the lecture halls. Overall I really enjoy this campus and would recommend it.
Sophomore,5,"SCU is an interesting blend of Jesuit and Western values. If you are considering attending, make sure you fully understand what both of these mean. That being said, if you are wanting the opportunity to be heavily engaged in social justice opportunities around Bay Area, the school has a plethora of connections and partnerships. Whether or not the student culture is centered around that is another discussion, but it’s there."
Graduate Student,5,"I enjoyed being a student at Santa Clara. Not only are there a lot of opportunities, everyone is really friendly. The food sometimes is a hit or miss but overall it is satisfying enough. Sometimes I feel as if the classes have a lot of rigor to them but it just serves as more motivation."
Senior,5,"SCU is a beautiful place to be and an exceptional educational experience. The campus is paradise and facilities are great. The community is wonderful and my I still hang out with the same people from my dorm after 4 years. It took me a while, but these have been the best 4 years of my life and I've had a wonderful experience."
Sophomore,5,"In my opinion, SCU is a great school. As with other schools, there is always something available if you find the energy to seek it. However, what I like about SCU the most is that this is actually TRUE. Everything is so accessible given that it is a private university. If you need help with academics there are daily center for tutoring. If you need a life coach there are easily accessible individuals who will be willing to help. If you need help with class work, their won’t be this cut-throat competition present in other top schools where students will refuse to provide help to each other for the sake of the “grade”. Despite its high price, it does pay off with its abundance of resources and access to greate education within a fingers reach."
Niche User,5,"I love my school! Santa Clara University was my top choice ever since I began my high school. I am currently a teacher and I am so excited to be a Bronco because my knowledge had tremendously increased in my field of study. The professors are very knowledgeable, understanding and accessible to help on a daily basis."
Junior,4,Teachers are very willing to  meet outside of scheduled class time and accommodate whatever difficulties students are experiencing during the pandemic.
Freshman,4,"Santa Clara is a perfect mix between a rigorous education and a fun college experience. If you are looking for these types of qualities in your school, check out Santa Clara!"
Freshman,4,"I haven't been able to experience a full year of Santa Clara's online learning system yet, but it seems like it will work. The teachers seem dedicated to making sure students get a valuable education."
Junior,4,"I appreciate Santa Clara University's small class sized and dedicated faculty. Because of the smaller class sizes, students are able to interact with professors and receive great instruction and guidance."
Junior,4,Professors at Santa Clara University truly try to accommodate and understand the unique situations of students. They are willing to work with students and are flexible.
Sophomore,4,"Professors did their best to mimic an in-person class setting but could be improved. Overall, the school gave tremendous resources to guide students along the way of this spring quarter despite the circumstances. I think that if the online mode of instruction continues there will continue to be improvements."
Senior,4,"It's a great school in a great area, and I've had a wonderful time while I've been here. The teachers and courses put you in a position to succeed once you graduate."
Alum,4,"My four year at Santa Clara helped me grow and become the person I've always wanted to be. Being a small school,  there is a real sense of family among its students since in general there are an abundance of familiar faces. It's a great way to create everlasting friendships as well as a sense of home away from home. Would highly recommend :)"
Freshman,4,"I feel like SCU is not the right school for me, lovely campus, great people, but sometimes I feel like I am outcasted. SCU is majority white, so me being asian, it is difficult to feel welcomed. Additionally, since it is a small campus, once people find friends, you are left out. However, I love the professors here. I LOVE attending class and learning."
Alum,4,I loved the environment at Santa Clara. I got a wonderful education and all of my professors were interested in my well-being and success. The only thing I would love for SCU to improve is the diversity of the student body.
Freshman,4,"What I like about Santa Clara University, the most, is their LEAD Scholars program. This program is made for minority students, by minority students, to help them with the transition to college. They provide year-round resources and weekly emails full of useful information as a way to help minority students get an equal opportunity. In addition, they let all incoming freshmen attend school a week early; this orientation week is devoted to helping them transition to the school and become familiar with the campus and the city. Attending a predominantly Caucasian institution was initially a very intimidating experience as a female Hispanic student, but through the LEAD program I was able to find a safe community for me to grow as an individual."
Alum,4,"The small class sizes and academic rigor were valuable. I would like the school to provide a more robust arts program, and for the communications degree to include more focused concentrations in design and other commercially applicable creative fields."
Sophomore,4,"Santa Clara really cares about their students, offering many opportunities for mental, physical and spiritual growth. There is so much to do around campus and they also offer a bunch of trips and extracurricular activities. It is pricy but it can be well worth your while if you make the most out of it."
Freshman,4,"great atmosphere for the most part. I joined a sports team because unless you are in a sorority on campus or some other intense community of people, it is easy to feel excluded and alone. academics and professors are amazing. took a little longer to find my group of people than I had initially expected, but now I have the best friends I could ask for who are also my teammates, and being so far away from home (I'm from NY), I would have expected being away for so long to be more difficult than it is. surprisingly easy. wouldn't change this experience for anything"
Freshman,4,"The professors are extremely hands on, which proved very helpful my first quarter. On the other hand, it was hard to meet friends because a lot of people from common high schools attend this college."
Freshman,4,"Even though Santa Clara may have its flaws, we students are very lucky to be studying at a university like Santa Clara. The school has amazing facilities and the campus is amazing. Parties are a very huge part of campus life as well, and there will always be a party happening at least twice a week. Everyone is very outgoing and friendly. Although, I found its lack of diversity something shocking, especially since the school is located near such a diverse city, and that city being San Jose. School tuition is also quite expensive, so maybe think twice about applying to Santa Clara, but if you really like your major then by all means go for SCU."
Sophomore,4,Being such as small campus  with a strong engineering department definitely has its perks! You get to form relationships with your professors much more easily.
Junior,4,"SCU is a great school with more than enough resources to get you started with your career! The professors care about your learning and education, which makes it a very nice environment to study in."
Sophomore,4,"Everyone at Santa Clara University is eager to make a change in not just the local community, but the rest of the world, too. Located in Silicon Valley, there are immense career and internship opportunities that professors and counselors are prepared to assist students in applying and achieving."
Alum,4,"I loved SCU, the people, the teachers, the classes, everything was great. It was, however, expensive and I will be paying off my education for years."
Freshman,4,"SCU wasn't my first choice of college to attend, but now I can't imagine being anywhere else. The student body is very inviting, the campus is beautiful, and the professors are accessible. There are also a lot of opportunities to get involved both on campus and off. Whether you want to explore your culture, volunteer, search for future professions, or simply just relax there is a club at SCU."
Sophomore,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the community at Santa Clara. The students, professors, and all community members seem to genuinely care about the well-being of one another. At Santa Clara, I am not just a number; I am seen for who I truly am and for my accomplishments and values. Although I have had a great experience at SCU so far, I would like to improve diversity. Santa Clara is 50% white and Catholic, so although people are very diverse in interest, I do not seem to encounter many people with very different racial, religious, ethnic, or socioeconomic backgrounds."
Freshman,4,"SCU is a beautiful school with a beautiful philosophy centered around the core Jesuit belief of ""Men and women with and for others."" They produce students who care about the whole person, who become aware of injustice in the world, who can solve problems, and who develop a love for those around them."
Freshman,4,"The resources available to student and the quality of education is excellent. Feels a lot smaller than I was expecting, though."
Niche User,4,"Although I have not been to Santa Clara, and I am just a high school senior.  I have read a lot of amazing things about Santa Clara University. I have seen that the campus is a very beautiful place. The University is so impacted in business, that they even have their own school for the major. I hope that I am accepted to such a school."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the small class sizes and the professors who are always willing to help students outside of class. There are also many different organizations to get involved with and activities to go to. Also, since the school is located so close to the Silicon Valley there are many career opportunities available for both jobs and internships."
Sophomore,4,"Santa Clara University is a great school with a beautiful campus. The university is considered in the upper-tier of private schools in the US and it continues to improve and rise in the school rankings. The university prides itself in having a high percentage of students obtaining four-year degrees. Tuition is expensive as it is a private Jesuit university but the education and experience that I got from Santa Clara University was very meaningful with good people, culture and environment on campus."
Graduate Student,4,"Graduate school has a great program with an immersive learning experience. Part of the program I participate in is heavily focused on self exploration. This can bring up a lot of difficult issues, but also presents the opportunity to help work through them. The amount of growth I have had in this program just within the first year has been incredible. The work load is strenuous at times and the cost of the program is expensive but besides those two points, I have thoroughly enjoyed receiving my education here and have no regrets thus far about choosing this program over other schools'."
Freshman,4,"If you come from a private Catholic high school this place will probably feel very familiar right away. If you don't, it may take some time to adjust to the culture and attitudes of the people here. Regardless it is called Claradise for a reason."
Alum,4,It is a gorgeous campus with tons of opportunities locally and abroad! Definitely check it out if you are interested in smaller schools with a personal connection to your professors!
Junior,4,I enjoy the weather here. The campus is very beautiful and so are the people. The class sizes are perfect and you can really get engagement from professors and peers. Great engineering program.
Freshman,4,Overall excellent professors and really interesting courses offered. Safe campus with a variety of housing options. Santa Clara could improve greatly upon its dining options though.
Freshman,4,"As a student coming from a local Catholic high school, most of my life my opinion about Santa Clara was that it was too close to home. Luckily I was able to look past this when it came time to choose a college. The campus is beautiful and it is perfectly located in Silicon Valley, a major bonus no matter your major."
Sophomore,4,"It may get stressful at times but you can always find a community to help you through! Santa Clara chooses to focus on the individual student and always looks out for the little guy
 I am glad to call this place my home"
Junior,4,"As a current junior I've definitely grown to love the school but there are a few things that could be changed.  The increasing cost is not the best and the lack of true student diversity is disappointing but this is met with great professors, small class sizes, an AMAZING campus, and being a 45 minute drive or 1 hour train ride from SF.  Overall, it's been pretty great."
Senior,4,"Absolutely loved the school as a whole.  My favorite thing is how close I am with a bunch of my professors; I regularly converse with them outside of class and consider them friends as well as educators.  They even sometimes go with us students to a bar!  I would give 5 stars, but I had a few issues with my program in particular.  If you plan on going here, check out your specific program of interest first, because the quality varies within each department."
Graduate Student,4,"I'm a graduate student, and although I love my program and receive support from my program itself, I feel slightly disconnected from the rest of the campus."
Sophomore,4,"Santa Clara University offers many opportunities for students to network, build lasting relationships, and participate in internships. However, I thought they would be more accepting of students who are low income and not turn stray them away."
Freshman,4,"I'm a first year, but the school is decent so far. The programs and resources available at the school are wonderful. Professors seem to care about teaching. Some business school professors seem to be very experienced and know what they are talking about. Excited to learn more about the school through the rest of my years here."
Niche User,4,Beautiful campus with great surrounding area but lacked stand out qualities from other Jesuit universities throughout the country. 
College Freshman,4,The variety of courses is great and the professors are very good.
College Freshman,4,"The students are very welcoming and helpful to new students. The faculty, staff, and professors were very informative and helpful as well. The campus is very beautiful as well and students have school spirit, which make it a very good atmosphere to live in. Additionally, being in the heart of Silicon Valley allows easy access to many internships."
College Sophomore,4,Great school! Pushes to make students as well rounded as possible and as open-minded as can be.
College Senior,4,I have received multiple internships as a result of the career fair and value of the SCU engineering program. The program is highly regarded and there is not a problem for me or my peers.
College Senior,4,"Most professors are very smart, helpful, and great teachers. There are a couple of exceptions and the students have evaluated them appropriately, but nothing has changed. I would like the school to respond and take action of professors are receiving such low marks or a majority of the class is failing."
College Senior,4,I feel very safe walking through or around campus at any time. I don't know anyone who has been sexually assaulted but I know there have been only a couple of issues throughout my time there.
College Senior,4,There are different types of dorms to suite everyone's need or desires. Most dorms have been updated or remodeled to provide nicer housing than a lot of colleges.
College Senior,4,The fields and facilities are nice. They could update and expand the recreation gym that all students use.
College Senior,4,I love my school! There are small class sizes but plenty of resources available. We have great facilities and labs to compliment the classroom lectures. We obtain a lot of hands on experience which is very beneficial as an engineer.
College Sophomore,4,All the housing options are great and have their goods and bads. I wish it was a little easier to get into the building you would want though.
College Freshman,4,It's a wonderful place where anyone can feel at home.
College Freshman,4,"Since the school is close to many huge corporations, there is a wide array of internship opportunities and jobs!"
College Freshman,4,They do throw some fun parties but you won't miss out on much if you are not apart of Greek Life.
College Freshman,4,"There is no football team, but the other sporting events draw crowds. The athletic center is beautiful."
College Freshman,4,We have a police station right across the street and easily accessible help if needed.
College Freshman,4,"The housing is really nice, each dorm is very different so you can pick the style you want. Some are more social than others, some are more spacious, but all are very nice."
College Freshman,4,"I live in Casa Italiana, and I love it because it's suite-style. The only drawback is that it's far from most classes and the dining hall."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not interested in Greek Life, but everyone that's involved says that it's a lot of fun."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not really that interested in sports, but from what I've seen the facilities are nice."
College Freshman,4,"As a tall male, i feel pretty safe walking alone across campus and nearby at night. I don't see any reason why anybody else would not. Sexual assault is a problem at frat parties, but can usually avoided if one exercises simple caution. There are a lot of parties/mixers in which only girls will be let in. Identifying which parties encourage a predatory environment and which do not is sometimes necessary."
Niche User,2,"Diversity lacks at this school, there is not a whole lot of variety when it comes to the food which is why it usually is the same thing for like every meal and students nor faculty are welcoming"
Niche User,2,"This was my daughter's top choice for college. She was ecstatic on move in day, joined a sorority, and tried to take advantage of the advertised SCU college experience.  After a disappointing freshman year, she transferred. The quality of education was disappointing. Professors were, for the most part, lackadaisical and weren't current within their disciplines. Others acknowledged they were teaching classes in fields unrelated to their expertise because the university needed to fill these vacancies. 

My employer pays a significant portion of my daughter's tuition. The SCU One Stop Enrollment Service Specialist's  rigidity earned himself quite a notorious reputation among my employer's HR department.  

The party scene is intense (ambulances were a common scene at parties). She had a hard time finding others who shared her same values because so many focused on image and wealth. 

In short, other than the mild weather and beautiful campus, ""Claradise"" was disappointing."
Niche User,2,"I chose SCU for the small class size, so I could get to know my professors. I was disappointed to find that many professors are apathetic, unhappy with their teaching assignments, and are slow to answer emails. My religion professor is the only one who actually made any marks on my paper and seemed to like his job. As a student, I didn't feel valued and was disappointed in the lack of professorial accountability. I question the ""abundance of internships"" for students at this school. I had several classmates whose summer internships never materialized as promised- companies already too saturated with SCU student interns.

The social scene was what I expected- many affluent White kids who love to party. I'm no longer a student here- it was too hard to find genuine people and I couldn't justify the cost of this school with such a mediocre education."
Junior,2,"Santa Clara has a beautiful campus, nice dorms, and many parties. However, in the majority of the classes I took, the professors seemed to put minimal effort into their teaching. Many of my biology and chemistry professors used the same powerpoint they used in 2015. Additionally, many of my tests and quizzes were unmarked with a letter grade circled on the front. When asking for an explanation regarding my grade, the majority of my teachers were not helpful and told me to ask my classmates."
Alum,2,"At the end of the day I have to ask myself how much did this school prepare me for the professional world and the answer is none at all. 

200k spent on a piece of paper because people say you have to go to college. SCU is more concerned with appearing as a moral and wholistic experience in place of actually being such. My experience was that SCU's undergrad is filled with entitled toxic people who pat themselves on the back because their parents paid paved their futures for them.

If you're smart enough to get into this school, you're smart enough to find a better and more affordable education."
Sophomore,2,"The biggest turn off of santa clara is the lack of spirit and personal investment in the school. A big indicator of this is the lack of school apparel worn around. There is a general apathy towards the school that is pervasive across all sectors of the student body. Greek life undoubtedly controls the social operations, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but anyone who claims to disagree is secretly in denial. The school seems to try to milk as much money as they can from you, dishing out fines for even the most trivial of things. Despite all of this, it is a really beautiful campus and the on-campus living and dining options are pretty nice."
Senior,2,"Great area, facilities, social life, and students, but the staff is very biased, close minded and bent on brainwashing their students with liberal doctrine. Very sad. Way too expensive for how little you will learn UNLESS you go into a legitimate field like business, science, or engineering. Ironically, a degree from scu is worth a decent amount however, it is still considered a “good” school. Just be aware of the extreme, leftist views of the faculty and admin, to the point of openly making the campus a hostile place for conservative students. Scu should take a serious look at themselves and start to foster a more neutral environment that is more accepting of free speech and the exchange of ideas."
Freshman,2,"It's hard to make friends at Santa Clara if you aren't big into the party scene.  I also felt as if the quality of professors was not worth the tuition I was paying.  If you aren't in greek life, good luck making friends and getting into parties."
College Freshman,2,Not too much in the way of clubs/bars.
College Freshman,2,"Sure, there is racial diversity, but pretty much everyone who goes here comes from a similar socioeconomic position. Santa Clara is a very common safety school for the students of elite bay area prep schools, if that provides any context."
College Freshman,2,"Though the school tries very hard to be one-size-fits-all, it's ultimately limited by it's size and the lack of diversity in those who attend. Don't come here if there is no particular group/activity that you are sure you want to participate in. A lot of the clubs seem legit, but actually are just resume-boosters for small groups of students. Students here, especially the ones from nearby (which there are a lot of them), are not very ""open"" to other people penetrating their quickly-determined cliques outside of extracurricular. Additionally, you will very frequently feel like your money is being wastefully allocated, and you will be a member of an incredibly apathetic student body if you attend Santa Clara University."
College Sophomore,2,Too much focus on greek life.
College Sophomore,2,"The social system is run by greek life. If you have no affiliation whatsoever, you will find it near impossible to hang out with friends part of that social circle since they are the ones with all the mandatory parties"
College Freshman,2,Very little is covered by the university in the form of scholarships.
College Freshman,2,I strongly question how nutritious the dining options on campus are. Many things are made with way too much oil. One perk is the Cellar Market where there are healthier snack options.
College Freshman,2,"Aside from 5-6 off campus eating options, there isn't much within walking distance. It's pretty necessary to have a car or know somebody who does."
College Freshman,2,"It exists and people wear letter sweatshirts, but fraternities don't really have that big of an impact on the population. Sororities are kind of a big deal, but if you don't join greek life your life is neither ruined or greatly benefited."
College Freshman,2,"Women's soccer team is the best team here. Men's basketball can draw big crowds especially when we play our rival Gonzaga. No football team, so other than a few exceptions no one really shows a lot of interest in our varsity sports."
College Junior,2,Rent is very high for anything remotely close to the school. The house I rented last year was a shithole and was $890 a month for half of a cramped room.
College Sophomore,2,They rarely let people into the business sxhool if you want to transfer into it
College Sophomore,2,Other schools of similar and better academics offered me way more in scholarships. SCU gave nothing
College Junior,2,"The only team our school really has going for us is women's soccer. Our men's basketball team has the most potential, but we hardly ever win which is disappointing. There is an obvious lack of support for our sports teams and general school spirit, which is really tough. The men's basketball game versus Gonzaga is one of the only games that actually fills up the arena."
College Freshman,2,"There are very few dining options in close proximity to the campus. This is a real challenge for freshmen, especially given that most underclassmen don't have cars. The dining options on campus are limited and the hours aren't condusive to a typical student's schedule."
College Junior,2,Campus life seems almost nonexistent.
College Junior,2,"I am kind of astounded by how homogenous the student body is. However, everyone is very nice and kind. "
College Sophomore,2,"Currently trying to find housing off-campus, and I wish it were an easier and assisted process. "
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman year, personally, seemed as if there was very little diversity, but currently as a sophomore, there seems to be more diversity, though SCU could definitely improve on that. "
College Sophomore,2,"All near parking spaces have a time limit. Most parking spots are taken during the day, the best time to find parking is at night. There are several parking spots without time limits, but they're usually a block or two away."
College Junior,2,"It's somewhat costly, and they're extremely strict with their rules. For two whole years I've parked in the same exact parking spot in the garage of a dorm building and they ticketed me for not having the permit clearly visible. I complained, the school gets so much money, they should have the license plates and spots in a system to look up and not carelessly ticket."
Recent Alumnus,2,No football team. No swim team. Not very may intramural sports clubs or choices.
College Senior,2,"a lot of spaces but pretty expensive in my opinion. Also, since the San Jose Earthquakes play at our stadium, occasionally parking will be limited to Earthquake VIP's from about 430 pm. Pretty dumb if you ask me"
College Sophomore,2,"Parking permits are expensive, freshman can't have cars on campus, and for San Jose Earthquake games some parking lots need to be allocated for visitors so students frequently have to re-park their cars. That being said, there's enough spaces for each student, although the best parking lots aren't really located near the classroom buildings."
College Sophomore,2,"I got a pretty decent scholarship and I didn't even apply for it. Many of my friends are on full-ride, but if you don't have high test scores or special considerations, then you're pretty much out of luck."
College Sophomore,2,"Freshman Can't Bring a Car – Not that many freshman need a car, but it sucks for those occasions when you want to go shopping and have to pay for the bus or a cab. You can apply for a permit if you have special needs (like a medical condition or an off-campus job). If you don't get a permit, just befriend an upper-classman."
College Freshman,2,"During my first quarter here, the police broke up almost every party. Granted, I've heard from upper classmen that it hadn't always been this bad, but people had a hard time getting together for huge parties before they were broken up in 2 hours. Now that it's winter quarter, the cops have been a little more lenient."
College Freshman,2,"The school is very stingy on its financial aid. They give out high amounts of aid to certain people (arbitrarily, it would seem), and low amounts to others. It is not an evenly distributed financial aid fund."
College Freshman,2,"Ethnically, religiously, and economically there really isn't a great amount of diversity. Most of the people here are wealthier, white, people who practice the Catholic religion. This is mainly because our school is a small private Jesuit university. It is however still accepting of people of different backgrounds as I myself am African American. There are still people of different ethnic races, economic statuses, and religious backgrounds that are still represented on campus."
College Junior,2,"Public transportation is pretty good - bus is cheap. Lots of kids have cars and if you don't have one, you are kind of left out. School hardly provides any transportation."
College Sophomore,2,"Santa Clara has a big social life and this means that there is a wide array of drugs and alcohol being used. If you wanted to get alcohol or drugs, it would be very easy to do. Drugs, however, are a little more kept secret"
College Junior,2,Not So Good – the campus is a distance from downtown most of the clubs are at and even then most clubs are 21 and over. Some students on campus will throw a party here and there and they tend to be somewhat entertaining.
College Senior,2,There are people from different races and religion but school consists of mostly white students.
College Senior,2,"Its Improving. Slowly. Diversity, amongst many definitions, means racial diversity which is to mean having blacks and hispanics. And operating under that definition since it is still valid, SCU has been seeing more blacks, Hispanics, Indians and Middle Easterners, Asians, and even Swedish exchange students. However, notice the grade. Yes, thats a C-, something not really to be proud of. I give it that because as you walk around campus, youll probably notice that despite the small diversity, the majority of students or most noticeable of students, is the white, upper-middle/upper class blonde valley girl/person. Its simple economics, unfortunately. Due to the exuberant and unnecessarily high tuition, a larger number of people from the aforementioned background can afford it than those from economically disenfranchised or unfortunate can afford. Thus, more white folks. Its a sad reality, but once you get to meet your friends, its not so bad actually."
College Sophomore,2,"All the places within walking distance of SCU get old fast, specially because the good places closed down due to their leases being bought out. This shocked SCU students, because what we were left with was lower quality pizza, and no diner to get food if we want breakfast before Benson opens. That being said, if you have a car, then a variety of options are available as you have the options of going into the city, going down the Alameda, or going down to the Coleman shopping center where there are cheap places like Jamba Juice and Panera. There is a delivery service for some off-campus restaurants called Tapingo, which is convenient, but takes forever and isn't cheap by any means."
College Freshman,2,"Inconsistent at Best – One of my friends has gotten practically four strikes, but hasn't gotten into any real trouble because of it, whereas I know quite a few people that were kicked out of my dorm because of alcohol and drug use."
College Freshman,2,"Not much to do – I am a freshman and I am severely bored here at SCU. The parties are kept almost strictly to respective fraternity members and only open to the rest of campus late. The normal night in a ""party"" dorm is hanging out and taking shots of cheap alcohol. ""Going out"" is usually considered wandering around the off-campus houses in hope to become part of a huge, sweaty mosh pit at an unknown house. At Santa Clara you can find whatever you want... But I didn't, I found people that did not want to experience NorCal and who were content with drinking to excess in the dingy dorm rooms."
College Freshman,2,Lack of Communication – I had to take out more loans than I would have liked to and the communication between the financial aid office and student/parents is definitely lacking. Students working in the office are not that helpful and no one in charge seems to be around. My work study grant was given to another person with a similar name and it was difficult to meet with the right person to correct that.
College Junior,2,"The Same! It's said that SCU has athletic, good-looking students but in my opinion everyone looks the same! Same hair styles, outfits, shoes, etc. Nothing special, and nothing unique."
College Freshman,2,"Too Much Drinking – At Santa Clara people party during the night on Wednesday (tradition) and Friday and all day Saturday.  All parties are off-campus.  If you love a good party, it's great.  As a non-drinker, though, Santa Clara kind of sucks on Friday night.  Everyone goes off-campus, so the dorms are pretty empty.  I would recommend developing a comfort level with being around lots of alcohol because the best way to get by is to go around with everyone and not drink."
College Freshman,2,"The Health Center is completely useless.  The one time I tried to get a prescription filled, they never had it and I had to go days without it.  If you go to get checked for an illness, they just give you medication without a diagnosis.  Campus safety is pretty good.  They are reasonable about noise violations and if you get locked out of your room, they are very helpful and come quickly."
College Junior,2,"Not as Strict as It Claims to Be! The campus is hyped up to be extremely strict, but it's really not. The CFs (essentially RAs) are quite lax, with very few exceptions. People smoke pot in the quads of some buildings, drink regularly in rooms, and CFs hardly ever tell people to quiet down. However, when someone is written up, SCU does have a solid program in place for consequences, and keeps track of offenses."
College Senior,2,If your careful and responsible chances are you wont get caught. Its up to you.
College Sophomore,2,Back OFF – Campus safety is always on everyone's case.  It is way too easy to get caught.
College Sophomore,2,"You can get every drug you want, its great. alcohol is easily attainable, too."
College Junior,2,"Getting Bigger – It's almost a taboo topic around here- it isn't addressed as much as it probably should be.  Cocaine has become a growing issue, but it's not something everyone deals with on a daily basis.  There is definitely not a big enough problem that people should avoid SCU because of it.  However, it definitely exists here.  Drinking is more common among students.  We have a lot of cops driving down the party streets on party nights.  We are only a couple blocks away from the station, so they keep a pretty close eye on everyone and break up parties a lot.  Luckily, you don't have to drink if you don't want to.  There is a desperate (but somewhat pathetic) attempt to create alternative options on campus that offer other activities on party nights (like dance parties, movie nights, stand-up, etc...).  However, the location for these is on the opposite side of campus, and most people don't go."
College Junior,2,"There is Greek life, but it's definitely not necessary to get involved or gain status. Sororities and fraternities also aren't recognized by the school, which makes them much more low-profile."
College Junior,2,"Santa Clara University works very hard to impersonalize its communication to the student body's on both academic and social issues. This is because the university concerns itself with legality more than anything else in these matters.

Campus safety readily responds to ALL reported problems. I once thought someone stole my IPod while I was meandering outside. Despite my dubious story (indeed, someone found it on the lawn the following day) and the time of reportage (1 A.M. during Spring break--essay writing), Campus Safety was there and engaged!"
College Junior,2,Charming and Occasionally Vain – Students may be extremely conscious of their physical appearances. There is a strong emphasis on morality in SCU courses; most students at SCU know to value intrinsic worth. California has the most attractive people in the U.S.
College Senior,2,"The people in the financial aid office are not very helpful and seem to be annoyed that they are even working there.
I have a grant that pays half of my tuition, but
when it came to looking for loans for the other half, SCU was not helpful at all."
College Sophomore,2,"I personally really do not care about diversity. But if you live in Mclaughlin or Walsh, its like all ethnic people. If you like that have fun I guess"
College Sophomore,2,"The food is awful, overpriced. The good food though is on sushi Wednesday, if you like sushi, the yum yum tree man comes from across the street and makes sushi! But get there early, everyone loves it"
Alum,1,"I would never recommend this school to anyone who is a minority. Extreme lack of diversity and inclusion. Minorities are merely a marketing tool at SCU. Academics are challenging, but ok. Professors are a hit or miss in regards to caring about students. Avoid administration at all costs, they are apathetic to students' needs and are unhelpful. Campus is pretty, no complaints. Employers in California appreciate this alma mater, not much elsewhere. Athletics are only big to those who care for it. Party scene is directly linked to non affiliated Greek life. Local area is boring unless you have a car. Dorms and safety are acceptable, you can get by. Campus food is no good. Student life is very present but hardly genuine."
College Freshman,1,"Greek life is really annoying if you are not interested in participating. A lot of the members of fraternities and sororities act like they're still in high school, and often reek of entitlement. For the fraternities in particular, there is a disturbing culture of sexual coercion and a holier-than-thou attitude towards independents. The sororities are somewhat decent organizations, but there is a definite fakeness to a lot of the girls. Altogether, Greek Life is known to be expensive and less inclusive of the people who can't afford it."
College Freshman,1,I did not apply for financial aid but SCU is not known to be very generous. Somehow I did get lucky with some money but it is a very expensive school to attend.
College Freshman,1,"Santa Clara is essentially a suburb where nothing happens. Unless you have a car or a big wallet for Ubers, your stuck."
College Freshman,1,"Santa Clara is very unfair when it comes to scholarships and aid. Basically, if you are not an athlete, do not have a lot of extracurriculars/best grades, or are not a minority you do not get anything. You have to be either at the very top or very bottom to get aid. "
College Junior,1,Varsity sports and Santa Clara are not the best. We have a few teams such as women's soccer and tennis teams who always perform pretty well but the rest of the teams are not highly regarded. School spirit depends on the games; if it is an important game then you will see a lot of people out there but other games are not very populated. The athletic facilities are very good at Santa Clara University for the athletes at least.
College Junior,1,"The pro to Santa Clara off-campus housing is that most of the houses are within 1-4 blocks of the campus and no more than a 5 minute walk. The neighborhood surrounding Santa Clara is also fairly safe as well. The makeup of the area is mainly students. The cons include very expensive housing, small and old houses, bad parking if any. Most houses are crammed with double the number of students that should actually be there in order to make the prices reasonable. The leases start in October which make it very stressful to find out where you are going to live the following year. Overall, the off-campus housing at Santa Clara is below average."
College Freshman,1,"Most of the student body is noticeably white and middle to upper class. If you are a minority or do not feel comfortable around people who come from families that are very well-off, you likely won't feel like you fit in with the norm at SCU."
College Freshman,1,"Alcohol usage among underclassmen is constant. The school has disassociated itself with its Greek system, but the houses that surround the school are used for the purpose of hosting fraternity parties/house parties. Since many of these parties are open to anyone (or very easy to get into), anyone looking for a drink can walk across the street. Party nights are Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and sometimes additional days if the week is toward the beginning of a quarter. If it's an off-night, just walk around in your dorm building and you're sure to find someone with a supply of alcohol used to pregame for events and parties. (It's against dorm rules to drink in the rooms, but this is not always enforced, especially in the large freshman dorm Swig, where many of the ""community facilitators"" (RAs) turn a blind eye to drinking in the dorms)."
College Senior,1,"Sports Are Not Our Forte – Coming from a private high school who's basketball team won the State championship against public schools, I was running on a sports high when I came to SCU, looking and expecting a superb athletics department (or at least teams good enough to have an awesome crowd and school spirit section). I was disappointed. Don't suffer from what I did: recognize that SCU sports suck, and that theyre only good if youre hammered or with a bunch of friends or the occasional good basketball game. Consider yourself warned..."
College Senior,1,Absolute Nightmare – Sometimes I wonder if the Financial Aid office forgets that some students - albeit few - haven't been raised with a silver spoon shoved down their throats.  It's frustrating to be handed a stack of pamphlets when you go in asking for help (whether it be to decipher some of the technical jargon or are seeking financing advice).
College Junior,1,"Diverse but Segregated by Race – There's a lot of ethnically different students at Santa clara however everyone pretty much stays friends within their own race.  For example, all of the white people only hang out with white people and the same goes for the Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics.  I think people aren't willing to extend beyond their own comfort level and therefore they stick to students who look/act/talk like them."
College Senior,1,We Suck – Our teams suck and no one goes to the games.  We have one big basketball game a year against Gonzaga but that's pretty much it.  Our fans desperately want a team to cheer for that puts out a quality product.  Unfortunately that hasn't happened in a long time.
College Senior,1,Do Not Go Here – Despite having a 3.75 GPA I do not have any scholarships from this school.  Nor does the school actively promote any scholarships that I know of.
College Senior,1,"Do Not Go to This School – Lots of alcohol, bars are very cheap and it is very easy to go out and binge drink if you are into it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Being a minority at this school makes it tough sometimes to get into parties because people assume that you do not go to the school, and most of the parties are not dance parties, just where people drink and talk."
College Sophomore,1,"There's not much ethnic diversity on campus. The majority are white students, however, minorities are represented and there are opportunities for those groups to meet and discuss topics at MCC (the Multicultural Center).  Many people here come from wealthy backgrounds (not surprising because this is a private school), but since the school affords large scholarships, minority students and students who show academic skill and determination are present which helps round out the monoculture of people on this campus. The majority of students is religiously affiliated, and we have community on campus for LGBTQ."
College Junior,1,"I refused to be in a sorority and the girls were sassy about it. A lot of these people are fake, inconsiderate and sometimes I question some of them on how they even made it to SCU. If you don't get money from daddy or are plastic pretty good luck.."
College Senior,1,"While there are plenty of ethnic groups represented on campus through the Multicultural Center,I am sorry to say that the student dynamic makes me ashamed of my school. Each group has their own club-- the Japanese Club, the Hawaiian Club, the Chinese Student Association, etc. There is NO multicultural club, and the International Club is for foreign students to get acquainted with the campus. This creates enormous divides in the student body and in no way fosters community."
College Senior,1,"Students don't attend very many athletic team events...but I will always hold that SCU students have school spirit, even if they don't have spirit for sports. I'm not sure why those two things have become the same in our minds. The athletic facilities are really nice. The teams don't always do so hot."

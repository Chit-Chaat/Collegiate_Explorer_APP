Junior,5,Online didn't start for me until the pandemic so it was definitely a change for the whole school but they made the switch as best as they could and tried to accommodate to every student.
Junior,5,One of the best decisions I ever made was coming to this school. They really make you feel at home. Professors are nice and work with you and your situation. food is okay. Dorms are okay but getting better. The people really make all that it is honestly.
Freshman,5,After Covid occurred i took classes online at first it was slow cause many professors were confused but overtime it got better.
Sophomore,5,Hampton University provides a supportive academic environment while instilling ethics and morals into us as students becoming responsible adults.    Fellow students provide friendships that I hope will last forever.  We mentor each other as well as have fun.  The whole HBCU package!
Sophomore,5,"My Name is Faith Garland and i am a Bahamian. Hampton University was absolutely gracious to me. The lecturers at hampton were very helpful and i promise they all want you to succeed. The campus is beautiful and the people are so friendly. The dorm that i stayed in was okay. overall, I am so thankful to Dr. Harvey and everyone else that contributed to my stay at Hampton University, the experience was like no other, from learning in the classrooms straight down to the parties."
Sophomore,5,Online classes with Hampton University was wonderful. I found it easier to present assignments and interact with my professors via email. The best part about having classes online was not having to wake up an hour in advance toget ready and take a ten minute walk to get to class.
Senior,5,"They continuously motivated students through being open and honest about any problem we brought to them. They also opened my eyes to new  opportunities and internships that gave me a better view of the  veterinary field. I was able to land a internship at the Smithsonian and have contact with the Dr. Pierre Comizzoli,  who researches Animal physiology at the Smithsonian.  Another professor told me about Adventures of Veterinary Medicine which is a week long summer program.  With the help of recommendations from my Molecular biology and Physics professor I was not only accepted but was also awarded a scholarship for it. The Professors there really helped me find myself and opened my eyes to an impactful career that I love and can make a difference in. I have learned so much over the years and have been exposed to amazing people and experiences because of it. I know without a doubt, that I wouldn't be where I am today without the wonderful professors at Hampton University."
Sophomore,5,i had the best time for my first year at this school. the people are friendly and the school is really like a close knit family. every program is meant for you to be successful at being your best self. the teachers are willing to help if you are willing to ask for it. i cannot wait to return in the fall.
Freshman,5,"I like how the professors really care about you academically, and how the people around really want the best for you."
Niche User,5,"Hampton University has provided me the most offers than the other colleges that I got accepted to. Furthermore, Hampton has a extremely elegant campus, diverse people, an outstanding marching band, and welcoming students. I really look forward to being enrolled to this university."
Niche User,5,"I really love the atmosphere and how welcoming the students on the campus are. In addition to feeling extremely welcomed i also feel at home at Hampton. To further back this up, I feel at home with Hampton because of how many minorities im surrounded by. Me myself being a black and Puerto Rican young woman I truly appreciate a campus where I can feel comfortable in my own skin, and now that I will find someone else within my race that i can relate to."
Freshman,5,I am currently a 1st year Computer Science Major and all I can say is that Hampton University is one of the best Universities I have ever seen. It has a great campus and an even greater computer science program; a great school to attend.
Freshman,5,"I love it there at my hbcu. Im just poor and trying to continue my education and need a little help towards my tuition. I only need 5,000 a semester to countinue as a pre-pharm student. I have always wished to be a pharmacist and I hope that one day I will be a PharmD."
Alum,5,I will always remember my experience at Hampton. It was the best four years of my life. I have lasting friendships and memories that I will cherish forever!
Niche User,5,When I stepped on campus it felt like home. It is filled with beautiful and successful people and I can not wait to join them on campus.
Junior,5,I love this school. This is one of the best schools to attend if you’re trying to get ahead. So don’t let your life pass you by
Junior,5,"One of the things I enjoy about Hampton University is the people that they have. Hampton University has some of the most genuine and hardworking people that I have ever met. Everyone is extremely motivated and determined to be successful and that kind of energy and ora surrounding campus is contagious. This kind of energy makes me want to give it my very best in all my endeavors whether that is in the classroom or athletically because I know that there are plenty of people around me that are on the same mission as me. The people at Hampton University whether that is a coach, professor or friend has always been there for me in all aspects of my life. Hampton feels as though that there is more than a University but more of a family and thats why I enjoy Hampton University and enjoy being at Hampton. A lot has happened within the past few months with my mom and grandmother having to be in the hospital and the people at Hampton have been there each step of the way."
Sophomore,5,I really like the professors and all my classes.  I am learning alot. This is my second year as a student there and I can tell that the administration really care about the students.
Sophomore,5,"I like how Hampton University is a diverse school, despite that it is a HBCU. There are tons of ways to be involved at this school."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Hampton University is how much of a family we are and how much leadership, pride, and hard work Hampton students put into their lives at the university. There are a lot of activities that are mostly school related that help HU students have fun while still getting their studies done. Such as clubs, social events, plays, meetings, etc. There are also organizations that the school offers to students to expand their learning in other subjects that can help the student grow as a young adult and also give back to their community.  All and all Hampton University is a wonderful HBCU  to attend and I am very grateful I found my home by the sea."
Freshman,5,"My first year at Hampton has been eye opening, I am happy to be apart of a community full of student leaders. Attending Hampton is helping me to expand on my business as well as opening my eyes to new doors. While getting m education at Hampton, it has been challenging but good for me to say the least. I am excited to return in the fall."
Freshman,5,"Hampton University is a great school, with a well rounded educated teachers and staff. I am glad I picked this school as well as the 5 year MBA program."
Junior,5,"The absolute best experience I can share it when I first arrived at HU, day one freshmen year I was embrace like all of the students as a part of our established class name and identity; in my case Onyx 11 (it just so happen my brother was Onyx 7, and mom was Onyx 4).  It made sense that even though we all start together with our big dreams and goals, but understand we may not finish our race together.  But you will always belong to Onyx11, forever.  It relatively easy to seek out and join organizations that fit your interest and personality. Unfortunately, the dormitories NEED a major overhaul! GO HU."
Freshman,5,I really love that the campus always filled positive interactions and incredible people to share my ideas with. It is remarkable and outstanding campus with endless possibilities to stay academically  interactive.
Freshman,5,Wonderful supportive faculty and staff. Beautiful  campus and history. The housing is deplorable However and the food is bad!
Freshman,5,I've been to the campus and it is beautiful. I have many friends that have gone to Hampton University and they were very successful. I hope to follow in their footsteps and become successful as well. I think that Hampton University will help me achieve this goal.
Senior,5,Hampton University is a school that produces excellence. There are many resources available to students to ensure their success. The environment is friendly and welcoming.
Sophomore,5,"The thing I like most about Hampton is that there are so many opportunities to excel at in every aspect of life. Such as scholar programs within your school and internship opportunities are sent out daily! The thing that I do not like is the dorms but, the school has started to remodel all of the dorms on campus!"
Niche User,5,"View all of there qualifications and procedures the school has just like their spirt and campus is amazing. I did so much research viewing their school chant to their tuition. I really enjoy their school chant which their mascot is the Pirates. Which is one of the multiple reasons I would love to go there. Another reason I love that school is because it’s a HBCU, I support every race but it’s beautiful to see schools that are founded on the soul of acres people had to fight for."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here. There is so much culture and pride here. When there are events, it's a family like atmosphere on the campus. The alumni are so helpful with information after college or internships. Hampton really is a great place to be."
Niche User,5,It is a good learning environment and everyone there is so welcoming. The scenery is really nice. I like the whole back story around the circle with the flags as a student I feel like that gives to a reason to push yourself.  I like that there is a church so you can continue going to church.
Freshman,5,I like how the professors teach and explain the lessons that are being taught. Campus life is a very good way for learning about yourself and others. You will get the opportunity to explore a lot of things that will go on during the semester.
Senior,5,"My experience at Hampton University was great. I really learned a lot about myself.  I met so many people during my time here at Hampton University. I participated in clubs such as DMV PAC, Psychology club, Service Spree, SRT, ASA club, and National Honor Society for Psychology."
Sophomore,5,Great instructors and academic programs!  Beautiful small campus with waterfront setting.  Family like setting.
Freshman,5,I am attending Hampton University Pre-College Summer Institute. Thus far I am enjoying my classes and the professors. Hampton University is a excellent school with high academic standards. The college campus is new to me and thus far I enjoy being here.
Junior,5,"The Hampton University atmosphere is one that you cannot compare to other Univeristies. Hampton students and alumni partake In certain traditions; some being 12-2, Holland and Ogden crossing prior to graduation. These traditions make Hampton unique because they are celebrated for generations. The Hampton community ranges from 3,000-4,000  students total a year but our connection is strong and we are willing to help any of our fellow Hamptonians. However, something I would like to see change are the dorms. They are historical building that were built in the 1900’s but they could use some renovations. Maybe changing the bathroom stalls and the closets that are in the dorm. Overall, Hampton is an illustrious and wonderful school which I wouldn’t be happier anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,I love the university. It was definitely a cultural shock to what i was use to. It showed me the importance of the up liftment of the african american communities. Attending a HBCU will allow one to  recognize the importance of working together. I’ve learned some many and my interpersonal skills have developed the environment is so friendly and welcoming
Niche User,5,"I believe that after touring the campus and learning more about the school, I can excel at Hampton University."
Senior,5,"The illustrious Hampton University has nurtured and strengthened my sense of individual and communitive pride in standards of excellence within the young, black students at historically black colleges and universities across the nation. As a young black man pursuing academic and professional success As my home by the sea continues to shape and mature curious, eager minds, I hope to see a continued renewal of educational facilities."
Niche User,5,Hampton has great hospitality. As soon as you walk on campus you feel welcome. You get a great tour if you ever visit. You see that they have many traditions and good student life. They take care of the freshman as soon as they come in.
Niche User,5,The tour i had at Hampton University was very exceptional. It really had me interested in every little thing they presented to me.
Alum,5,I had an amazing experience at the REAL HU! No other college experience can compare to the community and opportunities I experienced at Hampton. It's a small campus with intimate class setting with tons to offer it's students.
Freshman,5,"I love the environment and community of the school. Between the students, the faculty, and the outside residents the school provided a comfortable and warm welcome."
Freshman,5,"I like how Hampton prepares you for the real world. For example, Hampton has you dress up certain events. They help you prepare for business causal and business professionals event. Hampton helps you come out of your shell. Also, I live the local community is cool. The academics are great. Hampton is one of the top hbcu's. The professors are nice and helpful."
Freshman,5,I am a freshmen at Hampton University and I am enjoying my first semester at college. I play lacrosse and it was my goal and dream to play D1 Lacrosse and Hampton gave me the opportunity to play and get my degree in sports management. I am excited to be a part of this young team and to grow with the program.
Freshman,5,"I chose Hampton University for the outstanding academic opportunity.  Hampton is ranked as the third best HBCU in the country. The faculty seems to care about their students, and are known for going the extra mile to help them succeed.   Choosing to study Kinesiology/Exercise Science has been a dream of mine since I began to run track and field.  I am looking forward to learning about the muscles of the human body and the skeletal system.   The school is located on a peninsula, surrounded by water on three sides.  The view of the water is very beautiful.  The campus is historic, with buildings that have been around since the 1800s. It will be good to attend a school with such a rich history."
Sophomore,5,Hampton instills pride in your community and self awareness.  It has great academics and professors who are willing yo help you achieve your goals.
Niche User,5,I have been accepted by Hampton and have basically grown up on this campus! Over the years I have participated in various activities that have contributed to enhancing leadership skills and personal growth. Hampton is an amazing university with a very rich history that offers opportunities for all people.
Freshman,5,"I love Hampton University! classes.  Hampton is a tough college academically, but it is only tough love. They want you to succeed the best you can therefore they will hold you to a higher standard than other students in other Universities. This is so when you are competing for things such as internships and job opportunities you will already be ahead of the game.  Hampton has a plan for every major and makes sure you have what you need to do to be successful once you graduate. Teachers will hold you accountable for your grades in the classes, and they rarely accept excuses. This makes some teachers seem like they don't really care however, if you stick through the battle and prove yourself academic wise you will become a better a person and have a great sense of responsibility. This leaves nothing ahead of your dreams and aspirations in life."
Niche User,5,The campus environment feels like home. All of the faculty and students are very helpful. The campus seems safe and academics are a top priority at the university.
Niche User,5,When I visited the campus I fell in love with the culture along with the safety aspect. Every 100 ft there is an emergency post that allows you to press a red button if you are in danger. I also love the teacher to student ratio alongside with the fact that they make you dress up as your profession everyday.
Senior,5,"I had the best experienced of my life at Hampton..Hampton has taught me so much value in life.
.we will always be closed"
Freshman,5,It his truly a selective school . The experience that you have in the 1st week is next to none based off of my friends feedback from other hbcu’s.
Freshman,5,The school is great! You meet people you will cherish forever. The curriculum is bad but at the end it is worth it.
Freshman,5,"Hampton University or better known as “your home by the sea” is a great historically black college/ university that strive students into excellence. With the beautiful scenery of the bay to the beauty of their students, is a great place to study and carve yourself into the person that you would want to see yourself become in the future. Even though some professors speak little English it’s the students that make eachother great. Study sessions, office hours, and even student tutoring are great factors of this University."
Junior,5,"Hampton University is definitely the standard of excellence. It instills leadership and professional skills that you won't even realize you have. The campus is very family oriented so you'll never feel alone. The teachers believe in your success and will go to many measures to ensure you reach it. Overall, Hampton University will be your favorite Home by the Sea and you won't regret it!"
Alum,5,"Hampton University was an amazing experience, I enjoyed being around young educated African American people that I could relate to. The people I met are my friends for life and I wouldn't change a thing about it."
Niche User,5,I absolutely loved the campus when i went for a college tour. The staff was very friendly and i would recommend this school to everyone i know.
Sophomore,5,My first year was great. I felt like I was safe everywhere I went on campus. Any information is always available for you. And the staff is always there to help when needed.
Niche User,5,"One of the best HBCUs-- good education, notable school, lifelong friends and relationships. 
Diversity in people, backgrounds, and interest. 
Dorms a little older, a few new dorms."
Sophomore,4,"Due to Covid-19, I finished my Fresh year online. It was an adjustment but all things worked out well. I am now taking two online classes for the Summer and will continue online classes for Fall 2020 due to Covid-19.  I am very much looking forward to getting back on campus."
Sophomore,4,"Hampton University is a Historical Black College University. I love the rich history of the school and the continuation of it's excellence in educating African Americans as well as other races and cultures.  I knew I wanted to be a part of the history as a student to better myself as a person and to one day, give back to my community and others who are pursuing their education at an HBCU"
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are very knowledgeable about the curriculum, very interactive and responsive. Lessons taught in professional manner."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see how to connect eith teachers and missed assignments or whats due like a fusions pahe we had un high school.
Senior,4,"Switching to online classes was a trying experience however, the professors that I had were able to adapt relatively quickly. Most of my classes required presentations and Student-leading discussions. They were able to utilize Blackboard Collaborative for lectures and I did not feel inhibited because of it. It felt as if I was still in the classroom. They asked many questions and kept the whole class engaged throughout the class period. The only downside is that I cannot personally go to their office hours in person, as I would if I was on campus. There feedback once a student has emailed would be delayed more than usual."
Sophomore,4,Hamptons online system was very good and well thought out it just takes a lot of self discipline to log onto the classes when you are supposed to.
Freshman,4,"As a minority that grew up in predominantly white neighborhoods it's really been an eye opener and great experience. There's a big since of cultural pride and unity even though everyone different. My only complaint would be the ""Hampton run-around,"" which can make technical things a little difficult sometimes."
Sophomore,4,I love how hampton is extremely cultured...being that it is a historically black college. The reason for not enjoying my time there would be because it’s pretty difficult being from California and going to school with no family nor friends in Virginia with you.
Sophomore,4,"Hampton University is one of the most prestigious HBCUs in the country; it's rooted in tradition and history. Hampton pushes me out of my comfort zone, and pushes me academically and socially. Professors create warm and fun learning environments, that allow for open discussions. The buildings need updates, especially considering how expensive the tuition is, and the quality of the food could be much better. Hampton opened a plethora of networking and connections for me. I constantly get emails about opportunities to grow my skills and resume. There are numerous clubs on campus, and if there is not a club that suits your interests, teachers, and mentors will help you get one started. Hampton prepares young African American and black students on how to be great adults and professionals in the real world, while still teaching them how to embrace diversity. Looking for a university that pushes you academically and has amazing support, then Hampton University is the place to be!"
Senior,4,"Hampton University was the perfect university for me. It is an old school, so they do things the old fashioned way. They could make more technological improvements around campus. They’re marketing department could also do better in communicating with the students about on campus events and issues. However, the academics and overall culture of the institution is awesome. The teachers care about you, and want everyone to succeed. Athletics are great. The teams garnered great successes over the years, and are supported by the rest of campus."
Junior,4,"From the start of freshman year, my experience has been pretty good. Like every school, Hampton has problems that need to be fixed but again thats every school. I will say, the amount of tuition, you don't get everything you'd need. Some teachers are terrible but others are pretty good. Dorms aren't the best either but Hampton is realizing this and is starting to get better."
Freshman,4,This was the college I had pursued interest in and I'm thankful to be attending it. It's been a pleasant welcome from their staff. They appear to care about you receiving your degree in your major and pursuing a career in it. School is very expensive though.
Freshman,4,"This past semester has been very hard on me. I am still trying to adjust, however, the school itself is great. I love it there even though it has its flaws. I love my HBCU."
Niche User,4,Hampton University's campus is very old but meaningful because of the history it carries. As far as diversity Hampton is an HBCU so it is dominantly black
Sophomore,4,"Although this is only my second year at Hampton University, I feel that I have a home away from home. The school provides rigorous educational courses that help you move towards your career goals. It reinforces me to work hard and strive for excellence. There have been times where I have thought that the major I have chosen was not for me, but I believe with time management, rigorous studying, and determination, I can obtain the grades, opportunities, and connections needed to become my desired profession of becoming a doctor in medicine."
Sophomore,4,I love the academics at Hampton. I feel as thought I am getting the best possible education on my field of study. I do think that Hampton could do better at planning events at school because often there are too many events planned in one night. I also feel that Hampton could improve on acceptance into organizations. Some organizations are very strict on accepting members and I do not think that that is helpful to students trying to get themselves involved in school.
Junior,4,"Hampton University has given me the opportunity to surround myself with a variety of people who are of African descent. This experience has, and continues to, blossom my confidence and educate me on the many beautiful aspects of Black people and Black culture. I would never trade my Hampton experience for anything however if the school had better facilities, technology, and food, the university would be unmatched"
Sophomore,4,"Hampton University has a very family oriented environment. This makes it easier for study groups to form, making it easier to network after graduation."
Junior,4,It’s a decent school to attend would recommend the people are friendly and are willing to help if you’re willing to put in the time and effort.
Junior,4,"I enjoy Hampton University because it is truly a community of predominantly African Americans striving for excellence. There have been issues pertaining to the food and the administration, but all in all I believe that the experience is what each individual makes it. With diligence, a student will find plenty of resources and wisdom beyond the four walls of the classroom."
Sophomore,4,"Hampton is very expensive but besides that a great school. The alumni presence is strong and for good reason. I’m only a sophomore and can see that Hampton has a lot to offer all students and the “vibe” that people have is something that is hard to find. You feel as though you’re a part of a family. The environment is also great. During the day the sun shines bright and reflects off the water beautifully. At night the stars are out and the air is wonderful. It does rain but when it does it’s a good rain that sucks very pleasant and welcomed. Classes are as expected, collegiate level and harder. Definitely recommend to those that aspire to be excellent."
Alum,4,Hampton is a really nice HBCU and it's academics is excellent. Their athletics is also good since they are a D1 NCAA school.
Sophomore,4,"Hampton, is a school of opportunity, position and critics. I loved how Hampton, aimed to do so much for the student board. I would love to see Hampton expand, and also grow more into 1 school. It’s “cliquish” events should be more socially oriented."
Sophomore,4,The university offers great education along with great availability to academic resources and support.
Sophomore,4,"My first two years have been interesting with some adjustment to the HBCU scene . I have done well academically and I am becoming for comfortable with the social scene. The teachers , counselors and faculty on the campus seem to really care about the success of all students. The campus food is not the best but there are plenty of other pluses on the campus. What a relaxing atmosphere to study and learn in this ""Home by the Sea"". You get out of it what you put in ."
Freshman,4,Hampton University is a school where higher excellence is pursued in most areas of a career field. The Academics are alright with a decent amount of options in classes that gives students different experiences through their education. Although some professors who work there tend to be rated at low levels as their teaching style isn’t made to accommodate the students needs to learn the given material. the cafeteria food Is very poorly made. The campus is a very nice accessible campus with every class needed in walking distance there are ways to find to have fun at Hampton university I have personally. I believe Hampton university is a good school and the experience is what you make of it.
Junior,4,I really enjoy the people I've met at Hampton University. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. The small student body really gives students a chance to get to know members their class. I would like to see improvement from some of the professors in their teaching methods but other than this my experience at Hampton has been very pleasant so far.
Freshman,4,Hampton has been a interesting experience. it has become a place where i was able to make connections  and network with people. So much so that i am actually less worried about finding a job when i get out of college because i know i have connections that will express how hard i work and the value i can add to a company. The beautiful campus allows students to relax and avoid stressful situations. Students often will sit and just enjoy the view of the water when they get a chance. So far the Hampton experience has been a joyful experience.
Freshman,4,Hampton University has a very beautiful campus being that it's a private institution and has an excellent academic program.
Freshman,4,I love the people that come from all over the country. The diversity and spirit that comes through the campus is amazing. The all-around good vibes are what make the experience so valuable for all people.
Sophomore,4,"The culture within this school is unmatched. Although this may not be the best place for everyone, for those that enjoy it have a home and strong social network of people that want them to succeed. This is a community of people that want to achieve great things and are willing to grab a fellow classmate, dorm mate, or club member along for the climb."
Freshman,4,"I'm currently a Freshman at Hampton University and I must say that I a VERY happy here! Hampton University has so many resources and professors that are determined to help their students become successful. so far, my experience at Hampton University has been a challenging yet great one!"
Freshman,4,"There is always something to do here. I am always busy between academics, athletics, and socializing.  I truly enjoy being a Hamptonian."
Junior,4,"Hampton has a very diverse culture, being that the students are from all over the country and it’s phenomenal"
Freshman,4,I like the community and the support you recieve from the professors and your advisors. What I would like to see change is a renovation of the dorms because they are quite old and there’s sometimes a bug problem.
Freshman,4,Great caring environment just wish biology and math department was slightly better. Both departments are filled with professors who do not care much for o help. Feels like you’re on your own. Other than that great school and environment. Wouldn’t trade the hbcu experience for anything!
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed the close nit family style of the campus. This made it easier to build friendships and build relationships with faculty. The campus life was very amazing and offered many extra curricular opportunities for every student who attended. If I could change anything it would be the on campus housing. The dorms are out dated and need some enhancements. The Financial Aid office could use some improvement as well. Many students received reimbursements fairly late, and some students depend on their refunds to pay for books and other necessities."
Junior,4,"Hampton University is my ideal HBCU. The professors and advisors worked one on one with you and actually want you to succeed. There is just enough partying, not too much and not too little. It seemed at first that HU was right on your tail and kept you from enjoying your social life but as time goes by you see that they want you to enjoy your time while being safe. Freshmen curfew was a downer sometimes. There'd be late events that we could only partially participate in due to having a curfew and sometimes got put on early curfew for coming in a few minutes late. However, when curfew was over some wished they had it to keep them on track. One thing I do not like about the school is there aren't too many social groups to join and the ones that are available have to be dug up because there isn't a lot of promoting for them. Other than that I love my HBCU and wouldn't trade it for another."
Alum,4,"Hampton University was a great experience. I was able to really branch out of my shy ways, and developed long term relationships. I continue to speak with majority of those I know and I continue to meet new Hamptonians. The university has updated a lot since I attended and it is definitely moving in the right direct for people of color."
Senior,4,"A common phrase that can be heard is ""Hampton is what you make it."" I have had an amazing time at Hampton leaning about myself, my people, and how I fit into society. If you go out and network, and take advantage of the opportunities here, there is no doubt that you can come to love Hampton and the many connections you make with it."
Senior,4,"My experience with Hampton is good so far. My first year was tough because I was not use to dorm life and the dorms weren't that well kept up, the food isn't that great either in my opinion, but otherwise I had no issue getting through it. in my later years I got an apartment, which made my college life easier. Academically its tough, professors treat you like their you're own, being an HBCU, its mostly African American based with a few other ethnicities mixed in. although being a D1 school, we are average at sports. Campus is filled with beautiful, social people, campus life is good with food spots and a student center for people to socialize. Hampton isn't a big city so the party scenes are always local. overall I enjoy being at Hampton, if you come from a big city it will allow you to focus more on your academics."
Sophomore,4,My freshman year at Hampton University was a good one. Hampton does a great job of making the incoming freshmen transition into college life an easy one. Student life on is great. There are always various activities for the students on campus. Some of the dorms are older and could use some remodeling and the food at the cafe' could use some tweaking but the campus is beautiful and the views looking out on the Chesapeake Bay are breath taking.
Freshman,4,I feel as though that Hampton University is a great school. They just need to have a better financial package for students who deserves it.
Junior,4,What I like about Hampton is they put freshman on a curfew their first semester to keep them focused on academics. I didn't appreciate it at first but I'm glad they did because the first few semesters are so critical to keep a good GPA.
Senior,4,"I love my Major, department, and my professors. As an Architecture student, I have been blessed to be in an environment where the studio culture is uplifting and those from higher years help incoming freshmen to get situated but also share the knowledge. There is a sense of unity and togetherness. As a student body, we are trying to make changes to uplift one another. We are seeing progress in small ways but our efforts are profound. one challenge we are facing is finding ways to bring in scholarships since there aren't many funds available to us. I wish to see more help and assistance given to us as students to help with our struggles."
Senior,4,Hampton U is a great university to go to. Just like any other university it has it ups and downs. But as HU students say. “Hampton is what u make it”.
Alum,4,"Of course, every school has its pros and cons. My time at Hampton University was rewarding, yet challenging. Academically rigorous, yet the living conditions led me to live off-campus. The freshman dorms are not kept up like they should be and the cafe food could be better. Other than that, I loved attending a HBCU and learned more about myself and culture in the process."
Sophomore,4,"Through my freshman year at Hampton University, I have learned that in order to enact change is like pulling teeth. The administration has been intact for some 40 years, therefore it is very difficult to get things such as food quality, dorm maintenance, and events to change for the better. Although this year was a very academically rigorous year, it did lack in other areas. In the aforementioned areas, students had to organize a sit in protest in order to have our voices and concerns addressed. Academically speaking, Hampton University is not lacking at all, well, at least in my experience. All of my professors were professional, thorough, and cared about the well being and academic journey of their students. Entering my sophomore year, I look forward to how this illustrious institution will grow, or decline!"
Junior,4,"Even though Hampton is a very histocally black college and holds great history it still needs to be kept up to par in terms of resident halls, academic buildings , and food services. Still, despite the need for improvement it still gets students ready for whatever career they want based on the professors there. Also, I still have fun with friends and the activities that the school holds."
Freshman,4,"Overall, Hampton is a great school. I know a lot of people have seen the problems we've had going on this school year, but there has been a huge change throughout the year. Hampton is what you make it, remember that."
Freshman,4,My overall experience has been very good.  I have learned a great deal about myself and appreciate all of the support of my BIG and the staff.
Freshman,4,"When I first came to visit the campus back in April of 2017, I immediately felt welcomed at this campus. Everybody was so welcoming and willing to help me with whatever I needed assistance with. Coming to this campus as a student, we all immediately connected as a unit and as a family. Now, something that should be altered is the food in the cafeteria considering that there have been plenty of complaints. 
Overall, this campus is provides a great atmosphere to anybody who comes here."
Sophomore,4,I love my school and its a great place to learn and make friends and connections that will last a lifetime. Its a small school with small class sizes and a tightly nit community. There are so many opportunities to have fun and get involved alongside academic involvement.
Freshman,4,Attending Hampton University has opened my eyes to a new world. Exposed me to a new level of education and opened the doors to forming my future.
Freshman,4,I like the way the campus is set up and the people on the campus are nice and friendly which makes for a better environment to complete your school work.
Sophomore,4,"Hampton wasn't my first choice I will admit but it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I've made some great friend that I believe that will last a long time and the school challenges me enough to know that they're preparing me for greater. The food here has it's bad day's but over all it's still pretty good, especially their Fried Chicken Wednesday's. Everyone loves Fried Chicken Wednesday's. The campus is breath tacking I remember when I came to visit as a senior in High School is when I made up mind about attending Hampton, and our water front view is liberating you'd want to always enjoy the view to do your homework, have a picnic, or just sit there to relax. Hampton is more about business now and party later, we do have fun but it's always work first. Hampton has it's moments but at the end of the day you won't be let down, it's 100% satisfactory."
Alum,4,"Hampton is great! Just be forewarned: the Hampton Runaround is real. Be prepared to lose a lot of time trying to get around bureaucratic red tape. Still, the experience is unlike anything you could imagine."
Alum,4,"The campus is beautiful and the benches along the water front provide a positive space to destress from your classes. The student to teacher ratio is ideal for learning and allows for there to be a more engaging class session. The professors of my department cared a lot about their students, and put forth a lot of effort to make their futures successful after Hampton. However, due to the uniqueness of the campus, provided by the age of the buildings, proved quite a challenge for living arrangements. Buildings need to be renovated/rebuilt to accommodate for all health needs."
Freshman,4,I really like the diversity of hampton. You have most blacks but there's still a mixture of people who are all over the us that you get to meet and that's not normal from where I am from.
Senior,4,"My experience at Hampton university has been a rocky journey. I am glad I chose to attend my Home by The Sea. I made some lifetime friends, could come out of my shell and grow as a young adult. I figured out what journey I want to take career wise and I learned a lot, academically and personally. I had great professors who could help me figure out my calling and what I could see myself doing in the near future. What I would like to see change are the professors in some departments and the housing for all the students on- campus. Instead of being money hungry and trying to accept many students, Hampton should focus on the ones that are currently attending and help them any possible."
Niche User,2,Overall I will say Hampton University was not worth the money I spent and the Architecture Curriculum was not up to par at all. Student life was ok. Dorms were horrible. Food was ehh.
Junior,2,"One of the biggest concerns about Hampton as a student is how dated it is. Of course, this is partially due to its deep rooted history as an institution, but the extent of this antiquatedness is - in my experience - one of the biggest reasons why so many students either transfer or lose all enthusiasm for learning."
Freshman,2,I have a relative that attended Hampton University. How they described their experience at Hampton was vastly different from my own. Sad to say my own was negative.
Freshman,2,"The people of Hampton are about the only thing that makes this school good. You will have the opportunity to be around some of the best people you'll ever meet. Besides that, the university itself is downright ancient and frankly unacceptable. Most buildings are extremely old and many rules and aspects of the school are simply outdated. Students don't have consistent access to simple things like hot water and wifi. The school doesn't seem to care and change is never going to come. If the university itself was improved, it would be a 5 star because of the amazing people, but sadly it is not the case."
Freshman,2,"I came onto campus expecting a very different experience than what I was given. The administration does not care about the students, trying to get help was merely impossible without having to do the Hampton run around. The dorms were horrible and nothing seemed to be going right for me over there. The school just has to be the place for you and for me, it was not."
Freshman,2,Hampton has a lot of problems internally. I think they would be an amzing school if they didn't have the current adminstration they have now. If someone is reading this and they plan on attending this University I wold advise you to research the Town Hall meeting we had this year.
Senior,2,"Hampton University is the worse HBCU in existence. Students are treated and act poorly. Professors change emotions more than a pregnant woman in her last trimester. The campus ""police"" give tickets to people in the right. Administration care more about your money, rather than the educational purpose."
Graduate Student,2,"Hampton University accepts students who's GRE scores may not be the highest, but have a good application package as a whole. The university however does not upgrade the WiFi even though it is in desperate need. The heat runs in the summer and the air runs in the winter. No one seems to answer emails or phone calls within a timely manner."
College Freshman,2,Im not an athlete so I wouldn't know
College Junior,2,"I wouldn't choose my school again because how houses works, I do not like some of the classes and it is a very small town."
Recent Alumnus,2,Hard to get into chosen Greek life
College Sophomore,2,Do better. It could be ten times better and more than what it actually is.
College Sophomore,2,"Security is very unprofessional. No harm on campus, but a lot of recent break-ins on the off campus apartments."
College Junior,2,They have facilities that close they should be open later to suite all students
College Sophomore,2,It's not appetizing but you wont starve
College Sophomore,2,"The are no workshops or offices that offer the students scholarships. The financial ""aid"" office is more of a place to pay money than to find money."
College Sophomore,2,"WHY on Earth would you put the health center so far away from the dorms!? You want people to visit the center if they fall ill, but it is so far away that no one who is sick and in their right mind would walk all the way over there"
College Sophomore,2,There are not a lot of healthy off-campus dinning options. Only cost efficient places is Chenellos Pizza
College Sophomore,2,"Personally the cafeteria food is un healthy, it needs to have more healthier food options."
College Freshman,2,"The cafe's food is not great quality. I personally think the best food they offer is the pasta line. Also, the cafe often runs out of plates and cups so we have to use plastic ones instead. The cafe could stay open longer too."
College Freshman,2,The campus run around and I have some really good grades and barely have any financial aid from the university.
College Sophomore,2,Not clean and very old
College Student,2,"I say it's bad but it is actually helpful and conducive to the learning process at Hampton. We had a curfew the first semester of our freshman year and we weren't allowed to have in room visitation until mid-second semester. Also, Hampton isn't big on warnings and are quick to give people ""out by 5's""."
College Student,2,"-Shared bathrooms

-small rooms 

-""historic"" (no rennovations; look exactly like they did when they were first built)"
College Student,2,"The food on campus is of course not the very best options to choose from. When I experienced my first meal in the cafeteria, it was not bad, but at the same time it was not that great either. It was more like a average meal that I could tolerate really. Then as weeks began to go by the food level went down. Sometimes things were not prepared well. Maybe it was just that I missed my mothers cooking, but I was not really satisfied with most of the food. I had soon stop going to the cafeteria and just ordered out. I would normally head to tropical smoothie or just use up my gourmet dollars at Chic- Fila"
College Freshman,2,The school does not help with off campus housing what so ever. The closest off campus housing is the harbors apartments its right across the street but its not safe the only time the campus police are over there is to shut down a party anything of any other matter they will tell you is not in their jurisdiction
College Freshman,2,There are a handful of restaurants within basic walking distance of campus. They don't stay open late and the food is anything of healthier or better option to the cafe.
College Freshman,2,This is not party school so do not expect that from Hampton! The HUPD shutdown every party in the harbors within a good hour or so and the on campus parties that school sponsors is always a hit or miss. A lot of students hang out at Old Dominion University in Norfolk or off campus parties in general and of course that requires a car; which most students can't have until junior year.
College Freshman,2,The administration is poor. The rules have gotten very strict in the last couple of years. You will be kicked out for almost any breaking of the rules.
College Freshman,2,"Many incoming freshman will receive scholarship, however the financial aid department works hard to avoid working hard to help you."
College Sophomore,2,"Two words: Whipple Barn. If you are going to use any kind of financial aid (including scholarships), this will become your new home. Prepare to wait in line for hours, and fly all over campus to get your ""paperwork"" fixed.  The process can feel longer than a box braids appointment."
College Sophomore,2,"The buildings are all very old. As an incoming freshman, go for Twitchell Hall or VC if you're a lady, and James Hall or Pierce if you are a fella. Just trust me on this. The buildings are all very old, so be prepared to purchase Raid. You will encounter an unwanted guest. You will also want to invest in risers and a nice mattress pad for your bed, it will help you sleep like royalty. Also, be sure use double the detergent in those pesky ""high- efficiency"" dorm washing machines."
College Freshman,2,The health center is just for show.
College Freshman,2,The only time food is goo in the cafe is on the weekends for brunch.
College Sophomore,2,financial aid does it come in till later in the month so that means I still don't have enough money for college which I have to wait for financial aid to come in.
College Freshman,2,The cafeteria food is bearable in the beginning but it eventually gets bland quickly. They need to revamp the menu
College Junior,2,Some professors/chairs/admin in my department are really slow.
College Junior,2,The campus is very old and there has been little initiative to refurbish any classrooms at all. It's one aspect of the campus that really ticks off a lot of the students here since they pay so much money.
College Junior,2,"Computer Science: average workload, people cheat all the time, barely anybody knows how to really program, teachers can be ridiculously incompetent and non tech savvy which is just sad, computers are not modern and the fews iMacs available are old, internship opportunities are given to you though."
College Junior,2,"I wouldn't recommend anyone to come to this school for several reasons unless they are a) in-state, b) getting a full ride or close to a full ride, and c) just trying to get a degree and move on. a through c should apply to you if you actually want to attend this school. Honestly. Please do yourself a favor and choose another school if a through c do not apply to you.

The reasons include but are not limited to: terrible facilities, lack of resources and amenities for any department, lacking dorm experience, lenient disobedience of the honor code, lack of modern technologies in most departments (not all, most), lack of off-campus food options, the caf's degrading food choices, and finally but most importantly, the lack of initiative the administration has when it comes to taking care of their students. 

Many at Hampton, unfortunately, would not hesitate to disagree with me on those areas, because they ring true across the campus and many students regret the decision of coming here. Please, if you have the opportunity, do yourself a favor and attend a college where you will at least get your money's worth."
College Junior,2,Hampton gets boring very fast - it's a small town. VA Beach and Norfolk are usually where more interesting events happen. Williamsburg and other cities further away have amusement parks but that's pretty much it.
College Junior,2,The dorms are the joke of the campus. There are always some issues that prevent the on-campus living experience from being very ideal and good environment for a student to be productive. So people don't generally like to be in their dorm unless they're off-campus.
College Freshman,2,better to stay on campus
College Sophomore,2,"Following the rules is very important, especially when attending a private university because the rules are going to be very strict. There a ways to get around the unnecessary ones, but it would be smart not to abuse that being said, because you just may ruin things entirely for everyone. Having bigs is the best way to get over the strictness; their experienced and more than willing to give you the insight on how to have harmless fun of a college experience with ought it being the slightest bit harmful to you or any other student."
College Sophomore,2,"There's only a few places to eat that are off campus, and by off campus I mean literally right across the stree from the university library.  On the bright side, you don't have to walk far for food if you need it.  On the downside, your pockets might be feeling empty after you get your food, from the same very small handful of places you've been eating from all year long.  Oh, and if you were hoping for a late night snack, your options are narrowed down to overly priced chicken wings or a much longer walk downtown to the local 7-11."
College Sophomore,2,"Being a college student in Hampton can be a real bummer without transportation because all the fun is away from campus.  The school is located in downtown Hampton, and downtown doesn't really have anything for recreation or shopping or entertainment.  The school is like an island civilization you can only escape by taxi or car."
College Sophomore,2,"Student involvement at Hampton University is weak, people rarely attend the sporting events and when they do little to no school spirit is shown and that is disappointing because are sports teams need our support."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus housing is pretty bad at least for Freshmen students, the buildings are historic which is fine, but inside living conditions aren't the best. Rooms are small and students must use public bathroom and shower which are never fully clean and that is because of lack of janitor work."
College Junior,2,Everything is just so expensive. There are apartments right across the street from campus but they are very expensive unless you have a roommate.
College Junior,2,Not really sure how to rate but pretty much everyone drinks or smokes. There is peer pressure but it is easy to stay above it if you want to.
College Junior,2,Hampton isn't a college town or a city so it sort of just...is. There is a mall about 15 minutes away that everyone goes to but besides that you have to leave town to find something.
College Junior,2,You definitely need to bring a computer/laptop unless you want to go to the library everyday which is the farthest building from everything on campus. The network is very hard to stay connected to which gets in the way when you are taking an online test.
College Sophomore,2,You need a car. But aren't allowed to have one on campus until junior year.
College Sophomore,2,"When it's pretty, its gorgeous. But many days are misty and over cast and rainy."
College Sophomore,2,"Since any ""city life"" is about 30 minutes away in Norfolk or Newport News, most people drink or smoke to have fun. People ""turn- up"" almost every day of the week. If you fall in with the wrong crowd, it can be devastating for your academic career."
College Sophomore,2,"The level of strictness at HU is seemingly institutional, but the tenets they are trying to instill through the strict policies are invaluable."
College Freshman,2,"Campus strictness, in the long run, are beneficial to the students but it does not appear that way. Policies are very strict and begin to take the freedom and enjoyment out of being college students. Simple dorm visitations are limited, especially for freshmen."
College Freshman,2,One day it's 30 the next day is 70
College Freshman,2,They are in need of renovations.
College Junior,2,the buildings on campus are out dated and very hot or cold.  never in the middle
Niche User,1,I did not take online classes so I can not speak on the online learning experience. Overall I will say Hampton University was not worth the money I spent and the Architecture Curriculum was not up to par at all!
Graduate Student,1,"Programs did not make any real effort to adapt to online learning with the COVID-19 outbreak. The program I was in was originally completely on the main campus, but with the social distancing orders in place it was moved to online and it really showed that the professors had no idea what they were doing with Blackboard."
Graduate Student,1,"This is a school that should be your ""I can learn this myself but need a college seal of approval"" choice. If I were to compare paying for this school to anything it would be like paying $300,000 for a house only to arrive and find out you bought a tent. The offices are slow, some of the staff is helpful but most are not, and you will get the general feeling that they feel they have done your job as long as they've gotten a semester or two of tuition out of you. I even had peers who were told to ""Take a walk and pray about it"" when they reached a point of considering withdrawal and reached out to faculty for advisement. Advisors and department chairs should have more practical advice than telling students to leave it to God. If you can stick it out you will get an official degree though, so if it's your last chance to get into a program go for it."
Freshman,1,Seriously this school is a joke. They pretend to be this elite black Ivy League institution and it’s far from that. The dean is a con artist and makes everything about himself.... even church! Parents don’t send your students here. Save your money. My education is 100% free and I don’t even want the money to go to this school. The professors are subpar and the staff is rude and unhelpful 95% of the time. I will be transferring next semester and take my VA benefits to an institution worthy of them.
Niche User,1,It was terrible there and I attended in 2018 as a freshmen just don’t waste you’re money here it isn’t worth it trust me
Freshman,1,"The communication amongst the faculty is awful. Their famous for the “Hampton runaround” and it seems to be something their proud of. For a school that puts on this superior facade for the world they are extremely unorganized, staff lack knowledge about the departments that they work in, the staff are unprofessional and they’ll squeeze money out of you any way they can. This school is FAR from superior and if this is rated the 2nd best HBCU is hate to see what the others are like. It’s overpriced for the poor quality their giving off to students. It’s not in a very big city (nor are the cities around it) so getting big time job opportunities or wanting a fun and alive environment isn’t possible."
Junior,1,Terrible. I had mold in every dorm I lived in. The administration pockets money. Tamper with federal aid and don't care about students well being. Professors are hard to understand because they don't speak proper English. There are not enough professor's in each department to carry out curriculum.
Sophomore,1,"The amount charged by this school for education is ridiculous.  The majority of professors have multiple jobs and instructing at Hampton University is not a priority.  One of my daughter's professors (PreCalc) actually stated that he was not paid to teach but to lecture.  Teaching is what they should have gotten in high school; plus he really didn't care that they did not understand his instruction because he would be paid anyway.  Prior to that class, my daughter took a final exam in a different PreCalc class and the instructor never graded it.  He put a zero in the grade book and quit his job.  Besides all this, there are no scholarships available, mold is everywhere and there is no help when a student moves out of a room because of it."
Alum,1,Hampton University was an experience I wish on no one. Most professors at the school will pre judge you and base your grade off of where you’re from and not always the work you put in. While they let the below average basketball/football team skate. Most employers don’t even know where the school is and it puts you at a disadvantage out in the real world. The dorms are old and dilapidated. Moving off campus is your best bet. Way too many rules as a freshman doesn’t help shape you and just hinders the college experience. The parties are average at best with the redundant 12-2 and Holland parties. The campus food will make you wonder why you attend the school unless Christmas or Thanksgiving is coming up. Definitely wish I attend another school even though I transferred in.
Freshman,1,We went to Hampton with High hopes and transferred after a year.  faculty was okay.  Overall moral is bad at Hampton.  Please do not send your kids there.
Niche User,1,"[Part 2/2]

Also the counseling program is not very good. I suffer from depression and anxiety. Normally schools will help you work around your schedule to manage these things but this one did not at all and I had to suffer for it.  It is very inconvenient how they cannot do back to back appointments so I have to wait at least a few weeks to a month before I can see the counselor again and that is too long a wait. They need to acknowledge mental illness better than this. I could have been helped better but this was just terrible. The lady was nice but she could have done better than what she did.

Overall I just think this was not a good choice of a university to attend. I don't recommend it at all. As much money as you spend to come here, it's best if you save it. Save your time."
Sophomore,1,"[Part 1/2]

The review was a bit too long so I had to break it into two parts.

This wasn't a very good experience. Every time my mother comes down to visit the campus, she ALWAYS has an issue with the financial aid office. This has been going on ever since 2015. The staff is so unorganized and 'claim' that they were not aware of what my mother has done.

The food is terrible beyond words I cannot comprehend. As nice as the caf is, at least they could have some decent food so I do not have to spend my money every single time. Plus I would have loved to have more options on campus than just Chick Fil A, Tropical Smoothie, Wing Zone, etc. It gets tiring having the same things over and over again, especially when theytt're overpriced."
College Junior,1,Make sure you do a lot of  research on finding a good dorm. There are some nice dorms and there are bad ones. Some dorm rooms can be very small and there are few that are big.
College Sophomore,1,I hate on campus housing! It is horrible. The dorms are small and dirty. Housekeeping does not do their job properly. Also the dorms are way to strict. Visitation is a luxury that is quickly taken away.
College Freshman,1,"My time here has been awful. The administration is unorganized, and there is a great lack of communication. The folks in Wigwam are bullies and have no people skills. They discriminate against people with mental illness. I was barred from admission for five whole days because they THOUGHT that I MIGHT have Depression. Later, well into the school year, they threatened to suspend me because I hadn't been diagnosed with an illness I DIDN'T HAVE. 

If you have any sort of health concern, don't think about going to the Health Center. You'll be sitting in the waiting room for an hour even though you made an appointment. Then, once you're FINALLY taken in, the doctors there will forget to make you an appointment with a specialist, no matter how many times you remind them. 

The teachers barely know how to teach. Because of this, classes are either way too easy because you don't do anything, or way too hard because you're tested on things you haven't learned.

Students are expected to go to class dressed up from head to toe EVERY DAY or you'll be judged by other students. Except in winter, when no one really cares because we're too busy freezing. 

The school is very pretentious, and I don't know why. Hampton has nothing to be pretentious for."
College Junior,1,"In order to get the help you need, you must know the right people,"
College Sophomore,1,"They do not help too much with scholarships, I thought this was normal until I talked to people at other schools."
College Sophomore,1,Ive heard from other people that it takes them forever to get financial aid.
College Freshman,1,"The actually caf building is beautiful, but the food is trash.  Breakfast is sub par, and that's the best meal of the day.  The caf is good maybe 4 times out of the year, and 3 of those times is only because they expect prospective students to come and eat.  Besides that, I honestly would come up with excuses to not go eat there.  Constantly I would use the excuse ""oh, it's raining today, no caf for me"" and end up ordering food. Apparently this year was worse than last year, so maybe it will get better after all of the student complaints."
College Student,1,"It's just nasty. The only time it is subpar is when we have visitors on campus such as high schoolers, parents, etc."
College Freshman,1,The university just recently built a very expensive cafeteria but the food served in it is terrible. The workers and staff are rude and we can't take our food to go we have to sit down. The dishes are usually dirty especially the silver ware. The food is most definitely not the thousands you spend on it every year
College Freshman,1,I have stayed on campus for two years and the housing is terrible. There are community bathrooms in every dorm except 2 dorms on campus. In the community bathrooms the janitors never clean it well they usually just rinse down the showers add soap to the dispenser and paper towels and sometimes they don't even do that. In my last dorm the janitors would go weeks before they decided my floor needed soap! Its absolutely disgusting in most dorms and very few lucky ones get into the small nice dorms. I also know that the facilities need much work. Most dorms are very old with old everything.
College Freshman,1,"Not a lot of off campus locations are nearby, and those that are often are expensive. Hampton offers no help in off campus housing."
College Freshman,1,Not a lot is available in walkable distance.
College Freshman,1,Nothing really worth visiting on campus or near campus.
College Freshman,1,Nice cafeteria building but terrible food. Always the same menus as well.
College Freshman,1,"Ancient facilities, no off campus transportation, strict rules (especially for freshman), and little to do in area nearby."
College Sophomore,1,"Out by Five is still, and will always be, very much alive."
College Freshman,1,did not have enough aid to cover the tuition even with loans
Recent Alumnus,1,"There were times that I cried because I felt so helpless with the financial aid office. They are not very helpful when its the beginning of a semester.  I was told that my FASFA maxed out when I had a year left ( I left and came back to the school).  I asked for assistance on how this happened, why wasn't there a warning or disclaimer that this was going to happen, and what to do now so that I could finish school.  The woman literally just said for me to figure it out and there was nothing that she could do, then she yelled next dismissing me.  I'm from California, so I have no family or friends out here to help me, I had to find a job and a place because I was living in the dorms at the time. This is just one story."
Recent Alumnus,1,"When I lived in the dorms they were very cramped and hot. During the summer the heater was on and during the winter the air conditioner was on.  There two new dorms that are for honor students but everyone else are stuck in the other ones. Most of the time the buildings elevators stop working after the parents leave from the beginning of school.  The elevators are for the taller dorms, meaning that there are at least 15 floors, so you'll have to walk up and down the stairs.  The paint is peeling and the floors are uneven."
College Junior,1,The administration never fails to amaze me. There are more in charge of 'administration' than there are professors. It might be okay if they actually helped the students and prevented the Hampton run around from happening to students all the time but that fails to happen. Students also cheat excessively on every assignment - at least in my experience - because they just don't feel like dedicating any time to work. Teachers/admin seem to care more about superficial things than if the student is happy or not.
College Junior,1,"There are a few places that you can choose over and over again that are actually physically nearby on campus, e.g. Subway, Tropical Smoothie, Wild Wings, Chinese place, etc. Very limited options here."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't much of anything to choose from, and these restaurant owners are aware of that. They jack up the prices so that you are forced to spend your money, because there is no alternative. The school cafeteria closes at 6 on the weekends and 8 during the week! We're all hungry within an hour of those closing times!"
College Sophomore,1,"Although I was eligible for Hampton's $10,000 Academic Scholarship, it was a hassle getting it finalized with the Financial Aids Office, and any other money that you have received, i.e. grants, loans, ect., you will be spending a lot of time getting the office to approve it and make sure it is followed on your record. I advise students to make appointments to actually sit with an advisor of financial aid, WITH parents if a dependent student, over phone calls and emails to the office. The advisors handle the situations so much more delicately yet swiftly when parents are involved."
College Sophomore,1,Housing would be much better if the buildings weren't so old and run down and if the cleaning staff didn't half-ass do their jobs. I insert and some buildings are of historical importance but you can renovate buildings without them losing that history. For the quality of the buildings Students shouldn't pay as much as they do.
College Sophomore,1,"The campus is too strict! Structure is good to a certain extent,but at this level they end up treating everyone like children while asking you to act like an adult. I didn't go away to school to be treated the same way my parents treat me, I went away to have some independence and make my own choices. Not possible at hampton ."
College Junior,1,There is no nightlife. Hampton is the opposite of a college town so you have to make your own fun or hopefully make friends that live off campus or have cars.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no nightlife in Hampton. Any scenes are bar scenes and,  as I don't drink, basically non- existent."
College Senior,1,Computers in engineering building are outdated yet the journalism and business schools have new computers
College Student,1,"To me it is the worst! close to unbearable. Personally, I do not like living with so many other people. It can be fun but at the end of the day the bad outweighs the good. Staff is decent and the cost is over the top. Basically other individuals are inconsiderate and that is something else that you have to deal with."
College Freshman,1,The school does not have any shuttle supported for the students and taxis are very difficult to catch. They are also expensive for college students.
College Sophomore,1,The shuttles are practically nonexistent. Transportation is bad.
College Senior,1,My financial aid experience here was very difficult. Starting with the problems I had trying to contact financial aid in the summer. I had to move down to Hampton a month early so that i could physically go to the school and speak with financial aid. The worst part about that was before I moved I had to hope that I was going to be granted assistance or else my move would have been worthless. Fortunately I was granted a couple loans and waiting on requested grants still for the 2103 fall semester.
College Senior,1,"The financial aid people act like they could care less if you get financial aid, they are very rude to the students. "
College Freshman,1,"It's actually really difficult, and although I am eligible for awards, I still haven't received any yet. I received an email recently saying that my application is still incomplete even though it was accepted a couple weeks ago. "
College Freshman,1,"I don't experience much diversity at Hampton... Of course, there are different ethnicities with people of African and Caribbean backgrounds, but overall... everybody you interact with is still black. Economically, people come from tons of different backgrounds. It's stereotyped that ""kids who go to Hampton are rich""... they're not. Most of the campus tends to have a liberal view on many political issues. Around here, everybody is Christian and goes to some type of Baptist church. It's slightly overwhelming that there is no religious diversity in this area. It's kind of a taboo to be open about your sexual orientation, especially since it is a slightly more conservative school... It's frustrating for my friends who are not straight to be dishonest with most people about their orientation because it's sometimes frowned upon."
College Freshman,1,"You literally need to call a taxi for everything... Unless there's an election, or extremely poor weather conditions, then they'll provide a campus shuttle. "
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, there isn't much to do off campus unless you have a car. And you aren't allowed to have a car until your junior year... There are some events in the beginning of the year celebrating settlers and Jamestown and whatnot, but other than that, just off campus parties. Safety is pretty okay, there's not much danger because there's no one around. There's especially nothing to do if you're under 21. The only thing to do around here is go to the Peninsula Town Center to go to the movies, shopping, and hang out. Other than that, you really have to make your own fun."
College Freshman,1,"I live in the apartment complex right across the street from the school and the pricing is a little ridiculous for the conditions of everything. But because  of the convenience, student tolerate the prices. The management doesn't always get back to you in a timely fashion, so depending on what the issue is, there are certain things that you just have to deal with until they get there. Parking is a hassle sometimes for visitors; if you don't have a pass, your car may or may not get towed... there's really no telling when they will enforce it. I have never found an issue with safety, but it's common sense to not walk by yourself late at night, etc. "
College Junior,1,Hampton University is extremely strict. Freshman have a curfew when they first arrive to school for about two months. Sometimes the rules are a bit over the top. It is hard to enjoy yourself at times because you can get kicked out over anything little thing
College Junior,1,"There is not a lot of school spirit at my school. Granted, our athletic teams are not the greatest, but it does not help that the stadium is basically empty at home games. The athletes may play harder if they had fans cheering them on"
College Senior,1,"Hampton has parking that's the only reason I didn't grade a F. Hampton is a smaller campus so parking is already limited but to top it off the parking lot where the majority of students park is nowhere near class buildings and students often have to arrive early to secure a parking spot. Those students who live on campus have very limited parking and they're are so many zone you can't park in, parking tickets are very common and unfairly given out. Parking permits are $60 for the year which isn't to bad that's how much some HS parking is. Oh you can't have a car your 1st year(freshmen on campus) at Hampton unless you have a proof of a job."
College Senior,1,Hampton does not provide any on campus or off campus transportation. I believe it is completely feasible and is a high need since Hampton does not allow cars on campus your first year and the dorms and classes are on polar opposites ends of the campus. You have to walk everywhere or catch the Hampton Peninsula bu which only runs Friday and Saturday and its schedule is inconsistent. You can always catch a cab but who wants to do that every time you need to go to the grocery store. Most people try to car pool with someone who has a car and split the gas; that's the most cost effective way.
College Sophomore,1,"You have to get a parking sticker, which is very unreasonably priced (hence the reason I don't have one). If not and your car is found on campus they have parking attendants that will put a ""boot"" on your car with the quickness. If you should choose to not park on campus there are a few places, like the visitors lot in front of the library, but you have to get there early since there is no penalty for parking there. Additionally, don't even think about parking in the Harbors apartments and walking to class. The have tow trucks that patrol the apartments looking for cards with out a validation sticker and THEY WILL TOW YOU. Be warned, parking is terrible. The way to do it is to find someone who lives in the harbors who doesn't have a car, and pay them to use their decal."
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't have a car, or money for a cab, goodluck!"
College Senior,1,"On campus parking decals are less expensive than at many larger schools, but there is a rat race every day to get a convenient spot.  There is no garage, and many spots inside of the gates are reserved for faculty/staff (except during the hours of 5PM-6AM and on weekends.)  There is another on-campus lot outside of the gates (near the cafeteria), but the last few rows are reserved for faculty/staff as well. You can not legally get on campus decals until your junior year, so many younger on-campus students resort to parking near the Harbors apartments, or across the bridge in a downtown garage."
College Senior,1,"Driving in general is only for upperclassman and locals. It is a challenge. You want to get to the campus as early as possible to get a good spot and don't have to hike from ""Africa""."
College Sophomore,1,"There are not very many different races at HU. There are people of obviously different nationalities other than African-American, but there are not enough to my knowledge, that would classify the school as being extremely diverse. The real diversity comes when the different personalities and backgrounds of each student are discovered."
College Sophomore,1,Dorms need to be renovated. Visitation rules are horrible.

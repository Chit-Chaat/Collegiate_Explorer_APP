Freshman,5,Jacksonville state is a great university to pursue your degree they have multiple majors to choose from and there is always people to help you at all times the only thing i would want to change is even with covid-19 if you have actual family on campus you should be able to go to their dorm.
Freshman,5,The online experience is question its really because the wifi isn't the greatest but other than that the teachers do their best to answer each question from students.
Freshman,5,DUE to COV-19 they provide best online program but also provide in person learning. So I have a choice of both.
Freshman,5,This is my 1st year in Jacksonville State University. I was offered the opportunity to few schools and Chose Jacksonville State. My 1st impression is how consistent they communicate with me. They sold me to Jacksonville State. They offered me a lot of opportunities not only academically but with financial opportunities. IT's been a week and I thank GOD my parents and I made the right decision. We prayed and GOD answered our prayer. GO JSU.
Junior,5,I LOVE TAKING CLASSES ON TIME BECAUSE IM ABLE TO TURN IN MY WORK EARLIER AND COMPLETE ASSIGNMENTS ON MY TIME. I THINK ITS BETTER TO HAVE THEM ONLINE WITH THE PANDEMIC THAT WE ARE IN. MY PROFESSORS ARE VERY HELPFUL AND PROVIDE ME ALL THE RESOURCES I NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL.
Sophomore,5,"JSU's educational program has appealed to me since campus visitations began in  high school. It has a family like atmosphere and the staff is very friendly. The professors are student oriented and care about your education. I am a member of the internationally known Marching Southerners, which has made my experience even greater at JSU."
Sophomore,5,"I'm only a sophomore at JSU, but I have loved it from the first time I visited. The professors I have had are great and the atmosphere of the college is fantastic. The options for food are great no matter what you're craving, and there is always something to do on campus whether it is just chilling, studying, or doing something more active."
Sophomore,5,I have taken many hybrid and fully online classes at JSU and all of them I have had so far have been great. The system is very easy to use and all of the teachers have been very helpful especially due to the current pandemic.
Sophomore,5,proffersors help u with anything u need and if u have any questions just ask . walk to anywhere and ask a question
Sophomore,5,amazing school i have made a lot of friends classes are challenging it’s a great campus to be on and it’s close to home
Senior,5,Jacksonville State is called “the friendliest campus” because it really is. You don’t meet a stranger. The professors are invested in their students and genuinely care about our success.
Senior,5,"My online learning experience was great. The classes were easy to follow without getting bogged down with work, but I still felt like I was learning a lot of information."
Sophomore,5,The online classes were set up student friendly. Easy access to information from the instructors. Easy access to testing and downloading student work.
Sophomore,5,"Excellent instructors who care about their students, Good access to parking and classes. Apartments close to campus.  Good programs for students to be involved in. Counselors available to help keep the students on the correct career path."
Senior,5,"The staff at Jacksonville State University really cares about its students. Whether it’s the cafeteria workers, the professors, or the admissions staff, the employees at JSU always show they care. The professors I have had this semester during the COVID pandemic went above and beyond to provide educational support for us. They made themselves available for us at any time, modified assignments, and expressed their gratitude for our flexibility. JSU has felt like a second home to me the moment I set foot on campus in 2016, and I can’t wait to graduate in December 2020 from this wonderful university."
Senior,5,My experience at JSU has been fantastic overall.  I have learned so much here.  I am graduating from the nursing program soon and feel that they truly have the best nursing school in Alabama.  The professors and nursing curriculum are top-notch.  I will always highly support and value this school and their nursing program.
Alum,5,"I had an amazing time at JSU.  The teacher to student ratio is small enough you are not just a number, but it is large enough to get professors from all over the world.  The Music Department and Drama Department are excellent."
Freshman,5,"I love JSU. I am currently in my second semester and I am truly growing here on campus. I love that it is really the friendliest campus in the south! If I had to change anything it would just be the parking, which is a common issue at any school."
Freshman,5,"Jacksonville state university is a great college for kids who don't like crowds or big classrooms. Jacksonville is a very friendly campus, pretty easy and also here to help you."
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful school! Academics are superb! I have been only going to Jacksonville for a year and I love it, they offer tons of extra curricular activities! Join a Sorority or SGA. Go Gamecocks!!"
Freshman,5,"JSU has gone above and beyond helping entering my freshman year.  From tours to financial guidance.  The two hour guided tour took me to student activity centers, the college dorms, athletic areas and guided me to my beginning steps.  It is the cutest, quaint town that is clean and has a excellent graduation percentage.  Their nursing school is one of the best in the state."
Alum,5,"JSU is an absolutely terrific school! I graduated and easily found a good job in my field. Student life is very good. There is always something going on. I made so many great friends!! We always had so much fun at ballgames and events!  Plus, very few schools are as affordable and offer as many good scholarships. Most professors are helpful and caring.  I’m really excited to see all the building and growth taking place since the storm.  The new med center is great.  The business college will be amazing too.  Love my school! Go Cocks! Fear the Beak!"
Freshman,5,"Jacksonville State University has a wonderful staff. Every professor goes above and beyond to help their students.The only bad thing about Jacksonville State University is the parking situation.There are very limited parking areas for the amount of students, faculty, and commuters. I believe that a parking deck could be extremely beneficial to the campus of Jacksonville State University. I personally would change the parking situation at Jacksonville State University."
Freshman,5,"I plan to attend this college in the upcoming fall semester of 2020, and I've participated in many of the activities that this college had to offer. I'm mainly motivated in the band aspect of college, so I've attended their Band Day and Preview Day. My sister is alumni of JSU which further sparked my motivation of going there. This school is one of the only schools in Alabama that offers Forensic Science as a major, which is also a motivation towards my love for this school. I feel that my experiences will be validated more as I ease myself into their college dynamic."
Freshman,5,I like that Jacksonville State University is small. I like that I am able to engage in class with my teachers because of the small class numbers. The campus is always clean and the faculty is always so helpful. The food is good and the REC center is definitely the best thing on campus. I would love if Jacksonville could add some more things to do in town such as a bowling alley or movie theatre.
Niche User,5,The thing I liked most about JSU is how friendly everyone is and how easy it is to bleed in and make friends. JSU has the best staff and they have been very helpful and considerate.
Freshman,5,"Jacksonville State University is an amazing school and it is very diverse. There are many resources to the school. I would just like to see the parking for the people who live on campus to expand other than to their dorms. My first class was at 7:30 in the morning and the walk from my dorm was twenty four minutes. I wouldn't be so worried about walking far at 7 in the morning, but I am a freshman female and only 4'10. It needs to be fixed."
Niche User,5,I love everything about Jacksonville State University. Their college is amazing. The campus is amazing. The professors are so kind and helpful
Niche User,5,"My Jacksonville State University experience was great. I went there for a preview day, and attended camp there. They're hospitality that was provided was very good."
Senior,5,"The classes are interesting, especially when you are able to take major-concentrated classes instead of basics, and the teachers have been nothing but wonderful. The forensics department employs many caring, intelligent teachers who have a strong desire to show students what they can experience in the field. The campus sponsors multitudes of events throughout the year, from plays to festivals, and there are many active organizations to join."
Niche User,5,I loved Jacksonville State University because the people there are so friendly and it feels like you are right at home. I have visited this campus several times and I have never felt out of place. I could see this being my future home.
Freshman,5,Jacksonville State is everything it is advertised to be! Its a fun friendly campus with a lot to do. After getting involved in the community I made tons of friends. Everyone here is great!
Freshman,5,I like the friendly campus and all the good opportunities that Jacksonville State University provides.
Freshman,5,"It truly is the friendliest campus in the south. Professors are easy to contact and care about your success as a student. The facilities are still being improved from the tornado last year but, are very accessible. There are wide variety of activities for the students to participate in on and off campus."
Niche User,5,I have yet to attend but I believe it’s a great school with great benefits to my future! I pray I can one day enroll as a student athlete at such a great university.
Senior,5,"I transferred from a community college, and the transition was easy because JSU feels like a community within the Jacksonville community. It has the look of a university, but still has the same comfort of feeling close to home. All of the faculty and staff members really represent Jacksonville State University's slogan of being the ""Friendliest Campus in the South."""
Freshman,5,JSU makes sure to make everyone feel welcomed. The college is fantastic. Every staff member makes sure to help you out. They make sure that you understand what is going on and will answer any question you will have.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy being a student at Jacksonville state university, it is really a great school,  I am so pleased that I picked this school. It is not far from my home only 140 miles up the interstate.  I have really great teachers, who care about us and really want us to learn. The dorms are spacious  which is good, because I have lots of clothes.  I swim really well, and my friends and I really love the pool. I have spent many nights in the library  studying for my tests, we have intense  study groups. Jacksonville state university is not big but it is just the right fit for me. I am so happy my mom suggested I apply.  I love her so much."
Sophomore,5,"JSU is a beautiful campus that has been struck with tragedy in the past years, but through all of that we uplift each other through kind word and helping hand. I believe JSU is a wonderful school for anyone wanting to attend a 4 year university. But we do lack parking so be prepared to walk to every class!"
Freshman,5,"I haven't actually attended Jacksonville State University. I will be attending in the fall. I do know that everyone as in students, faculty, and staff are very friendly. I have had a million of questions and they have have always helped me without hesitation. I am very excited to attend this university.  Even though I have not had a single school day there, they try to include you in everything they do on campus."
Freshman,5,I have not even had my first class and I already LOVE it. My friends are already in the nursing program. JSU has the best nursing student in this general area. They always have jobs lined up for them right after graduation.
Freshman,5,I like Jacksonville state university because it’s an all around good environment . The professors Care about the students being successful . It’s so many things to do on and around campus! I’ve made life long friends from attending Jacksonville state . I also feel safe on campus as well . The police department does there part very well . Only thing I would like to change would be the parking decals on campus and where certain people and colors can park .
Junior,5,It's such a friendly and open campus. It has an internal house for students across the world. Teachers and students alike are always willing to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,I LOVE Jacksonville State University! I have had an amazing experience ever since I came to Jacksonville State a few years ago. I have found that the staff is extremely helpful and attentive to the need of the students no matter what the subject may be. If you are lost or even appear to confused there is always someone to help you.
Niche User,5,I've only attended a campus visit.  Campus was beautiful.  Students and faculty very friendly and helpful.
Niche User,5,"I loved the campus of Jacksonville State University. The campus made me feel safe, comfortable, and the environment was very peaceful. The restaurants in the campus area are also amazing."
Sophomore,5,My overall experience at JSU has been phenomenal! The people the professors the college life and and atmosphere is all amazing!
Freshman,5,Best school I’ve ever been to. The teachers are really nice and it’s such an amazing experience overall. (:
Sophomore,5,I love Jacksonville State University because of the excellent Nursing Program that is available for students pursuing a profession in healthcare. JSU is also known for their education and business school.
Niche User,5,JSU is a state college with community college prices. This is the college to go to if you want to go to a large college and still have a sense of community and family.
Niche User,5,When touring Jacksonville they made me feel like family and was very welcoming to the campus. They have a multitude of clubs for every on campus. So anyone unique can fit in very well there.
Niche User,5,"Jacksonville State is personable and everyone is so friendly. I have had my admissions counselor reach out multiple times to make sure I feel comfortable with asking questions and finding out all my needed information. The spirit in Jacksonville for the school is undeniably shown and you can't help but feel at home, even if just visiting."
Freshman,5,"It has such an amazing community. Their saying of ""You Just Know"" is so true with this nice, southern college."
Junior,5,"Jacksonville State University (JSU) has a wide range of hospitality among the campus staff. The overall peers are friendly, kind and willing to facilitate your learning. The campus has several organizations including student led that help you feel at home. I enjoy going to Jacksonville State University."
Senior,5,My freshmen year at Jacksonville State University was in 2012. My classes were smooth sailing. The professors were amazing! I’m currently a senior about to graduate from there now! It has changed tremendously but it is still an amazing school. They have added a new rec center. I love JSU!
Sophomore,5,"By living on campus I have been able to be involved in many groups that helped me meet people. Jacksonville State Unversity is a great school. You can be involved in many different groups including Matching Southerners, fraternities, sororities, Intermural sports, and different sports such as baseball,  soccer, football, and basketball. We also have an International house that has students from the different parts of the world"
Freshman,5,Everyone has been very open and welcoming with both parents and students. Fellow students are very engaging with each other and helpful to their fellow classmates.
Senior,5,"I am in the nursing program, and I have had great professors at JSU who truly want their students to succeed! They work extremely hard to teach us how to be competent nurses by giving us clinical experiences, simulation lab experiences, and much more. The food at Jack Hopper Dining Hall is amazing, and the price of a meal plan is reasonable."
Graduate Student,5,The application process was easy to follow. The professors are engaged and willing to assist in any way they are able. The courses are interesting and provide solid foundations in the field of study that you are pursuing.
Sophomore,5,"I have been at Jacksonville State University for a year now and have thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The staff and teachers truly care about their students and future students. They have been nothing but helpful. Last semester I was activated with the military at a last minute notification and was deployed to the middle east two weeks before finals. They took care of me by allowing me to finish the class early and when I came back this semester they helped me to get registered for classes to begin classes on time. As a transgender man, I have only been shown acceptance and compassion by this college. I do not have any suggestions that this college needs to change."
Freshman,4,I really like how small it is! And it's diverse; you meet new people every day! I really like the teachers too.
Freshman,4,"I really thought with all this COVID-19 stuff, online class was going to to be hard! But in reality, the teachers are very understanding an make it clear when we do/do not have class. The internet speed could use work, but otherwise it's not that bad!"
Junior,4,I LIKE THAT I AM CLOSER TO HOME AND STAYING IN THE SAME DORM WITH MY BESTFRIEND. I ENJOY THE FOOD AND ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PROVIDED AT THIS SCHOOL.
Sophomore,4,The online learning at JSU excels in most aspects. The professors give you ample time to complete course work and they don't make it very difficult. The course work is easily accessible.
Freshman,4,The materials provided using the various virtual portals allowed for ease of access and posting work was issue free. Teachers were willing to work with students and save the students from heart ache and having to retake courses. Just don't let the internet distract you.
Junior,4,"I am a graphic design major so I spend most of my time in the art buildings. I really love the art professors, they are all very encouraging and care about their students. One thing I would like to see is our facilities updated."
Sophomore,4,I like the friendly people that live on campus. The teachers are also very nice and willing to help with any assignments.
Graduate Student,4,It was a great campus always something to do and great people. I met a lot life long friends there. I really enjoyed the student activities they had to bring everybody together in a good environment. I felt very safe there as well day and night. They also made transportation to the local stores for the ones without a car.
Freshman,4,"I love the people and professors at JSU. They make you feel welcome and help whenever you need it. I wish I could change the living arrangements at JSU. They are nice, but are expensive."
Sophomore,4,"The school really cares about its, students. Even when we had the tornado of 2018 they made sure we were taken care of. The professors care about your education and the financial and admissions officers are super helpful."
Freshman,4,"Love the people at JSU! Truly the friendliest campus in the south, JSU is my home away from home! The campus is still recovering from the tornado but it is continuing to rebuild and get better. The smaller class sizes make it easier to get a personalized experience within the classroom."
Alum,4,Jacksonville State University is a great school. The faculty is supportive in your endeavors. They want to see you graduate. The student life is booming as well.
Junior,4,"I enjoyed the people and the community in Jacksonville. Currently, the school is still struggling with money after the tornado hit in 2018, so many departments aren't receiving good funding, and there are a lot of unfinished buildings on campus."
Freshman,4,"Jacksonville State University is known as ""friendliest campus of the South,"" and that it is. If you are just visiting there is never a moment where someone isn't greeting you. If you visit to peak your interest you will be pleased by all this school has to offer. From hundreds of student organizations to the new campus recreational building there is always something cool going on on campus. The professors are very professional and to them you are not just a number. The housing is like any typical university, but the staff is what makes it stand out.  Lastly, the food on campus is good most times but is a lot of variety to choose from. There's lots of good dining options on campus. Overall my experience as a freshman at Jacksonville State University has been great so far and I look forward to learning new things, meeting new people, and growing as an individual."
Freshman,4,Jacksonville State is a great University in a small town for anyone not looking to move to a big city. the cafeteria food is great and they offer plenty of assistance with classes and housing is more than adequate.
Alum,4,It is a small campus this is less intimidating when you come from a small town or high school. It doesn’t not have a lot to offer students in terms of extra curricular activities and the staff is less than helpful.
Freshman,4,This school is very diverse and has multiple things to offer a new student. Jacksonville State is also a very campus friendly University. If there is anything you ever need you can ask anyone. The staff is very understanding and helpful. The change would be the walking. Walking 24 minutes to my first class at 7:30 in the morning is not ideal. There are multiple things that could happen to someone having to walk so far in the morning.  The parking is not ideal either.
Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my experience at JSU. The Advisory program needs some work, but for the most part it's a great school. I plan on attending JSU graduate school as well."
Senior,4,"Although I have only spent the past year at Jacksonville State, I really enjoy the atmosphere and hospitality from students and professors. It is a large enough campus to be whoever you want to be, yet small enough to feel involved and to make lasting connections with peers."
Freshman,4,Entering JSU at age 39 has been amazing. The campus is large but still easy to walk. The teachers seem to truly care about students futures and the facilities are well maintained. The 4 star rating is due to a lack of major options. Most students must transfer after their general requirements to fulfill their education goals.
Freshman,4,"I am about to attend JSU in the fall and everyone on campus has been extremely helpful, which is exactly what I needed as a first-generation college student. JSU truly is the friendliest campus in the South!"
Sophomore,4,Jacksonville State University is a great campus that is supportive and encouraging to the student body. The professors are available and helpful in helping students understand materials. There is always something going on campus to keep students engaged. One of the things I would like to see be changed is how the dining locations on campus are closed on the weekends.
Junior,4,Jacksonville State University is a beautiful campus with strong academics and party scene while being the friendliest campus in the south. The university has a atmosphere similar to home and it’s ready to accept you with open arms. While it may lack in some areas than other universities. It has the others beat in the essentials and extracurricular.
Freshman,4,"I will start at JSU in the fall, but already have had such a great experience. I can't wait to move in and get started living the college life. People have been friendly and supportive and informative. The offices I have been in contact with have been helpful."
Niche User,4,Throughout my time in SGA we took an annual trip to Jacksonville State University. They have been nothing but warm and accepting of each and every individual that comes to visit them. I love the large and spacious campus that makes you feel as if you are a part of something more than just yourself.
Alum,4,I just completed my bachelors degree at Jacksonville State University. While I was attending I enjoyed the campus and my overall experience. Some stricter schedule organization or assistance from faculty would be beneficial to keep students on track.
Sophomore,4,The students in campus are friendly and so are the professors. Very historic buildings.  Good football team
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed my visits at Jacksonville State.  The campus was not so spread out and the staff was very nice.  I believe it is a school where I could be comfortable and receive a valuable education.  I am very excited to embark on a this new adventure in the fall of 2019.
Niche User,4,"The campus and the area surrounding Jacksonville State University is very nice, I recommend the area."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience with Jacksonville State University has been great! J.S.U. was my dream university from even all the way back in my middle school days, and it sure did not disappoint. They have handled the devastation from the tornado extremely well while still making it feel like the ""Friendliest Campus in the South""! This university truly does instill one with a sense of family and pride; and, Fall Saturdays are a sight to behold in the little town of Jacksonville - all that can be heard is the Marching Southerners and, ""Go Cocks!"""
Senior,4,"I love the people and the southern hospitality the campus shows. Our campus was hit by a tornado back in March and it was amazing to see this campus come together and rebuild the school. We are one big family here. I wish the location was better. There is not much to do here in Jacksonville. We have two bars, and some restaurants but that's about it. The teachers really care about their students."
Sophomore,4,"I’m beginning my sophomore year at JSU and despite some small comments, I love it. My biggest peeves would be the administration and how they take a long time to get back to you, and the academics could be better, but for the cost, JSU is a great school that offers credible degrees while still having a fun and active student life."
Junior,4,it's a good school that's close to home and has many things to do from sports to partying it has it all. It has a football team that's ok a tornado recently hit there so they got along early summer break.
Graduate Student,4,I've attended for my undergrad and also my graduate degree and I've found that the professors want to help you succeed as much as possible.
Sophomore,4,"Jacksonville State is such an amazing campus. From the students to the faculty, everyone is so friendly and so helpful. There is always someone doing their very best to make sure you are at your best. One thing I would like to go into action at the school is the president and other faculty taking recommendations from students on how to better the campus. May it be food or how to update the buildings, now would be the perfect time to listen to the students since we are in the rebuilding process after the tornado."
Junior,4,"People working on campus is absolutely kind and friendly. Anywhere you go, there is someone who is willing to ask how is your day going. There are also really nice professors on campus, I have not had any problems with any of them so far and all of them love their job and hat inspires good environment to the students."
Freshman,4,"This is a small campus school in a small town. My classes are around 30. I would feel lost if I was in a class of 200-300 students. The professors are always willing to help. You will meet friendly, smiling faces everyday. Differently good parties available. It has the best nursing school in the state. Cafeteria food is pretty good. Don't depend on campus police if you have a dead battery. Overall this college is great."
Sophomore,4,"JSU is a great university. The campus benefits from a ""Goldilocks"" effect in that it is large enough that students get the full college experience, yet small enough for it to maintain that small town feeling. The faculty and staff all have an immense amount of pride in their work and there are plenty of activities for even the most introverted student to be motivated to be involved with. I'm happy I made the choice to pursue my education here."
Freshman,4,"Jacksonville State University  is awesome. There are so many organizations to join for all different interest groups. It seems cheesy, but it really is the friendliest campus in the South! The classes and teachers are great. The housing, especially for freshman on campus is not the best. If you don't want to share a bedroom with a stranger, request a roommate, or try to get a housing exemption. Overall, I am very happy with my choice to attend JSU."
Alum,4,Jacksonville State is a decent school. I’m glad I attended here. A week after graduation I was offered a great position in my field. Totally worth it
Freshman,4,"Jacksonville State University in my opinion is a very good school. It has its ups and downs such as not a lot of breaks except for days like MLK day or spring break. However, this allows students to finish the semester faster then other colleges. Also, student safety is on of their main concerns."
Freshman,4,"I’m only a freshman here but so far it’s been great! The classes are easy, and there’s always something happening on campus. Sometimes it’s hard to find what’s happening but if you look at the bulletin boards you can find some neat stuff."
Graduate Student,4,The professors are amazing! They try to help you in any way possible. Tuition is high compared to other smaller universities and almost compares with Auburn so thats a downside. The people make up for it though. We stand true to our name as the friendliest campus in the south!
Niche User,4,They are a very friendly university who focuses on the success of each and every student. I enjoyed taking courses here.
Senior,4,I enjoy going to school here. My main complaints would be the internet strength in some places and the poor quality of some teachers' classes.
Junior,4,Jacksonville State University is a great starter school for small town students. There are a variety of majors and subjects that would satisfy anyone. The teachers are great and intriguing. One thing that could change is the staff in the Bursar's office as many mistakes and hold ups have been prevalent lately.
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my time at Jacksonville State. The campus is small enough to feel home-y but not too big where it's overwhelming. My teachers were all concerned with their students' success. I had an amazing experience with all my classes and I feel prepared to dive into my career field. There are many opportunities to make new friends and become involved. Unfortunately the city of Jacksonville does not offer much for college night life, but the city is very supportive of athletics and provides a lots of activities surrounding them. I am proud to have received my degree from JSU and I know it will help me with my next steps in life."
Junior,4,I like the size of the university. It is small enough where I can easily have a good one-on-one connection with instructors and big enough where I don't see the same people everyday. They have a wide variety of accredited degree programs and opportunities.
Senior,4,As an upcoming senior at Jacksonville State University I have seen a lot of changes that have been made as I have been here through the years. I enjoyed student life at my school before I joined a sorority and I still continue to love everything that they offer. As incoming students come to our school there are so many activities offered around campus so that you can get to know others and the place that you will be calling home for the next few years. I also like that they have a tutoring facility (which I have worked in) to help students that may be struggling. The only down side that seems to be improving is the food. Our cafe has not been the best in the past but they are listening to our complaints and making improvements in the menu options. We also have retail dining options that everyone loves.
Junior,4,"The Marching Southerners are spectacular, and the stadium is pretty great. This a growing University so the costs are rising very quickly. I recommend coming here after community college, or if you have a lot of AP credits."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy Jacksonville State University because it is known as the friendliest campus in the south. However, if I were to change anything, I would change that the fees are going up."
Sophomore,4,"The student life is great. You feel like you are about of something bigger than yourself. The campus is beautiful and well kept. However, the surrounding towns are run down."
Freshman,4,I really like how nice everyone is at Jacksonville. Someone will almost always be willing to help you with something. The football games are also a lot of fun. What I would like to see change is we need more food places on campus. I'd also like to have more then one recycling bin that is actually noticeable as well.
Alum,4,"I graduated from JSU in 2004. I ran cross country and Track. I had a great experience, however they graduate out too many teachers and it is very difficult to get a job."
Junior,4,"People are very nice at this university.  Most professors and staff are very helpful to the students on campus.  The only real issue can come from the administration when they seem to be unhelpful.  Also, unexpected fees and tuition increases can be a problem."
Freshman,4,This is my first year at Jacksonville State University and I love it. Everyone is friendly and easy going. I look forward to the years to come and have truly enjoyed it so far. The campus is beautiful and the teachers care about you as a student.
Sophomore,4,I like the experience I've had with Jacksonville State University thus far. The campus is truly the friendliest campus in the south. I also really like what it had to offer from the classes to the student life on campus it is great.
Niche User,4,I like Jacksonville State I feel that it is a great environment to be in and learn things for my future.
College Senior,4,The people I have known have got jobs after they graduated.
College Senior,4,I have never had a problem.
Freshman,2,"If you want to pass take certain classes, if you want to learn and pass. You are gonna have to learn to live on your knees. There are a majority of teachers who try, but there is a population that seem to intentionally make life difficult. Ruining the experience and students grades. I would recommend online classes where they are material focused."
Freshman,2,"Jacksonville State University is a friendly campus, but is not diverse at all. I wish the students were more fun and engaging. Everybody goes home on the weekends which makes the campus even more dead. The frat houses stereotype certain groups of people from being allowed to their parties. Everybody is so quiet and stay to themselves. The cafe food is not the best at the times and the dishes are not always clean."
Freshman,2,"Jacksonville State is a good school and will provide you with a basic college degree and experience. It does not exceed expectation, it barely meets expectation. About 50% of the teachers are good. The campus claims to be the ""friendliest campus in the south"", but that is a complete lie."
College Junior,2,"My freshman year in the dorm was bad. I do NOT like the community bathrooms!!!!! I would constantly get out of the shower in my towel wrap and a boy would be in the hall! Not okay!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Only one freshman girl dormitory had its on bathroom and I did not get into that one. When we came back from winter break the heat was awful for a couple of days. They had it on too hot and we couldn't control it. The dorm lady was always rude. Thankfully I had a good roommate. The dorm lady would not let other people switch if they had a bad roommate. There were fights in the halls constantly. Girls yelling to one another and being loud at all times of the night and day. Girls were smoking weed on my floor and never got in trouble for it. There was one RA who wouldn't let my sister come up to my room because she didn't have an ID. She was too young to have an ID. The RA's would befriend girls. They're suppose to be watching the doors, they had girls standing all around talking to them. They weren't paying any attention to who was coming in and out."
College Freshman,2,Needs to be more selections during off-campus hours
College Freshman,2,I do not go to any parties. I only go to a Southerners party just for support and because I am a member of the Southerners.
College Freshman,2,The only issue is the level of disrespect to the students in terms of dealing with financial aid.
College Student,2,"They have lots of rules, but don't seem to care."
College Junior,2,All chicken places around here.
College Senior,2,I didn't understand most of what the financial aid people were saying half of the time. My financial aid fact sheet saying that I have money but the financial aid office saying that I don't have any money.
College Sophomore,2,The campus housing is just old and dirty. There is hardly any space for two girls to live in one room. It's just crowded. Everything needs to be rebuilt.
College Junior,2,Thjere is a range of options
College Freshman,2,"Not much off campus housing, and the off campus housing available is very scary."
College Sophomore,2,"JSU tends to not cancel school during bad weather. This year, we had a terrible snow storm, and JSU did not cancel classes until I was already stuck on campus. I was stranded for 4 hours in a parking lot until I was able to flag someone down to help me. After this incident, JSU now cancels classes at any chance of heavy snow, which is how it should be."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not any healthy choices. Jacksonville only offers the same few places, and I get tired of them easily. There are many fast food options, but, again, it is not healthy to eat fried foods every day. There are a few local places that are good, but students grow tired of those easily, too."
College Freshman,2,"Not many bars around the town. Not much of a partier, anyway, but a bowling alley or something would be nice."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the students on campus drink, and the cases of marijuana that are on campus aren't dealt with very heavily."
College Sophomore,2,"Generally, if you don't raise hell then the UPD will leave you alone. However, the parking around here is downright awful. The UPD are absolutely nuts about issuing fine after fine after fine. The parking zones are very poorly laid out- it appears to have been an attempt to force students to use the buses, which isn't a bad thing IMO, but the parking zones are ludicrous for anyone except commuters, visitors and faculty, and even then they're unable to park anywhere on the main circle. Students and faculty are also hurt but not being able to park anywhere close to the stadium and/or other sports arenas on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Not to many restaurants that have good food.There are only fast food options. 
College Sophomore,2,It is not easy getting around outside of campus.But on campus is easy.
College Sophomore,2,Students can't stand the campus police.
College Sophomore,2,The town where the school is located doesn't want the school to become bigger and there isn't a lot of stuff to do in the town anyways so the students usually just go home on the weekends.
College Freshman,2,"I've been drinking in my dorm for months and have never gotten caught. Hide your booze in your dresser, fridge, closet, wherever. They can't look there. But, go to the frat row and drink and you'll be busted."
College Freshman,2,"Students who live on campus can't drive or park on campus except for at the dorm. Hello, Gamecock Express. Also, everyone complains about how bad we're all ticketed. One girl got a ticket, went inside to pay it, and when she came back out there was another ticket on her car."
College Freshman,2,Fast food chains and maybe like three local restaurants
College Sophomore,2,I believe JSU is like most universities in that they allow you to be an adult and make your own decisions and as long as things do not get out of control they do not enforce too many of the rules.
College Sophomore,2,"I personally do not drink. Through my first year in school, I certainly felt the pressure to try it. I felt weird at parties being the only sober one, but people quickly learned that I was not going to budge on my decision and began to see things my way and respect my opinion on under-aged drinking."
College Sophomore,2,We have had two severe tornadoes hit JSU in the past two years and a lot of things had to be renovated!!!!
College Junior,2,It is ok. Wish there were more choices and not just the same thing everywhere you turn.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no atmosphere. The town revolves around the college but that isn't particularly a good thing. There is no shopping, at all besides Walmart. There are lots of fast food places but there aren't any fun healthy experiences in or around this town."
College Sophomore,2,Practically all Greek members walk around campus drunk on Fridays (Thursday is party night). Everyone has access to alcohol and study drugs.
College Freshman,2,"I believe that the campus is very serious about parking. Since all parking areas are color coded or labeled, they expect everyone to park in their assigned places. I once saw a car that had a boot on it while I was looking for a parking space. I parked several rows away just to be on the safe side."
College Freshman,2,All athletes are required to have to c average in order to stay in the sport he/she is partcipating in. If not then they can no longer be apart of the team in which he/she is on.
College Student,2,Drugs are there.  I don't partake but I'm around to see it. Crazy ....
College Freshman,2,"The University Police do everything and anything it seems to get people in trouble. Obviously, these people do things they're not supposed to, but it's like the police go out of their way to try and make up a reason the student was doing wrong. The best thing to do is behave in the public eye, and be very smart about your activities. (drinking, parties, etc.)"
College Sophomore,2,"There are not a variety of food choices on campus; however, the food is not bad. We have a Chick-Fil-A which is my favorite, but the prices are outrageous!"
College Sophomore,2,"The scholarship, financial aid, and work study process was a complete hassle. I have not received the work study that I was promised. Overall, the process was okay, it was not smooth."
Recent Alumnus,2,"A Blind Eye Is Kept – Administration says that the use of drugs and alcohol is bad during orientation, but once orientation it is over their is nobody to keep a watchful eye on anything and the most police can do is break a party up."
Recent Alumnus,2,Who Needs Them? I fail to see their purpose other than to provide a place for underage teenagers to partake in alcohol.
College Sophomore,2,Park Where You Live – You pretty much have to park where you live because you have to park where your color is which is only next to where you live.
Niche User,1,"No zoom classes, no lectures, no teaching. All assignments were given on the website with no help. There was no help or guidance  from professors when it classroom all became online."
Niche User,1,"This place is worse than a community college. In my opinion, they don't care to educate the young adults but look at them more like how much money they can get out of them.  And the campus police are the same way. Not for safety but how much money can they get."
College Sophomore,1,I wanted to love this university but I hate it.
College Sophomore,1,"A 27 ACT score and no scholarship of any kind from JSU. JSU's financial aid office and scholarship office have some of the rudest workers, and absolutely refused to help or assist in any way. If you planning on attending JSU, better be ready to take out loans, because JSU isn't going to help you."
College Freshman,1,"On campus housing for freshman is DISGUSTING. My dorm could pass for a prison, and we lose visitation every other week. Freshman dorms are also extremely far from most of the halls that freshman classes are held, expect to walk 30 minutes to a building with NO on campus parking."
College Freshman,1,"Living on Campus is the worst! Campus is usually dead, but it is easier to get to places on campus."
College Freshman,1,"There was a rape case this year involving a student with a prominent role in Greek life. The university is still making every effort to shove the whole thing under the rug, especially those in charge of Greek life."
College Sophomore,1,"The place dies and dies HARD at night. There is _NO_ nightlife to speak of around here, and the bus line, the ""Gamecock Express"", does not run after 9pm. Luckily for me, nightlife is not an issue, as I'm not exactly the kind of guy who has a life. (!)"
College Sophomore,1,"Safety at JSU is my biggest problem with the school. We have a much too-high rate of theft, both in parking lots and in buildings. There are some remote parking lots for commuter students that are far away from all buildings except frat houses. It's terrifying walking alone to your car at night. There are frequently social groups of guys walking around with no purpose, drunkenly stumbling around and yelling belligerently. The Student Health Center, on the other hand, is great!!! It provides free health care for students, though quality may be questionable. But it's great for needing a quick doctor excuse and prescription when bugs are going around."
College Freshman,1,The students that live on campus have to walk to their classes and it rains a lot in Jacksonville.
College Freshman,1,"There's no night life. There are two bars in the town that no one goes to, and the fraternity house parties suck. (They literally suck)"
College Freshman,1,"UPD is EVERYWHERE. And at my dorm, you can't have any visitors past twelve."
College Freshman,1,"Not much going on. There are two bars in the area- Brothers (18+) and Pelhams (21+), however there is usually no more than a few people there except for when there are big events. Frats through parties at their houses on Thursdays ONLY and they are so boring! No one dances; people just mingle and leave early. On holidays, there are a few more parties that are better, but that's about it. It is NOT GOOD. Don't come here if you want to party."
College Sophomore,1,The people running the desk were extremely rude and I did not have a pleasant time talking to them.
College Sophomore,1,Jacksonville is in desperate need of a parking deck!!!
College Sophomore,1,"If you received this grade then your work was either incomplete , little to no effort was given , or it was not accurate ."
College Sophomore,1,The members of Greek life at JSU think they own the school. I pledged a fraternity and quit due to this realization. There is a terrible blind eye the university turns to Greek hazing. Students are looked down upon if they are not in a Greek organization.
College Sophomore,1,The typical guy at JSU is country boy who enjoys mudding.  The typical girl at JSU is a girly girly who only associate who her sororities member. In other words there are no diversity in JSU.
College Freshman,1,"The police and housing are extremely strict,and attendance policies are ridiculous. The police ,also, give out ridiculous parking tickets."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Off Campus housing offers all the amenities that a student can ask for, but as soon as something is broken by no fault of a student it takes eight years for them to come fix it.  Not to mention no privacy when it comes to being your own space."

Junior,5,I love the smaller campus. It provides a more intimate feel. The professors really want you to succeed and are always there to provide more help if needed.
Senior,5,"Everyone at Kettering College is so welcoming and eager for students to learn.  All of the faculty and staff were generally excited to be there and to be a part of this chapter in our lives, shaping us all into great workers.  The connections that I have been able to make at Kettering College, both with other students, as well as professors and faculty members, have been relationships I will cherish forever."
Junior,5,Kettering College is amazing. The professors are there to help you succeed and the classroom sizes are small and personable.
Freshman,5,"So far, I am having a very good experience at Kettering College. The professors here are very one-on-one with the students and will help you understand anything you have questions about. My dorm room has Air Conditioning, Heating, and a sink, which I absolutely love! There are fun student activities to do from time to time. I fell very at home at this college :)"
Junior,5,Best college experience of the 3 I have attended/taken classes at. Wonderful teachers who truly want you to succeed.
Junior,5,"Kettering offers smaller classroom sizes and it gives you that enables you to get to know your classmates. It also help with your learning experience as teachers are better able to give you individual attention. The lectures always make themselves available outside office hours. Additionally, they do everything in their power to ensure that you understand the information and succeed. Kettering is a faith-based college and the chaplain and teachers are willing to have prayer with you if you need it."
Junior,5,I have really enjoyed my time at Kettering College so far.  It has great academics offered and the instructors make sure to have the students prepared for their future in the health care field.
Sophomore,5,"Kettering College is great! It is a small school that feels like family, especially when you have been going to small schools your whole life. The teachers are very caring and intelligent and are excited about teaching."
College Junior,5,"My experience with Kettering has been a pleasant one. I've had no complications whatsoever. Teachers are very flexible, along with the offered courses."
College Junior,5,"The online courses that are offered are extremely convenient. The only difference between the online courses and a traditional class room experience is that you're not actually in a class room. You can still have chats with other classmates, and the professors respond to any questions promptly. Being a full time student, and also a full time care provider can be hectic, but online courses make it easier because you can still get the same education right from your own home."
College Junior,5,"The opportunities given after graduation are an amazing. The network that you work within is tightly knit, and everyone is extremely kind. Just being given the chance to work within the network is an extraordinary opportunity."
College Junior,5,"The courses offered at Kettering College live up to the things I heard in high school. Each class is small enough to where the each professor knows you by your name. Thanks to these smaller class sizes, the quality of learning is greatly improved. The professors are very understanding, and also passionate about what they do and they want nothing more than to see the students succeed. Knowing that each professor cares about my education just as much as I do is an indescribable feeling. With out these professors, and the small class sizes, becoming discouraged could easily happen."
College Junior,5,"Being given the opportunity to receive a degree from this college is a tremendous blessing. Kettering College works closely with Kettering Health Network, which is what majority of who runs the hospitals near me. There are so many opportunities given to become a permanent member of the network when you graduate thanks to the college's work to get you in to these hospitals during clinicals. Most students are instantly offered a job within the network upon graduating."
College Junior,5,"Being given the opportunity to study radiology is such a blessing. It's not easy, but it's rewarding. Being a student at Kettering College is an amazing opportunity for many reasons such as, having the best teachers imaginable, having the most up to date equipment, and being given the opportunity to work within Kettering Health Network during, and after the program."
College Junior,5,"Each teacher is compassionate and understanding. They make each and every class enjoyable, and make learning difficult courses fun and intriguing. How each class is taught makes me want to get up and go to those early seven AM lectures because they're just taking the information and talking at you, they talk with you and they talk you through everything. I wouldn't trade going to my school for anything."
College Sophomore,5,The workload is a lot but it's worth it in the end.
College Sophomore,5,It's a very competitive and high-strung college but you get an excellent education because of it.
College Senior,5,The time and energy the teachers put in especially in the nursing program is remarkable!
College Sophomore,5,I had no problems when applying to the school. If there was any confusion or if there were any problems I simply shot a quick email and received an immediate response. The staff really pays attention and cares for every individual student in hopes for them to achieve the best education possible. Students are motivated to learn and to help each other. Because the school is one building the classrooms are easily accessible and professors are right there to help as well.
College Sophomore,5,"Kettering College is very generous and kind to their alumni members. Kettering hosts many events for their alumni members, such as outings to a baseball game, to show their appreciation and support for their graduates. In regards to Kettering's career center, Kettering assists students with composing their resume, emails students about job openings, and provides tips on the interviewing process. Kettering is a school truly focused on the success of its student body."
Junior,4,"My experience with Kettering College has been decent. The classes are small and having the ability to have 1:1 with your professor is significant. With COVID making a majority of the courses online, it makes the learning experience a little challenging due to being at home vs. in class."
Freshman,4,It is a very good school if you like small class sizes with competitive programs. I didn’t give it 5 -stars because I felt some of the prerequisites were harder than my major classes.
Senior,4,"Kettering College is very rigorous, especially if you are in one of their accelerated programs. This may be a turn off for some, but i can say that it has really pushed me to be the best at what I want to do. If you want an accelerated program that will challenge you then go for it."
Junior,4,"I have liked that the classes are all kept pretty small, so it can be easier to get a one on one with the teachers if need it. The teachers are all passionate about what they are teaching so it makes learning it better. I think that they need to change their transfer of credits review and acceptance because there were classes that I had already taken that they made me retake so that wasted financial aid that I really didn’t have to waste."
College Senior,4,The nursing program is an excellent program at Kettering! With giving hands on experience and an understanding that most students have to work while in school full time they help work with your schedule.
College Senior,4,Such an amazing school with faculty who support you and want to see you succeed!
College Senior,4,A lot of my credits transferred from the community college I was at before!
College Senior,4,I normally am terrible at online courses. However I got the hang of it this year! Very impressed!
College Senior,4,The only thing I don't like is that we are charged $400 every semester for a Nursing fee.
College Senior,4,I am able to apply the subjects I'm learning about to real life scenarios and to my job!
College Senior,4,"Kettering College offers great academics, tutoring sessions that are free, and a writing center to help with papers. The teachers and even financial aid and admissions office are hands on with students. I love this college. It's great to be a part of Kettering!"
College Junior,4,"A lot of students here are very friendly. I felt very welcomed when I first came to KC. The typical student is religious and very driven to succeed. Kettering's Courses are not a joke, they are very difficult to complete so the students that make it into their program are not here to play around they are serious about getting their degree and a job."
College Junior,4,"KC isn't too big on sports, we don't have any sports teams. The college does try to make up for that with a gym and fitness center, weekly yoga, a 5K that is offered in the spring, and much more. 

The student center is a nice place to study or do homework in between classes if you can handle noise at the same time because it is usually pretty packed since most students are commuters. 

We have a 2 story library full of books and computers. I haven't had to use it much but it seems like it would definitely be useful to many students.

My favorite thing about my school is the campus activities. We have student appreciation week, how great is that? Last year we had free massages, cartoon drawings, and lots of food! We have had Papa John's Pizza, Panera, Dunkin Donuts, Orange Leaf, etc. They love to feed their students! At the beginning of the year we also go to a free Reds game, bowling, and much more! In the winter they take us snow tubing and to the aquarium. They never charge us and transportation is always an option."
College Junior,4,"I have not had to transfer credits out of KC but I have had to transfer credits into KC and they were accepted. But, I do know a lot of people had their credits denied especially the science classes because KC has more difficult courses. So although it may be frustrating that a credit went to waste, it is for good reason. 

I live on campus so my schedule doesn't have to be too flexible but I know others have made it work around their lives.

I love how at KC all of the classes are in one building and the dorms are on top of the classes. It makes it really easy to get to class and get the help I need whenever I want to basically."
College Senior,4,"I like that the nursing program is 3 years for a Bachelor's degree and that there is a lot of hands-on/ clinical hours dedicated. I do not always find the workload to be appropriate, or the curriculum to be relevant. I do not think students should have to pay to print either."
College Senior,4,Many jobs/internships are offered and available. The career programs are very useful and the degree is very up-to-date with society and requirements.
College Sophomore,4,My student body is very small but everyone either keeps to themselves or talks to their small group of friends.
College Sophomore,4,The computer network at my school is very good. The computer lab is never very crowded and it is my favorite place to go when I need to do something online.
College Sophomore,4,The instructors at my school are amazing. They do everything they can to help you in every way possible.
College Junior,4,At this school the curriculum is not too bad because the teachers are there to help you when you need it. They explain everything very well and there is also tutors that are available and the teachers are also available after classes to help.
College Junior,4,The professors want students to succeed. Professor's are available to answer student questions outside of classes. Registration process is handled according to your field of study to help you complete courses required for your major. Kettering College offers an Honors Program as well. This program allows students to learn and serve within the community and internationally.
College Junior,4,Kettering College is a medical school that incorparates a faith based curriculum. All students are welcome no matter what their faith be. There are free concerts of various Christian artists. It has been amazing learning in the various religion classes offered.
College Junior,4,The computer network is great. There is wireless access for personal computers. There are computer labs and students can print on campus.
College Junior,4,The resources on campus are great for the size of the campus. There is a gym and work out section. The library and computer lab are wonderful places to study between classes. There are concerts and other activites throughout the year for students to attend and/or participate.
College Freshman,4,"Kettering College is a generally accepting place. The college is affiliated with Seventh-day Adventism, but there are plenty of people from all walks of life and Kettering is accepting of all. Students are not quick to judge. People in general at Kettering are happy to listen, talk, and understand. There are many religious events that students may attend, but you are not looked down upon if you do not attend them. The one exception is a mandatory, short religious at the beginning of each semester for all students."
College Freshman,4,"Advisers are absolutely willing to help you work with your schedule. There are only 6 majors at Kettering College, they're all medical related, and it's not incredibly complicated to switch to another major if that's what you decide you want to do. If you're looking for flexibility inside of your major with your class schedule, your adviser will absolutely be supportive and help you wiggle your schedule around until you both find something that is acceptable and achieves what you need to get done."
College Freshman,4,The education I am receiving is well worth the money. It is expensive- but keep in mind it is a private school.
College Sophomore,4,"the class sizes are small, largest I've seen is 35, but I've been in a class of 8 total students. professors are knowledgeable and help students achieve their academic goals. tutors are also available. kettering celebrates their students on a regular basis. it's an awesome school"
College Junior,4,"The professors here are extremely helpful. The ratio of students per program via professors is good. We have a very select few who get into a program which is helpful towards the professors because we actually get the one-on-one time if needed. The class registration process is fair as long as your financial account is under a specific amount. Sometimes I feel that there are classes that are not necessarily needed, but the college makes you take them as a requirement anyways."
College Junior,4,"I have only taken one online course since I transferred to the college. The online courses are fairly easy. Some can be time consuming, but as long as you follow an agenda they are usually a breeze. I would recommend taking as many as possible especially during the winter semesters."
College Junior,4,My school incorporates Religion into their studies.
College Sophomore,4,You have free wi-fi and you have computers everywhere. The cost to print is cheaper than the library so I use that a lot if my printer is down. If there is a problem with the network they will fix it immediately.
College Sophomore,4,This school is really small and everyone knows each other. We all go to spiritual emphasis at the church and I think that is a wonderful thing to do and have.
College Sophomore,4,Above Average – My school is great because it is small.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The professors really take time to get to know the students and to help them in their studies.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Being a small school that deals only with health science, they can focus on that area and excel in helping you after graduating."
Recent Alumnus,4,Everyone Is Different – Every school and staff member are different but I had a good experience.
College Junior,4,"Wide Range of All Types of Students – There are many people who work full time and have families to support, and there are some students who are right out of high school who are just full time students and nothing else.  The people are always friendly here and there are all different types of students at the school.  Young and old, male and female, American and foreign."
College Junior,4,"Hard, but Rewarding – The human biology program here at Kettering College of Medical Arts is a very tough program.  It is a premed program and other than the school's physician assistant program, it is one of the highest degrees you can earn at the school.  The workload is high, but that was expected with this premed degree.  All my classes are relevant to the degree and its as I would have expected it."
College Sophomore,4,School Experience – My school experience has been great.  I like the smaller classes and the intensity of the programs make the students more focused on their courses.  Some of the problems are scheduling classes since it is a small school and classes are limited.
College Junior,4,"Not Quite There Yet! While I am still enrolled in school, I have not had the opportunity to use any post-grad services. I am not aware of many available, but I believe the reputation of the school places most graduates at an advantage when compared with students of other schools."
Junior,2,"The faculty are always trying to show you they're working to improve things for the campus, academics, and student life but they just talk in circles and nothing ever gets done! Don't stay in the dorms because even though they are working on renovations for them, it's not worth it. The dean who runs it is not fit for the dean job description. I lived on the same hall as the dean's house and she would let her  children run up and down the halls on their bikes and scooters while yelling during the early hours of the morning. Kettering college lacks terribly in communication. I had a hard time with some classes ended up having to be a semester behind due to a class I passed but the grade still wasn't high enough. Kettering waited until it was too late to tell me. So I was unable to retake the class before the new semester started and they didn't have an answer for me when I asked them why they waited so long to tell me."
College Junior,1,My overall experience was not great at all. Tuition is not worth it. A lot of the teachers are worthless and don't know anything. The nursing program teacher were not the best either. Save your money and go else where.
College Junior,1,"Hard Knock Transfers – Before my Program Director got involved hardly anything transferred in to Kettering, but after she looked and reviewed my case, my financial aid become better, and almost all the classes that should have transferred did, but it was quite a process. If you're trying to do it yourself, forget it, or be prepared to take more classes."
College Junior,1,"Don't Give up – The college has two different ladies who handle financial aid and I have found one to be of greater help than the other, so I always go to her for help. She's great and answers all my questions. However, the process to get into the college and recieve aid wasn't easy. They are not good at getting back to you or letting you know the status of the aid, so a lot of the legwork has to be done by yourself."

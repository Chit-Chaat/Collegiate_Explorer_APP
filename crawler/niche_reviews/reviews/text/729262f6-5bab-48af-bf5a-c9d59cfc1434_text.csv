Senior,5,They are very welcoming and make you feel at home.I have come a long way as well as learned so mux=ch about the online process
Senior,5,I have had a really good time doing my online learning. On line has made it so easy for me to do school work as well as be home to take care of myself and my family.
Sophomore,5,"Overall expereinces with Rio Hondo College has been great so far. I remembered when I was trying to register for classes. I was able to get help within that day by a counselor. Later when I was trying to register for class, it wouldn't let me and I call the administration office, they contacted the counselor and got me up to speed that day so I would be able to register for class. I have no problem getting my classes at Rio Hondo College and I very grateful for that since I had difficulty getting the classes I want at another community college."
Sophomore,5,The professors at Rio Hondo College want their students to succeed. The appropriate tools are provided for each student to thrive. All my professors have been open to questions and feedback which enriches the overall experience.
Sophomore,5,Rio Hondo is a great college with many helpful resources. I have had nothing but a positive experience while studying at this college.
Sophomore,5,"I had a unique situation and online classes was the only thing for me to take my second semester. A few months later that is when the pandemic hit. I can say that many professors go above and beyond on making sure that the learning experience online is great or good to say the least. All the classes that I have taken online were well put together and the professors did their best to help a student if there was any misunderstanding on lessons, discussions, projects and so much more."
Graduate Student,5,The staff is very diverse and helpful. They often have speakers and professionals from different fields to assist in any way they can. The professors are knowledgeable in their subjects and offer different support.
Graduate Student,5,Online classes have always been more convenient for me as i work full time. The professors are flexible and always offer support if needed.
Freshman,5,"So many of the professors and counselors have made themselves available to any questions that I have had regarding an education plan, my personal goals, and financial aid. I have yet to receive any professors that administer too many assignments that I am unable to keep up with. Though the Zooms may be hard to remain focused in, I do enjoy the time spent with my peers and professor."
Alum,5,"Overall, I had such an amazing experiencing at Rio. One thing I adored was the amiable environment at Rio from the Professors, to the counselors/ academic advisors, and for the most part all the people there. It's quite a small school which almost makes it feels like home for me, but this school will always hold a special place in my heart.  Go Roadrunners!"
Alum,5,"Wonderful college experience at Rio Hondo College! A lot of classes aligned well with the schedule I had and the Professors were wonderful. There are so many resources on campus that helped me with transferring to a university, and there are so many resources to help with your classes."
Alum,5,"Easy to follow and the Professors provided so many different materials to follow along. There is a lot of work and studying to be done, but that's expected given that you are learning from home with online courses. There are plenty of courses to choose from, and some can even work with your major, which helps clear up your schedule if needed!"
Freshman,5,I love Rio Hondo. Everyone is soo nice and supportive. Most of the professors are super understanding and will work with you if you try. The counselors try to make your dreams come true as much as they can. I wish there were more student activities such as dances.
Freshman,5,"Yes, I took classes online I loved it because they actually still did lectures. But they were actually insightful. Most online classes are very lenient."
Senior,5,"An excellent school to transfer to a 4 year college. There are wonderful teachers, plenty of resources, and great activities to do on campus. They have everything available to help you succeed."
Senior,5,"I've always taken online courses, and at Rio Hondo I find it the same as being in-class in person. My faorite course was a philosophical ethics course, where the instructor recorded himself for every lecture. Many teachers do this, as well as being available for phone sessions or office hours."
Junior,5,The professors and all staff including counselors and all other academic teams are doing their best to make the transition smooth and easy for all students! The classes are amazing online since the teachers are staying even more attentive with students while keeping Us updated on all board meetings and etc.
Junior,5,The staff is amazing!! Especially during covid-19 the whole staff especially teachers and counselors are working with to student for an easier transition that’s is smooth and swift for all students. Over all campus is always clean and students are respectful making the environment comfortable at all hours of the day! The all the professors always take time out of their day to help students understand the material no matter how many times you ask they’re willing to help. I say this from experience!!
Senior,5,"If you want you graduate within two years, Rio Hondo has all the resources to do so. The professors are easy to talk to, and their campus is clean!

Also,
There are many clubs to choose from, and most students are friendly."
Senior,5,"Online learning while experiencing The Covid-19 pandemic was hard to adapt to at first,  but Rio Hondo stepped up to the plate. They reached out to us on a weekly basis, and sometimes every other day. All their centers were virtually available to the student body, including mental health services. The library made hotspots and laptops available to students who needed them. They also planned a non-contact graduation parade for us!!"
Freshman,5,Online classes are a bit harder but you can always email the professor and they reply fast and happy to help there's also online tutoring available on any subject
Sophomore,5,"I had a great 2 years at Rio Hondo. I played for the women’s soccer team both years and those years made my experience very memorable.  Each course taken at Rio Hondo was great, the faculty was always amazing. Professors and advisors were always there to help. With the situation of covid19 occurring we have all switched to online courses. I would say they could have done a better job, administration wise, in better educating and preparing for something like this happening that all courses have to be taken on line. Some of my professors now have never even used a computer and barely know how to email so makes it 10x harder. It is the 21st century, where literally everything is now online used through an electric device, it’s time they get use to it. That is my only concern of Rio as of now, other than that it has been amazing and I am very thankful to have gone here because they have helped me with my progression of achieving my ADT."
Freshman,5,So far it has been a peaceful and subtle journey. Professors are straight forward and students are typically friendly. Quiet campus when no rallying going on.
Freshman,5,Rio hondo college is a good school with excellent professors and staff! But it would be better if they organize the parking lot!
Freshman,5,it was a new experience for me due to transitioning from highschool. Over all the atmosphere is friendly and the staff is very helpful too. The professors are very welcoming to students. The food from the cafe is very good too and the cafe is also a pretty big hang out spot.
Freshman,5,My experience at Rio Hondo college is far better than what I had expected it to be. The teachers really do care about the students' success and there are tons of resources available to students if they need help with anything on campus. There are also several clubs and organizations to get involved with which are great for transfer students looking for something to make their college application stand out.
Niche User,5,Wonderful school that allows me to practice  and further expand my academic career. Supportive teachers and captivating courses.
Sophomore,5,Going here has been a blast for me . I have issues where I can't pay attention as much but many of them help with that and their are online classes as well so that is a 10/10 for me.
Sophomore,5,"Rio Hondo College has provided me with so many reasources in order to fufil my educational needs. The professors really do care about each individual students education & want us to move foward carrer-wise. While there has been some professors who weren't the best, I can say 90% of my professors here at Rio Hondo were amazing.  With dedication, I can gladly say that I will graduate & tranfer from Rio in spring of 2020! It took me the expected two years in order to graduate & transfer even though community colleges tend to get a bad representation of having students enrolled for 3 plus years. If you are truly dedicated to your school & success here at Rio Hondo, I can promise you'll transfer easily and fast."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is a breath of fresh air! Rio Hondo College is my first college and it does not disappoint. For starters, the staff and Professors are on par with the highest degree of professionalism. Each department is dedicated to helping students achieve their potential by listening and implementing the knowledge the student lacks. Personally I like the campus because it is placed on top of a hill surrounded by nature."
Junior,5,I love Rio Hondo College I've tried other colleges but this school fell so safe and secure. beautiful campus and lots of helpful professors.
Niche User,5,I have visited campus many times as a high school student and it is a very beautiful campus with so much to offer. I have taken a course for counseling and everything was so organized and a lot better than a normal high school course.
Alum,5,"There are so many people there willing to help you find your career path. All the staff are very friendly and want to help all students succeed. They offer many different departments that help students plan out their classes, apply for financial aid, or even apply for internships."
Senior,5,Rio Hondo College is a good college to attend. The downfall of this college is that it is on the highest hill ever. It is either you walk up the big hill or you have to take a shuttle. The academics are amazing here and so are the professors. The sports at Rio Hondo is also great.
Graduate Student,5,Rio Hondo is great. I knew I was going here while I was in high school because I did not really know what I wanted to do in college. Rio allowed the flexibility to really discover who I am and what I want to do without putting me in debt. The Kinesiology department is great and the professors are really helpful.
Sophomore,5,"Rio Hondo College has great professors that are professional and dedicated towards my educational journey. Overall, my professors are extremely supportive and encouraging with my future goals to obtain my Associate degree in Nursing, Bachelor's and Master's degree in the future.

The only issue I would change with Rio Hondo is the parking situation. It is pure madness at the start of each semester. I suggest that Rio Hondo build a 8-10 level parking structure to accommodate students and visitors."
Sophomore,5,"Rio Hondo College is an overall great school. The campus is small, so it is easier to walk to classes. The professors for the most part are excellent. The counselors are helpful and assist you in creating an educational plan. There is a StarBucks located in the Rio Café. There are plenty of elevators and ramps making it accessible for wheelchair users. The student population is small and very diverse, especially in age. There are plenty of workshops and student activities throughout the semester. The parking is terrible at the beginning of every semester, except for trimesters. Since Rio Hondo is located on a hill, the cellphone reception is terrifyingly poor."
Sophomore,5,I loved how this school has a lot of resources for a student to pass a class. Rio Hondo has great professors who actually care and they are all knowledgeable.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Rio Hondo! It is so easy to get classes and professors are always so nice. The campus is gorgeous as well! It is up on a hill and has so much greenery around. I always recommend others to this college.
Freshman,5,"I do firmly believe Rio Hondo community college is an excellent start in a path for a career and it can be a life changing experience if you know where to look and where you apply yourself to. To describe all the pride and gratefulness I have towards this college is immeasurable and there truly are no words to describe it. Even though it may be my second semester in, I've learned the right path to take in sound engineering just form the classes and professors I took, all of whom I owe great thanks to and can't think of what my college career would be like without them."
Freshman,5,"Rio Hondo is a wonderful school. Their resources and their willingness to help students succeed is amazing. It is a great opportunity to get connected, receive a good and valued education, and to graduate on time."
Junior,5,"My experience this past 3 years has been excellent. The counselors and professor's that I have had have been great, they have been patient with me.
I thought it would be difficult for me since it was over 40yrs since I graduated from high school. The staff at Rio Hondo have been extremely helpful and constantly encouraging me. The different programs they have on Campus to help with books and other supplies. They have free tutoring available in most subject. I have recommended Rio Hondo to a lot of high school students trying to figure out their options."

Sophomore,5,"Rio Hondo College is a school with hundreds of diverse resources for students to take advantage of whether you are looking to transfer, want to be involved in clubs, or even if you just need someone to talk to. The professors are excellent, and encourage students to visit them at office hours for help outside of the classroom if needed. Student life is vibrant, especially because of the many active clubs around campus and numerous events the college holds. Rio Hondo College is an excellent school, especially if you plan to transfer to a 4-year university."
Freshman,5,"There is a very good programme for those intended to pursue the engineering, nursing, science fields. There are programmes to support students' learning and the professors are very supportive. The environment is very diverse and surrounded by nature."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Rio Hondo has been great! The only thing I would change is to add more afternoon and night classes, but other than that the school has been fantastic!"
Niche User,5,The thing that I found interesting about Rio Hondo College is that it a good college  but mostly it has a good program for the career that am interesting. It may be far away from home but it really does not matter at all because there are always a place to stay at. I would not change anything at all because everything looks good.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is small but it has a beautiful view of the San Gabriel Valley.  It has gone through some renovations, but they need to focus on their parking problem.  Like I said before too many students very little parking."
Junior,5,its a very  great college with great professors. It is very diverse and has a lot of different clubs for everyone to feel included. they have resources that can help different people and they work to have a safe environment for students.

Niche User,5,I am currently a high school senior but have visited classes and the campus and I agree that it is good for students financially.
Sophomore,5,Rio Hondo College is a good school in terms of friendliness and resources. It’s a very comfortable school to go to. I would say people feel safe on campus.
Sophomore,5,"If you're looking for a place to earn undergraduate units for your general education look no further. Rio Hondo offers a catered to students environment throughout the campus and classrooms. The counselors are patient, and willing to spend hours with you to help reach your goals. Rio Hondo is an excellent, inexpensive college that is great for those who are not sure where to start."
Sophomore,5,"I loved how small the campus is, and how approachable all of the professors are. Small class size, so it is very easy for the professor to put a name to a face."
Freshman,5,"Rio hondo college is a great school with great staff member who love doing there job and love helping you. Whatever you need weather it is counselling, the transfer center and many other offices they'll always help you. The professors are fun and they love helping their students whenever they need help. Rio Hondo college is a great school."
Sophomore,5,I am a returning student for their nursing program and from what I can tell their staff really puts in the effort to make sure students are prepared for licensure
Sophomore,5,"Decent community college. They have a great public safety (fire and police) training program. The campus is somewhat old, but it is still functional. New facilities would be great. The online student portal website is great, it is easy to use and I have had no problems with it."
Freshman,5,"It's good campus very friendly, just the parking can improve, its is usually often times really hard to find parking but other than that it's a well school all around."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy being a student at Rio Hondo College! The professors I've had really care about both their jobs and students and tend to be great people themselves. I also was able to make many friends easily -- which surprised me since I'm quite introverted.
Sophomore,4,"Since quarantine, all of the classes have been switched to online and the professors I've had were really quick to adjust their routines. Though I would prefer being in physical classes, I really don't have a choice in the matter. I would also bring up that the layout for the online classes are quite organized."
Niche User,4,"Overall experience is great! There are some professors that need to learn to speak to their students better, just like anywhere you go. I've received help when needed and all the staff members and workers at the school at least tries to help."
Senior,4,"With their simulated nursing skills lab to the quality nursing instruments used in the classes, Rio Hondo College goes above and beyond to meet the learning needs of their students. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, their lectures turn to online courses; however, we were able to sometimes go to the campus and use the labs to practice our nursing skills set. They provided Personal Protective Equipment for the students during those skills lab sessions, as well as hand sanitizers and they checked our temperatures. The online course for lecture ran smoothly and productive."
Senior,4,"I have taken a Certified Nurse Assistant Program (CNA) at Rio Hondo College this past spring of 2020. The professors in this program were patient, understanding and motivating to us, the students. For anyone interested in taking a CNA course, this would be the place to take it. The professors are highly knowledgeable, compassionate and truly care for the education of their students. Their teaching and training are effective and they create a great learning environment in the classrooms and online."
Sophomore,4,"This is my second year here at rio hondo and i can say that they really do their best to help every student. I would know I had trouble with a few things my first year. Come to my first spring semester, I had on going issues at home and the teachers were really helpful and understanding. On top of that, that is also when the pandemic hit. It was a relief as to knowing that the staff understands that there are other things going on in a students life and doing their best to help students try and finish the semester strong. I can completely say that Rio hondo College is the best and is always on top of things"
Freshman,4,"I have been able to access so much help from the college staff after COVID-19 forced remote learning. Many of the students are very nice and outgoing which has a positive impact on me, but it has been difficult to receive financial aid during this time making it hard on me to make future based decision because I relied on the financial aid I was to receive."
Alum,4,"Majority of the classes I took at Rio were on campus, however, the online course I took were awesome. Some were better than others as certain teachers provided their own websites enhancing the content of the course while others posted modules through Canvas making it very manageable to navigate through. Despite the small differences, taking these online courses were very convenient for my schedule, and every person should try a online course at least once!"
Sophomore,4,"Rio Hondo college uplifts every student that is attending to this campus.
Professors care deeply about your education and will do anything to help you reach that next step.
Be prepared to put in your part!"
Sophomore,4,"With everything that has been going on due to this pandemic, professors made it extra clear that they are also learning how to work online. Although it has been quick and unexpected, professors have made it happen, all fair game."
Freshman,4,My Professors were very caring during this time and understood that we are in a Pandemic. Assignments were still due in a timely manner but their grading was not as strict.
Freshman,4,The counselors are very helpful and I really love the way they have their website set up. It is very easy for student’s to plan their own two-year’s there and explore the other majors offered!
Sophomore,4,Rio Hondo is a welcoming school. The professors are apt and educated and are able to cater to student needs. There are plenty of organizations on campus that promote student involvement despite being a community college
Sophomore,4,"Rio Hondo has done fairly well with remote instruction. With COVID-19 in the foreground, the school made canvas instructure shells for all of its students. It was a rough transition for those who did not teach or enroll in online classes prior but it was a challenge that was taken head-on."
Sophomore,4,My experience was great at Rio Hondo College. I was able to interact and get to know my professors. I found an amazing community to help me throughout my journey. I feel that the school need more organizations for different majors.
Freshman,4,"This was my first year at Rio, but I liked it a lot. I chose to go hear because I could not afford not going to a community college. There are many programs here that offer academic and financial help. The professors are great and give an appropriate workload for each class. The students are very friendly and the faculty tries to help you as much as possible."
Freshman,4,Staff is great helpful counselors and professors but classes fill up fast so it hard to get the classes you want or need. The campus is clean and beautiful there's food available on campus I love to eat in between classes.
Junior,4,I've enjoyed my time at Rio Hondo. All of the resources that  they have for students are great! The counselors in the Transfer center are amazing. I have only had three professor that I did not like bu that happens at most school and you deal with them bu other than the the other faculty is amazing and would recommend rio Hondo to any student getting ready to go to college.
Sophomore,4,My overall experience with Rio Hondo College has been great. The only thing that I do not enjoy about this college is the parking. I believe that the parking is an issue because they all get full and it is difficult at find parking at peak hours. The views that Rio Hondo has are beautiful. The staff is also very kind and they are willing to help you in anything that you need. This college is also very affordable.
Freshman,4,"I like Rio, it is not as diverse in ethnicity as I thought it was going to be, but it has an amazing staff and friendly students."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Rio Hondo has been great. The campus is spread out enough that you can make it from one end of campus to the other quickly. The classrooms are a good size. Most of the professors are nice and have a good rapport with the students, the professors are very easy to approach and talk to when struggling with an assignment or when you just need to talk. The library is my favorite place on campus, there are a lot of windows with a great view. I gave my review 4 out of 5 stars because there are some negatives to this campus. One thing being the parking. At the beginning of every semester there is always parking wars, the campus is on a hill so it’s sometimes very difficult to try and find parking close to the actual campus, there are parking lots towards the bottom of the hill but then you either must walk up the hill or wait for the tram. Even with all the good and bad things this campus has to offer, I am very proud to graduate and transfer from Rio Hondo College."
Sophomore,4,I have had a good experience so far. Would like more parking on main campus. Extra support classes are  offered every semester and not to much information given to new students some times its to late when you find out.
Senior,4,"Great school! Faculty is helpful, professional, and very qualified. The school is located on a hill, so getting to classes is a little time consuming. They do offer free shuttles from the bottom of the hill. Never found it hard to get the classes I needed. Good sized classrooms. Very clean and cafeteria is brand new."
Sophomore,4,I like how the famous is small and the staff are friendly. Most professional are good at teaching. I would change is the food court because I don’t really like the food.
Freshman,4,A nice college. Has a lot of resources and helpful people. Very welcoming school and helps students succeed and become on track. Quiet campus.
Sophomore,4,I genuinely enjoyed my years here. The school is very close to my home and I love the option of the off campus locations. Going to school and working is not easy but being able to build a schedule around the two is great.
Freshman,4,Rio Hondo is a small community college but it offers many different programs. What I love about Rio Hondo is that they have an amazing support for there incoming freshman and help them out in many many different ways. The counselors are very supportive and want you to achieve and do great in life.
Sophomore,4,My experience with Rio Hondo college was great the professors are very good the only thing I would change is the building some are old if they made the school look new  it would be better i like the size of the school it's small and not too big. Another bad thing is the parking sometimes you cant find morning parking when the semester starts.
Sophomore,4,"I’m going on my 4th year at Rio Hondo and I’m graduating in May 2019. So I like to think I know quite a bit about the campus. I went through some tough times with my school work and dropped off a bit with my school work, but The people at Rio truly helped me stay on track. Visiting the counselors to help me discover what the right path is for me was all I needed. The transfer center definitely helped me with my transferring process for the fall. They offer so much for every single person who walks through their doors and I highly recommend this school!"
Freshman,4,"Everything is great! Great faculty members and nice peer students!  Very supportive community! However, some of the organization wasn’t organize that well, need some improvement."
Sophomore,4,I like the environment and the atmosphere of Rio Hondo College. The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. The professors provide a good amount of work based on the lessons they have thought. Some professors assign group projects which I'm not a fan of but I do know in the real world working with others will be essential. Some of the students are very pleasant to work with and overall the campus is kept nice and clean.
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed my first semester at Rio Hondo College. I learned a lot and my professors were all so helpful. The only downside was the location and parking.
Junior,4,What I  like from Rio is the environment that is arround this college and this makes us as students feel distressed and help us to feel better. There are many teacher that are really good people and do everything for yo to understand a subject.
Junior,4,Iv'e been at Rio for 3 years and I have had a great learning experience! There are many resources and programs that will help with student success.
Junior,4,Rio Hondo college has given me a very great experience. Very easy to get classes. I’ve been taking online classes and am currently enrolled to take on campus classes next semester. I’m excited.
Junior,4,"Rio Hondo is a fairly small college so it is very easy to find your way around, especially if you are a freshman. The staff is very sympathetic and friendly as well as the diverse students."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently a Nursing student at Rio Hondo. The Nursing Professors and nursing faculty there are excellent. They are very professional, organized, and caring for their students. What I love the most is that they treat everyone with the same interest, in other words, everybody is important. I have been a student at other colleges where I've experienced racism, and Rio Hondo is nothing like that for which I'm very grateful. The food in the cafeteria is great. It's varied, affordable, and they have Starbucks coffee. The downside of the school, at least for me, is that they don't have any programs that help Nursing students. The nursing career is a long one. By the time the student makes it to Nursing program, he/she is already out of financial aid and so it's very hard to survive without any help. I think they should have more programs that help and support the nursing students."
Junior,4,"Rio Hondo College is a wonderful if you're looking to transfer in Art and Animation. The Professors all have industry experience, and are tough with out being mean."
Freshman,4,The professors are really caring! They prepare their students for transferring to the universities and for life in general. The school offers plenty of opportunities to get involved and learn more.
Sophomore,4,"Rio Hondo College is a fine school to begin one's pursuit of higher education. I've met some of the greatest professors here for Social Science classes, and I've met some of the worst professors for other classes. Overall, with Rio Hondo and other community colleges, you get what you put into it. The classes come pretty easy, professors are willing to help the students, and there is a wide range of resources for students. It is a great stepping stone on the path to transferring to a 4-year university/college. 

(As this is a community college, there are no dorms or housing opportunities.)"
Freshman,4,The classes are relatively small and all the professors are really professional and experts in their field. The school offers a good amount of extra cirriculars that fit the diverse body of students they have.
Freshman,4,"So far going into my 2nd semester Rio Hondo College has been okay. Majority of the professor I have had really seem to care about the actual education. Some things to complain about is parking, but that is a given at any college campus and also there is not that much around the area food wise. Usually have to go but more in distance for better cuisine."
Sophomore,4,"Rio Hondo College is a two-year community college for those who want to get an associate's degree, a certificate, or plan to transfer to  a 4-year college to further their education. There are programs for first generation college students and low-income families. It is really nice that there are people at school that can help you through the process of college as well as the transfer process. One thing that needs to be improved is the parking and the road. Another thing that needs to be improved is the food. Overall, I enjoy attending Rio Hondo College."
Freshman,4,So far Rio has helped me out a lot. Everything that I have needed is at hand reach. All of my professors are really nice and help in every way they can.
Freshman,4,"Rio Hondo college is a great campus, as they've provide good programs and excellent benefits, they paid for my transportation from metro, but I would like to know more. Someone from Rio hondo that can give Moreno information, like they come to you for information."
Alum,4,"Was a very good community college for a student who is the first in family to attend college. They have a lot of resources for students, if you are low income you can apply for EOP&S they give you more resources and textbook grants."
Sophomore,4,Rio Hondo is a great college if you hope to transfer. Campus is beautiful. Professors are very kind and helpful. Students are provided with numerous amounts of help. Resources are offered to assure your success.
Sophomore,4,"As a returning student I was very nervous about coming back to school after such a long time. I knew I needed to finish my degree and start a new career. I was pleased with the adult re-entry program Rio Hondo College has. The counselors are amazing and extremely helpful. They guided me step by step in finding my balance in incorporating college back into my life. As I know approach graduation, it is also time to transfer so I can complete my BA.  Working with the transfer center has also been great. They offer quick and easy overviews of what to expect during the transfer process. There is always transfer counselors with helpful tips and feedback to guide you in the right direction.  I have been very pleased with Rio Hondo and would recommend the college to everyone."
Freshman,4,"Rio Hondo is a great college, as a freshman the staff helped a lot. They answer all my questions, and guided me through everything that I needed. The teachers are not only helpful but friendly."
Sophomore,4,"The school is  great for a community college. Professors are helpful. The campus predominantly is Hispanic. Classes need to be updated. The library is fantastic. The school is community college, so if you attend or plan to attend you will be getting a good deal."
Junior,4,"Overall great school. Around 97% of the professors I've had  are truly great, and put in a lot of effort into educating the students. It's reasonably simple to get classes. The only complaint I have is that clubs are virtually inexistent. "
College Junior,4,Though most of my courses are required I was excited to find out that the school had an American Sign Language class. That got me extremely excited for classes.
College Junior,4,A lot of the teachers are just trying to make sure that everyone is learning and understanding that is being taught.
College Junior,4,The major is great! There are many like minded students on campus that want to learn as much as possible. The proffesors are great with students and reccomend them to job opportunities. The curriculum is tough but I would rather it be hard and to learn than easy and not learn at all. Same goes for the workload.
College Junior,4,"Me experience with this school is great because the proffesors care about their students, they are well informed in their area of teaching and they make their classes intersting. The school is beautiful and has an amazing view of the city landscape. Campus is small allowing me to manage my classes with ease. If I was to choose a cc again, I would choose Rio Hondo again."

College Junior,4,"It is my first year here and I just came for summer school, the first teacher I had here was so helpful and is very passionate about the topic they are teaching."
Sophomore,2,I never took an online class so I do not know how it felt but I am experiencing now during the CoVID situation. I do not like it. I receive too many emails and it’s difficult to keep up. Maybe taking one online class per semester would be best.
College Junior,2,At the moment I'm not able to afford a lot of my books so I have a hard time being able to do things with the classes like homework at the moment.
College Junior,2,As far as post grad services i feel there really isn't any if you're not involved with the professors.
College Senior,2,"Many students dont graduate from Rio Hondo. Coaches, professors and counselors i feel do a very bad job in getting the students to graduate. The internships are kind of a waste of time here ."
College Freshman,2,"Other than the police academy, there is no networking among the students."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I got financial aid the first year that I was at Rio. The years after that I wasn't eligible because my mom made to much, because of her bonus that she gets once every year. It sucks cause all that money goes to paying bills, the house, and my moms retirement. I wish I just got a little bit of financial help, so my aunt doesn't have to help pay for my schooling."
College Junior,2,Lots of the students are stuck up and think they're too good to make new friends.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Review is for the financial aid office, the staff helping the students out are often very rude and seem annoyed by your questions.  There have been numerous times that I have left more confused than when I went in. For the most part, my financial aid has been quite smooth, I just wish there were more than 1 or 2 staff members that are willing to help you and seem like they want to be there."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are a good amount of computers with internet access available on campus, however phones and tablets often lose service throughout campus. There is an ok wireless network that students can connect to, but there have also been times where I have had calls drop."
College Senior,2,I was hoping for more involvement from the professors. Overall it was/is ok.
College Senior,2,"I am still taking my general education classes, as well as classes needed for my major. The workload can be pretty intense, depending on the subject but it is manageable. Some classes, like psychology and child development are really interesting, whereas math is simply something I need to take."
College Sophomore,2,Even though Rio Hondo offers marketing courses they are non transferrable to any cal state/ university so its difficult as i want to become a marketing major.
College Sophomore,2,"I wish the professors in the mathematics department focused on the class subject rather than ranting about life, religion, politics, etc. Students take lower level math classes to learn the things they missed or forgot and this cannot be accomplished if the teacher does not focus on the topic or explain in depth about the subject."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm a Vet Science major and I am attending Rio Hondo College to improve my math skills. So far I have had teachers who do not take enough time to explain the material and would rather discuss other topics not related to math. I would like to see math professors who stay on topic and go in depth in some of the harder material. 
I am pleased with the other courses I have taken but I would like to see the mathematics department improve."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The education I am receiving is great. Unfortunately the price that I am paying for my education it is not. My school keeps increasing the tuition year by year due to the budget cuts which it is making it extremely difficult for students to continue school. This problem has lead us to taking less courses per semester and prolonging our transfer date. Textbooks prices are ridiculous! Purchasing a textbook amounts to the same price of paying a course! Which leads us to debate to either take less courses and pay for our textbooks that are required for each class. Our financial aid is known for bad service. The staff is not helpful and hate answering questions which makes students avoid going to the financial aid office for help. The transfer center offers better quality service and they are willling to sit one on one with the students to fill-out the forms or answer any questions regarding financial aid, scholarships, or about transferring."
College Sophomore,2,Its very busy. Everyone wants to be an RN. Not enough classes. It takes years and hard work to even begin.
College Freshman,2,I am looking forward to becoming a registered nurse but the classes are impacted and I will have to be taking electives I don't need. Nothing unique.
College Junior,2,"The education im getting is well worth the money, but the finiancial aid process is a headache."
College Student,2,"they always seem short staffed for the cashier,financial aid, and admissions."
College Senior,2,i didn't really like this school because they take forever with the financial aid money. i never got anything the whole first semester i was there. The teachers also misses a lot in the classes.
College Senior,1,"Financial aid never picks up their phone. They are always busy and seem to hate dealing with students. I attempted asking for scholarship opportunities and they said to look online. Financial aid process application is pretty easy however they denied my application because I work full time and make a dollar or two above the limit. I thought that was very unfair. I can barely make my rent paymet and I saw a girl walk in to the office with brand name shoes, piece, jewelry etc etc etc and overheard the lady tell her to expect X amount of money. My jaw dropped to te floor. The system seems to be failing for some that really do need the financial assistance. "
College Junior,1,Many people seem very unmotivated at Rio Hondo. There is not a strong sense of community largely due to the fact that Rio Hondo is a commuter school. There is also a huge difference in ages in all the classes. Many people are there because they took a break from school so coming straight out of high school is not necessarily the norm.
College Junior,1,"Tuition is like any other college.  But, the financial aid office is by far the worse office i have ever known."
College Student,1,they keep upgrading the computers to the latest windows version but they still run slow. and they restart them every night so everyday you have to go through the same updates...
College Junior,1,Not Helpful Enough – Well the ladies at the Finacial Aid desk are not really that helpful for example i was asking on how to reinsate my finaical aid and told me to go the FASFA website turns out that it is not done on the FASFA Website and i told them about this and they still told me to do it on the FASFA website it seem they dont really care about their students
College Student,1,"One of the main problems I have with this school is the way financial aid is received and the help I tried to acquire when I had problems with my financial aid. Rio Hondo goes through the HigherOne banks for financial aid. Each student is mailed a HigherOne debit card in which his or her financial aid money will be transferred to. This is a frustrating system because any time a student swipes his or her card, they are charged fifty cents. This wastes money they could be using on books, gas, or food. It also is difficult to transfer this money into another account, because they charge you five dollars to transfer to another bank. In the end I ended up spending way more money for all the processing fees than I did actually using the money for something beneficial. When I went in to the financial aid office to ask for help and to question this system, there were only three people available to talk to and I waited in line for almost three hours. When I was finally able to speak with someone, they kept trying to refer me to the website instead of actually answering my questions and helping me. Overall the system in which we receive our financial aid needs to be changed. Our money should just be directly deposited into whatever bank account we choose."
College Junior,1,"Not Much Diversity – Mostly hispanic student body. A few asians, white people and black people. Most students are the typical young, fresh out of highschool age. There are a few middle aged students who are coming to college for a change in careers."
College Student,1,"No Money – I feel that since I don't get financial aid, it really makes it hard for me to pay for classes.  On top of that, I have to work now in order to get money to pay for classes.  I seen some students get money and rarely uses it for school.  I wish there was something to help the ""fortunate"" actually be fortunate."
College Junior,1,"Keeping Secrets – No wait is too short in my opinion. Yet, to wait in a line and not receive the proper information well... is a waste."

Senior,5,"Very safe, close to the beach. The school does lack the whole party scene, but does make up for it the resource you find on campus with academic help."
Senior,5,"It is a bit challenging now with the pandemic and all, but that has not stopped the professors at CSUMB from trying their hardest to teach its students. I do not find it difficult at all to be learning like this, but I do miss being in a classroom."
Senior,5,I love it. I have never felt so proud to be a student until I entered CSUMB. The professors are so kind and very understanding. The buildings are quite amazing and there are plenty of water bottle filling stations.
Senior,5,"They seem very motivated to help otters and promote themselves to help wildlife! Since I'm very interested in environmental stuff, they would be a great college for you!"
Senior,5,"The website seems very nice and comforting, the school looks nice! and the professors seem really nice. :)"
Freshman,5,"They are keeping everyone up to date on everything that is occurring very well, and try to find ways to bring students together."
Junior,5,So far it is going well for me and the department of study I am majoring in. I think the professors are doing well at transitioning and getting use to a whole new system and they are very patient with the students who are also getting use to online learning.
Sophomore,5,I live so close to CSUMB and all the staff working very hard and they are helping me a lot and very kind people
Sophomore,5,I haven't tried online learning yet. but I have been told they understand and care about us to success and help each person with whatever they need to have done their Education degree
Sophomore,5,"CSUMB is the first school I've attended with a comprehensive plan in the event of a school shooting with a training video for students about what to do during an active shooter situation. It's a very relaxed campus atmosphere, with plenty of wide open space for outdoor activities, and the big open skies can be taken in just about anywhere on campus. The library is beautiful, with plenty more new buildings freshly completed or currently underway. The professors are very personable, and the online services for payments, studies, grades, research, and information are user friendly. The small, new school is perfect for people who need a small community and better opportunity for financial aid. As an introvert, I can pleasantly attest to its mellow atmosphere--the pride isn't coming from a mascot or some rivalry, but rather the work the students put into their education. Never before has my success been taken so seriously by others, be it from professors, counselors, or administrators."
Sophomore,5,"Professors were very clear about their class format (synchronistic or asynchronistic) and were very flexible in their adaptations. The hiccups of everyday life were easily forgiven when the new class schedules interfered, and professors were open to hear everyone's feedback about the change. Some deadlines had to be extended, but a slightly longer semester is certainly worth the understanding conduct of the class. The in-person lectures are much more engaging, but professors kept their standards high without being cut-throat which I deeply appreciated. The school even found a way to conduct an art show I got accepted into online, and made sure to keep the social community connected through online events and routine emails about opportunities on/through campus. The most important emails were very prompt and uniform with covid/cost updates. My professors were more behind on their emails because that supplemented all in-person communication, but that is to be expected."
Alum,5,"I never took an online class at this campus, but my roommate did and she recommended to take one or two online classes."
Junior,5,"I liked how small the class sizes are, more one on one time with the professor if needed and it was a lot easier to interact with students. I also really liked the environment of the school, it has a large diverse community and everyone is very accepting."
Junior,5,"I have taken classes online, this previous semester was not my choice but due to covid-19 we were transferred to online and overall my experience was good and present and the professors were great at adapting."
Freshman,5,I have heard online classes are very intuitive and easy to speak with the professor if you have a question or need clarifications. i have attended other colleges where the online program isn't that great and it is really difficult to get ahold of the professor if you have any concerns
Freshman,5,"I haven't started yet however i have heard good things, and i am very excited to attend this college this fall. I applied to this college since it was close to my house and it would be easy to commute from college to work to my house. This college gives off a good vibe when i first visited it and ever since then i have fallen in love with the campus."
Junior,5,I have enjoyed my time at CSUMB. The small class sizes make it easy to connect with professors and get a better understanding of the material.
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed my experience at Csumb I had amazing professors. I also had an opportunity to intern for the personnel department, which makes me a desirable human resource candidate. One thing I would change about Csumb would be for majors to be held in one building. Csumb buildings are very far from each other for most part, which made it difficult to have back to back classes."
Freshman,5,"I love CSUMB! The campus is near beautiful beaches, and the vegetation around the campus is gorgeous. I love that there aren't that many students who attend CSUMB so class sizes are small and personal. The weather is perfect I love the vibe of the campus. Professors are very helpful and care about the well being of their students. The school is very diverse, and liberal."
Sophomore,5,"This school has really given me the opportunity to come out of my shell, most of the professors are amazing and helpful. the schools location is also another factor that  has made the experience even better."
Alum,5,"Class of 2019! I absolutely loved my experience at CSUMB. As a first-generation Mexican-American, CSUMB offered the support I needed to overcome adversity and prepare me for future success. The HCOM department transformed my mentality and prepared me for my graduate program. CSUMB is diverse, the academics are stellar, the campus is gorgeous, the community is close-knit and growing each year. If you're looking for small class sizes, beautiful scenery, or liberal learning you will love CSUMB! The social scene is growing and if you get involved and meet other students you're bound to have a great time.  Nothing will beat experiencing the central coast if you have the opportunity to attend do it!"
Alum,5,I loved my experience! I transferred to CSU Monterey Bay and had a blast.  I was in the KIN department and loved all my professors and fellow classmates.
Niche User,5,"Beautiful college, amazing experience, can't wait to visit again. Offered many opurtinities. Amazing experience with an amazing atmosphere. Had a beautiful view of the beach. The professor seem nice and friendly and as if they care for the students and their wellbeing."
Freshman,5,I’m currently enrolled to CSUMB and I couldn’t be happier with decision. There are various amounts of free resources that are available to all students such as tuition-included tutoring in the library and food banks to distribute to hungry students. CSUMB campus is very diversified and includes many extracurriculars for anyone to join.
Senior,5,CSUMB is great! They're continuing to update their facilities and construct new buildings that compliment the unique area. I'd like to see more sports programs and a horticulture program one day.
Junior,5,CSUMB is a great school. It is very diverse and the professors make everything easier because they’re understanding.
Sophomore,5,its great location and campus isnt too bad itself people here are super nice and chill great time overall
Graduate Student,5,Great school for an Online MBA.  I've found the application advisors and overall process to be very helpful and look forward to earning my degree.
Freshman,5,"There are many different areas to hang out in, and the environment is beautiful. There is green everywhere and flowers, I love seeing the birds there are so many different types. The teachers care about there students enough to put in extra time and to give more examples to those who need them. The Departments that are smaller like math are also better for students because they get more time from advisors and are cared for more frequently. The diversity is better than most other schools that I have been to, and it is fun to be in the neighborhood around the school."
Freshman,5,"CSUMB is a great school. It isn't going to be the biggest school or a school where people are always going to be attempting to get into, but it is a school where there's enough opportunities for you to be able to make a name for yourself and be successful."
Niche User,5,The campus is clean and not too large or small. The people are nice and there are plenty of quite spaces.
Graduate Student,5,"CSUMB is a small but up and coming university! In every class I had the ability to get one on one time with my professors which was so incredibly valuable to my learning experience. There are some fantastic undergraduate research opportunities and some fun clubs to check out. The price you pay for tuition is relatively cheap compared to a lot of other universities and overall I would say it is definitely worth it for the education you get! Definitely take note that Monterey is a quiet area so there isn't much partying, but the beautiful beaches and overall chill vibes of the campus make up for it. One more thing is that the housing is great for freshman year because the dorms are relatively spacious, but I would recommend trying to live off campus after that so you don't have to pay for the meal plan! The food there is not too amazing."
Sophomore,5,"My college experience has been far better than I had ever expected, and much of it has to do with the college itself. The campus is small so the classes are typically tiny - even tinier than any of my high school classes ever were. The teachers are kind-hearted and have the best interest of the students in mind. My work load is enough to where I am learning but I still have time for leisure. The student body is really amazing, too! Everyone is super nice and easy going. Living on campus is awesome, too, because everything is within a 5 minute walk due to the small size of the developing campus. My only issue with this school is that the housing staff don't seem to be very great at communicating with each other or informing the rest of the student body about important things."
Senior,5,The campus is beautiful! The teachers are very understanding and helpful when you ask for help. Students are very welcoming and friendly. The food is pretty good and healthy.
Sophomore,5,"I have enjoyed my current tenure as a student at California State University - Monterey Bay. I feel that they have done a good job helping me adapt to the college lifestyle and helping me feel apart of the culture they are attempting to make at the University. I have no real complaints about anything at the university only praise and happiness for how they've helped me in my transition to a full-time college student. I can't thank the University enough, and I can't wait to get my degree as an otter. The school is fantastic and I hope other students are willing to give it a try."
Sophomore,5,I love CSUMB. The students are all very nice and welcoming. The teachers are very caring toward their students. This university is just an over all really great place.
Senior,5,This school is quiet and small. I love that! Everything is so spread out so there's a lot of walking but the public transportation is really good. The freshman dorms suck but the on campus apartments are amazing
Sophomore,5,I loved how welcoming the students and professors were. If there is one thing I would change it would be how involved the students are.
Alum,5,Big campus but it's still small as a community. The classes are far from each other and the makes it difficult to park on one side of campus and get to the other classes.
Alum,5,"California State University Monterey Bay is an excellent university. All professors and support staff (counselors, tutors, etc.) were all extremely helpful and seemed to WANT to help vs just being there for a paycheck. It is a smaller university, which led to improved teacher-to-student individualized support.
While the school is outside the Monterey city limits, there are a lot of activities to do on/near campus. With the beach less than a mile walk from campus and the CSUMB Outdoor Recreation Program, CSU Monterey Bay is never boring."
Freshman,5,"My experience so far at CSUMB has been great. The amount of resources provide for each student is great. They have tutors that are  always willing to help students out in any subject that the student is struggling in. Professors are always willing to help each student out in anything that they need because they always emphasize how they want to see all of us succeed. Professors have office hours that students can attend for extra tutoring. The school always promotes the importance of mental health and the resources that they have for students. This was very helpful for me because I was in need of the counseling center that is provided. The campus, although it is pretty small, is extremely beautiful. One thing that I would change about this school is maybe the dining commons. Even though they have a variety of healthy options, I think I would want to see more fresh fruits provided for students."
Freshman,5,"I am currently in my second semester of college. College has been treating me good so far, one of the best experiences. I chose to come to CSUMB because of its location; I absolutely enjoy going to the beach, and CSUMB is the the closest CSU to the beach. This campus is new compared to other colleges, and I love the small class sizes because it is easier to actually engage in the class and ask questions. CSUMB has one of the best baseball teams in California, so I'm looking forward to baseball season. My professors have been great so far; they want to prepare you for the future, they care about you, that's how I feel about them. The people here are so nice, and I feel safe here."
Freshman,5,the dorms are huge but there is virtually no party scene. the campus dining commons has a great selection of vegan food. sometimes the food gets repetetive and it can be boring after a while.
Freshman,5,"CSUMB is a very welcoming school with a beautiful campus, exceptional buildings for recreational and educational functions, and many other benefits. CSUMB is a generally diverse school, which ameliorates the learning environment. To go with this, the dorms and housing are exceptional and have no apparent flaws. In regards to the campus, it can be described as open and secure, as well as easy to transverse. other things that complement student life there can include well-designed meal plans and cafeteria, and a good student to teacher ratio of about 30 to 1."
Junior,5,I've had a very good experience so far here at CSUMB. The only change I want is for financial aid to be less and affordable.
Alum,5,I loved the small campus and intimate atmosphere between students and professors. The abandoned military aspect made things interesting. I definitely enjoyed playing water polo there and enjoyed every moment with my team.
Niche User,5,"The campus is very comforting, and the people are very welcoming. It Is evident that the student teacher relationships are quite strong. The professors are Very approachable and quite helpful."
Senior,5,"Great campus if you like relatively small class sizes aside from lecture sessions. Teachers offer a lot of extra assistance through their office hours and the campus offers free tutoring-the CLC (cooperative learning center)-for nearly every class. Colorful setting with colorful people from every walks in life. Very diverse in majors, minors and concentrations. Overall, great experience."
Junior,5,"While being in the process of majoring in psychology at CSUMB, I have been fortunate enough to meet some of the most educated and supportive psychology professors. Most of them have earned PhDs and their class lectures demonstrate that they know what they are talking about. If I would have to give a constructive criticism, it would be for the school's counselors to offer more information about scholarship opportunities. I have struggled to find scholarships that fit with me and when I have asked my counselor for further assistance she has simply told me to search for scholarships on the CSUMB website. I wish that the non-teaching staff members at CSUMB could be more supportive while understanding that ending up with high debts post graduation is remarkably essential for us students to intend to prevent."
Alum,5,"Excellent location to attend college. Small town that doesn't provide too many distractions, but close to bigger cities have some adventures. Not a very big CSU, which gives you better access to the faulty and sports teams are well supported."
Junior,5,"I love the personal community and small classroom size. CSUMB has a positive atmosphere and fun events. Unfortunately, housing is terribly expensive and hard to get into. It would also be valuable to have more food options on campus."
Junior,5,"I would like to see more buildings get renovated and more parking space available. I like the local environment, and there are plenty of things to do like visit local beaches and restaurants. There are are a lot of old buildings that can be torn down to make room for new infrastructure."
Senior,5,This school has been such an inspiring place ever since I started attending in 2014. I have met countless of people whom I have become close friends with. My learning here has been amazing. My school offers various programs for my major and will go above and beyond to help students with our projects. CSUMB is commited to helping their students grow academically and professionaly. They make sure to go the extra mile to help us get ready for our career.
Senior,5,"I received my bachelors degree from CSUMB in four years. It was a very beneficial school for getting my degree, there are a few things about the courses transferring else where that should be fixed. But it is an amazing school with amazing advisors and teachers."
Alum,5,"I went to California State University Monterey Bay in fall of 2011. I went to this University so I can experience a whole new life for myself. When I got to campus, I realized that I was going to have to adapt really quickly. AT the school, there are so many people that are friendly and helpful. I have never saw that before. Where I was coming from, there were limited resources in order to aid you. This University offered everything and included a smile with it. I truly enjoyed my time at this school and would suggest as many people as possible to go there as well. I graduated from this University in spring of 2015. This school gave me all the tools necessary to succeed after graduation. It has also led me to get into graduation school at San Jose State University."
Alum,5,I liked the diversity seen at CSUMB. Resources and counseling was very helpful. A calmer feel. Teachers were straight forward and knew what they wanted you to learn and teaching methods were great.
Freshman,5,Great campus that offers a large range of opportunities since it’s a smaller school. I enjoyed the campus because I like cool weather and the ocean that is close by. They also have multiple dining areas so there is always somewhere to eat
Niche User,5,The CSUMB campus is possibly one of the great campuses I've ever seen! I can't wait to attend in the fall of 2018!
Graduate Student,5,Very flexible to student with families. The tome of classes in the credential program allow me to also make a living and gain the classroom experience I will need when i am fully credentialed
Junior,5,"CSUMB, is atmosphere of both developing and growing to staying natural and environmentally friendly. CSUMB is starting to grow based on new academic building and student center. It is maintaining its beauty by leaving trees and plants along the university. Making students enter a natural environment to an up to date technology buildings and resources. Making students to get a new vision on the CSUMB campus and how they live in resident halls and how they interact with one another. CSUMB will then be more pedestrian friendly by 2020 by moving parking lots to the edge of campus creating a more physically active campus."
Senior,4,Online classes have been good so far. Office hour are still available and classes are easy to get used to.
Junior,4,I am a junior at CSUMB and I have loved my experience thus far. The people are nice and the teachers care about your success.
Alum,4,"Online classes are great. Classes are well organized and easy to follow. Grades are post quickly as professors do not need to grade tests themselves, the computer does it for them. Power points are saved to your computer and professors do voiceovers so they are easy to follow."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy how hard they are working to keep everyone included and bringing people together during this pandemic. I just wish all my professors were using the same schooling websites, as im using Ilearn, and Canvas rather than just one."
Junior,4,"I am barely a week into my first semester here after transferring from a community college and so far it is going very well. I think the university as a whole is doing a great job at transitioning from in-class to online while in this pandemic. So far, this is going well and the school itself is still holding events via online to make us feel like we are not in the middle of a pandemic and I believe this is awesome and thoughtful."
Sophomore,4,My experience at CSUMB is very good the environment is very calm and refreshing having the nice refreshing breeze coming from the beach. The beach being accessible in just minutes away. When it comes to academic wise this school is a great option having great facilities and good access having a great library for studying as well as support programs to help you succeed. One thing I would suggest to CSUMB to have is better programs for masters or a veterinary school  and even a medical school. I think by having those programs there would benefit it because of the location.
Alum,4,"During COVID-19 quarantine response the In-person class I was attending became an online class. At first I was afraid my grade for the class would suffer. However, I had a great professor who was always available. I ended up doing great."
Alum,4,I loved the community and close knit environment. Professors truly care for the students and want them to succeed not only in the local community but in their careers as well.
Alum,4,"We really did not use online programs or have online classes. All my bio course were face to face. Class  sizes were small so it was very easy to pay attention ,learn , and ask questions."
Alum,4,love the area and environment .  The bio department is absolutely amazing . There are a few rude/non-understanding  staff members but overall great school.
Freshman,4,"Though I had difficulties with only one of my teachers my overall experience was good. Teachers were understanding and lenient on deadlines. Submitting homework wasn't an issue, test were a bit difficult to navigate."
Junior,4,"Overall, very good! This school has my exact major I needed (not really offered at other CSUs) and great professors that teach for it! Campus is great for me Slight issue with the Advising office, bounced around from a few different advisors, who have different opinions and ways to create an ILP. Parking and residence halls are not great here. I was crammed into a small room my first year with two other girls. My room was clearly a double person room at most, but you know how it goes. Party scene is alright, just need to know who and where to go."
Sophomore,4,"It's a nice and small school, big enough to explore new things. However, it is not overwhelming. I would recommend the school to anyone who is coming from a smaller high school. The transition for me was quite easy. Only felt like a smaller step up instead of her going to a school that had over 10,000 people. I do think one thing they could improve on is more food options/choices. I know food insecurity is a big problem on this campus. I  would also like to see them add more parking and less buildings."
Freshman,4,"Overall so far I really enjoy going to this school, the staff is amazing super helpful. But personally I am having struggle financially, so I would appreciate better financial support."
Freshman,4,"I like that at this school, a majority of people are open minded, accepting, and welcoming. The professors I have had here have all had a positive impact on me and have treated teaching as way more than a job they have to do. They spend extra time making sure you are getting the support you need and deserve, as well as preparing you for the rest of your lives. The staff cares about you and is always willing to listen and they have helped me so much. The school overall is a safe environment for you to grow and blossom."
Graduate Student,4,"As a retired student athlete, CSUMB was a great school to attend. I loved the history of our campus and how it was built on the old Fort Ord. Classes were great and everyone really got to know each other."
Junior,4,It is an ugly campus in a pretty place but they seem to be updating the look of the campus rapidly. there is a new student center being built and there are a lot of great people and professors here are amazing. however the amenities at this school are sub par there are only a few places to eat as a freshmen and the gym and facilities are very poor
Junior,4,"This school has a lot of pros and cons like any other school but I chose to go here for a reason. Everything else aside, this school was the best option for me. It is one of the cheapest of the Cal State Universities. It is located in beautiful Monterey about ten minutes from the ocean so there’s always something to do. There are also tons of opportunities for my major in the area that the programs here have helped me connect to. Some of the more important cons to look at are that the school is expanding so some of these connections this small school offers will be lost soon. They are increasing the price especially  Student Housing and Residential life. Plus there aren’t many good/healthy food options on campus, it’s gotten worse in the three years I’ve been here and now I only eat at Starbucks In the student center."
Freshman,4,"So far I am enjoying my experience here at CSUMB. I hope to continue my education here because the academic, social, and overall environment here is refreshing and exciting."
Sophomore,4,"CSUMB is a diverse campus with a very friendly and accepting atmosphere. The courses are taught by a wonderful staff, safety for the students is a priority, and the campus itself is clean, pretty, and spacious."
Freshman,4,So far my time at CSUMB has been pretty good new smaller campus lots of friendly people and so far also pretty good professors.
Junior,4,"It has been a tough transition for me to attend this school as I am unfamiliar with how everything works. The school has provided me with resources that I have taken advantage of and have helped, but I still worry that I will struggle financially. Housing was the most difficult part for me when speaking of my transition, besides that the professors and advisers have been great."
Sophomore,4,What I love about CSUMB is the where is located and the student to teacher ratio. It is so easy to talk to the professors one on one and they all want their students to succeed. I truly feel supported here and confident that I have the tools and help I need to succeed and get my degree.
Freshman,4,"Overall great institution, really nice weather and other students are very nice. Great place to hang around and meet new people"
Freshman,4,"good. small classes so you get face time with the teacher. the community there is close. the food is average but it is a quiet school, very close to the beach so it is always an option to hang there. the weather is nice and basically the same everyday."
Junior,4,"Love that the university is small compared to the majority of UC's and CSU's. The free access to the region's bus routes and a bus route that drops me off near my off-campus dorm is excellent as gas prices are not cheap nowadays. The food on campus over here is good (one buffet-style cafeteria, 2+ food -on-the-go restaurants, and 1 Starbucks). As for services, the CLC inside the library is great help for tutoring. The TRIO SSS-STEM staff does an excellent job to make transfer students not from the area feel at home while at the same time provide excellent guidance. The clubs/activities that seemed to catch my eyes are the school radio broadcasting and video game programmer club; I may have not had time to join them my first semester (last semester), but I'll see if I can join them next semester."
Senior,4,I'd like how they support my major in Film department. I don't like how low quality they serve their food on campus. The weather is exceptional due to location.
Freshman,4,"Great School! The professors here really care about their students, if they see you're struggling they will reach out to you and offer you their help or give you the resources you need. The classes have a great student to professor ratio so you really get the help you need from your professor and they all offer pretty flexible office hours and they are willing to work with you.The overall atmosphere of the school is very welcoming. The campus is pretty small so you don't feel overwhelmed."
Freshman,4,"I have met a lot of new people while attending at the school.  Also, the professors are really nice to you when they start to get to know you.  Another thing is that the food is decent but near the school they have some restaurants that you would adore."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the teacher to student ration, which allowed me to get to have a better connection with my professors. I encountered passionate professors which made the classes more interesting and relevant. I also liked the affordability of tuition in comparison to other universities."
Freshman,4,"I'm currently attending Monterey Bay and so far, I enjoy it! The beach is very close and the professors are so understanding. There are many opportunities the school gives its students like internships or extra-curriculars. The only complaints I have is I wish there were more food options, especially for late nights. I also wish we had more around us in general, so definitely bringing a car is an advantage if you want to explore the cities nearby."
Freshman,4,CSUMB has been a super awesome school. The classes are fun especially my scuba class. Most the professors are great and understand the materials they teach very well; while a few I’ve had aren’t open to opposing opinions. The campus is clean and very diverse and the dorm rooms are very large in size compared to other colleges I’ve visited. I’d say the biggest complaint about this school most students have is the lack of parking. The school has started to get rid of inner parking spaces to enforce less driving and healthier students. I feel pushing the parking spaces out makes the campus a bit less safe especially for those like me who get off work late at night. Overall I believe this is a really great school.
Freshman,4,"The campus is nice and super close to the beach which is a plus! The classes seem good but could be a bit more challenging. Overall, love the school."
Junior,4,"Absolutely my all time favorite university, I transferred away to play golf at another school, I was there for a semester and transferred back to not play golf and work with the athletics department."
Senior,4,"My experience at CSUMB has been great. I love the area and the fact that it's a fairly small school. It's not perfect, and it is in the process of renovating so there are definitely growing pains. But I wouldn't have wanted to go to school anywhere else."
Junior,4,"The university offers great services to students such as plenty of events and mental health. Professors really wish to see their students graduate and remind them constantly about workshops that help with their careers. However, the dorms are reportedly decent, at least the older dorms, and food could be better. Luckily there are plenty of shopping centers with restaurants."
Niche User,4,"I went to California State University - Monterey Bay for a college tour and I instantly loved it. I could see myself going here and they provided everything I am looking for in a college. The area is everything I want in a college, the campus is super clean and a good environment for me to focus on my education. CSU - Monterey Bay is my number one choice right now as I am a senior."
Senior,4,"California State University Monterey Bay has so far been a decent school. Instructors here for the most part work with you as much as they can. The Kinesiology Dept. here is very good. This is what I am going to school for. The cost is a bit much, but the financial aid department really works with students to make sure they are receiving as much help as they can to try to make school more affordable. The school has a good environment. Located in a nice area only 10 minutes from the beach. Has great additional facilities like a gym and dinning areas located right on campus."
Senior,4,"CSU Monterey Bay has provided great opportunities in my major and is very affordable. There is a difficulty with meeting with an advisor, but there is adequate support provided in academia and career."
Niche User,4,Monterey Bay is a beautiful and friendly town. I feel very safe and feel like i have access to many things like peaceful and clean beaches.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is big and spread out although the population is very small. You tend to see the same people everyday. It is about a mile to the beach and the weather is so nice. The one thing that would need to change would be to update some of the buildings, a lot of them are still the original old army base buildings."
Junior,4,"Overall it is a great school for film majors. It has a very hands on program with excellent professors who are very knowledgeable of the film industry. Housing is a mess and often is making errors with students housing, however the dorms are pretty nice and are decently maintained."
Niche User,4,when I went there it was nice. The people were nice and the atmosphere at this campus is great. I have an Aunt that works there and its cool and she lives on campus. It has a modern feel and they are renovating and expanding the campus as it is only 24yrs old
Niche User,4,While visiting the campus I enjoyed my time seeing and touring. The students on campus seemed very friendly and seemed to have gotten along. Something I noticed was how big the campus was and I would like to see it also expand in the future.
Niche User,4,"Everything is perfect, except the fact that the college has liberal views. I would prefer neutral and of course my views."
Senior,4,"California State University, Monterey Bay is a newer university that is growing rapidly. If you are looking for a cheap school with quality education, teachers, and opportunities, I highly recommend CSUMB. If you are interested in social justice, there are many opportunities surrounding this area of interest. If you are  interested in partying with a popular local area and downtown, I don'r recommend CSUMB. As the school grows, it will continually improve."
Senior,4,"I would’ve suggested better parking options but due to the fact there are lots being closed in order to start construction it wouldn’t be worth it. This school is getting bigger and they’re trying to compensate but there’s not enough room for all of the cars coming in. The new food company they’re working with looks really interesting as well. I’m glad Sodexo is gone since their food was just OK. The campus is easy to get around once you get the hang of it, it’s not a big campus. The student to teacher ratio is great so you feel like the professor really gets to know everyone."
Junior,4,what I like about monterey bay university is that not only that i have the required meets to enter the university I want do more that i can do. Not only that i hope to go to that university so i could become a video game developer.
Senior,4,"I like how small and new CSU Monterey Bay is because I get a chance to establish a personal relationship with my professors and fellow colleagues. With it being so new there is plenty of opportunity to make something new on campus and to make the community your own. The surround area is beautiful and there is lots of hiking, surfing and activities to do."
Alum,4,"It's a great school, but some professors are very careless with the grades of their students. I would think that at this level in education everything would be planned out and good in terms of grading and getting people where they need to go during their time here."
Junior,4,"I was attracted to California State University - Monterey Bay because of the vibe the campus presents. It is not necessary to be a student in order to feel the friendly and loving atmosphere CSUMB has to offer. Walking around campus, it is guaranteed to run into someone you may know. It is a wide spread campus, however, the interaction with other people are very close. It is a great campus to be a part of when you may be feeling a little homesick. Although, I would like CSUMB to upgrade facilities since most buildings are history from Fort Ord."
Junior,4,I have had a good experience so far. Csumb is very big on diversity which is nice. Everyone is welcome.
Senior,4,"Great school with wondeful teachers and students, really laid back vibe in a great area. Advising and housing could be improved but every school has its pronlems."
Senior,4,"I have been attending CSUMB since Fall 2014 where I entered as a first-time freshman. CSUMB has offered me many opportunities and I have loved my time here, especially with how small it is. It isn't out of this world but it does vibe with me."
Freshman,4,My experience has been excellent so far at CSUMB. I am really content with how diverse this campus is. Also it is located right by the beach.
Niche User,4,"The professors and staff were all very friendly, accessible, and knowledgeable in their fields. The campus is big in terms of land, but classroom sizes are small enough to receive individualized help and attention. Classroom organization can use some change, as there does not seem to be a logical organization of where classes are."
Junior,4,It almost feels like I’m at home. I love this campus and the environment. The staff here is amazing and the professors are willing to help you.
Junior,4,"The thing I like about CSUMB, is how each department has its own building in which people are allowed to thrive in their educational development. However, this is also poses a major issue. People of one specific major hardly interact with people studying something else. For example, as a Computer Science major, I hardly ever see, or talk to, someone majoring in Art. I feel like this has both its pros and cons."
Sophomore,4,"Csumb is a great place to be there. There are beautiful beaches & attractions all around. The classes are fun, small, & interactive. The people are very nice. The food is a bit repetitive & can get old easily but the workers make it easier to keep coming back. Monterey is the place to be!"
Niche User,4,I love this school! The campus and local area is beautiful not to mention the history behind the campus! I kind of wish they offered more sports though.
Graduate Student,2,"The online MBA is okay. I was mostly disappointed with my experience in the school. The teachers that work IN Monterey Bay were great, but those outside of the actual school were just okay. 
I went to a different state school For my undergrad degree so I thought I would enjoy my experience similarly but class after class found myself mostly disappointed in the quality of education and level of critical thinking expected of me by my teachers. 

However, the level of “prestige” is very high when I tell people I went to a Cal State school, despite my own personal thoughts about my education there."
Graduate Student,2,"The online MBA is okay. I was mostly disappointed with my experience in the school. The teachers that work IN Monterey Bay were great, but those outside of the actual school were just okay."
Sophomore,2,My online experience at CSUMB was not so great mainly because instructors were not able to adapt to the situations of the online experienced which left us students struggling even more trying to not only go through this academic but as well as adapting to the online classes which was difficult.
Niche User,2,"The campus is decent, it's not the best looking Cal State out there but you can get a decent education there!"
College Freshman,2,"Everything is far from campus, and not worth it if you can't drive, or don't know someone who drives."
College Freshman,2,Not a big athletic department but I attend evening and online classes so I don't really pay attention.
College Junior,2,"A lot of my neighbors where drug addicts and housing did not respect my request for room change. Event occurred where I feared for my safety and housing gave my name to the person that caused the event and fear of my safety. Heating sucks and always cold. Room fans and heaters are banned, live off campus is better option but live with roommates for cheapest option."
College Freshman,2,"The campus generally focuses on helping specific majors opportunities for internships and careers. There are general job fairs, but nothing specific to certain majors"
College Sophomore,2,Theres like no alumni since the college is so new
College Sophomore,2,"I have had a couple good professors, namely Susan, from the business department and Professor Silveus in environmental studies.

I hate giving such a harsh rating to this school, but truely, maybe I'm just talking to the wrong people, but nobody seems happy here. There is no school pride whatsoever, there is nothing to do in the area, and I have had quite terrible experiences with a couple of the professors on campus. It seems like they're growing faster than they can handle, and hiring professors that aren't qualified.

I have to say, though, the housing is phenomenal compared to other colleges. My room is very spacious and I have my own bathroom."
College Sophomore,2,The school is easy and the students think it's a joke. I wish I had gone to a school where students are proud of the education they are receiving
College Sophomore,2,Everyone tells me no one takes Monterey seriously... It's terrifying
College Sophomore,2,I always get crappy roommates and my RA never cares
College Sophomore,2,"schools motto is ""who cares it's Monterey"""
College Freshman,2,"Because we are so close to the beach, everything is pretty expensive and you need multiple roommates"
College Freshman,2,"Everyone goes home on the weekends! Everyone here is so stuck up they do not want anyone they do not know in their parties. When you do find a party, it will be from an athlete, and you have to get in with them."
College Senior,2,The school is working with what it has. The food can be very repetitive and boring after a while and I still have trouble eating it now after stopping for a couple years and trying it again. Student organizations try to push for better food options and the differences are marginal at best. I do not recommend campus food besides the occasional meal you didn't have time to make yourself otherwise you will get kind of sick of it.
College Junior,2,"It takes for ever to get anything done, and they can be totally unhelpful.  It took me 2 months to move out of a house that was harmful to my health.  The study abroad office is pretty helpful though."
College Junior,2,More grants would be nice right about now
College Freshman,2,It seems like no one knows how to control themselves. Being the sober one makes it hard to have fun when all people want to do is become so drunk they're wet noodles. It's sad. And I don't think the Fraternity Kappa Sigma helps at all. They have a bad reputation with girls.
College Freshman,2,My first semester here it seemed as though we were getting sexual assault emails every other week. And we never got any confirmation that any suspects were caught.
College Freshman,2,"Seaside is okay, Marina is a dump, and Monterey is amazing but also expensive."
College Sophomore,2,I personally think the Greek life is not well established and I do not take it seriously.
College Freshman,2,I've never been to one I don't like parties.
College Freshman,2,There's not much going around the campus. It's pretty empty compared to others.
College Junior,2,I did not receive all the financial aid I needed and that is a problem. I was supposed to get a pell grant again this year and it did not come in for some unexplained reason.
College Junior,2,The food could be  a lot better for the prices.
College Freshman,2,"I don't believe that the FAFSA is a fair process. In my experience, I did not receive any financial assistance because my fathers income is too high. What the FAFSA does not keep in mind is that I live in a family of six people. My father is the only person that works for my family, I work as well but only part-time. The FAFSA asks for information such as, ""how many people are in your household?"" ""list employment for parents"" ""ages of the siblings you live with"", but does not seem to do anything with this information. If they do not care why do they ask? Applying for scholarships and possibly working seems to be the only solution when college gets too expensive."
College Sophomore,2,Nobody wants to be in a Frat or Sorority. There are many negative connotations on them.
College Sophomore,2,People tend to leave campus for parties because they are better and get crazy. There is a lot of underage drinking.
College Junior,2,It's not the university's fault that there is no public funding for education!
College Junior,2,"I did not receive any financial aid as a freshmen because FAFSA said we were able to pay for college, but my family and I still have to pay the hard way. My word of advice is to look into scholarships through the school's financial aid office, and to weigh your housing and meal plan options to figure out what's most cost effective, because that's probably your biggest expense as an incoming student."
College Junior,2,"The Greek Life on campus is not very developed yet at CSUMB. There are several fraternity and sorority options, but none of them appeal to me. There is no Greek housing (they all house off campus), the groups are very cliquey, and it seems like all they are known for are partying and social affairs. Some groups host fundraisers and cool events, but many I have never heard of. I personally would not want to join Greek life on my campus, the vibe the people give doesn't make me feel welcome."
College Sophomore,2,"There is nothing to do in the area. A lot of older people live in the area so that explains why nothing happens and there is no nightlife. Coming from a city like Los Angeles, Monterey county is very disappointing and dull."
College Sophomore,2,"The social life is terrible on this campus. There is rarely anything to do, the events rarely have a good turn out. The student center is good for watching tv if someone isnt already watching something else and the library is actually very nice and the staff are helpful. The athletics are not an important part of the campus nor do they do well."
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few options on campus and majority of the students dislike the service and the taste of the food. The otter express is unhealthy, expensive and takes very long to cook the food."
College Freshman,2,"From what i've heard, they are not very respected here."
College Student,2,We have a really small gym for non athletes I heard that there was going to a new one built by the time we come back for fall semester.
College Freshman,2,they just take out the parking lot near the library to built a new college
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you know people in certain frats, sororities, or sports teams, it's more about having small kick its. People throw parties in East Campus, but they're nothing very big."
College Freshman,2,"The area is beautiful, but far too remote for me. I come from SoCal, where there is always something going on, or something to go do. Monterey is certainly different than that, so make sure you know what you are getting into. If you like surfing, hiking, and biking you will love the area. Especially hiking."
College Freshman,2,"I would not come to this school again if I was given the opportunity. The program seems alright, but I worry about the value of my degree, because the school is not a very good university. I need to go to grad school, and I worry I won't get into the prestigious schools I want to attend."
College Freshman,2,"The police are more interested in giving out parking tickets than stopping the student body from doing drugs. The big weed problem on campus is turned a blind eye. Cars parked in library parking overnight however, are ALWAYS given proper attention."
College Freshman,2,"I wish we had a football team, and the gym is small and outdated. Also, the track still says ""Fort Ord"" because it was not replaced when the base turned into a university."
College Freshman,2,"The Greeks on campus are very involved and are definitely there, but we don't have many of them. Also, they can be overly pushy and somewhat petty if you have to back out or choose not to join."
College Senior,2,The running joke was that anyone could get in. Some of the presentations I see in my classes are pitiful and I cannot believe I go to school with some of the idiots I have in my classes.
College Freshman,2,they don't run late enough. For those students who have a late class or if they're coming from work late. You can't really depend on the buses here.
College Freshman,2,It's hard to do work on the internet because there are so many students on it which makes the internet runs dramatically slow and hard for you to do online work.
College Junior,2,There are mainly Asian food restaurants around the area as well as a few Mexican. But overall there isn't much diversity to choose from. You would have to travel a bit if you wanted something different. Everything closes early around here so there aren't many late night options as well. 
College Junior,2,"The food is the same thing everyday. Not much there are a few options to choose from each day. You can have pasta and pizza, Mexican food or burgers and fries. There is a salad bar and they allow you the option of to-go meals. They do not stay open late except maybe the Otter Express, which has subway sandwich opportunities as well as a fried food section.They have healthy and organic snack to purchase as well. The otter express if pricey though. "
College Junior,2,"The housing process this year was terrible. They told me when I applied that there was no way I would get campus housing, the waitlist was too long. Then I found out by chance two weeks before classes started that I had gotten housing. The school never sent me a word about it! I already had off campus housing all lined up. Then the school wanted me to pay $650 to ""back out late"" from their housing. No way. Not when they didn't tell me I had it!"
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is small and hated. There are no parties.
College Sophomore,2,Housing is old. Problems don't get fixed.
College Sophomore,2,"Restaurant Variety is fairly limited, and most places close after 10pm.  Unless you enjoy eating fast food super late at night, there's nowhere decent to eat.  A good cheap place for breakfast is Tommy's.  They serve breakfast meals there for only 1, 2, or 3 dollars. For generic asian food, Noodle Bar is a dependable place to eat."
College Senior,2,"Honestly, I don't like the cold and Monterey is always cold. Also since it's always foggy the air is always super moist which can get your clothes wet. The constant cold generally keep the students inside their dorms which is a shame because we live next to so much beautiful wildlife and amazing beaches. During the entire school year there are maybe four weeks of beautiful sunny weather."
College Sophomore,2,"If you get caught in the presence of under age alcohol possession (not consumption), you are required to write an essay and get placed on housing probation."
College Senior,2,"Small close by cities with some attractions. An Aquarium, music festivals, not too accessible to students due to cost. Very turistic area."
College Sophomore,2,"While the on campus starbucks and peet's are nice to have along with the student center, there isn't much to do on campus. The dinning commons has little options for food and usually serves the same thing every day with the exception of two or three stations. The Otter Express has more food options and is the best place to eat on campus, but other than that there aren't many food options. 

There are many diverse clubs on campus including sororities and fraternities. Campus is a 20 minute walking distance from the beach and has free public transportation for off campus needs."
College Sophomore,2,"So far I Have not had much difficulty finding parking, now that I have a parking permit, which came as a costly price. Although my classes have started this Summer and parking is fair, I am a little nervous about this fall when all of the students will return to the regular schedules; parking will likely be packed!"
College Junior,2,I have tried looking for a place off campus but according to rules. A student has to be a full time student to live in the apartments.
Alum,1,"CSUMB cares more about money than anything else. I graduated from there 2 years ago and was really disappointed by the costs and overall education. 

Fast forward to now, they send me a check saying I owe them $100 with no explanation to why, when I called to figure out why they're charging me for something 2 years later in the middle of a global pandemic when everyone is finacially hurting, they couldn't figure out what the charge was for. Regardless they said I had to pay it or they would turn me into the Franchise Taxes Board. 

So unprofessional, so greedy
Put the student first and make our world a better place."
Alum,1,"They don't care about students, only money. I can't believe the greed of this college, unfortunately I think its the whole CSU system."
Senior,1,"Someone will tell you one thing like taking classes , and when you try to do it you end up finding out that you arent allowed to do"
Freshman,1,"I lasted one semester before transferring. And now, 6 days before school resumes, they still have not sent my transcript to my new school. Leaving me with a hold on my account, and a lot of issues with enrollment. The food is decent, and the professors were nice. The math department was fantastic. However, if you are not an adventurist person I would not recommend attending here. Also, the school requires a service learning course. Which occurs twice in the 4 years you are supposed to be there. This course is 6 units, and requires 30 hours of community service. Which is great, if you are not a broke college student and need time to work during the week. Overall, I was not pleased with my experience."
College Junior,1,"I do not live on-campus, I have lived off-campus for most of my college career however there are many students that been unable to secure housing because of the systems in place and lack of available resources."
College Sophomore,1,No spirit whatsoever. I don't even think our school owns the track near the university. No football. There's a basketball team and at the one game I attended the cheerleaders couldn't even preform and they all fell down. It's embarrassing. People don't come for the athletics.
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene on this campus. NONE.
College Freshman,1,I was wait listed as a freshman and did not get the chance to dorm. It was extremely hard to find an apartment especially without the help of the school. Since many CSUMB students had to live off-campus there were hardly anymore nearby apartments available.
College Junior,1,I go to school in less than a month and I've heard nothing of housing! Far too impacted! It's terrible!
College Sophomore,1,Theres some randoms Greeks but they arent important. The only cool thing one of them does is throw the annual Freaky Knights dance which is for Halloween.
College Sophomore,1,"There is little student involvement, the team performance is poor, and there is no school spirit."
College Sophomore,1,This school does not have a fun social life at all. There is not much to do and if there is the events can be boring and dont have a large amount of people participating. The dances are much either expect the very first school dance. There is nothing to off campus either. I dont really hear about unique opportunities on campus nor academic programs.
College Junior,1,The school does not provide financial aid to students in the Scientific Illustration Program I am enrolled in.
College Student,1,I hate how dirty and old the dorms are.We can tell that they are refurbished army buildings and hey haven't been re done since the school opened.
College Student,1,I am very unhappy with the way the financial aid at this school is set up i think that they should factor in all aspects of a students home life
College Senior,1,Im almost positive people just go to bed at 9pm every night
College Freshman,1,Everyone smokes weed. Even the professors and faculty know.
College Freshman,1,"If you are looking for vapid individuals who care more about where to score the next ounce of weed or how many classes they can skip and still pass, then this school is for you. If you are looking for meaningful conversations and students who care about their future, this is NOT the school for you. I know, it sounds harsh. I wouldn't have believed it before coming. But it's the truth."
College Senior,1,I have had no luck with scholarships at all.
College Freshman,1,I'm completely use to So Cal weather that I haven't really given this weather a chance. I just don't like the cold and I really do wish It was more warm here.
College Junior,1,Most people are white. It was a little overwhelming at first.
College Sophomore,1,UPD cracks down too hard and people tend to rebel.
College Junior,1,There is almost no transportation for the students here! It can get very frustrating.
College Sophomore,1,"Athletics are practically non-existant, and those who are on a team are usually drunk or high.  This is not a fun enviornment for anyone who actually wants to be there to learn.  We have minimal support at athletic events and they are boring since our teams are not experienced."
College Sophomore,1,It rarely exists and when it does it gets shut down quickly.
College Sophomore,1,Parking exists. Different lots require different parking passes. Overnight parking spots are limited causing parking violation issues.
College Sophomore,1,"The food doesn't generally make you ill, therefore, it doesn't completely fail. There aren't too many dietary accommodations. Also, when you take a bite of anything white (ex. rice, noodles) you will get an instant headache."
College Senior,1,"Police is strict. Also intermingled with military police, since campus shares land with military posts and personnel."
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife at CSUMB is almost non-existent. Parties are hit or miss, and not many clubs around the area."
College Freshman,1,"mostly gay guys, the straight guys are ass****s and or  man whores"
College Freshman,1,Night life here is non existent this is not a party school or a college town. it a bunch of old white stuffy rich people.
College Freshman,1,The Dining Commons are a joke and there are hardly any options to eat elsewhere. 
College Freshman,1,"The food for vegetarians sucks. There is very little variety and on the weekend it is only open for dinner, as if the vegetarians and vegan do not eat breakfast and lunch. I have lost count how many times I have had cereal or pizza for dinner. Also the healthy food opinions are disgusting while the non-healthy opinions are only slightly better."
College Junior,1,"Housing is not the most reliable on campus. However, once you find are placed in a room they are nice. In North Quad (for upperclassmen) you get a living area and a kitchen."
College Sophomore,1,"The academics are professional and the school is heavily community oriented. Service Learning is required and time must be spent in the community to graduate. However, the student life is none existant. The resedential life is discriminating, due to the fact that the police officers are racist and agressive. The police force provides an unsafe enviroment that sends many kids home for the weekend. Because everyone is affraid to hangout there, everyone chooses to hangout elsewhere. If you did not do well in highschool and scored poorly on your SAT, and dont care about social life then this school is for you. If you want to challenge yourself academically go to a credited university unlike CSUMB. And if you would like to go to school for social aspects then it is vital that you do not attend this institution. "
College Sophomore,1,"Not many Greek's, those that exit are easy to get into and do not throw parties to often. My highschool partied harder, and my highschool had 800 students!!!"
College Sophomore,1,Very Strict – Good luck trying to through campus parties with all the R.A's.
College Sophomore,1,"Buses Lag – Busses lag, not really the best, but they are free"
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life at csumb really sucks!. no one really sees it as a big deal. Csumb  doesn't have a huge vararity of sororities so its hard to fit into one. I suggest if you are the type who likes to have fun and party , then csumb is not the school for you. The Greeks that are there do a horrible job for setting up parties. Not a serious status thing!"
College Junior,1,Not Enough Options – We are limited to the basic fast food options that do not offer student discounts. We are also limited with the hours of operation for the off campus dining places.
College Senior,1,our university teams lose to weak community colleges  there's no athletes at our school.
College Senior,1,Only Five Attractive Women on Campus – only five good looking women i've seen in almost two years and two of them are faculty.
College Senior,1,teacher's don't teach and they themselves know the program is bogus.
College Senior,1,Lousy Computer Facility – the computer labs at most community colleges are way better than these ones.
College Senior,1,"I Came Here to Lean Not Waste Time. wasted almost two years and i am worse off now then i was when i started.  i have less money, i missed time from work and passed up opportunities for advancement at work.. if you come here, you will see"
College Senior,1,They Stole My Money – i have to retake most of the classes i took because i didn't learn anything.  telling students to google information and not knowing how to answer specific questions is not good if you're majoring in a technical field.  most of the teachers are inept and don't bother trying to learn how to subject they are supposed to teach.
College Senior,1,"Poor Classes – this school is a scam with scam teachers.  most of the teacher's do not teach.  a lot of the teachers don't even grade your assignments.  the majority of the work is easy busy work.  there's so much of this useless work that it becomes time consuming.  esentially you waste a lot of time doing work that does not teach you anything because the instructors don't want to work.  here is something else in about half of my classes, no instruction was given at all and two of the instructors dissapeared for most of the semester.  in two of my classes this semester, no grades have been submitted for any assignment.  we were supposed to receive our final grades today."
College Senior,1,Bad Food – the food sucks.  the only thing okay there is breakfast.
College Senior,1,"this school is bad  I gave this major a D- because I had one professor who was good.  the rest of the people who teach at this place are bad,  they don't care if you learn anything and most of them don't even know about the subject they are teaching.  this school does not preapre you for a career."
College Junior,1,I never encounter anyone in a fraternity or sorority.  Are they here??
College Junior,1,"A Lazy Bunch – I have not found happiness in any program at this school as I have switched between three. The advisors are extremely lazy, the teachers have the same attitude, and the classes are made to be as dull as can be. I like to get involved not just listen to a teacher lecture for hours. Yes I would do it all over again, and hurry up to get this over with. My goals are to graduate, and get an internship with Greenpeace in various parts of the world. I hope to continue to learn different languages to be able to travel, and expand my help all over the world. What concerns me the most is the school that I go to, and if it will look good on any resume."
College Junior,1,"For one the library has very limited hours. It stays open until 8pm on weekdays, but only until 5pm on weekends which is the time it is mostly used. The time is always changing up on us as well. Also this is not a place to go if you want silence, it is the loudest library I have ever been in. The student center is so small you would not even know it was there unless somebody told you. The athletic center is also very small, and is not accommodating to the increase of students each year. It is hard to find an exercise machine available the majority of the time. Campus activities are not up to college status, and a lot of the activities are things you would do in middle school. It is strange to me that there are no activities that are fun for us so-called adults. Campus housing is getting so crowded they are cramming four people into a very small room instead of renovating the old buildings just sitting on campus without use. The campus food is over the top gross, and there is not much for a vegetarian to eat there. Sodexo has taken over our school while the students fight to use local farming for our food instead of this gross cafeteria food."
College Student,1,"I personally have heard no one from CSUMB talk about Greek Life. We are a fairly new campus, therefore I don't believe we have something like this available for our campus."
College Senior,1,"Need Car, Too Far to Walk Anywhere – Main campus is to far from cities and lack of rapid public transportation is poor. Apartments are somewhat easy to find but expensive, need roommates."
College Junior,1,"Some professors actually teach you something. Some don't. It is not really hard to pass classes, they aren't challenging."
College Junior,1,when registering for classes of housing you are given a lottery number in which no one knows how it is picked but even those who register for these appointment times before others  still get latter times
College Sophomore,1,"Greek Life is lame. There is one frat on campus, and they don't have a house. The parties are rare and it usually consists of senior guys and freshmen girls. One thing they do that I give them credit for is bbq's on campus. That's about the extent of my involvement."
College Freshman,1,"Don't Go Here!! Seriously, do not go here. This school is a joke. Academically, it is ridiculously easy and close to none of the classes transfer.The campus is somewhat depressing due to the fact that no one is ever outside or even walking around.Its hard to make friends because there are barely any social activities or clubs that real people would join. And the party scene here is pretty much nonexistent, students just drink or get high in their rooms.The surrounding area is really pretty though. So, I repeat, do NOT come her unless you are a anti-social stoner who loves to do absolutely nothing."
College Freshman,1,"Go Crazy! Honestly, this school's policy on underage drinking is ridiculous. If you get caught drinking, which is virtually impossible as long as your not loud and obvious, the alcohol is drained out and you must write an essay on the negative effects of alcohol. Same goes for marijuana or any other drugs."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Call the Federal Student Aid Department Yourself – Financial aid is a joke.  We use CMS PeopleSoft accounts and the information on your student account will always be wrong.  You have to show up in person and demand that they fix your financial aid at least 2 weeks before school starts, or you'll be dropped from all your classes.  Forget about trying to get help over the phone, you'll be put on permanent hold and after 20 minutes, someone will hang up on you."

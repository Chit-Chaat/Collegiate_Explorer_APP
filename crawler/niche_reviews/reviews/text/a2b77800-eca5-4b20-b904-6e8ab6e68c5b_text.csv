Freshman,5,Love it here. Work is pretty easier then it was in high school for me. Everyone is friendly and willing to help if you need it
Freshman,5,I like that eventually after a week or 2 everything is hands on. The people you meet are amazing. Seeing different personalities being brought out by the students passion for their studies. Is truely amazing.
Freshman,5,"As soon as I walked into five towns I was greeted happily by the administration and immediately given a tour of the school and campus.  Soon after I actually met the president of the college shook his hand and he formally got to know me,  this made me feel like the college had a very home like atmosphere.  After giving the tour I am mediately applied and  no more than two weeks later was excepted and my schedule has been made.  Although I have not yet taken a class I am very excited for what the next few years will hold for me at five towns College!"
College Freshman,5,"The classrooms aren't filled to capacity, so the experience between teachers and students is very personal. It allows me to pay attention easily."
College Freshman,5,"There are many opportunities for students to intern so they are ready for the ""real world""."
College Freshman,5,The college allows students to join internship opportunities so they can get their feet wet in their fields.
College Freshman,5,"I have been in the school for 2 weeks and I already feel how great the year is going to be. The classes don't have a lot of students, so it is a more personal experience with the teachers."
College Student,5,Get involved and you'll have a great learning experience!
College Student,5,Flushing High School is really a great school to attend to because there's so many opportunities here for juniors to start an essay way for college and while during their senior year they would already know what to expect for college.
Recent Alumnus,5,i always had a good experience with my schedule and flexibility
Recent Alumnus,5,"i took most of my classes in the school, but did take a few on line classes so it would fit into my schedule.  it all worked out great and the teachers are very accessible."
Recent Alumnus,5,"very good overall experience in every way.  i am graduated with a bachelors degree in business with audio concentration.  five towns was very helpful in every way from education, connections, career center, internships, and resume help and interviews."
Recent Alumnus,5,quality and overall experience of courses and professors are terrific.  class sizes are small and teachers are very personable and work with you for extra help and anything that comes along.  i made a lot of good connections with professors as a lot of professors at five towns are involved in the music and business field outside of the school and are very willing to help you.
Recent Alumnus,5,"the career center is extremely helpful - i had a great experience with internships and the career center helped me with my resume and interviews after graduation.  they are still in contact with me if they see something they are still calling me and e-mailing me for job prospects.  i had a very good experience at five towns.  everything is there at the school, if you take advantage of it - you will be very happy"
Recent Alumnus,5,"my major is bachelor in business with concentration in audio recording.  i got a great education in business and learned a lot of new things in audio recording and made a lot of connections with teachers that will last a long time.  i have graduated with a bachelors in business with audio concentration and am prepared for my career.  i do have a lot of loans to pay off now, but i know my education was worth it."
Recent Alumnus,5,overall experience at five towns college was awesome.  teachers are very personable and being involved in the school is key. joining the school band was great experience for me and my overall experience was memorable.  i've made a lot of key connections with friends and teachers that will last forever.  everyone at five towns is very helpful and also with finding a job after graduation.  i still am connected to five towns college in many ways and will always be a part of who i am in my future.
College Sophomore,5,I have heard great things! I have yet to graduate so i can not personally say at this time
College Freshman,5,Everything has been extremely easy in my transition into 5 towns college. Strictly being a music school i am surrounded by amazing talented people who are all pushing for the same thing in the world. this will be my first semester at the school.
College Freshman,5,I enjoyed my time visiting Five Towns College. the school is socially put togetger and based around my major. The dorms are right on campus so its easy to get to classes and all classrooms are on the same floor so it would be a lot easier to figure out my classrooms. The building it self is beautiful and they really look to see their children succeed. The staff has been really helpful with refistering for the school and helping me with anything I need. Being on campus and seeing how everyone operated made me want to live on campus even more. I will be attending this school because of my experience in the school.
Freshman,4,"Five Towns College has provided me a place where I can learn my craft in a safe, creative environment.  I am surrounded my like-minded people who support and encourage me to learn and make me better at what I want to do! However, Five Towns College is not very financially helpful with scholarships so it puts so much pressure on me to succeed as Five Towns College is expensive to attend for just one semester."
Sophomore,4,At five towns the community is small but very tight knit. Smaller class size allow for professors to focus one on one.
Sophomore,4,The small community environment creates a close family atmosphere with all the students and professors.
Freshman,4,"My experience with Five Towns is pretty good. As a resident on campus, I like how hard the students try any and everything to make life better and more enjoyable. Even for those who do not reside on campus, they still join whatever festivities that may happen. One thing they might have to work on is reviewing the success of their events. If it was a popular success, then they should have more of it throughout the year."
Graduate Student,4,"Five Towns has excellent teachers, especially in the music department. They have recently begun trying to improve the schools facilities and appearance by planting flowers and revamping the schools radio station. There are many opportunities there for all kinds of interests. The only frustrations i had with the school were when I had to deal with registrar, bursar, or financial aid. These appointments tend to take too long and sometimes it seems that no one is informed."
College Student,4,All the teachers are fine and have a hands on learning technique.
College Student,4,there are a lot of internships anyone can apply too.
College Student,4,In my High School year the wonderful things I experienced here was just like having a real job and opened up my mind even more to see that I'm on my own.
College Student,4,It's wonderful because learning things the easy way and when you get to college  it's going to be very easy and you're going to know what to do and try to empress the professor.
College Sophomore,4,4 year graduates are required to intern before graduation
College Sophomore,4,"Every year, there are The Luminaries Film Festival where awards are given for specific categories. It is a lot of fun. Last year, I was nominated for Best First Year Film. I was so happy and proud. I didn't win, but it still didn't take from the experience. I don't see other colleges doing things like this."
Recent Alumnus,4,Some online flasses i took made me wish they offeted them in person because there was so much knowledge to take in.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Some of the teachers are old and forget things a lot. But are knowledgeable, informative and always helpful."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I was a performance major for two years which really packs on the work load in the first 2years, because the curriculum  classes needed are 1credit each and they are all hard work. I enjoyed being able to work one on one with a vocal teacher and learn new vocal techniques. I switched to a music business major my junior year and thought the workload was less under the music program"
Recent Alumnus,4,I was a pretty good student; passed most of my classes and worked hard. I just wished I would've been more involved in the student activities. And clubs.
College Sophomore,4,They take most if not all of your transfer credits
College Sophomore,4,Many people from this school have gone on to do great things. For example Maroon 5's Adam Levine was a student
College Sophomore,4,The teachers know their stuff.
College Sophomore,4,"I like the one on one time.

It helps me understand the information more.

I love the intimate pratice space and you meet others just like you"
College Junior,4,the school has been under going numerous changes and sometimes things are worse before they can get better. i believe if i was a commuter i wouldn't be as involved but that dormer pushed me to want to me more active in the community. the creative friendly people here are amazing and eye opening. the programs here are good for dedicated learners. the food might not be the greatest but its college food- don't expect it to be great. dorms are beautiful and resident life is super helpful. my advice is get involved it'll make your college experience there very fun!
College Sophomore,4,Very different from what I did in high school
College Sophomore,4,It's a small community so the y are at their best
College Sophomore,4,It's been good....I'm on campus so it is convenient for me to attend classes on time. This is a small campus and classes are close by
College Freshman,4,The theatre professors have a high expectation of students to do schoolwork as well as participate in three plays per semester. I enjoy the lifestyle but it is exhausting.
College Freshman,4,The class registration process was easy with the help of my advisor.
College Freshman,4,Five Towns has a great student center that allows students to create our own clubs. But there are no athletic teams or activites other than a gymnasium used for theatre rehearsals. RAs often organize fun activities for everyone.
College Freshman,4,The performing arts centers on campus are wonderful but I wish the food was higher quality.
College Sophomore,4,This school focuses on getting you into the real world as far as Music since that is what i took up. It offers internships and much more.
College Sophomore,4,It is a wide range of ethnicity at the school. Its more males than females that attend the school on a regular.
College Sophomore,4,"Its all pretty good, everyone is helpful and always there"
College Sophomore,4,It is pretty great for what is needed.
College Sophomore,4,"Since the college is in a rural environment, more options are on the school campus for the students to enjoy."
College Sophomore,4,It is a catering and small environment. You are not just a number at the school. Your presence actually matters and is valued as an individual.
College Freshman,4,"The overall experience is great, I'm not sure if its for me though. I would probably prefer a bigger school for my next college."
College Freshman,4,The financial aid department at Five Towns does their best to find a financial solution for all students. Most students are attending on some sort of scholarship.
College Junior,4,well im in the HEOP program so in really paying nothing which is a good thing because college is expensive especially for a commuter. but because of this im able to go to school.
College Junior,4,I've seen lots of post grads come back to the career center and either get jobs at the school or get help with find jobs in there field.
College Junior,4,"The student body at the school is amazing. FOr example, if i ever forget my thumdrive or cell phone by accident somewhere, I can be confident that I will find it. Everyone looks out for each other. SInce it is a small school, everyone tends to communicate with other people with different majors and work together. It is a great small community of people of different ages, religion, and ideas. Regardless of the differences you can always find many people making you feel like you are with your other big family."
College Freshman,4,"The overall experience my for my first year at Five Towns has been great.  While getting an education, I've grown as a person.  The staff and upper class men make you feel at home and like your with family. I'm looking forward to my sophomore year at Five Towns."
College Student,4,"Online Course – online courses are no where helpful as much as an in class, professor to student course"
Freshman,2,"Thought Five Towns College was a cool place to be, at first. But, it's not really. FTC loves to claim that they are diverse BUT the fact of the matter is that they do not treat black people or POC fairly. They claim that they care about us but they don't. So far, being in this school I've seen and experienced flat out racism and discrimination from RAs and higher-ups and it doesn't sit well with me knowing that I have to spend 3 more years here. And this is only my first year here.

You can collaborate with students and they have your back. A lot of the teachers are great but higher-ups are questionable

I felt like there was one teacher cared about minorities in the school and because they spoke up about it.. well you can ask anyone that goes to school here what happened... Yes, you can get good grades here. Yes, it's a diverse school but if you're a person of color, I suggest you look at a more diverse administration because they only claim diversity because it's beneficial to them."
Recent Alumnus,2,Everything's about making the school look good and hiding better projects from the owner/President
Recent Alumnus,2,Ive heard that its hard unless you are switching from another music school.
College Freshman,2,"The application process and paying of tuition is very confusing. Before last semester, I was sent via mail several different letters stating how much money I owed. No financial aid or scholarships are given towards housing. They are for general tuition only."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I was a Audio Technology major. Your not as hands- on as you may expect for a audio tech major. The equipment however, is always the latest. The coursework is repetitive as you progress. will not recommend this college to anyone."
College Junior,2,"The school is rather strict with what courses you have to take. A lot of waivers are usually filled out in order to switch classes or take an internship course. Sometimes its like pulling teeth, but as long as you are on top of it, you can find your way to taked the classes you desire."
Alum,1,"I went to school here as was one of 10-15 students at most in Mass Communications and in the 6 years I've been out of the school, I have not gotten my career job. The career offices do nothing for you and they never had the proper connections within the broadcasting field. I would stay as far away from this school as possible. The only credit I will give is the professors were top notch in the communications department."
College Sophomore,1,"I took 2 AP classes in High School for history, and I was not allowed to roll over the credits to this school. That made me upset since I paid money for them."
College Junior,1,"My school mostly consists of music business majors- that is, not actual musicians that auditioned to get into the school, but rather those who were accepted regardless of a low GPA or previous academic performance simply because the school can make money off of them. Our school has a 60% drop out rate, surprising no one as a result. The music business majors are mostly 'producers' that occupy space, class time, and overall noise level trying to make it big in the hip-hop world, acting as a deterrent for actual music students or people that would actually want to learn things at our school."
Recent Alumnus,1,As a theatre major at FTC the Career Service center not only did not help me get a job...they had absolutely NO knowledge in pursuing a career in the arts.
Recent Alumnus,1,I didn't take any online courses at my school because they only offered a few...and never when I needed them.

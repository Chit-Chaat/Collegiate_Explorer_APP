Niche User,5,I just loved it. I loved loved loved loved loved loved loved loved loved loved loved loved loved it.
Freshman,5,"I love that this school is an all art school in which you only focus on your major from the first semester you arrive. I would change the price of the school, can be a little expensive."
Junior,5,"It is great, you will be able to get great opportunities and connections through talented working professionals that will be teaching and leading your class. You will be well prepared and ready to go out to the industry by the time you graduate here."
Alum,5,"Overall, my experience as an SVA undergraduate student was a wonderful one. At first, I went to this college with the dreams of wanting to become a ""manga"" artist. Through so many ups and downs, the instructors pushed me past my comfort zone and my drawing style began to change. At the end of my senior year, I wanted to become a general comic artist rather than focus on one genre.

SVA is very diverse and open to all individuals regardless of race, gender, sexuality, religion, and so on. I have formed many friendly connections with classmates and instructors, who motivated me to develop my style and my confidence, and as I graduated SVA, I left with a wonderful experience.....until now. Thanks to one of my instructors, I now have the motivation and dream to pursue Graduate school for a Master's in Art Therapy."
Niche User,5,"The School of Visual Arts is a beautiful school with impeccable resources, staff, students, campus etc."
Freshman,5,This school has it all. Literally. The energy is just right and there's tons of things to get involved ith as a developing artist.
Senior,5,I love the atmosphere of the entire school. I'm not one to like secluded campuses and SVA being in the city makes me feel like I have more of a responsibility to take care of myself. The professors are incredible.
Niche User,5,"The biggest thing that I found resourceful with SVA was that the professors are people who are already working in the industry. As we are learning from them, we are also making connections for after we graduate for job opportunities."
Junior,5,"Been at SVA for three years now, and have thoroughly enjoyed my time. SVA supplies their students with hundreds of resources for experience, internships, jobs, etcs. I sometimes see many professors get bad ratings online, but honestly i've never had a terrible teacher."
Sophomore,5,School of Visual Arts is an exemplary school to learn graphic design. Everything is so active and interesting in this art school. One thing I would look out for is to make sure to find your professors through what other students have to say. The good teachers are very good. Look out for yourself and have fun! I know I am.
Niche User,5,My overall experience of SVA was more positive than I could imagine. I was amazed by the amount of opportunity and technology they have for students. There is always a student or faculty member to answer questions or help out with any other circumstance.
Junior,5,The school of visual arts connects you to companies and professionals in the field to help you succeed. They teach you what is relevant in the industry and how to think out of the box. They really teach you how to think.
Freshman,5,"The School of Visual Arts, the best art school in the world. As an International student from Israel, I can say that the school’s stuff was more than fantastic and welcoming. I had some struggles to adapt to study in a new language, but with the help of the Writing Resource Center and the free tutoring classes, My English got so much better. As a photographer, I feel that my skills gained so improved with the help of my awesome studio class teacher and the exciting critics in my workshop class. As an artist, I’ve never felt more connected to my art in this great school at the best location in the world."
Freshman,5,"I am going into the school around the summer, but the only thing I would say that could be changed is balance possibly the addition charge for food."
Freshman,5,"Since I was little, I know New York is a amazing place. All superheros lives in Manhattan Island. Also all Aliens from different planet in entire universe will attack Manhattan Island 10 times per day. Now I understand, all stories is created by man. Students in sva are free to use their imagination to create their own stories. For me, animation can be the strongest way to speak out stories inside  of me. thus why I decide studying animation in Manhattan Island. When I have offer from sva everything seems fine and perfect, my dream is going to come true. However there is one last serious problem confuse me. The living consumption in New York is so expensive for me."
Junior,5,"The atmosphere is just great, everyone is so creative and welcoming. The professors aftually take their time to give their lectures and care about the students needs. I never had trouble or difficulty in asking for help because it was just so easy. Everything is so accessible and they have ample supplies to better your work. I love the School of Visual Arts and cant wait to finish getting my BFA there."
Sophomore,5,The honors program is amazing and the teachers are genuine and caring! They are passionate for the craft and really bring out your full potential!
Junior,5,"This college offers current an recent graduates the opportunity to network with animation professors, who have or currently work in the top five animation business's."
Freshman,5,"Finding it financially difficult, but love NYC and learning and seeing a lot. Having access to all the museums and galleries is so enriching. I have made some great friends already. My professors are assigning challenging and creative assignments. I am looking forward to getting more involved in my major in the coming years."
Freshman,5,"The School of Visual Arts is a wonderful place for every flavor of artist, seeking a higher understanding of art and the business around being an artists of any kind. During my first year, I've learned techniques to better the art I create and how to learn from, collaborate with, and simply talk to other artists, both the classmates as well as the experienced professors."
Graduate Student,5,So far it's been a great experience. What you get from any graduate school depends greatly upon what you put into it. The teachers here are there to help you but they can't do so if you don't speak up. 
College Junior,5,I've learned so much in such a short time. Every teacher has their own way of teaching and pick what they decide to teach. I wish  I could take everyone's classes.
College Freshman,5,"The variety in courses is phenomenal! Aside from the basic courses that you are required to complete, which all still seem very interesting, there are many different elective courses that are available, expending on into different subject such as history and even science. Seeing different courses that focus on different methods and styles of art only makes me wish that I could be able to apply for all of them! Finding the right professor, however, is not easy, sometimes you'll end up with a teacher that has a sort of teaching style that doesn't help you at all, and the only way you can get a good idea on who the right professor is for you is to rely on other's opinions."
College Freshman,5,"There were professors that wanted you to absorb all the information, so they constantly quizzed us and asked us randomly what was what, what to do after a certain step, how to get to which software, what were the hot keys to certain commands, etc."
College Freshman,5,They want to do your best and know the best to fully prepare for the real world.
College Sophomore,5,You know that any of the teachers will work with you to help you get into your field.
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are artists themselves living and working, so the critique you are going to receive is valid and not based on past experience but current events."
College Student,5,The schedule of the courses is really flexible and there are a variety of choices of timetable.
College Student,5,Actually I am not familiar with the career center.However I know that the career development in SVA is advanced.
College Student,5,The professors there are all outstanding and professional. Most of the classes are no more than 20 students so the quality of classes is in a high standard.
College Student,5,There are many internships in SVA and school will provide a various of opportunity for students and it is helpful for  the  future job seeking.
College Student,5,"I will major in design and specifically I will choose graphic design and interactive design.As I am a transfer student to SVA this fall,so I don't know much information about workload or other specific things."
College Student,5,"I am going to study in School of Visual Arts this fall and I will major in design. There are so many reasons why I love SVA. The main reason is that the professors there are all professional and the students there are extraordinary and inspiring.I have been to NYC once and I visited SVA,.The dense art atmosphere really appeals to me and that moment I swear I'll be one of them one day. Actually I am a transfer student to SVA. Before entering to SVA,I majored economics in Waseda University,Japan.But I just couldn't give up my dream and I decided to follow my heart. Fortunately, I got in and I really want to cherish this chance. SVA is unique because of his location, the professional and outstanding professors and the creative students.NYC is a city that full of chances and especially for artists.I love art and in SVA, art is everywhere.Students all work in different directions and they can really inspire each other.If I have another chance to choose university,I will definitely say ""SVA!"" again. When I apply to university in America,I only apply to SVA."
College Freshman,5,"It's strict. Nothing below a C grade passes. The workload can be tough sometimes, especially with the honors program, but there's nothing meaningless about the work. Huge companies like Cartoon Network and Pixar scout SVA regularly and are amazing sources of information on jobs and internships."
College Freshman,5,"Before starting school in the fall there were many different schedule options to choose from. It was convenient for me because I'm not a morning person, so in the fall I was able to make sure all of my classes didn't start before 12, and I was able to have Fridays off which made visiting home on the weekends easier. However, in the spring all electives are at 9am and there is a required course at 9am, so for the people (like me) who aren't good at focusing in the morning, it can be a disadvantage."
College Freshman,5,There are many alumni from this school who have become very successful and have jobs in what they've studied.
College Freshman,5,"Almost all of my professors have been great people who know so much about what they teach. There isn't a lot of opportunity for electives for first year students, but after our first year there are so many different courses to take that really focus on what interests a student has. Class sizes can be big, but are small enough so each student can be focused on during critiques."
College Freshman,5,"The school has teamed up with many companies and people that will help students to get internships. There are many alumni from this school who have become very famous, some household names. All professors are workers in their field."
College Freshman,5,"I was someone who came in knowing very little, but ended up learning a lot. Also, the teachers are all people who work in the field that they teach, so they can give us real advice based on real life experiences."
College Sophomore,5,This school's animation major is their best. They provide a good amount of resources for the students such as labs and wacom. The workload is manageable but I do find trouble in keeping up. There is a clear defining line of who learned in advance and who knew absolute nothing when entering this school. Just have a lot of passion and determination to learn and create something great. Don't neglect your homework because it might go into your portfolio.
College Senior,5,The professors and facilities at the School of Visual Arts are both fantastic and inspirational. The professors are well acquainted with not only the subject of their teaching but all other aspects of the art communities.
College Sophomore,5,"Before this school, I had never attended a professional art school. I'm glad that I've come here! The professors are great and they, themselves, are immersed in the art world so they are qualified to guide you in the direction you want to go. Since I've attended, my skills in various mediums has risen far beyond my expectations! In addition, alumni of the school who proficient in different mediums come back to give lectures on their experiences. My school even has companies like Cartoon Network, DreamWorks and Disney give lectures and allows those, who are interested, to intern with them! I wish I had known about SVA when I first began my college journey. I would've graduated by now and would've been doing what I love, by now. I can't complain though. Everything happens for a reason."
College Junior,5,School of Visual Arts challenges its students in ways other schools don't. They push their students to be unique and creative. Students who go here are different because of the curriculum.
College Senior,5,"I've never seen any kind of racism, sexual harassment, or bullying."
Recent Alumnus,5,I feel like i am getting trained well.
Recent Alumnus,5,"first rate, real-world applicable study and resources."
College Junior,5,I could not have hoped  for a better life experience
College Junior,5,You will run out of class spaces in your schedule before you run out of classes you want to take
College Junior,5,"Really typical art students as a whole (crazy colored hair, high gay population, silly, Quirky, etc) but also a lot of people you would never know want to be artists. People of every religion. High in foreign students and new Jersey Commuters. Very much a liberal school so it might not be pleasant to talk about convervitive views with others and it's best if you have a strong skin."
College Junior,5,"Honestly, it's rediculous expensive but so are their competitors and I know I chose the right school. Financial aid office has the most helpful out of any other office. I have to communicate with them a lot for my loans and billing statement , etc. And they are nothing but helpful and my account gets taken care of fast and correctly every time."
College Junior,5,We have top of the line tech and tools. Students can learn old and new methods and new courses are being added all of the time to keep it fun and enjoyable as well as preparing for post college Life. Every major will have a lot of work so be prepared!
College Junior,5,illustration is tough just because of the time that each piece takes and then humanities on top of that. Junior year you have a thesis which kills. Like you won't sleep for months but it is worth it. Sophomore year is really the only unfortunate part. Feels very basic and boring but I grew the most that year so just get through it.
College Junior,5,"As previously stated, the teachers and faculty are the most amazing part of this school. They are all working professionals in their field, that being the artistic community, and are able to educate students as to what is happening in the art world right now."
College Junior,5,"Extremely diverse, beautiful, creative minds, incredible."
College Freshman,5,As my first year started I was very lucky and grateful to be there and also be accepted to work inside school. I have the flexibility to study full time and work part-time too. If I ever need a day off from work to do a complicated school assignment they always understand and rearrange my schedule so i could be off that day. I would say that the only thing I don't like is commuting but I have no other option since the dorms are way too expensive.
College Freshman,5,"I love SVA so far because is allowing me a lot of freedom when it comes to my work and there is no such thing as a curriculum that you need to follow. Professors and students are all very friendly and they like to help. What I like the most is how every student is always trying to help when you have a question and they know how to do it. We have a lot of communication with each other and the chairman of our department is the best. John McIntosh the chairman is always helping us and taking care of us, he is a very respectful person and an inspiration for everyone."
College Freshman,5,"Classes and courses at SVA are very helpful you learn a lot. So far all my professors have been great and they are always available to help me when I don't understand. The class size are of 12 to maybe 15 the maximum of students per class, which means that we don't have large classes and we can all get help when ever we need it. There are a variety of courses you can choose that could help you with what you want to concentrate more as a computer artist, but for the first year at SVA you are not allowed to choose classes. The first year you need to take fundamental courses."
College Freshman,5,"The Computer Art department offers many resources where you can have help online. We the Lynda program which is a great tool to use to learn new things. We are free to use as much creativity as possible in our assignments there's no restriction. Faculty members, students and the chairman are always there to help you. You can ask any question and they would always try to help the best they can. We all even communicate as a group online when we need help as well. We always try to be friendly to each other and treat each other with respect."
College Freshman,5,"All students at the Computer Art department are always helping each other. We are one of the departments that have the toughest time when it comes to lack of sleep. We are always trying to do our best and discover new things, so most of the time we barely sleep. This fact makes us help each other and feed each other when ever we have the time. Despite the lack of sleep and hours of frustration sitting in front of a computer, we try to be cheerful. My first semester at SVA was the best, I thought that I was going to be alone when it came to do all my assignments but I was wrong. I met so many people and most of the were international students. I quickly became friends with them and now they all became my second family including faculty members. We all learn from each other and we are constantly helping one another since we know that team work is a most in our department and our career."
College Freshman,5,My Department offers plenty of support while choosing what path you want to follow. As a computer artist you need to have as many connections as possible to be able to success. The Computer Art department is always open to help you find an internship and Pixar for example loves visiting SVA and has provide internships to many students in our department. Our Chairman is always encouraging and helping students to get internships as well as our faculty members. I feel that I really don't need to worry of not being able to get a job after graduation as long as I work hard and take advantage of all the opportunities that the Computer Art department at SVA offers me.
Freshman,4,"As a first year animation student, my experience at SVA is overall great!
Location-wise, NYC is a fun place to be in. While SVA doesn't have a set campus, rather several buildings in manhattan, transportation between buildings isn't that big a deal.
The professors I had were all industry professionals which gave helpful insight as well as thorough critique on works. And they were overall nice people! With any college, I find the curriculum can be drastically different between professors. However, I was surprised a school like SVA can have these very different curriculums within the same program. Not getting the professor you wanted because the class filled up can be a real pain for a semester, but most professors do make themselves accessible if you just make the effort to email or talk to them."
Freshman,4,"SVA strives in its presentation and how much they push their students toward  finding their identity and taking advantage of it. Their BFA Animation department in particular has all the resources you need: sound rooms, animation labs, drawing equipment, etc. But despite all of this, the teachers that you get really do make an impact on what you learn, so it's vital that you learn to improve yourself in and outside of school. Also, despite having phenomenal teachers freshman year, I did wish that most of our lectures were more fleshed out. For example, It'd be wonderful if the estimated duration of each class was preplanned depending on the topic. That way, the essential information can be in the lectures, and the cost of attending each class relates to the class' length. Of course, something like this would take a lot of money and help to implement into the SVA system, but I believe this would make the education aspect of this school thrive."
Freshman,4,"We did take online courses for most of the Spring semester, and I think it helped the teachers make their class duration a lot more flexible. The only real downside was the fact that taking classes online is no where near as academically engaging as being on campus. I do believe this way of teaching can work, and because the teachers had little time to prepare for this change, it's understandable that this online format wasn't fully realized."
Freshman,4,"In my experience, SVA has good instructors and spaces to work, however, we are  currently only allowed 3 absences per class which could potentially harm mental health or even people who get sick often."
Freshman,4,"SVA is a wonderful school that really works to train the students both technically and analytically for active careers in the art field. The school has a lot of networking opportunities, and the surrounding local area (set at the heart of New York City) is the perfect start-up location for any up and coming artist. My biggest critique of the school would be the lack of a meal plan, which can make things difficult when looking for a bite to eat between classes."
Sophomore,4,"The School of Visual Arts has good facilities with up-to-date software and is well-stocked with traditional art supplies that students can utilize to create artwork. They have a killer library and students are allowed to engage in several events not available at any other school, thanks to SVA's connections to industry professionals, many of whom work within the very school."
Graduate Student,4,"I am really happy with my program at School of Visual Arts.
Their location is convenient. For the most, our teachers are great to learn from."
Sophomore,4,"School of Visual Arts (a.k.a SVA) is one of the best colleges to find and create strong relationships with friends, peers and professors, as well as learning and absorbing the surrounding community of artists in NYC. The school's professors are experienced professionals within the art world offering strong insight and inspiration. Resources and tools available to students are wonderful! Labs are open after classes for Animation students like me, and rentals for equipment are readily available for students in Film, Video or Photography. SVA's East and West Libraries are both great places for research or relaxing. The clubs are also some of the most fun and interactive clubs I've joined. Figure Drawing club and the fun, educating sessions at LGBT/Queer SVA helped make my days at school all the more lovable. If I had to pick out a specific way to improve SVA, I would ask for the school to offer a more readily available/ accessible cafeteria and/or meal plan."
Junior,4,"I enjoy going to SVA, the teachers are people who are either retired or are currently in the industry so they are able to give you a first-hand experience and advice that allows you to understand what you look forward to. On top of that, due to the school's connections, you are able to gain access to tools that allow you to get an internship and even a job when you graduate."
Sophomore,4,SVA is a great art school if you want to experience what it is like to live in the city and be strictly independent. It opens many doors to new opportunities and is great at getting you a job in the field you are studying in.
Senior,4,"The professors will spend hours and hours on end with each student. Students are challenged by their peers by being pushed to create the best work to each students abilities. All of the professors in the school are currently working in the field they are teaching, giving students connections to people in the working field and staying up to date to what's current in each study."
Sophomore,4,"I like the school a lot so far. As an Illustration major I feel like the professors are interested in teaching and care about their students success. The buildings are mixed. they have new tech but the buildings are older and need some repair. Security is serious about their jobs (they always ask for ID), and the surrounding neighborhoods seem safe enough even at night."
Alum,4,I had a great support system at this school emotionally. In the photography program I wish they had better prepared us for careers. The program was very geared toward fine arts and emotions rather than the reality of the corporate world.
Sophomore,4,"School of Visual Arts is an exemplary school to learn animation. Everything is very peachy in this art school. One thing I would look out for is to make sure to find your teachers through what other students have to say. The good teachers are very good, and the bad ones are very bad. Look out for yourself and have fun! I know I am."
Freshman,4,"Great program (academics, professors, curriculum) and a really diverse college, but there is no campus. Very expensive too because you're in nyc and there is no meal plan at all with the housing. It's different from other colleges you'd expect, because there are barely any active clubs, activities, campus groups, etc but you sure learn a lot. Be prepared to learn independently."
Freshman,4,Its a very nice school. Ive only seen it once to be honest but just with that one time of seeing it i love it so much. Im beyond excited to see all the teachers because most of them have such great reputations.
Freshman,4,"If you're passionate about your major and career in the art, then this is the school for you. Variety of classes with deciated and experienced Professors that would guide you in your artistic vision. As well the benefit of it being in New York City, where there is many art opportunity and internships. After my 1st year, I learned how much hours and determined is need to show throughout your projects. While you might work long dreaded hours, its all worth it with the critics given and techniques on how to better improve as an artist."
Works Here,4,"The school is old, which has a certain charm to it, the professors are experienced and respectful, the environment is friendly, but it lacks certain character and feel too commercial oriented"
Freshman,4,"The teachers work in the field, and the school is very geared towards finding a job. The diversity of the students is really great, too."
Senior,4,"Overall experience is good and instructors help you out a lot. The administration is not great basically you need to keep track of all of your records, what credits were transferred if you are a transfer student, check progress of your degree, nobody tells you anything you have to figure it out on your own. Tuition is really expensive unless you have someone that pays for it. Working part-time and being a full time student doesn't cover the tuition, even with financial aid and federal loans. Other option is to take out private student loans and that you have to research on your own."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love this school! The professors are great and it's such a close nit community. Definitely worth the money. As a computer art major, the classes are very small and very personal so always get on your professors good side!"
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed studying at the School of Visual Arts. As a transfer film student, I've been able to advance my knowledge way beyond my education at the university I attended. The professors are well versed in their field and are always willing to help you, so long as you ask."
Freshman,4,"Its a generally small college (art school) with mainly professors who've worked in the business or still do (can be both good and bad). All of the teachers love their subject. As an animation student I didn’t have very much down time, and found myself going to class and working from mornings to the night. Getting around assignments and tasks can involve some BS, especially with some teachers. If you wanna kick back and relax and get by you can and still pass, but if you love art and whatever you do and are prepared to try hard in doing well, SVA will reward you and you will end the year with plenty of good work. Everyone is friendly, encouraging, but more insecure than usual. The girl to guy ratio feels like 80: 20, the died hair scene and unique outfits is real, and is loaded with international students. I had a fun year, but still curious as to what 4 years at this school will do for me."
Freshman,4,"I love the facilities and how many different courses and majors there are. You can really explore all facets of the creative field. SVA gives a lot of creative freedom and room for exploration to their students. I would only recommend their board to think about renovating their buildings and stuff like that. And maybe adding a meal plan or something. With such a high tuition fee, I feel like they should accommodate students more in that aspect."
Freshman,4,"As a BFA Animation major, this school has a very encouraging environment and gives students a lot of space for experimentation with styles and their art. This school is heavy on work, however, it often resembles busy work rather than work to challenge you as an artist and help you improve. SVA accepts many students each year, meaning that there have to be more teachers, and many of the teachers I have had should not be teaching. On the other hand, some teachers I have had genuinely care about their students and want them to achieve their goals in the animation and entertainment industry. I have found some teachers that have greatly changed my perception of art and I have improved tenfold with my drawing since coming here. This school overall is wonderful; being in New York City surrounded with some truly remarkable artists and professors is unforgettable. If you are someone wanting to attend art school, SVA is a very good choice."
Freshman,4,"SVA is a great school, and it has a lot of great teachers. However, it does have negatives: the major departments tend to be disjointed, leading to very differing experiences. Teachers might be a bit of a hit-or-miss, despite the fact that there are many, many great teachers. I would recommend to read many reviews on your teachers before choosing their classes. Still, the classes are very helpful and it's incredibly useful to live in an area where the art scene is so alive. Field trips and galleries enrich your experience. The student body (although some may be immature) is incredibly diverse and invested in their art. It's expensive, especially the housing (it is NYC after all; that's the only part they can't really control), so make sure to think about if it's the place for you before coming; definitely a campus visit before you decide to come."
Sophomore,4,"School of Visual Arts is a school of dedicated, hard-working students who are highly motivated in their focus/major. Each student there works day and night in order to create their best work, working harder and harder towards their ultimate career goal. Not the place to be if you were looking for a typical party school, the students generally prefer to put their hours into their work and enjoy the New York City nightlife in whatever free time they manage to find for themselves. The professors are industry professionals who can give you first-hand advice on portfolios and reels. As an art school, the academics are still focused on the artistic sides of math, science, etc. So it's the perfect school for those wanting to think outside-the-box."
College Freshman,4,"So far, The school of visual arts appears to be a good art school. The professors I have are approachable, and down to earth, and they encourage you to be straightforward about any problems and queries you have. The school itself looks well kept, however, its layout can be problematic, like how one studio and workspace is across Manhattan, and how some rooms are hard to find. Overall, the other students are diverse, open, and friendly, and the schedule I have is very flexible, perfect for if I have work study or a job."
College Junior,4,They send out emails about job opportunites and internships every week.
College Junior,4,Get to know the school. There are so many resources availible.
College Junior,4,Be prepared to never sleep.
College Sophomore,4,"It's been a lot of hard work so far, but the professors are all easy to warm up to once you find their charms. They are harsh but not mean, they want you to be good professionals in your field no matter what."
College Senior,4,I answered this in the previous two questions
College Senior,4,I am receiving good amount of help from my professors and classmates by get in small gigs. But it's hard to get a steady job which I'm hoping once I graduate.
College Senior,4,"My department is Film/Video. I specifically major in the editing side of it. But I am always eager to learn from each side of the production world. As I have mentioned previously, I love the access for editing softwares because it helps me better than working at home on my laptop. All big computers and the space feels great to be around."
College Senior,4,I have an had such an amazing past three years so far -- onto my last year! I want to make the best of my thesis year to prove how much I have learned from my classmates and professors. And to make a really great project. I absolutely love this school from the amount of support I have received from all around me. The access for editing labs and the equipment is great. They should include more for camera equipment but still wonderful.  I will miss this school so much when I graduate.
College Junior,4,"Like I said previously, getting a job/internship is possible not only because of the emails you receive, but from the connections you have with your professors, or even with alumni who have found a job in their field."
College Junior,4,"From what I've seen, there have been alumni who are able to take jobs as TA's for a while, and some alumni even help out with the books that SVA gives out for those who are interested in attending SVA."
College Junior,4,The quality of the courses are fantastic. The professors actually make sure you understand what to do during the curriculum. They answer their emails as soon as they can and they may even set up an appointment/meeting to see your progress if you wanted one.
College Junior,4,"The workload isn't always crazy, but when there is a lot of work to do, you have to learn how to use your time wisely. The professors will help you through different programs, especially during freshman year when you take Digital Compositing. Drawing and Anatomy classes really help you with pushing poses when you animate. Also, there are plenty of opportunities if you either attend the special events that SVA sends you via email, or one of the staff members in our department sends you an email about internships. These events include animators talking about their experience at Disney, Pixar, DreamWorks, Nick, or Cartoon Network and giving you, the student, a chance to ask any questions regarding the process of making a film or TV show."
College Junior,4,SVA has made me realized how much I really want to pursue my career choice as an animator. The staff and students in that school are amazing. They are very helpful and friendly and it feels like you are part of a community!
College Sophomore,4,The academic advisors will do whatever they can to help you with whatever you need.
College Sophomore,4,"The job prospects are fantastic and the school will do whatever they can in order to get you the career you want. The professors are great connections to have, too."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are amazing. The classes are completely unique, too. Definitely the best of the best."
College Sophomore,4,"Job prospects are really good. No matter how specific your career path might be, at my school, You'll get there."
College Sophomore,4,"Facilities are incredible, amazing job opportunities"
College Sophomore,4,"Fantastic! So diverse, and the teachers are great."
College Freshman,4,"I have heard so much of this school from many artists that I follow on social media, and looking into it and reading about the work ethic and reputation of this school, I knew that this school would be the art school to truly help me pursue my goals."
College Freshman,4,"Most of the time, if you want to do a big idea, it will take a lot of time. However, it's worth seeing when it's finished. Bringing your thoughts to reality and onscreen is the best feeling ever!"
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of money, but great education and experience"
College Sophomore,4,"I am learning from the best people. Seriously, the professors are the reason to come here."
College Junior,4,It's really great that the Illustration and Cartooning Major hires working professionals!
College Freshman,4,Most of the professors know what they're doing. The ones who aren't living up to expectations are very receptive to feedback. They are working professionals up to date in the industry.
College Freshman,4,"There are regular visits by major companies as well as opportunities to work freelance. In the computer art department, it is often said that one can never work anywhere without running into a fellow SVA alum."
College Freshman,4,"I love being in NYC! The computer art department, while strict, taught me many things about 3D animation in just my first semester. Paired with the honors program, I've learned more in my one semester here than in all of high school. The stress is so worth it."
College Sophomore,4,It is pretty good I guess since i have never taken one...
College Sophomore,4,We have a very strong career line and we have a career development department to help students to find jobs. Also we have the job fairs and online job search.
College Sophomore,4,Most professors are very professional and had enough experiences in the industry.
College Sophomore,4,"Some of the courses are very hard but they are also the ones that you can learn the most from. In the field of illustration, it is all about competition."
College Sophomore,4,"I think SVA is pretty a good school. It offers students enough freedom to choose what they want to learn and the teachers are helpful in general. If you work hard, you will learn a lot from SVA."
Alum,2,"Another waste of my time, energy and money.  I do not recommend most of the courses they offer.  I had two of the worst professors I've ever had here, in the Advertising program."
Niche User,2,"They let fine arts slide, which is disappointing.  
A few years back, SVA was one of the best fine arts schools in the country.
The school strength is now flashy, commercial graphics."
Alum,2,"I can only rate fine arts.  A few years ago, it was amazing.  Now, the school embraces slick, trendy, cute.  
Gone are the days when the great Leon Golub taught here."
Niche User,2,Went here for a few months. Left for a combination of health problems and a feeling that I wasn't getting great value for money. Was majoring in photo video. The teachers for my degree were amazing but the humanities teachers left a lot to be desired (I tried switching classes 3 times). The housing  was overpriced even for ny. It wasabout 1780 a month for rent which wouldn't be too bad if you weren't sharing a room. If you plan on going here I recommend 3 things. One do early application so you can get priory choosing classes and then use rate my professor to get a decent set. Two apply to other art schools and get scholarship offers then send them to sva and ask them to match it. This is the only way they will offer you a scholarship unless your portfolio is incredible. Three live in Brooklyn and commute you'll save a fortune even with the $130 a month for a metro card. Look on the housing Facebook groups to find roommates.
College Junior,2,"For majors such as Design or Advertising, the school is wonderful. You are almost guaranteed a job in either of these majors. In Fine Arts you are offered little to no practical help whatsoever."
College Junior,2,There is a demoralizing lack of standards for writing at this school. Some classmates will graduate with honours and not be able to compose a proper or tasteful essay or artist statement.
College Junior,2,No one really goes and the campus is so spread out it's a hassle. Even more so if you are a commuter. The I 9nly go into the library to print. Most events I do end up wanting to go to are being held while I have class so that is kind of pointless for the many students in class still
College Freshman,2,"Tuition is very high for the things that we get. We should have better quality facilities and dorm rooms should be better built. Education is great, but facilities need improving such as editing labs. The way editing labs are set up makes it harder for students to learn in that class. Financial Aid is very difficult to receive."
College Freshman,2,I think it's worth it because it's in NY and I am studying photography which I absolutely love. I love the professors I've met as well. The downside is it's so expensive for me and it's hard to pay for it with my family's financial situation. I was going to dorm but got very depressed and realized it was a lot of money so I got out of it. I only stayed for 10 days and I had to pay 10 percent of it. Huge rip-off. Also for doing payment plans I had to pay a fee which is ridiculous.
Recent Alumnus,2,My school registration took a long time and it was kind of bad. When i sent mails to my school it said that they didnt receive them or something.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There's no athletic center which sucks, but the library is good and the student center is okay."
Recent Alumnus,2,They insist on keeping me here for 4 years instead of 3 which is possible.
College Junior,2,"I applied late therefore I wasn't applicable for any in-school scholarships, but seeing how my family's EFC is 0. They expect me to magically pay 20,000$ out of pocket. But your mind and education is your biggest investment."
College Junior,2,I had to have my old high school teacher email the president of the college to get my art history credits transferred. My academic advisor is some times rude and not in her office even when you make appointments. She doesn't know what credits I need and I'm left to figure out what classes I need to take in order to graduate. She doesn't keep track very well and is unorganized.  
College Freshman,2,"Eh, life in the city so not too much of a ""campus"" life if that's what you're looking for. All the activities that the RA's throw can be overwhelming and sometimes boring but, it is a good effort of trying to create a more 'campus' feel to the place..."
College Junior,2,"City Campus – not a lot of resources compared to big 'campus' universities...no gym, little food service, etc.  BUT the  school makes a great effort to compensate: e.g. providing opportunities to take advantage of all the major museums, broadway, etc.  and schedules a lot of activities to create a more 'campus' feel to the place..."
College Sophomore,2,Make Sure You Know Everything You're Getting in to When Going for This School. It is a very expensive school and I realize now that I will not be able to afford it without going into a huge debt. The tuition goes up every year and MAKE SURE YOU APPLY FOR THE FRESHMAN SCHOLARSHIP!!! It is the only scholarship they offer that can take a load of money off your tuition. Too bad I found that out too late.. Very unorganized.
College Junior,2,"Not So Good. hey have over all 6 scholarships that they give on Merit which is good but, they don't consider the financial aspect of it. They'll still give it to
the person who can afford the school before they give it to someone who needs the money. you can't choose your own classes, or your own schedules. Getting in touch with someone in the school is literally the hardest thing I've ever done."
College Senior,2,"Not Seeing Much – I don' see much prospects for job placement. They do however have workshops, but I don't feel that SVA will put me in a job fresh out of graduation. That I'll have to do while I'm still in school."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Great – It's a private school, so the tuition is huge. The financial aid office is helpful, but there aren't many scholarships or grants floating around."
Alum,1,"No response, although i hear students are not too keen on this idea. Some say its not worth it. Maybe try to learn via tutorials provided online?"
Alum,1,"Avoid this school, its over priced for what its worth. The opinions and critiques from professors are outdated and will stunt your creativity if you take it to heart.  If illustration is your passion these professors will try to mold you into a carbon copy of themselves. Their world only revolves around editorials and newspapers. The head of the illustration deptvneeds to step down, he is super demeaning, out of touch and abelist.  Many alumni and current students have recently challenged sva's hiring pratices since they have hired many racist, perverted, xenophobic, ignorant professors. Some have been fired since but there is still muck and grime left in their faculty. If you do plan on going there,  please take things with a grain of salt and pratice on polishing your skills! Good luck!"
Junior,1,"I've never taken an online course here. I don't know if they offer them. For the COVID-19 Pandemic a lot student complained about the quality and that there was a discount on tuition (a lot of it is lab fees.) It made no sense to charge for them, when students can't use the labs."
Alum,1,"I went through a lot discrimination at that school. I ended up a civil right fighter instead of a student. I lost opportunity to develop my network because I was fighting for my right to access. It wasn’t great experience for me as a student.  They didn’t warn me that this filmmaking for crews heavily depending  on headphone to communicate each other. When I graduated, I didn’t find a job because I couldn’t hear the headphone and it would slow me down as crew. If they had warned me, I would get major in business for filmmaking  since It does not require to use headphone to communicate. :("
College Junior,1,"The school will try any way to suck more money out of your wallet and deprive you of your financial aid. I have numerous classmates and friends who have had hundreds of dollars shaved off of their aid here and there. You must bargain with the school and make deals with them. If you are an international student, there is no hope for you."
Recent Alumnus,1,I would like to be a major for illustration. Some of my classes aren't about illustration or things i am interested in.
Recent Alumnus,1,The financial aid process is going very terrible. I don't have a way to pay the money and the school is asking for a lot of money.
College Junior,1,No online course that I'm aware of.
College Freshman,1,They didn't answer my phone calls and messed up my billing. I'm hardly getting aid. I'm learning a lot but the price is outrageous. 
College Sophomore,1,"the school is depressing.  my classes were overcrowded, too many classes were dull.   freshmen  don't get lockers. you have to shlep a ton of gear back and forth.  I notice that the same person keeps posting raves, and giving it A's and can't help but wonder if the happy student is an administrator.  "
College Freshman,1,"Ugh, terrible. They're a bunch of drug and alcohol addicts who barely have any interest in education here at all.The college thing is just a joke and a party to them. Everyone knows someone that can make a fake ID or get into a bar/club with no problems. Making friends here is terrible if you don't drink, party/club, and or smoke.

If you manage to find a decent person who isn't like the above, you better stick with them for life."
College Freshman,1,"I feel like I had to ""dumb"" down my standards to match my teachers' level in my writing class. I felt like she didn't know what she was doing and was just giving us work to do without substance to it. In another class, my intro class, we were behind. Way behind. All of the other classes were doing other exercises while we were still doing the same one since class started. And inside of the class, I didn't understand nor did I think anyone else for that matter understood what to do because he explained the assignments so terribly then rambled on about things that were completely irrelevant. Don't get me wrong, they're swell people but, as teachers, they're horrible. I think SVA needs to work on their hiring procedures instead of focusing on students as dollar signs."
College Sophomore,1,"I was disappointed.  I'm told that the school isn't what it used to be, and is coasting on its former reputation. The approach was old fashioned, except for one teacher. My classes felt like cattle pens.  The sculpting space is small, and dirty.  Students work with dated materials.  There is some cutting edge computer driven sculpting equipment, but good luck getting to use it."
College Junior,1,Very Lazy – Most artists are not living in the real world. Their work will never make them money or fulfill their dreams of being recognized. They are extremely lazy and usually end up passing classes anyway. Most are middle class hippie/ socialists.
College Student,1,"I received less than half of what I should have gotten for financial aid since I'm poor. The Financial Aid office just suggested plenty of fees and loans to take out. They also told me that I should get a payment plan of $700 a month. THAT IS CRAZY! The office wasn't helpful AT ALL. $33,000 a year is way too much to be spending on art school, even if it is considered ""cheap."" People try to make up for the money they're wasting on this school by believing that they're getting their money's worth. Nothing is worth $15,000 in loans every year. Ridiculous. SVA has tons of money, why can't they help these kids out? a $5,000 grant for the whole year isn't enough, and even then they were very hesitant to give it to me. Wow!"
College Junior,1,"The Worst. I never was notified that there was a problem in the first place until the day I had to pay my enrollment fee which was 3 months ago. I called an hour and my Adviser said shes ""still working on it."""
College Senior,1,Those that I've had the personal disspleasure to seek help from at SVA's financial aid office are alone enough reason for me to transfer to another school. My financial aid advisor is condescending and rude. She lacks compassion and is extremely cold. It seems her only duties are to file FASFA and process loans. I would die of shock if she ever willingly gave out information beyond tap and pell grants. The great teachers I have the honor to study with are what keep me going.

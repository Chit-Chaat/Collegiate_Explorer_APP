Senior,5,"The professors at Smith are wonderful and very passionate about teaching! I've had excellent opportunities to follow my interests and pursue research in areas I am passionate about. The campus is beautiful and has a strong community, where students work cooperatively rather than competitively. Smith is a wonderful school that I would recommend to anyone considering it!"
Junior,5,"Smith has been the greatest experience because of its supportive environment. All of my professors and advisors are willing to do whatever is necessary to help me succeed. The students are all extremely passionate and hardworking, but mostly each of us wants to make a difference in each other's lives and in the world. I'm extremely fond of my time at Smith."
Alum,5,"Smith is an empowering environment that has served me well in the three years since I graduated. I loved my professors, who were as excited about my idea as I was, and there are so many more classes I wish I could have taken. Northampton is the best college town out there, with dozens of restaurants, bars, cafes, and bookstores to fill a Saturday. Like every college, Smith has work to do, but its students and staff are committed to meaningful progress."
Alum,5,I graduated before online learning at Smith was implemented. I did not take any classes online while at Smith.
Freshman,5,"Being surrounded by passionate and motivated young women from around the country (and the globe!) has opened my mind to so many new experiences and points of views I have never considered. The professors are passionate and understanding as well as committed to students and their overall success. The school's setting is beautiful and the entire campus is a botanic garden! If you are hesitant about attending a woman's college because it is not a ""traditional"" college experience, you forget it is different at all when you are surrounded by wonderful people."
Sophomore,5,"I love smith college! It has a great tight knight community. The teachers are great, and they really care about their students. The college also offers many resources to help student's academic success."
Freshman,5,"Overall, I like Smith College. It is really a place that someone can come and explore who they are, in academics and personal life. We are not bound by required core classes, so you are able to take anything you want. There are also a lot of clubs and organizations that you can join to explore interest outside of academics. I was in the radio club and got to host my own show on Saturday mornings. Smith has a vast range of resources that students are able to use. Diversity at Smith is a tricky topic. Yes it is true that the campus is diverse, but there are still issues surrounding race and inclusion. The food is terrible, but there are kitchens in your house, and restaurants in town. Most Smith parties are terrible, but UMass is just a bus ride away."
Niche User,5,"The tour I had at Smith College was wonderful. It was just the tour guide and I and she was very kind and answered all of my questions. She was also honest about the academic intensity at Smith, which I appreciated. The campus was beautiful, the housing was very nice and there were quite a lot of single rooms available, and the food was good. Their botanical garden was also very impressive!"
Niche User,5,"Smith is a wonderful school that has amazing academics. The professors so thoughtful and caring. The students are very accepting and diverse which makes an amazing community. The campus is beautiful, and the town is amazing."
Freshman,5,"Smith is the best place in the entire universe. I have never felt more at home. The professors, students, and faculty are just SO nice it's unbelievable. I couldn't be happier."
Freshman,5,"Smith professors are cute and supportive. They always encourage me to do whatever I want. I wanted to do research, and my advisor helped me a lot even if I am only a first year. Opportunities are abundant here. Also, the campus is extremely beautiful, especially in fall. This is a great little place."
Freshman,5,"Smith is a very welcoming place. The dorms are big and most of them are singles. The food is actually very good, many people say it isn't, but they are just no open to new food.
The professors have been extremely nice and they are very good. The work load is not that bad, but it is enough to keep you busy."
Sophomore,5,The campus is beautiful with a diverse group of people. The school focuses on making you successful and providing plenty of oppurtunities.
Alum,5,"Smith helped define who I am as an adult.  It opened doors to me personally and professionally in a huge way.  It sharpened my critical thinking, exposed me to a wide variety of ideas and people and is a beautiful and fun place to be.  I was an immature 17 year old when I arrived but I knew that the nurturing, challenging atmosphere at Smith was the perfect fit for me to focus on a quality education and grow into adulthood in a safe environment.  I was far away from my Texas home when I graduated in 1986.  I went on to  got a graduate degree afterwards and now have been at NASA for 30 years! If I had a daughter, I'd strongly encourage her to apply."
Freshman,5,Smith has been the greatest decision that I have ever made. Everyone at Smith is extremely supportive and is constantly pushing each student to be their best. I love it!
Alum,5,"Smith College was an empowering experience for me. To be surrounded by motivated women who are concerned about world issues and women worldwide was inspiring. Furthermore, the professorship that worked within research and human rights related fields opened my perspective to the potential that I had to utilize my own education for the empowerment of others. I now work in human rights, thanks to one of my first year professors igniting this spark! I am thankful and excited to use my education to support, advocate for, and stand alongside those who value humanity."
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Smith! The academics were engaging, the community was active, and the campus was beautiful. I will miss my Smithies."
Senior,5,"Overall very good.  Great professors, facilities and students. Also enjoyed activities and traditions of the school."
Alum,5,"Smith College was my launching pad into the world. Smith College gave me an education that expanded beyond the world of academia. My professors and peers educated me on the sociology of culture, business, and migration.  I learned the French language and history through literature, the news, and practice as well as a year long exchange program in Paris, France. I engaged in international relations by means of endless readings, case studies, and mock policy memos. However, it was not until I experienced these disciplines by studying and working in France and Morocco that the concepts, which the pages of books previously held for me, became tangible. I developed a taste for multicultural environments and opportunities for problem solving through collaboration all due to my Smith College education."
Alum,5,Great professors who are willing to take the extra step to help you succeed. Lots of paid opportunities to study abroad. The Praxis Fellowship helps all students get internships over the summer.
Junior,5,"Smith has wonderful academics. I especially appreciate the dedicated professors, small classes, and open curriculum, which let you tailor your education to your needs and interests. The many student organizations and the housing system create a great sense of community among students."
Alum,5,"Smith College has great academics, a strong sense of community, and a beautiful campus. It's a wonderful place to complete an undergraduate education."
Freshman,5,"So far, I love Smith! The academics are definitely the best part of the college experience here. The classes are really in-depth and unique. All of my professors thus far have been absolute experts in their fields, and it shows. It's thrilling to be able to work with the foremost thinkers in these subjects. I'm excited for all of my classes this semester. There are also a vast number of different clubs to join; there's something for everyone. It's a wonderful place."
Alum,5,"I am an alum of Smith and am very grateful to have had the opportunity to attend. 
While at Smith I studied technical theatre and had the ability to work closely with the many wonderful professors and staff in the theatre department to produce some really fantastic pieces of theatre. 
Though I changed career paths following graduation as Smith does not have a nursing school and I was not feeling the draw of the theatre anymore, I feel that my Smith education set me up in the best way to continue my studies and acquire another degree. 4 years after graduating from Smith I landed my dream job, and almost 6 years out now I was able to return to Smith for my 5 year reunion and re-live some of the best pieces of my life up until this point."
Niche User,5,When I visited Smith I fell in love. Not only with the atmosphere but also with the people. Smith is lacking in diversity but they are making every effort to try to make sure every student feels represented on campus. When I got of the bus I saw several dorms which were hanging BLM banners and LGBTQ flags. I loved smith and I hope I get to attend in the fall.
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore transfer student at Smith and I have loved my experience so far. The classes are wonderful and the professors are always helpful and caring. I feel challenged but not completely overwhelmed, even while competing as a student-athlete. The food here is good enough for dorm food. As long as you don't expect gourmet meals, you should be fine. Smith tries very hard to cater to vegan/vegetarians/allergies, but they could do more, especially for gluten allergies. Because I am so busy, I am not much of a partier, so it's a positive for me that Smith is not a party school. From what I have heard, the parties are very tame here, which is not for everyone! 
Northampton is a cute little town that has just enough to keep me from being bored. The only downside is that the stores and restaurants are all quite expensive."
Freshman,5,"I am a first-year at Smith, and also an international student. And so far, I have loved the experience of living in such a safe space for everyone. I haven't had a single bad class, the professors are really engaged with your education (and, wow! they really do care about you). Diversity can always get better, but you can see that Smith is putting effort into making every voice be heard. The campus is beautiful, and there are a lot of spaces to study comfortably (even though the main library is under construction)."
Senior,5,"The party scene is lacking, but the academics and the professors are excellent. I have built great peer and professor relationships throughout my four years and they are all committed to helping you succeed."
Freshman,5,"I interviewed with Smith the summer before my senior year on campus and I immediately felt welcomed. I, like many, was initially apprehensive of the idea of going to an all women's college. However, once i got there, I hardly noticed the lack of males (though there still were some around). Once I left campus, I got a personal e-postcard from my interviewer thanking me for coming. Skip ahead to after I got accepted. Smith was unique from the other colleges I got into. For one, I got a handwritten postcard from a Smithie as well as emails from another Smithie, the Smith Orchestra Director, and the head of the local Smith alumni chapter. Furthermore, I was invited to fly to Massachusetts, free of charge, to go to their Open Weekend, in which I got to explore the campus, sit in on some classes, talk with professors personally, and actually live in the dorms with a host Smithie. It was then that I realized that I wanted to go to Smith and I feel glad of my decision."
Alum,5,"Best thing I ever did was going to Smith . The network associated with the school has connected me for post grad work , fellowships, and ultimately Ivy League grad school ."
Alum,5,"Amazing!!! 

The teachers blow your minds. The students teach you just as much as the teachers. The facilities are great. The class opportunities are phenomenal. Go to this school. You will not regret it."
Freshman,5,"Lots of individualized attention, beautiful campus. I've had some awesome professors here. We live in houses, not dorms, which in most houses creates a feeling of community and family. Most students here are intelligent, passionate about a variety of fields, kind, and empathetic. The open curriculum is awesome because you can pretty much take whatever you want as long as you do one writing class your first year and complete at least one major."
Sophomore,5,"Like any school, Smith is not right for everyone, but it is perfect for so many women who come here. Smith's small size allows for people to run into their friends throughout the day, and for people to make connections across friend groups. The campus is beautiful, even in the freezing cold dead of winter, and the tropics room in the Botanic Gardens is always there if you need to take a quick vacation from classes. The professors are responsive and genuinely care about their students as people, as well as helping them succeed. The food is almost entirely locally-sourced and served by dining staff who make an effort to learn the students' names. Additionally, the self-governing house system ensures that students create families away from home. Rooms have character and history, and they are mostly singles, perfect for studying if none of the four libraries work for you. All in all, Smith is a truly wonderful place to spend four years."
Junior,5,"Smith College is an academically intensive environment. The campus is beautiful, most professors are more than willing to help you, and there is a place for everyone."
Freshman,5,"Smith is a great school, exactly what I was looking for in a college. A lot of people here are kind of intense (take that as you will), but it's incredibly easy to find your kind of group, there's all different types of people here."
Alum,5,"Smith's beautiful campus is the perfect backdrop to a rigorous education for inquisitive minds. I think the one thing that all Smithies take away from college is the ability to think critically, which, in my opinion, is an incredibly valuable skill. Negatives include: stingy when it comes to student life (i.e. reducing chaplains, upkeep of some of the houses, declining food quality) and an ongoing struggle to support students who aren't cis, hetero, white, middle class and able-bodied."
College Junior,5,"One of the reasons I'm happy to be at Smith are the courses and my professors. I have been challenged and encouraged to do well in all of my classes. Class sizes tend to be small, and if they're not, professors make all their effort to hold office hours and one-to-one meetings with students. Sometimes I wish we had more course offerings, but I admittedly do not have enough space in my schedule to take the classes that I am interested in."
College Junior,5,Love campus housing! Houses are beautiful.
College Sophomore,5,"very large alumni network, good career center,"
College Sophomore,5,wouldn't change it for the world
College Sophomore,5,Amazing. People don't live in dorms but in houses which have their own communities. I love my house. The rooms are so beautiful!
College Freshman,5,Smith is great because it has resources for whatever field you are interested in and is a part of a five-college consortium where you can take classes at other schools.
College Freshman,5,"I truly think that the courses and professors are less of a matter of which is ""good""or not, but whether you like the course. Smith's open curriculum means you can take pretty much only classes you like and are more likely to find good, interesting, engaging, and to be not too much work, because they like learning and the work feels less intense."
College Freshman,5,"Smith's alumni network is bigger than anyone can imagine, considering the school is so small, but Smithies love Smith and they love helping Smithies in any way they can. Plus, Smith is a well-known institution that is well-regarded in the professional world. Having a degree from a women's college, especially Smith, shows dedication to oneself and future career."
College Freshman,5,"The Housing system at Smith is fantastic. When you arrive, you are assigned a House, which you can choose to stay in all four years, or move between years or even semesters. Because such a high percentage of the rooms on campus ae singles, in most houses you are guaranteed a single for your sophomore year, and if not, definitely by your junior year, at no extra cost to your housing bill."
College Freshman,5,"Many elements of Smith make the college transition easy; the house communities provide a support system, the communal mealtimes mean you don't have to worry about squeezing lunch in, the plethora of activities presented at the org fair are always looking for members. Plus, Smithies want to be at Smith. Despite complaints about the winter weather or competing in the Stress Olympics, Smith students can always be seen wearing Smith apparel, looking in awe at the beautiful campus, and laughing with their friends."
College Freshman,5,The houses at Smith are the nicest.
College Freshman,5,The lighting around campus isn't that great but I never feel unsafe really. Campus police is there to help you if you feel unsafe walking home at night.
College Freshman,5,Going to office hours is extremely helpful. Professors are very skilled and want to see you succeed.
College Freshman,5,"Blue light system, amnesty policy, super safe"
College Freshman,5,"great courses, amazing professors,  small classes"
College Freshman,5,I know corporations and people who will hire you just because you have a degree from Smith
College Freshman,5,"Amazing professors, great (non-party) social life, beautiful buildings and dorms,  amazing programs, racially diverse campus, 5 min walk from town, everyone's happy and helpful, not cut-throat, student body is extremely intelligent (I graduated in the top 5-7% of my class at a difficult high school and can say that the majority of people here are smarter than me."
College Freshman,5,"Smith feels like an Ivy League for women. It's definitely prestigious, and classes are full of intelligent people ready to learn. The overall environment of Smith is more academic than anything else (esp. the social scene) and everyone here is driven (sometimes to the point of super stressed) because they really care about their classes and their education as a whole."
College Freshman,5,"The best part of Smith academics are the lack of requirements. Because students aren't bogged down by gen-eds, they're actually invested in the classes they wanted to take. The amount of academic freedom means you can design your education from the start, and double majoring is common. So far, my professors have been incredibly passionate and knowledgeable."
College Freshman,5,"Smith's ""houses not dorms"" motto means no dingy, crowded residence halls. Every house is different, and varies in architecture, amount of singles (the Quad has the most), number of residents, and proximity to classes. You grow attached to your house and the community (and if you don't, you can move, though the process can be a bit of a hassle), and house loyalty is a big part of the school's environment. People will always ask what house you live in before they ask anything else."
College Sophomore,5,"Smith is just a great place. The administration just passed a policy that will allow for transgender women to apply and get accepted, which goes to show how open-minded the school is. However, I definitely agree that views that oppose the campus norm are not well-accepted. At the end of the day, those students who are able to engage with point-of-views different from their own are going to be much better off going into the real world. The sense of community here is indeed very strong. Everyone feels the need to support a fellow Smithie. And the academics will for sure prepare you for the road up ahead. Smithies are very smart people, and employers know that. It's a great place for a female identifying individual to develop the confidence they need to really succeed in the world."
College Freshman,5,"The rooms are beautiful and spacious. I've seen dorms in other colleges, and they are nothing compared to Smith's."
College Freshman,5,"Northampton is a perfect college town, very liberal, artsy, hipster, and worldly. So is the food. So many different types of restaurant options are available. I had Vietnamese food for the first time in this town and I love it!"
College Freshman,5,I am in a house with all single rooms. I love it.
Senior,4,I took four courses online and it went relatively smoothly! My professors were willing to accommodate students' challenges and changed their syllabi to make them work for everyone.
Junior,4,"Due to the pandemic, having online classes was not my decision, but each of my professors worked hard to make the experience the best it could be in harsh conditions."
Alum,4,The amount of opportunities I had were excellent. I had amazing professors who not only cared about teaching but cared about their students. The campus is gorgeous and the facilities are great. The reason it doesn't receive a five is because I do not believe my experience to be universal.
Sophomore,4,"Something that stands out to me about Smith college is the campus community. As a student away from home, upon arriving at Smith I immediately felt welcomed and at ease. Specially,  the house community played a huge part in this sense of comfortability , as their are many ""houses"" on campus, which act as dorms, and the people who you share that space with become your family.  Furthermore, as a student at Smith, I am always being challenged academically, and there are so many resources on campus like the Jacobsen center, that are excited to help students with their academics. Students can also find many study spaces on the campus, such as in the Campus center, or Young Library. So if you are looking for an academically challenging environment, yet welcoming and comfortable setting, Smith College is the place for you."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I can definitely see why Smithies love Smith and on the other hand why they complain so goddang much about it. There are niches and cliques and it was so incredibly easy to find my tribe, but the campus is notoriously small and it is hard to avoid exes. The food is sometimes alright but most times just okay, it does not get good reviews at all but I don't think it's that bad."
Alum,4,"I graduated from Smith in 1996.

Overall, my experience at Smith was positive, and I can come back to campus any time and feel right at home again. Being at Smith was at truly mind-opening experience both in and out of the classroom, and had a huge impact on my growth as a person. As an alum, I'm also part of the broader community of Smith alums and we connect on social media and continue to help each other grow and change from afar. 

Downsides: the limited range of foods offered at meals/lack of facilities to prepare our own food/place to purchase affordable ingredients nearby (at the time), getting stuck in a housing assignment that was not the best fit, lack of support for my family’s changed financial circumstances during/after my junior year. 

Based on recent events, the college still needs to continue to work on diversity and inclusion."
Freshman,4,Although I am a freshman I view the college in my short time of being there a great experience. It is such a female empowering environment and the relationships made there will be prolonging and positively impactful.
Junior,4,"Smith College provides its students with an exceptional education! All of the professors are very well versed and I would even argue experts in their field. Given that Smith is a college instead of a university, undergraduate students are offered unparalleled research opportunities from first year that most students would have to wait for graduate school to have."
Senior,4,"There are great things about Smith, like certain academic departments, but some others are still very new and underresourced."
Freshman,4,"Smith is small, but the college is incredibly supportive. The house systems help create a sense of community outside of class which can be very helpful in the first few months. Academics can vary, but professors and resources are all very approachable and accessible."
Niche User,4,I will be attending Smith College in the fall and am very excited!  I did an official visit this fall and loved my experience.
Junior,4,"I've only been here one semester so far (I'm a transfer junior), but I really do love it! There are a few things I would like to change, for instance I would love to see a greater amount of POC students, however it seems like in general people are happy here. My favorite thing about Smith are the traditions like Convocation, weekly tea, and Mountain Day. Also the campus museum is lovely!"
Sophomore,4,"Smith is a great college and like any college, it has its problems. Classes can get difficult but by talking to professors, you can get help and fix your issues. Food is alright. Party scene is... okay. I think the best thing about Smith is the alumnae connections and opportunities to study abroad or in a new place."
Freshman,4,"This school has a lot to work to do, but overall I’m very happy to be here. The campus is beautiful and has all the resources you need, the people here are accepting and friendly. It’s always very busy and academia is very stressful, but it’s worth it. You get your money’s worth here."
Sophomore,4,"I really appreciate the Smith community.  I feel able to strike up a conversation with anyone, whether I know them or not.  The campus is gorgeous, and there’s lots to do in the area.  I’ve had professors that range from pretty good to amazing.  As for an area of improvement, health services and counseling is severely understaffed, which is quite frustrating."
Sophomore,4,"Smith College is an academically challenging yet supportive environment.  I had really interesting classes right from the beginning, and I've found that there are few classes I will be taking simply to fulfill a requirement."
Sophomore,4,"I've enjoyed my experience at Smith College so far! I've been able to make some great friends and the academics are rigorous, yet rewarding."
Junior,4,"Good academics, bad party scene. People are pretty intense about studying. The dorms are nice, but the food could be better."
Alum,4,"I was a junior transfer and biochemistry major. Now I’m a chemistry graduate student at MIT. A lot of Smith alumnae end up at MIT thanks to the emphasis on research. I had mostly good teachers. The food ranged from wonderful to inedible depending on dining hall and time of day so you just had to know where to look. Dorms at Smith are spacious and cozy. 
Like other schools, Smith has some issues it needs to deal with. They lack a mechanism to hold racist faculty and administrators accountable, and I was sad and angry to hear of many Black, Latin@ and Asian students being tokenized and stigmatized. I fought for the new admission policy that’s more inclusive of trans women but now we need to make the culture at Smith more welcoming to trans women and nonbinary people.  I felt stigmatized and mistrusted by faculty and administrators due to my low income and disabilities. Alumnae actually have a lot of say in what changes happen at Smith because Smith relies a lot on alumnae donations!"
Freshman,4,Good academics but still a predominantly white institution. Still hasn't divested. Wait list to receive counseling services is a month long. Food could be better. Campus is gorgeous though and Smith gives you a lot of opportunities.
College Freshman,4,"Smith is fantastic. The teachers are experts, and you can learn a lot from them, though some can be a bit more difficult to understand than others. There are so many fun traditions like Friday Tea and Mountain Day that make the experience so much better! The students here tend to be very dedicated to school and driven to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"The housing system here is very unique to Smith. You may love it or hate it. The social community, room styles and sizes, and amenities are different from house to house. So depending on where you live, your experience with these things can vary drastically. Some students will have singles their very first year, while others may have to wait until they are juniors or seniors before they can get one. Some houses have dining halls, others do not. Some houses have 100 or more students, others have fewer than 40. At the end of each year, you can choose to switch houses or stay in your current house."
College Junior,4,"I like  most professors, I'm interested in their courses, they teach well"
College Junior,4,"i haven't used career services, alumni network is tight-knit and helpful, internship prospects are solid i think"
College Junior,4,"Love my house and house community, I live in a medical single"
College Junior,4,I like the community and academics here
College Junior,4,I haven't researched as much about career prospects after Smith. I am not worried about getting a job after college.
College Junior,4,"Smith College is a great place to go to school if you're interested in learning. It's also wonderful if you are a woman who wants good leadership opportunities. As a Smith student, I have had the privilege of being a teaching assistant, leading a club and mentoring younger students. I've also had access to multiple research opportunities, both at college and during the summer."
College Sophomore,4,"It's not the MOST important part of our school, but  people do achieve great things and our teams are good or at least decent imo.  And people do go to games and events."
College Freshman,4,The athletics at Smith are easy to participate in but require a lot of time and effort.
College Freshman,4,This is the most diverse place and community I have ever been a part of.
College Freshman,4,"The one mandatory thing that Smith requires before anyone comes to campus is an alcohol training video. It definitely helps maintain safety for first years, especially during the first semester."
College Freshman,4,"Smith is on the Blue Light system, but there don't seem to be that many around campus. When a sexual assault or other crime is reported, Smith will send out an email so students can be on alert. While there is awareness and support for victims of heterosexual dating violence and assault, there is a lack of understanding for what that looks like in a homosexual relationship."
College Freshman,4,Sports are there for who wants it but generally no one pays attention to sports. The rugby team has a big presence on campus; they throw a lot of parties.
College Freshman,4,"The academics are great, workload hard but manageable. The access to the 5 College Consortium and PVTA lets you basically take any class you can think of. Career services is great if you're an Econ or STEM major, less helpful if you're in the other social sciences and humanities. There are ample opportunities and funding for internships and studying abroad. The social scene is what you make it. In the quad, there is a general social atmosphere that (to me) makes college less stressful. Also good parties on the weekends! Other areas of campus tend to be quieter and have more study-heavy atmospheres, especially Green Street."
College Sophomore,4,Many opportunities to find internships/jobs
College Sophomore,4,"Courses are diverse. Professors are hard, smart."
College Sophomore,4,"Very old-school styled houses to modern, great!"
College Freshman,4,I really like my house. I live on Lower Elm and it is close to practically everything except the quad. The social atmosphere is great and it is kept generally clean.
College Freshman,4,"I really like Smith. For the most part, it's very welcoming and I feel like I can be myself. I have enjoyed most of my classes so far and they have been challenging and interesting the whole time. I like that there is an open curriculum; it makes me feel I have a lot of control and I feel like I can enjoy myself while learning."
College Freshman,4,"some drugs, usually not prevalent, good policies"
College Freshman,4,"Extremely accepting of minorities, diverse in every way, watch your tongue if you're a majority"
College Freshman,4,Very accessible to non-athletes. Club sports are really really fun.
College Freshman,4,This semester I had two great professors that clearly knew their topics very well and made me excited about them. I had one professor that didn't seem to know what she was talking about.
College Freshman,4,I have really appreciated the house community as a first year. The community on my floor has shaped my experience in my first semester in an extremely positive way!
College Freshman,4,I'm overwhelmed with all the opportunities and very busy but excited to have access to have so many great opportunities.
College Freshman,4,"LGBTQ+ students are welcomed, with many different sexual and gender identities present, and the lesbian/bi/pan community is huge. Issues with racial diversity are very prevalent, because while Smith has many international students and students of color, the campus still feels overly white and it needs to make better/safer spaces for POC. Also, conservative students here are few and far between (the very vocal ones can be infamous) because Smith is extremely liberal."
College Freshman,4,"Smith alums have a strong global network, and are always willing to support their alma mater. The career center at Smith is accessible and sends out daily emails about career opportunities and workshops."
College Freshman,4,"The academics are incredible, but the social scene can be lacking; while I've met some incredible people, it can be difficult to make friends/acquaintances. Everyone here - professors and students - are extremely driven and intelligent, which can be both intellectually challenging and intimidating. Also, the campus is absolutely gorgeous and a perfect setting to learn and live. Overall, if you're uncomfortable with a campus entrenched in current national and global issues, the atmosphere might not be for you -- but the thing I love about Smithies is their dedication to both acing their classes and saving the world."
College Freshman,4,"I'm a little boy crazy, so that's the only struggle about going to Smith."
College Sophomore,4,"Smith is definitely not the school for everyone. Just because it's a women's college, that's already something many people would not even consider/would thrive in. The social experience varies widely, especially depending on where you live on campus. Your location on campus can determine whether you are drinking and partying every weekend or studying or watching Netflix by yourself. House community is also very important for many, but there are enough people who don't care for it much. I've made most if not all of my friends through my house community, which can seem a bit limiting but I think residence life usually does a good job each year with picking compatible people. If social life is a deterrent to attending Smith, academics by far outweighs it. We have amazing professors in almost all departments who truly care about the students and the material. With the small class size, you get to really know your professors and classmates which can be great. Oftentimes I find myself even waving hello in passing to people from my class even if we don't talk much because Smith is that small and close knit."
College Freshman,4,"Wide variety of delicious off campus dining options, however, most places close before 10pm."
College Freshman,4,Smith offered me the most money out of all of the schools I applied to.
College Freshman,4,"Great variety of restaurants. They can be expensive, bit it's worth it."
College Freshman,4,"They are extremely generous with financial aid. Lots of funds for textbooks and other miscellaneous expenses, just ask!"
College Freshman,4,"I heard the Friedman's are alright, they are building a new wing of them close to the Quad."
College Freshman,4,"People know what they can and cannot do and how to act. For me, I think it's great that you can have guests. You will never see teachers yelling at you for not coming to class but the honor code is taken seriously. There is an entire board that will not tolerate that type of behavior. I do not participate in drinking, but there is some, but not too much."
College Freshman,4,You can get as much as you want. You can bring friends and family and there is no limit.
College Freshman,4,Local Burgers is the best!
College Freshman,4,You can find something to eat in any of the dining halls- and I think the food is a 3.5/5 most of the time.

Sophomore,2,"Smith is a very unique place. So many wonderful people thrive there, but it just wasn't right for me. I am really happy to have experienced going to school there, but it isn't the right place for everyone. Visit and sleepover if you have the opportunity to see what it is really like, go in the winter when it' coldest to have a true smithie experince."
Junior,2,"Smith provides that quintessential college experience: the ivy league aesthetic, beautiful landscaping and brick buildings. But its not worth the money. In terms of supporting its student financially and providing job placement, Smith ranks pretty low."
College Sophomore,2,"The Smith party scene is virtually nonexistent except for Convocation night. Luckily there are great options for going out dancing in town -- Diva's, Pearl Street Nightclub latin night, Iron Horse, and so on. And to be honest, who wants to go to a college party anyway? Go dancing, it's way better!"
College Freshman,2,Overall food is bland and not a lot of meat eater options
College Freshman,2,"Smith ""parties"" are pathetic excuses for awkward white girls to ""dance"" -- this means flailing around until they bump into someone to inevitably make-out with."
College Sophomore,2,"Pricey, limited in options, plus Smith residential life only allows seniors to live off-campus, and you have to apply for permission."
College Sophomore,2,"Basically if you're not an athlete participating in a school sport, you'll almost never hear of anything going on in the athletics department."
College Sophomore,2,"Our parties are pretty regulated, which means: no alcohol, low-set dancefloor person capacity, long lines. There are usually random UMass guys who show up expecting to have Smithies swarm over them."
College Junior,2,"People generally go elsewhere for parties. Ours tend to be small and rather awkward since most of the people there already know each other, except for the random guys from town who lurk by the walls and watch the girls make out. The best parties are small gatherings of 4-10 friends in someone's room with a CD player and maybe a bottle of wine. ResLife is usually pretty relaxed (or at least ignorant) about those kinds of parties, even if there is underage drinking going on, because they rarely get out of control."
College Freshman,2,"House sponsored parties are usually pretty lame, I don't know why people get so excited about them."
College Freshman,2,"It's wonderful if you are lesbian, since you'll have a lot of dating options. However, it is not so good for straight people. There are barely guys on campus. It is quite hard to find guys on campus. A lot of people use Tinder and OkCupid; however, there are lots of freaks on it. Students here looks good, we don't really have a dress code."
College Junior,2,"Depends on the dean of your class and your RA's. It could be a hit or miss. A lot of the deans are not helpful at all and rude, but where I find the most help is in a different building where there are people who genuinely care about the well being of a student and will help you with other things and also put a word into the dean so the dean will be more helpful/nicer."
College Junior,2,"No one seems to care about any of the sports. You will barely see any students at any of the games. About 10 people, at most, will be at a game."
College Sophomore,2,"The school generally tries to prevent students from moving off-campus, for obvious tuition reasons. It is cheaper than living on campus and more convenient in reaching the downtown area generally. Also, because it isn't popular, finding friends to share rent can be difficult."
College Junior,2,"Living in Northampton is ridiculously over priced.  If you're dying to get off campus, check out Easthampton (though you will need a car)."
College Junior,2,"My major is a nightmare! Do not come to Smith if you are going to major in Math&Stats! 

The most important criteria for admission I guess is high school GPA and personal statement. For international students, you should also have good SAT/ACT scores and TOFEL."
College Junior,2,"As I said, the math department is horrible. Professors are constantly changing and most of them do not know what they are teaching. Even though, almost all of the professors at Math department are extremely knowledgable, they seem lack skills of teaching."
College Junior,2,I REALLY HATE THE COLDE WEATHER HERE!!! The only good thing about storms and snows is that courses can get cancelled (even though sometimes you have to go to classes even there is snow storms).
College Junior,2,"The math department at Smith is HORRIBLE! A lot of great professors have left and now we are having those temporary lecturers, who come and go often. There are not a lot of resources and projects in the department. However, Smith does offer a variety of math courses but usually the lecturers/professors of the course will make your life miserable. 

Smith does have really good departments such as Computer Science, Biology, Engineering, Government, Art History and many others. But math department really needs some improvement!!!"
College Junior,2,"Not so many students are actually permitted to live off-campus (Not Allowed for Freshman). Once you become a sophomore, you can apply to live off-campus but the process will be LONG AND FRUSTRATING! However, if you are lucky enough to get the permission and able to find a house than life becomes much better."
College Junior,2,"Smith does have really good fitness facilities. It also provides students a lot of fitness classes for academic credits. However, some instructors are actually not as good as you would expect but a few of them are awesome! Team sports are not very popular but we do have them. Because the academic work load is quite crazy here so it will be very difficult to be in a sport team."
College Junior,2,"Smith College strongly encourages all students to live on campus. The housing community is very close and has a lot of positives, and the dining hall program is excellent. It can be frustrating if you enjoy making your own food, but other than that, living on campus is lovely. One of the first questions that alumnae will ask you, before even asking your major, is ""What house did you live in?"" It's a big part of the community."
College Junior,2,"I come from a sunny place so coming to the east coast was a big ""weather shock"". I am still not used to this weather. Is always cold and gloomy. The weather really affects my attitude."
College Junior,2,In getting funding in ethnic organizations has been a struggle this semester.
College Junior,2,There is camping that the school is diverse but once you are here you can tell that it really isn't.
College Junior,2,"Its okay but when you are a person of color, there is a lack of support and feeling comfortable or even belonging."
College Freshman,2,"You have to request to live off campus, and then you have to pay for all your own meals and housing, so it may be more difficult than just staying on campus with dining hall access."
College Sophomore,2,People are involved but no one cares or pays attention.
College Sophomore,2,"The college is part of a consortium of 4 other colleges that are all within a half hour away. Lots of weird new age activities in town. Not much going on in the area though if you are acclimated to city life. No big concerts or events, just restaurants and shops downtown is really all there is."
College Sophomore,2,Freezing from November-March. First and last 6 weeks of school are pretty pleasant.
College Sophomore,2,"This school is suuuuuper strict. Smith party= you have to wait in a line, sign in with your college ID and write down what time you signed in, get a wristband, all the while campus police stare you down to see if you look suspicious or intoxicated. Police are all over campus and additionally, every house basically has student police called ""House Residents"" who crack down on underage drinking and smoking weed in the house.."
College Freshman,2,The weather is cold and rainy then cold and snowy 
College Sophomore,2,"Smith is a very unique college that is great for some and not for others. The major reason why I have chosen to transfer from Smith, despite its great academics, location, and facilities, stems from the fact that it is an all woman's college. When I applied I thought this meant I only had to get used to having no male friends, which I adapted to well. Once on campus, I didn't even notice it. However, what proved to be the biggest struggle was the very strong feminist vibe. Socially, it is impossible to avoid, and a lot of times my opinions weren't listened to because ""I am straight and I don't have the experience of being a minority"" even if I was agreeing with someone else. The entire time I was worried about stepping on peoples' toes. I also wanted to focus on other global topics like infectious diseases and the availability of clean water, which of course is discussed but conversation both socially AND academically (which disappointed me greatly) always seemed to fall back to women rights. Overall, I felt unaccepted at Smith for wanting to focus on different global issues, shunned and ignored if my opinions about women rights (or sexuality) were different, and claustrophobic and overwhelmed by the constant hiding and running I did every day to get away from this part of my Smith experience."
College Sophomore,2,"Northampton is expensive. Working to independently pay for that, and being a full time student would be near impossible."
College Freshman,2,"When it's cold, it's really fricken cold, but when it's nice it's lovely. Classes don't really get cancelled because if weather, they almost never do."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you are not careful and get caught underage drinking, the College will take action and put it on your record."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The weather grading gets a C because it's the avg of all the weather I experienced. some days its horrible--I won't lie. It's freezing and snowy or windy and class is scheduled to continue as normal. Though, in the late spring and early fall, the weather can be absolutely beautiful. The fall foliage is to die for."
College Senior,2,"Kind of a Pain – It's hard to get off campus housing at Smith -- they ""require"" you to live on campus for all 4 years and some people go to extremes to get off campus approval.  The actual town of Northampton is okay -- rents range from reasonable to ridiculous, but you can definitely find a place if you put your mind to it.  C- for the annoyance that Smith plays in the process."
College Freshman,2,The athletics department isn't exactly the most visible force on campus but everyone still knows it's there. Our athletic facilities are amazing though. Our gym is designed for women. <3
Senior,1,"To all future high schoolers considering Smith: please, please, think twice. Unless you're extremely wealthy, this place will ruin you financially for the rest of your life. I am a rising senior, and tuition has already gone up by almost $10,000 since my freshman year. They say they meet ""100%"" of need, but the majority of their ""aid packages"" are just loans. I am going to be around $100,000 in debt by the time I graduate. The classes are okay, but they're not worth this ticket price. Nothing is worth this ticket price. Please, save yourself. Don't be like me. Go somewhere else."
Alum,1,"It was the worst experience of my life. I have only one regret in my 65 years, and that was thinking that I could shape an education about theatre around my dreams at this institution. I still occasionally have nightmares about this place."
Freshman,1,"Like many from my class, I transferred after my freshman year. Smith was miserable. There was an extreme lack of social life - apart from a capella and sports teams, most clubs seemed generally inactive, campus police shuts down any parties. I lived in the quad, but it was silent on the weekends. Most people were quiet, dramatic, and/or cold. Academics were no better. Most of my classes were seminar-discussion based, and no one spoke. It depends house to house, but mine was poorly maintained. Chapin had windows blow into rooms. It seems like all funds are going towards the new library. The food started out okay and became nearly inedible. There were countless accounts of uncooked chicken, salad bar food poisoning, etc. Due to the incident last summer (and others), there is extreme racial tension on campus, as well as tension between administration and students. My advisor could have cared less about me, and the class dean was cruel when I met with her about transferring."
Alum,1,"My two years at Smith were not good. I was so excited to attend Smith and be in an environment with students who were impassioned to learn and also had an accepting view of all. This is not the case. Smith has an anonymous online confessional that is a source of bullying and hatred. People are targeted for EVERYTHING. I have never met such hateful, rude, judgemental people in my life. Professors are hit or miss. Some are great and some are just downright miserable and seem to hate their job and their students. The administration is clueless and doesn't seem to care about what students need and ask for. Houses are rundown with peeling wallpaper and no air conditioning. I ended up transferring out and it was the best choice I've ever made."
College Sophomore,1,"I really, truly abhor the food options -- but I'm a little biased because I live in the house with the blandest of dining rooms, Tyler. I wish it were easier to cook on campus."
College Junior,1,"The party scene is awful. There is nothing to do on campus unless you want to go to a ""house party"" that has about 5 cops, you wait outside freezing, no matter how drunk you are, and sometimes you don't even get let in until the very end. It all depends on how many people actually leave the party. The house parties are basically really drunk people with people looking to hook up and very creepy guys. 

If you want to ""party"" you'll be drinking in someones room just talking. If you're looking to play card games, beer pong, have rages you won't. The party scene is the worst! That's why I am transferring to a bigger school that actually has somewhat/has a party scene."
College Junior,1,Coming from a big city it is still hard to live in such a small town. There isn't much to do in Northampton because places close around 7 pm.
College Sophomore,1,"You have to enter a lottery to live off-campus since Smith likes to keep all of its students on campus. Which sucks, because living off-campus cuts about $7000 off of your semester bill and there is abundant housing nearby. They let a very small number of seniors live off-campus if they have good reason. "
College Sophomore,1,"Completely academic focus and really no social life. People are cold, miserable-looking--rare to see people smiling or laughing. Most conversations are academically focused. Parties are really really bad. The school does not sponsor events for students such as concerts or dances or anything."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't live off campus. Almost nobody does because it is super expensive, places are hard to find, and you are guaranteed 4 years of on-campus housing anyways."
College Freshman,1,"Not Great – Not many local bars or clubs in the area. Parties on campus are not wonderful, either. Luckily other colleges are nearby, but the public transportation makes it more difficult to go to them."
College Freshman,1,Poor parking is always going to be a downside to living in a larger city like Northampton. Parking tickets can be a hassle. Good luck even winning a permit in the lottery.
College Freshman,1,"Overpriced and overrated. I've never understood what the big fuss over Northampton was. If you like to party and shop, I guess it can be okay. But if your interests are outside of those boundaries, be prepared to venture to another town to be entertained."
College Freshman,1,You can't live off campus until you're in your junior or senior year (I can't recall which). Smith tries to keep you on their campus all the time so they can get your money.
College Junior,1,"Campus parking is horrendous.  Public safety is ticket happy despite having less than ample parking availability.  Even with a parking sticker, parking can be difficult."
College Freshman,1,"Off Campus Is Practically Impossible – There is little to no off-campus living options for students, and on top of that, only a select number of seniors (selected by lottery) are allowed to live off-campus. The Friedman Apartments are suite-style apartments and are the closest thing to independent living available for the majority of students. The housing available in Northampton is limited as well, because the area is pretty wealthy and historic."
College Senior,1,"Too Many Tickets – There aren't enough spots for all the student parking stickers they give out, unless you want to park a mile from campus. And if you dare park in one of the white-lined spaces, be prepared for a parking ticket within 30 minutes that requests your check to kindly be sent to the ""Smith Scholarship Fund"" (they need money from somewhere). Luckily, most students don't leave the Northampton bubble, so a car isn't necessary."
College Freshman,1,"Yeah....About That. Smith dining is very traditional. You sit down and eat in a dining room three times a day and eat whatever they decide to serve you. You're at the mercy of the menu and there ARE NO STAPLE FOODS (except maybe the salad bar). Terrifying? It can be. You can pretty much guarantee anything mom makes will be half the quality at Smith. Convenience-wise, it just gets more depressing: Meals are served during the time slots of 7-9:30 a.m., 11 a.m.-12:30 p.m., and 5:30-7 p.m. I'm sorry, were you hungry at 3:30 and ready for a little mid-afternoon pick-me-up? Well, too bad, buddy. You should have thought of that before you DIGESTED YOUR LUNCH."
College Junior,1,"Nope, Nada, Never - Don't Even Try – This DOES NOT HAPPEN at Smith. Smith WILL NOT let you live off campus. Seriously. You're required to live at Smith until at least sophomore year, and then afterward it's almost impossible to leave. You don't have a chance."
College Sophomore,1,"You can pay to have access to a limited number of ill-defined Smith College parking spots outlined in green or to have access to a parking garage that is exclusive to Smith personnel and students but is really far away from anything else on campus. Or you can park for free on residential streets, but you have to be super careful not to make homeowners irate because they will not hesitate to have your vehicle towed."

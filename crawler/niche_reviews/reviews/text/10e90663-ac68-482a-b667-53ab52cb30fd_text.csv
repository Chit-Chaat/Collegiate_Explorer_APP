Freshman,5,They have been very helpful and hands-on withe the enrollment process. They have easy to talk to staff and teachers.
Sophomore,5,I love the teachers and the expertise they bring with them from industry. The project based learning is amazing and fast paced so you dont have a chance to get bored of the classes.
Freshman,5,There is a lot more practical use of the projects and classes done. More real life like work than just simple theory and what ifs.
Alum,5,Neumont is a fast paced school. The school approaches teaching a little different but better prepares you for industry after graduation.
Freshman,5,I lover every thing and nothing needs to change. I mean you can take billiards as you gym class. Oh and there are no sport teams so there is no stress of being told you should join.
College Sophomore,5,"Neumont is great school full of hardworking students, the workload is high but i have we all have a great time. student housing is located near campus and there is always someone there to help you with anything you need. most registration documents are done completely electonicaly and sent through email, no hassle with paperwork"
College Junior,5,"The post-grad service are the biggest thing that makes Neumont so worth the money. In the last few years of graduation, all of the students have had real jobs within six months. On average, the pay is about $62,000 per year, around what somebody who's been in industry for a few years would make. The majority of students have multiple job offers before they even graduate. This is due to the awesome career services. Career services keeps in touch with many companies to stay up to date on what skills they would like in computer science graduates and ensure that we learn those skills throughout our time at school. We also have three ""Enterprise Projects"", which are essentially unpaid internships required to graduate."
College Junior,5,"First off, in the last eight years the tuition has only been raised once, and that was by $300. There also aren't any unexplained or exorbitant fees. As a for-profit institution, they are exceptionally honest and straightforward. They also do their best to work with students. Also, they will match any outside scholarship for up to $5,000."
College Senior,5,One of the more comprehensive career services as you seem them in the building everyday and during your last 2 quarters you are constantly talking with them.
College Sophomore,5,You learn lots in just a day.
College Sophomore,5,Everything involving technology is beyond excellent at this University! Everything is up to date and exactly how you need it to be to be efficient. You can't be working on older technology so everything is at its newest point. The laptops that are given to you are also top of the line and are very expendable for anything you want to do with them.
College Sophomore,5,"Neumont University is a computer-degree-only school: they have degrees for Computer Science, Web Development, Game Design, and other various computer-related degrees. I've been going to this school for two quarters now and the school is a computer heaven: internet is fast, printing is sound, networks are always up and working, and you're required to get a school- provided computer. The entire school is a computer lab."
College Senior,5,"Everything You Need to Know â€“ The campus is great. It's a small two floor business building, and you have as much personal communication with your professor's as you need. The tutor's know exactly what they're talking about at all times, and don't just give you answers, they help guide you to the information you need to know. The apartments we live at are wonderful, and have great views of the mountains. Full living room and kitchen, 1 master bedroom and 1 regular room, which you will share with three other people. Also 1 master and regular bathroom. If you're bored on the weekends there's always something to do. Depending on your classes the sizes run from 15-30."
College Freshman,5,Very hands on and well taught by people who used to be top notch in their field.
College Freshman,5,"A lot of nice people that just want to help you out with your next programming problem. If your having trouble, just head to the lounge and ask if you can get some help and you'll have more than a few willing people."
College Freshman,5,"Best college around in my eyes, I'm a programming major and wish to get into the game design area of the career and this college show me how to do just that."
College Junior,5,"It was the easy process, our Financial Aid adviser was there all the time helping us with any concerns or misunderstandings."
College Junior,5,"One word, MAGNIFICENT! High standard, latest technology surrounded campus"
College Junior,5,"There are couple 30+ students, majority of students are around 18-23 years old. We have small female populations, because it seems like females have less intentions to study in technology field."
College Junior,5,"In our campus we have everything ready for the students. Since it's a technology based school, you feel no problem with any technical issues. We have I.T department open at anytime. It is just perfect campus, that anybody can dream about."
Junior,4,"The online classes are amazing, Though the school has a low amount of online courses, the ones that they have are a breeze."
Junior,4,"Neumont is a very focused school. If you are not serious, you will be swept away with how much work you need to put in. However, you do earn a degree in less time and you are going to learn how to solve things by yourself. There isn't someone there that is going to hold your hand."
Freshman,4,"Just starting out
Everything is great, so exited to start here, professors are great in the few classes I have joined.
Students are helpful and friendly.
Difficult workload but worth every penny"
Niche User,4,Neumont is a new and reliable school. They provide you the opportunity to experience all of their degrees and what they have to offer.
Senior,4,"The educational experience we have as students is extremely valuable. Not only do we get hands on experience with the material, but we also get industry experience during our last year due to our Enterprise Projects."
Alum,4,"If you can avoid getting sucked into the young crowd focused on video games, Neumont can be a great choice. If you own your education during your tenure, it doesn't take much to come out at the top of your class."
Sophomore,4,"The school is a fast paced learning environment. I know students that have gone to other schools for computer science and they learned less in one semester of Intro to Computer Science there than five weeks at Neumont. And while you can get a job with a community college degree, Neumont's education on its own gives you three internships and a better preparation to enter the cs industry with a much better skill set than most other colleges. If you can stand the workload and challenge, Neumont is a great college to attend. There are a plethora of clubs that you can get involved in and get to know people with. The school is evolving and growing with the industry. The teachers are great and know what they're teaching, and are available to help you. The housing is the weakest point about the school. The options will either have low storage space, bad internet, or subpar utilities. Students do get a pass which allows you to use the public transportation for free."
College Junior,4,The people in this department are really nice and helpful.
College Junior,4,"There is a huge demand for developers right now, so there are tons of job opportunities.  But I'm pretty sure you would have the same job opportunities if you attend any four year school that has a Computer Science major.  I wish I had gone to my local state college and spent a fraction of the money."
College Sophomore,4,"We don't have any gym or library but we have a ton of student staff and normal staff on hand for tutoring and help almost any hour of the day. We get a free membership to a gym down the street if we live in the tower and their is a public library not too far from here, maybe about 10 ish minutes."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are a lot of acitivities offered by the students and by the school (camping, board game nights, movie nights, etc)."
Recent Alumnus,4,As a computer science major I'm required to complete a lot of homework and a lot of my knowledge has come from outside sources. The workload is huge but there is a great payoff at the end. I often feel not smart enough to be here as there are some insanely smart students. We start programming day one and I think that's a very unique aspect of my school
College Sophomore,4,Things are fast but they are efficient and their system is the best that I've seen for what they guarantee.
College Sophomore,4,"It is very open and free, it does not feel like a traditional University. It is in the center of downtown so everything Utah has to offer can be available to you very quickly. They are very friendly and accurate with everything that you learn. Not only that the students and the teachers and faculty are more than just colleagues, they are friends and beyond acquaintances."
College Sophomore,4,"Things are fast and efficient, they are difficult but that's what Neumont does. They work the fastest possible to get you to graduate as soon as possible.

You have your own personal finance team, your own tutors and the professors will make time to help you out when you need it. It is free and open and it does not feel like a University at all!
Everything and everyone is there for you, everyone is in it together to help you get through your education!"
College Sophomore,4,"I was very pleased with the way everything was presented by the financial aid office. Not only was all information was straightforward and upfront, but any time there were additional funds available or another way to benefit me, my financial aid officer called me personally and gave me all of the information and answered all of my questions."
College Sophomore,4,"The student body is not very diverse because its a very specific field of study. needless to say there is no nightlife associated with the school aside from lan parties and playing games all night (when there is time, which is not often because of the work load). the student advocates and faculty are easily the best i've ever seen in my life, you get people here who really care about you and your future. the job opportunities from going to this school and enormous because it is a very prestigious school in the industry since it is all project based and we get to work hand and hand with industry leaders through a series of enterprise projects where we are basically interns for the top companies and for smaller companies. overall this school is amazing but it is not for the undedicated. this school comes with a nice big tuition of 30k per academic year but you get your degree in only 2.5 years because it is an advanced learning degree."
College Junior,4,"This school makes it hard for you to simply give up.  Even though its tough, the faculty works hard to keep you involved.  The school tries to challenge you and teach you not only course material but how to look at problems in your work from different angles.  Registration in most cases is automatic because you have a dedicated person working with you to make sure your degree plan is on track and up to date if something needs to get moved around.  I felt the honest effort of all my teachers to know and understand the students.  It was a great help when the teacher was able to recognize topics students struggled on and spend more time on those topics and less time on easy topics.  I have found out that those students who struggle are those who believe it is still high school and do not grow new habbits of learning or those who do not put school anywhere in their top ten list of things to do throughout the week."
College Junior,4,"The school is expensive and you spend money getting a specific computer through their programs.  This is what keeps me from giving an A+.  However, the school is only two and half years long and compared to a similar four year degree somewhere else you come out on top financially.  This school is not easy and the workload can pile up quickly if you are not prioritizing.  I was trained as a Nuclear Power Operator in the Navy and this school shares similarities in the learning process that I feel make this a top notch school.  The school is small overall because they only teach computer science related material and next year will be moving to downtown Salt Lake City.  If you want a career in computer science this has to be the place.  Internships?  This school makes those seem outdated.  As part of the programs at Neumont you work with real companies on real life projects where you get to see your creation be used in the real world.  They call these Enterprise Projects and you work on them your last three quarters (10 quarters total).  Talk about networking and real life experience while still in school.  Itâ€™s part of the education and to me; the biggest asset to what will get my career going quickly."
College Junior,4,"Classes Are a Hands on Learning Experience â€“ The workload is intense and rigorous. It's completely worth it though, right from the get go you continuously learn something new everyday and feel like your getting your moneys worth. We have a 95% work placement with salaries averaging at $65 thousand dollars a year."
Junior,2,"I have been attending Neumont for the past two years and i'm about to graduate. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO GO HERE UNLESS YOU NEED A QUICK
 U N D E R G R A D  DEGREE AND ARE A UTAH RESIDENT. As a Utah resident living at home I spent 19K for all three years. DO NOT LET THE SCHOOL SUCK YOU INTO GETTING A LOAN FOR LIVING ON CAMPUS. I have friends who are graduating with 120K in debt. The college has a lot of VERY LEFT leaning professors and students, If you say anything someone is guaranteed  to get Triggered and it's awful. The education is very good, but you can learn any of this in an hour online and get a verified certificate. You would be better off working at a company and work your way up with certificates than go here. I would leave but I already invested quite a bit. The area is also dangerous knowing that all the protests happen on the street behind the school leading to the capital. To sum it up, This is a glorified coding camp."
Junior,2,I do not recommend this college for anyone who wants a serious education in software and game development. I'm a second-year student and I've barely learned anything about how to make games. The teachers are hired with little experience on what they are teaching and it shows. If you want to learn anything you need to research it yourself and that's how you learn.
College Junior,2,"Anyone that has a Computer Science degree will get a job in today's economy, regardless of what school they attend. Real colleges/universities have better-developed career service departments. At Neumont its just like one guy that helps students look for jobs, but he has to teach classes most of the time so he's never available. What a joke."
College Junior,2,"Tech classes I took at my community college were better and harder. The professors at Neumont seem very disengaged with the students and don't seem to care. The facility is small, not enough classrooms."
College Junior,2,Workload is really high and stressfull.  I really don't like how much Neumont uses part-time faculty for almost everything. I'm in the Information Systems program and I feel like I learned more at my high school tech program.
College Junior,2,"Before coming to the school they really talked up the experience of the faculty. When it came to actually taking classes, most of the instructors are part-time and don't really know how to teach. A few of the full time instructors are super good, but I only got to take them for a few of my classes.  The majority of my classes were taught by part-timers that have no connection to the school and they act like they couldn't care less about the students."
College Junior,2,"The faculty are easy and pleasant to work with, however, due to the nature of the expedited program and the small student body (resulting in only one or one of a specific class at a time) my schedule revolves around class times."
College Senior,2,For the most part unless you want to spend longer than 10 quarters here you move your life around the schedule.
Freshman,1,"Just terrible.  Sad, but true.  They are clearly only interested in profit and do not compare to schools which teach CS for the sake of education."
Freshman,1,"Simply terrible.  Some nice people, but a total scam college.  Profit drives everything and everyone"
Niche User,1,"Seems like when my son started attending, they had it together.  Since then, all of his favorite instructors are gone and the leadership clearly is only interested in making money from students who are not qualified to attend.  Very expensive lesson for our family.  I do not recommend this college."
Freshman,1,"Been here for a year and not very happy with it.  Classes are really easy, and most of the other students don't know what they're doing. Like they've never used a computer before."
Niche User,1,"Instructor credentials: Most instructors I had there were temporary or imported from somewhere else. I had two instructors that were employees from the University of Utah. As for the permanent instructors, you can find all of their credentials on the Neumont website. The instructors are just that, they instruct you. They are not professors and are not academics. They are people who have worked and decided to teach on the side. I later find out that some of the teachers' education does not match what they are teaching. My business and information systems instructor has a bachelors in microbiology and an MBA from Western Governors University, an online college program that has a center in Salt Lake. One instructor has a bachelors and masters in business yet teaches about servers. Three other instructors have never studied anywhere except for Neumont.

It also doesn't help that the accreditation firm that the school uses has just been removed from the Department of Education's roster."
College Junior,1,"Anyone with a Computer Science degree can get a job pretty easily, it doesn't really matter which school you go to. Neumont career services is a joke. It's like one guy that also teaches classes so he's not always available to help students. Employers that come to campus are mostly smaller local companies, not the big tech companies you would expect."
College Junior,1,"Since they only have one degree, they don't have much variety in classes. Don't expect anything unique."
College Junior,1,"Career services is lame, it's just one guy and he spends most of his time teaching classes. I guess they figure anyone with a Computer Science degree can get a job, so why spend time trying to help them. They have career week, but most of the companies that come to campus are small local businesses. None of the big tech companies come, which is a bummer."
College Junior,1,"Professors are really disengaged and seem overworked. Lots of the professors are part-time/temporary teachers that work for Neumont as a side-gig (they already work full time at other bigger schools). Overall, the professors just don't care that much, but I've had a few really good ones."
College Junior,1,"Neumont isn't at all what I expected. It's really just a career college for people that couldn't get into a real university. I don't know how they can put ""university"" in their name and only offer one type of bachelors degree that isn't even recognized by most other schools. Now they're doing cheesy ""boot camps"" for career-changers. Doesn't feel like a real college."
College Junior,1,"Poor instruction by mostly part-time faculty that don't care about the students. When I met with the guy in charge of all the teachers he didn't really listen to my concerns and told me that I just needed to work harder. I really like the project based learning, but the school lacks a lot of hands-on tech gear. Their marketing talks a ton about how immersive the school is with tech, but it really falls short in reality."
College Junior,1,"I want to transfer to a different school that is less expensive, but my Neumont credits won't transfer to the state college I want to attend. So frustrating! The Neumont student service staff is really nice about it and understand my anger, but they can't do anything about it. It's just the way they designed the school.  I wish I knew this ahead of time."
College Junior,1,Don't Expect Many Women â€“ Less than 10% of the student population are women. It's also very diverse as many people from different places attend this school.

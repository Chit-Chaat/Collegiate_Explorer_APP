Sophomore,5,"Northern Arizona University a very accepting and fun college. With plenty of clubs and intermural sports for students to get involved. Plenty of career paths and degrees to choose from. They also have an assortment of masters degrees for people that are interested. A beautiful city for the campus to be located with plenty of trees, snow, hiking, and skiing/snowboarding."
Freshman,5,It is a very good school. The campus is so pretty and awesome and so are the meals if you choose to dorm and get a meal plan the first year. Plenty of activities to choose from including mountain winter sports in the winter and so much more.
Freshman,5,It is really accommodating. Teachers are very understanding and a it is well laid out and organized so nothing is to confusing.
Junior,5,the classes online are a lot easier if you know how to be independant and responsible. you need to work towaeds your degree and not expect anyone to do it for you. The professors are really good and I love the anthropology program
Junior,5,Online learning experience so far I prefer over going to classes. They are well organized and I can work ahead if I want. Being at both schools this is a plus because If I could not get ahead it would make nursing school tough! I love this nursing program option they offer and I hope to spread the word to many others because this is such a great opportunity.
Junior,5,I am concurrently enrolled in a nursing program at Pima Community college with NAU. NAU has been great so far with the two semesters I have attended online remotely. The nursing staff that teaches these classes are very knowledgeable and willing to help in any way they can.They want you to succeed and this is enlightening!
Junior,5,"The Personalized Learning program interface is complex, yet easy to understand and navigate. It's the best online learning platform I've experienced in many years of school."
Junior,5,My application and enrollment process in the Personalized Learning program has been seamless and easy. Every representative of the university has been personable and knowledgeable and I have not run into any snags. I'm super-excited to start classes!!
Graduate Student,5,"My online classes were very easy to work with. Quizzes each week were easy to access. Even though they were online, I was able to interact with the other students and the professor very well within the structure. You are not missing anything when you take online classes. You stay involved which is great."
Graduate Student,5,"Great staff, great location, and beautiful town. I enjoyed being able to do field studies all around northern Arizona including the Grand Canyon."
Senior,5,"Not a student, but a proud parent of an NAU student.  My son really likes NAU.  Lately I’ve been reading that NAU is not working with  refunding their students for housing lease cancellation.  If the student won’t be living on campus and will be taking online classes they should get all their money back."
Senior,5,"My son is a senior at NAU and he really likes it, but lately I’ve been reading that NAU is not refunding housing leases when students won’t be leaving there. That’s very wrong and not cool. NAU need to be fair with everything and everyone.  Please be nice you your student and they will comeback."
Freshman,5,"Ii have not stepped foot on campus yet but they have many measurements taken to ensure the safety of students, staff, and visitors."
Junior,5,"I am in the midst of earning my online bachelors degree with NAU. So far, the professors have been accommodating, easy to get a hold of, and are extremely knowledgable in their craft. I truly feel like I am learning core concepts within my field of study and building a strong foundation for the rest of my academic career. The online programs at NAU are easy to navigate and perfect for someone who is also working full-time."
Junior,5,"Northern Arizona is a great 4 year college. They offer a variety of majors and degree programs, both on campus as well as online. You can tell the professors are passionate about what they teach, and are very encouraging. Even the advising team is helpful, knowledgable, and easy to talk to! The tuition is far less than a lot of other colleges, but do not let the cheaper tuition fool you- you are still receiving an amazing education that will prepare you for your future."
Junior,5,"The greatest thing about Northern Arizona University is the beautiful campus and welcoming community of  Flagstaff.  NAU has some of the kindest, friendly, and most helpful professors that I've met. I would recommend NAU to anyone who was considering it because of all the amazing features it has."
Niche User,5,"I loved the diversity in the University. The students are very close to each other like a family, the community is like a little town and everyone knows everyone on campus. The professors are amazing and not only care about the students education but also their mental health and life outside of college."
Niche User,5,"I did not take online learning, however, I did do research on those who have done online at Northern Arizona University. A lot of students loved their professors because they are very understanding and caring, not just about the education but for the students themselves."
Senior,5,"The overall experience of going to college in a smaller mountain town that revolves around the campus was an amazing experience. The students, professors, and residents are very down to earth. There are a lot of outdoor activities to be associated with along living a very active lifestyle if that is the kind of experience you would like to be associated with. Snowboarding, hiking, sports, you name it. The education is top tier, and being in one of the best Construction Management programs in the nation has shown and payed off. However, upper management of the school is lacking, as fees and costs always rise every year, and a lot of the fees have no description or reason behind them. There is some bad politics revolving around the president of Northern Arizona University, and it is becoming more scandal to get money from students every year. The Lumberjack scholarship is a huge help if you can earn it prior to starting at NAU as it is a tuition waver for four years."
Senior,5,"I am in the Construction Management program, and was a biology student for 3 semesters. 95 percent of the instructors i have had were amazing individuals who truly care about the development and well being of all their students. There always is that sour apple that tends to be selfish and power hungry just like any school or education system. I have taken a majority of my classes in person but i do take about 1 class a semester online if it works better for my schedule. The instruction schedule is easy to follow and universal for the whole campus so creating a schedule."
Senior,5,The classes are easy to follow and you can learn at your own pace even though you have weekly deadlines to meet.  The interaction with the professors is exceptional.  If you have a question they will respond no later than the next day.
Senior,5,I love how diverse the campus is and the people in Flagstaff are very friendly.  I am most happy about the online classes. I like how I do not have to be physically on the campus to complete my degree.
Senior,5,Very welcoming campus with friendly professors and other staff members. School located in the woods is the best part. Beautiful campus.
Senior,5,Great online experience. Very interactive courses with great structure. Any issue was resolved within a few hours and the staff was extremely helpful.
Sophomore,5,"At Northern Arizona University, you'll find opportunity in every direction—‭all in a ‬‭beautiful, four-season mountain setting that breaks Arizona's desert stereotype and ranks among the nation's best ‭college towns.‬‬ Discover a comprehensive range of majors with many nationally ranked programs taught by professors who recognize potential and will help you realize yours. Students can work alongside skilled faculty and mentors who believe that providing abundant undergraduate research opportunities instills the real-life experiences needed to thrive academically and professionally."
Senior,5,The teachers have been helpful with any questions. Material has always been made clear. Communication with staff has been easy. Counselor has been fast to answer any questions I have had.
Senior,5,BBL is easy to use. Material is clearly listed and easy to find. Expectations are made known. Get yourself a planner in order to keep track of due dates. BBL usually will send out reminders along with the teacher about assignments being due to make sure you don't forget.
Freshman,5,"Very nice people. Excellent dorm. Freshman year, people were very open and helpful. The food on campus was quite good 10/10"
Junior,5,I love Northern Arizona university. Flagstaff is a beautiful city and I love the vibe. The professors are great!
Niche User,5,"I personally haven't experienced it for myself but from what others have told me, it seems very nice!"
Niche User,5,It's a beautiful campus. Many of my friends' parents have gone there and went on to get highly fulfilling jobs. I've been on several tours there and there are plenty of options for me to chose from. I look forward to attending school there.
Freshman,5,"The campus is great as well as the staff and students to guide you.  Once you step onto campus it feels like you have a home where you belong.  The area around Flagstaff is such a college town.  Not too big and not too small, with so many activities to do off campus."
Sophomore,5,"I really love the location, classes, and general environment cultivated at NAU. My first year was amazing and I'm proud to be a Lumberjack.  Despite some administrative issues, including the poor and often late responses to COVID-19, I am glad to be earning my degree at an institution that offers good professor-student relationships and connections as well as other great opportunities."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, it is the perfect size and a great option for Arizonians who want to escape the heat without breaking the bank."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the fact that NAU focuses a lot on environmental sustainability. I have seen how much they try to use more materials that recyclable. I have seen such things in the NAU dining places. I also love how many programs there are for Native Americans, it makes things a little easier.  If there is one thing I could change, it would be the amount of scholarships and programs they offer for my major, which is, Journalism."
Freshman,5,"Overall very interesting and diverse school. Northern Arizona had caught my eye when various people had discussed the exciting student life, which was at the time my main priority. Turns out the school did have student life and was very welcoming."
Freshman,5,Arizona was very informative despite the current situation of corona. Also was very good at keeping in contact and updating students.
Senior,5,Personally for me it been good so far. I took some public health classes online and all my instructors have been understanding
Junior,5,"I enjoyed the online classes that I have taken during my time at NAU. I enjoyed the layouts, such as the folders used on BBL, that help with assisting on finding reading materials, homework, and quizzes/exams. I especially like that most teachers post videos and explanations, for those that aren't able to grasp concepts just by reading the books."
Sophomore,5,"Northern Arizona University (NAU), has provided some amazing opportunities for my higher education. NAU has allowed me to see the career field I am most interested in and make a plan for me to achieve my goal. The counseling staff at NAU is super friendly and always available to help, with smiles on their faces. I am astound at the wide variety of degrees NAU offers, from Nursing all the way to theatre or forestry. NAU is a great college choice."
Senior,5,"I enjoy how Flagstaff is a small community, at school you make many friends in classes but also your co workers become friends, your neighbors, your ally professionals become great friends and peers to learn from. It’s one whole community constantly giving back, I enjoy the charismatic people and town full of outdoor adventure. The school gives back to the community offering swim lessons and sports camps."
Senior,5,Yes classes online were a little more difficult because you do not get the personal face to face feedback on assignments or have that face to face help. It is hard to learn on your own with little instruction. Teachers expect you to know many things but some teachers teach things different from our previous teachers.
Alum,5,Wonderful college town. Large campus with a lot of offerings. Lots of clubs and activities. Beautiful setting.
Alum,5,"I was nervous at first to take online courses, as it can be difficult to communicate with educators via online platforms, but I was pleasantly surprised with the caliber of the classes I took. The professors were easy to talk to and willing to help whenever and however they could. The courses were also easy to navigate independently."
Graduate Student,5,The campus is absolutely beautiful surrounded by forest in a small little town. Very friendly people all around.
Alum,5,Platform was easy to navigate. The professors were Receptive and easy to access if need guidance with assignments.
Alum,5,"Great school, dedicated professors, and great community!  I was in the accelerated nursing program, passed NCLEX first try and had wonderful clinical experience."
Freshman,5,I love everything about this school! The campus is so beautiful. I have had nothing but a good experience with all of the staff that I have come in contact with. All of my professors were great!
Sophomore,5,"I love online classes however with the COVID-19 outbreak I found that some of my teachers did not know how to teach online. Every class that I have tal=ken online by choice has been amazing with some awesome professors. After this next year, I will actually be fully switching to online due to how much I enjoy it."
Alum,5,The teachers make sure to connect with students and be active when looking through emails. They are understanding when students run into technical issues and are willing to work through them. The layout of the classes makes sense and the program used for the books is easy to follow and provides good information.
Senior,5,So far I have not felt like I am missing out on any knowledge due to taking all classes online. Professors are prompt with assisting with any questions.
Senior,5,"So far it has been a pleasant experience. I have been in communication with admissions department, my advisor, along with various departments and everyone has responded promptly providing as much help as they are able to."
Senior,5,I love it here so much it is my second home. I love the people there and the city itself. The fact we have a ski resort in our backyard makes it the funnest part of being here
Junior,5,The overall environment is absolutely amazing. Everyone is extremely friendly and there is always someone new to meet. The weather can be a little crazy in the winter but is extremely beautiful otherwise.
Sophomore,5,My teachers and university did a great god switch so fast to remote learning. They have been extra helpful and have been Amazing.
Junior,5,Some of the PRM courses are more demanding then others. Taking them online gives me the freedom to choose how I complete the assignments. The online learning environment is great.
Sophomore,5,"I had a great first year experience at NAU. You have access to any resource you need whether it be Microsoft Office for your electronic device, or mental healthcare. Even during the COVID-19 outbreak, the university's response was very efficient. For those staying on campus such as myself, I did not need to worry about finding my next meal because they managed to allow students to safely have access to food. NAU is a great and safe place to study and I enjoyed it."
Junior,5,The online nursing classes are very well organized. The staff have been very supportive through the pandemic.
Niche User,5,"When I went to visit NAU, I was amazed by all the buildings that they have. NAU's campus is gorgeous and all their staff is incredibly nice!"
Sophomore,5,"NAU is great for online education and in person education. Each professor is a professional in their subject, which allows them to effectively answer questions or concerns you have about a specific field of study or job occupation. The class sized are also smaller than other major state universities. This helps students feel closer to their professor and helps professors with assisting students individually."
Sophomore,4,NAUFlex is the method that NAU went with the Covid-19 situation. This allows for students to choose for in-person or online. If online then there are cameras that allow for what it seems like actual in-person. They also use Blackboard Collaborate Ultra which allows for easy PowerPoint presenting and more. Overall each professor has their own way of teaching the class and some of them only make real connections with students in-person which can be hard for them.
Senior,4,"For the most part,  my experience has been mostly great.  Some issues with communication,  due to both faculty and black board not being really accessible. Switch to canvas!"
Senior,4,Had a really great experience at NAU.  I really just had an issue at the beginning with knowing when I'd start due to my start date and campus location changing and i wasn't updated by any faculty and by then it was too late.  The teachers are wonderful and inspiring.  The program I'm doing is great.
Senior,4,"Northern Arizona University has really strong programs for Education, Music, Women and Gender Studies, and Hotel and Restaurant Management. I have had a great experience in the college of arts and letters, and the college of education. The professors are supportive and knowledgeable, and do so much to support their students."
Freshman,4,"So far, I have really enjoyed going to NAU. Many of the professors are understanding and comprehensive when it comes to deadlines and late work and the staff have been very welcoming and accommodating during these hard times. The only reason I cannot give a five star review is because of the police activity and the lack of action when it comes to things like sexual assault."
Alum,4,"As a student-athlete at NAU, my overall experience was absolutely incredible. From academics and campus life to the town and extracurricular activities, NAU has everything to offer!"
Alum,4,"I took a few classes online throughout my undergraduate career and they were all very well taught. The professors clearly outlined the course, the requirements, structure, and objectives. The online professors were readily accessible and easy to communicate with."
Alum,4,The Honors College and Liberal Arts electives were wonderful. The arts programs could use improvement in facilities. I would not recommend a meal plan... I had a lot of health issues because of the food.
Junior,4,the financial aid office and registars officecould be more organized. however i love the smaller class sizes and student organizations.
Sophomore,4,"With this only being my second year here at Northern Arizona University, I have had the most amazing time, and have met some of the most amazing people.  I chose NAU because I fell in love with the community an the gorgeous scenery. I recommend this small college town to everyone. I am so happy I chose Northern Arizona University."
Freshman,4,Due to covid-19 all the classes I currently have are at least partially online. All my professors are very good at teaching online. The only downside is that this increases cost because we have to pay for certain websites that we need for class.
Freshman,4,"They are very good about communicating with students, this makes the experience of being a new student much easier."
Senior,4,My experience has been great! It is a great university that cares about their students. I was fortunate enough to have good professors and classmates. Most of my professors have been very involved and ready to answer questions.
Sophomore,4,My first year at Northern Arizona University was a great year. Living on campus and attending campus events was an awesome experience. I met people from many different parts of the country and even other countries. One of the problems I did face was parking on campus. It was extremely difficult to park on campus other than my dorm. I would change the parking guidelines to make it easier for students to access campus buildings.
Alum,4,The university is commited to Indigenous education. I hope the university starts to give more back to the students and staff.
Junior,4,"My overall experience with Northern Arizona University is that the classes are great, there are great professors that aren't very stereotypical. It's a kind of a diverse school."
Junior,4,"My online learning experience has been good so far,  my professor always responded within a day which is great since we were an online class. He had given very helpful responses."
Senior,4,"When classes were moved online in the Spring semester of 2020, many professors and students struggled during this transition. My professors decided not to do any classes via Zoom and provided us with online readings and assignments."

Junior,4,"The professors are doing the best they can to adjust. I have difficult classes, and the professors are trying to stay flexible and be understanding."
Freshman,4,"I did not take any classes online but from what I heard, the teachers were very helpful and easy to communicate with."
Sophomore,4,"So far, NAU has been a pretty good experience. I wish they provided clearer answers on my questions related to COVID-19 instead of just sending the policies again. However, my experience with academics and professors have been great."
Sophomore,4,"Northern Arizona will forever be a part of my heart. When you think of attending a University many people are often fearful of the new changes and a new lifestyle they have to enter. As a freshman I was one of those fearful yet excited students, thankfully NAU made me, as well as many other freshman feel welcomed and helped me navigate my school schedule and other resources available on campus. although I spent the first month super confused on my classes and books I was able to manage by the help of an older student. I plan on continuing at NAU and I would surely tell anyone to attend this magnificent school located within the woods."
Sophomore,4,"I would change how the students don't really get a decision on things that go on around campus or events. The concerts that go on, on campus I would like to vote who gets to come. I feel that their needs to be better tutoring systems for certain classes. I love how nice the RA's are but some need to learn that not everyone likes to do the programs around the dorm. I love how welcoming the campus is because I can talk anyone on campus."
Sophomore,4,Some teachers their need to learn that not every student learns the same way. It takes time to learn certain subjects also their needs to be better physics teachers because no is learning and the grade has to with the lab so that students can pass the class.
Freshman,4,"NAU took the actions to help students to transition online, being a guiding hand amid the Coronavirus Pandemic.  Although there were some struggles, NAU was very efficient in completing the year strong and communicating regularly."
Freshman,4,I haven't had any classes online however I did have the online orientation with online modules and zoom meetings with orientation leaders and my academic advisor. The whole process was pretty straightforward and it was easy to navigate.
Sophomore,4,"To be honest its been a hard adjustment attending this school but at the end of the day the people here are so nice. if you are scared to attend you have every right to be. For me i was scared because i was just so far from home. But i stuck to it and completed a whole year and if i am being honest, i loved it. It felt so surreal to be a collage student and live on campus. it was just amazing!!"
Sophomore,4,"Okay to be honest when i had to do classes online i was very unsure of just how smoothly me and online learning would get along but in the end, i LOVED IT!!!! it made  my classes go at more of my pace, it also felt like i was in control of my education and allowed me to learn the way that i want too. It was a good experience and really helped me feel much more confident about my academics."
Sophomore,4,"I attended NAU as a freshman last year (2019-2020) I quite enjoyed everything that student life had to offer. There was casino night, movie nights in a big auditorium and even movie nights at the school pool. They had a lot of activities to offer to help make new friend and get out of the house (aka dorms). I had so much fun my first year, I made a lot of friends and a ton of memories that shall last me a life time. I’m very excited to be going back in the fall to see what NAU has to offer this year."
Freshman,4,"I have not started any online learning experiences with NAU to know much about it. Although, my virtual orientation was quite informative. I learned a lot about the resources that are provided for me and where to call or email if I need help."
Niche User,4,It was a fun school to be at with class sizes not to big and I felt like professors cared a bout me.
Niche User,4,I only did online because of covid but it wasn't too bad. I personally felt like it was set up to help me succeed.
Freshman,4,I loved NAU. The campus is absolutely beautiful and there are so many student resources available around every corner.
Sophomore,4,"To start off, I like the overall setup of transportation of the campus; from the designated bike/scooter/skateboard lanes running through the whole campus to the free busrides we receive taking us from building to building or from downtown to grocery stores with our IDs. Teachers can seem distant, but once you ask for help it's a whole lot easier; with the exception of this year with the switch to online learning and the fiasco of some of my teachers unable to help me learn anything they were trying to explain. It has an appealing scenery ranging from the beautiful colors of the trees in the fall to everything covered in snow in the winter to the overwhelming amount of green in the spring; you really get to experience all of the seasons."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the quality of the business building. With computers laid out on mostly every floor, I was able to begin, or complete assignments on days when my internet at home was acting up. I dislike some of the class layouts. Teachers often use different websites for quizzes and attendants, so it's often hard to afford to pay the subscription for all."
Senior,4,I do enjoy the area and I enjoy many of the professors that I have had. However one of the big downsides is that the president of the college is heavily corrupt and misappropriated funds for personal business.
Senior,4,I do enjoy the area and I enjoy many of the professors that I have had. However one of the big downsides is that the president of the college is heavily corrupt and misappropriated funds for personal business.
Senior,4,"Online classes are normally very fast paced; however, with the COVID-19, I feel that the professors and university handled the transition from in-person classes to online classes very well.  To the point that it was nearly the same due date schedule, but with an easier rubric."
Senior,4,NAU is a small university with smaller class sizes than other universities that have many conveniences in order to adapt to the weather and its surroundings.  The only complaint is towards the current president of the university who had pursued in illegal embezzlement of the university's funds for her own personal use.
Junior,4,"I have had a good experience so far, I think it is the best University in Arizona and would highly recommend to an outdoor person who loves to go outside and have a good time. I would change some of the pricing and hiring of professors, housing can  be very expensive and the professors are some times not adequate to teach their subject"
Sophomore,4,"Northern Arizona University is a very beautiful campus. They have a bunch of things you can do on and off campus. Many clubs and groups to be a part of. I enjoy being there. I wish the professors would be more understanding and helpful. Some are rude and do not care about you, or they assign absolutely random crap that does not deal with your class. Otherwise, it is a wonderful place."
Sophomore,4,"The only reason I took online was because of COVID. During online it was nice and I liked going at my own pace, but I still had due dates. I did not mind being online. I liked going how slow or fast I wanted while going through lectures. It was nice to actually go at a pace where I can understand what is going on and enjoy what is happening, not stressing."
Alum,4,"Yes, I did take a few online classes.  They were well organized and the professors were easily accessible."
Sophomore,4,I began taking online courses this past semester due to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting universities all over the US. We decided to go online after our spring break and the teacher's really worked their hardest to try and ensure that classes wouldn't be too different. I appreciated the effort NAU teacher's put into ensuring the success of their students during the in person to online transition.
Junior,4,The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. NAU and the Community are friendly and the weather is nice. The president is the only change needed for the school.
Junior,4,"With the pandemic, online classes were the only option  and it turned out alright. Most in-person classes have online aspects to them as well and they always seem to enhance the class with more opportunity."
Sophomore,4,"My time at NAU has been one for the books. College in general is a place for growth, and being in a small town surrounded by Ponderosa Pine Trees help with growth a lot. You not only learn in class, but you also get to learn hands-on outside for a lot of classes. Especially for parks and rec + sustainability. The student life is inclusive and outgoing. There us always something to do whether it's hike, go to house concerts, snowboard, skate at the union, etc. The only tips I have for future Lumberjacks is: understand that Uber's in Flagstaff are expensive and there aren't many out after 2-3am, don't be afraid to be yourself, it's not always cold in Flagstaff so have some warm weather clothes, and go to as many on campus events as possible. Go Jack's!"
Alum,4,"I loved the campus and the university environment. The professors are also very eager to help you achieve success by working with you to form and obtain academic goals. There were also tons of opportunities to pursue research or internships, as the town is built around the university. I do wish the academic advisors were more knowledgeable, as this did cause some disruption in my time at NAU. Overall, my experience at NAU was a positive one."
Graduate Student,4,Professors were very forward in helping you strive to succeed. Get all the information to you as soon as they can.
Freshman,4,"I had to do online classes with NAU over the quarantine. Although I did not do very well at my classes, that part is on me. I am just not built for online classes and I dread them. However, the school did a good job of converting everyone to be online very quickly and efficiently ."
Junior,4,"Studying at Northern Arizona University has been a great fit for me. The campus is located in the mountains, with lots of outdoor activities. The majority of my professors have been passionate about what they teach, making the classes interesting and enjoyable. There are also over four hundred clubs on campus, so meeting people and finding new activities is fairly easy. However, finding the right major and classes at NAU can sometimes be challenging, due to the advising staff. After this adjustment period, the majority of NAU has been great. Peers and staff are very friendly, classes are interesting, and there are a lot of activities to keep people busy."
Junior,4,"Online learning at NAU has provided me with interesting courses. Teachers like to use Zoom, BBlearn, email and online videos to keep students engaged. Though classes are much more interesting in person, taking a few online classes at NAU still allows you to learn a lot, talk to teachers if you have questions, and be presented with a lot of interesting class material. Homework assignments are easy and simple to do online, and lectures are often very straightforward. Engaging with the teachers and students can be slightly more challenging, but a lot of teachers at NAU create discussion boards so that the online course still feels like an in-person class."
Alum,4,The teachers were always very supportive and kind. The school provided plenty of opportunities to reach out to others and be active on campus with a variety of clubs and activities to participate in. I would suggest updating the campus buildings though for all departments instead of focusing on the business and writing departments.
Senior,4,After the virus started nau switched to completely online. After this switch I found that some classes were made a lot easier but I lot were still very hard.
Senior,4,"Because online classes are generally self-paced, finding time to complete online class work is very flexible; while assignment deadlines still exist, most online classes do not require specific attendance periods. Additionally, the digital nature of online classes causes their resources to be easy to access."
Senior,4,"Northern Arizona University provides an expansive variety of career opportunities for students from any walk of life, and the professors are not only highly knowledgeable and trustworthy, but also very well-respected. This university is also a hotspot for a wide array of outdoor activities, such as hiking, cycling, disc golf, rock climbing, and soccer. Moreover, on-campus housing is affordable, and many scholarship opportunities are available for both upcoming freshmen and current students."
Junior,4,"I was fortunate enough to attend a year on-campus and my experience there was eye-opening.  To start off, Flagstaff scenery is gorgeous during the winters and sunsets(except for the actual weather).  I created wonderful friendships there and the social life is welcoming!  Everyone either finds or creates a niche to their liking and it grows from there.  Like every student, the only downfall of the campus is the parking situation: there is never parking and the need for parking passes to be THAT expensive is ridiculous. 
Other than that, I miss Flagstaff once in a while and would have loved to experience the full four years there.  Make it count!"
Junior,4,"Lots of resources to help you, but is also very difficult, even with help. I was rewarded a full tuition scholarship in 2018 where I was required to keep a 3.0 and I struggled the entire time until I lost it. I went to advisors, professors, tutoring, and more for help. As a Biology major, know that a career in science can be very difficult at times (especially chemistry for me), so please be prepared and ask for help when attending."
Sophomore,4,I loved the town and campus. I had great classes and teachers overall. However the food and busses could use some improvement.
Junior,2,"N/A. I have not taken any online courses at NAU. However a lot of my classes are hybrid which means that I attend class in person, and most of my homework and assignments are online. In some cases, all of the learning was done on my own, and in class was just used to discuss what we had learned."
Sophomore,2,"COVID-19 taking over the last half of the semester was truly inconvenient for all and NAU's decision to go online was the smartest decision.  I honestly believe, though, that many professors were not well-prepared to teach in such a situation.  I know that the professors were not to blame, none of them had to ever teach online on such a massive scale, if at all, but I felt like I did not get the most out of my online experience and struggled often to keep up with assignments and due dates.  NAU Online could have been a much better experience for me."
Alum,2,"Warning: The NAU nursing program takes 3 yrs when other programs are 2 yrs. I transferred from community college after fulfilling all nursing prerequisites and basic degree classes. Despite this because of the way the nursing courses are set up it took 3 yrs to graduate. This meant my not only paying for another year's tuition and living expenses but also losing a year's worth of nursing pay, costing me at least $80,000 total, plus my big scholarship was only for two years.
The clinical skills instruction is terrible. Post graduation at my first job (UCLA Medical Center) it took me two months of hard, stressful work to raise my level to what it should have been on day one, and I'm an excellent student (got my masters later.) The other new grad on my unit was light years ahead of me with clinical skills though my academics were solid.
Advice: Get into an RN program at a community college then have your employer pay for your online BSN degree. Stay away from the NAU nursing program."
Junior,2,"I am a visual learner, so I do not do the best when it comes to online schooling. I pay to go to in person classes, and with this pandemic going on, it was a struggle to adjust to online school. The professors were helpful and understanding that the adjustment would take some time, but I do not think the administration was the best at keeping us updated and informed."
Sophomore,2,"They took one of my scholarships away without telling me I was losing it, hence the reason I'm here now. Besides that the school has been great, I have enjoyed attending classes here and that's why I'm looking for new scholarships; I want to be able to continue attending NAU and furthering my education."
Sophomore,2,Rita Cheng is awful. She doesn't care about anything except the money that she earns. If she were to be gone my rating would definitely increase.
Sophomore,2,"I feel completely upset at NAU because they do not care at all. During this pandemic, NAU has chosen to raise tuition for out of state students like my time which is ridiculous and I cannot believe they have the audacity when people all around the world have lost their jobs and the fact that they are opening without a vaccine blows my mind. Also, when I came to NAU I was expecting hard classes but most of the professor I had weren’t challenging enough, it just seemed like an I got an A for just showing up."
Junior,2,"During my Sophomore/Junior, I transferred to online school as living off campus was out of my budget.  I did not have a pleasant experience doing online classes, as it turns out I am unable to work or study in an area like that.  I am rating my experience and emotions, but this does not reflect the wonderful professors who helped as much as they could."
Freshman,2,The school is extremely expensive. I am an in state student and still took out 2 student loans and still had to pay out of pocket. I was forced to transfer out of the university to a community college. Rita Cheng is a scammer who takes your tuition dollars to travel with her husband.
Sophomore,2,"The campus is beautifully and most professors are great but NAU does not treat their students well outside the academic field. Disability resources is rude and does not care about students disabilities, Housing could try harder to accommodate and financial aid does not keep on top of things so people know exactly how much they will owe at the beginning of the semester"
Sophomore,2,"Going into college as a first generation student it comes with nerves and expectations.  As a place you are permanently living for two semester on your own, you hope for it to be welcoming. I did not feel like I belonged, my roommates and other students would give me a hard time for wanting to spend my day at the library to do homework. You would think that we are all here to learn and better our futures, they would want to join me. I would receive comments such as ""eww you were at the library"" ""lame"" ""why"". Having such negativity around you is not a good learning or living environment. I want to study Forensic Psychology and go to graduate school, Northern Arizona has made it difficult to carry on my dream. I desperately want to learn and become the to be able to share with my family how great of an opportunity it is to be in college, however it is difficult when your college experience isn't so positive."
Junior,2,"Freshman year was great! Dorms are fun, might get a strict RA, Sechrist and Reilly are the party dorms, Gabaldon's for rich kids, the others are mediocre. Go here then transfer elsewhere.  The tuition's relatively cheap, food is good at first, and professors are great for the most part.

The food gets old, the town's creepy, people are shady, too many hippies and entitled tree-hugging ignoramuses.  The police force has overrun the town and take up 10% of the traffic; they aren't good at their jobs either.  They prefer to arrest first-time offenders (freshman) walking around drunk and underage than the plastered homeless native guy stabbing people and firing gunshots at dusk.

Anyways, I got over it after one year.  It's also very cold and windy.  First year's great though!"
Sophomore,2,"The campus is over-flooded with out of state students. The town is overcrowded, and living in a little town like Flagstaff is somehow more expensive than a home in downtown Philadelphia. It costs 1200 dollars for a studio apartment, and on campus housing is honestly more expensive. A lot of the classes are over taxed and over crowded. In many cases you are only given online options for courses, because too many people need the class to hold in person lessons. It feels like the staff care more about over filling the campus to fill their pockets than about our experience as students. If you work hard and focus you can still get a good education out of this school, but a lot of the students are party focused. When school is in session ambulances are on standby to cart off students with alcohol poisoning. The campus is beautiful and some teachers are amazing, but you can read good aspects off their brochures. My experience has been over full buses, and lack of housing."
Sophomore,2,"NAU is a party school. Everyone is smoking weed,  drinking to stay warm, and/or show up to class. Rita cheng is an awful President and out of state tuition is obscured. Save you money and go to community college first."
Freshman,2,"Northern Arizona University is not a place for me. I feel depressed and isolated from the world. Not having a car doesn't help either, even if I did have it there's not much to do around the town unless you're 21+. I haven't made many friends and don't know how people could. The people there are weird and not my type of people to hang around."
Junior,2,"I hate how the grades you get depends on the teachers you take...Last semester I took biochem with Dr.altimerano and I worked my butt off for that class, I ended up receiving a B in the class when my friend took biochemistry with professor mcCaughla and she didn't even have to work half as hard as I did and she got an A in the class...turns out the other professor let's you retake the exams online and also curves the exam scores. Two semesters ago I took ochem 2 with professor Coss and I received my very first C ever in my entire life, my friend took the same class with a different teacher and she receive over a 100% in the class and said it was the easiest class ever.  I believe that your grade should be reflective of how hard you work in the class not dependent on the teacher you get. Also the physics department all around is just terrible.  I have already deleted more than half of my review but I could go on and on with more complaints if only it allowed more than 1000 characters."
Junior,2,"They do not care about education too much, at least from an administrative point of view. Of course, the professors work hard to help and guide students toward their future goals, but funding is an actual disaster. Administration takes on too many students leaving many without housing options or availability to get into their needed courses."
Freshman,2,"The education here is pathetic. I have above a 97% in all of my classes and there are only six more weeks left of school. For the money I am paying to be here, I am not being challenged at all or learning anything."
Freshman,2,I had a death in the family that caused me to have to go home for a week when I came back I got a letter from the dean and attempted to proceed in my classes as normal. However the teachers are not required to respect the letter from the dean and they wouldn't let me make up work. The whole school is institutional and De-humanized. The students here hate it.
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are very small and poor and clearly built to save money. The Housing lottery is the worst and leaves people wit late slots with nowhere to live. The cost is high for small and low-quality housing.
Sophomore,2,"I have mixed feelings about my time here. I enjoyed my stay, however the school's resources for multiple departments are entirely disorganized and rude. I had several advisement appointments and only once did I leave with a sense of relief. There is very little communication within the workings of this university, and often times its students suffer because of it. I have decided to follow a different path at a different college due in part to these problems, and have found more happiness than at NAU. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a decent variety of courses offered. There are some courses where there is a small class size, but I feel most of them are larger. The professors don't seem to care about the individuals for the most part. Even in small classes, some don't even care to learn your name."
College Sophomore,2,"This school is drugs and alcohol galore, you'll find people do everything from pot to heroin if you socialize enough."
College Sophomore,2,"For one, no one knows how to work the website that is set up to ""help"" you find a job. For another, it is hard enough to apply to be an intern or TA for classes. There are so many people competing for the same thing that they have had to raise the requirements so that it is now even harder to try and obtain an internship. The only good thing is that I know if you do end up getting a job on campus, they are willing to work around your schedule so you can get the maximum amount of hours possible."
College Freshman,2,No one really talks about the sports at school.
College Freshman,2,There needs to be more housing for upperclassmen.
College Freshman,2,I am not sure because I am not part of greek life.
College Freshman,2,"There are blue lights to get help

This year there was a shooting, attempted kidnapping, sexual assaults"
College Freshman,2,Jobs are really hard to get if you are from out of state
College Senior,2,"We only have one Greek dorm and no sorority row

M"
College Freshman,2,Northern Arizona University has great team spirit but its hard to keep it going for one sole reason; We don't win! Years that we win the fans are in total support but this year we can not seem to win much so our athletics tend to be forgotten about. However the school heavily supports then and the tailgates rule.
College Freshman,2,Freshman dorms were not worth the price.
College Freshman,2,Not as hype as other schools
College Freshman,2,There is very little room and most of the halls are out of date.
College Senior,2,After the fraternity's this year had one shot four members of another on campus I have zero respect for them. I think there need to control the parties so the number of girls is higher than the number of guys and when a guy comes to go to the party they chase him out.
Recent Alumnus,2,Everyone likes the athletic department. Great exercise room.
College Freshman,2,Some of the classes are good. Some teachers are unorganized. Dorms are bad. Roommates are not so good.
College Sophomore,2,Dont come expecting 5 star food.
College Sophomore,2,It was a complete hassle but in the end I got what I needed
College Senior,2,It very hard to find off campus housing that near the school (20-25miles) that doesn't start at $1000 for just a studio plus Utilities.
Recent Alumnus,2,The selection is limited and some landlords are slumlords taking advantage of poor college students. College students do not have money and it is difficult to find somewhere to live. The cheap and decent places are ridiculously hard to get into.
College Junior,2,Off campus housing is expensive and hard to come by. Flagstaff is an expensive place to live and there are not many options for students on a college budget.
College Freshman,2,"I had to fight in order to receive the Lumberjack Scholarship that I was promised.

When I applied for Northern Arizona University, I was told that according to my grades, I would receive the Lumberjack Scholarship, which covers the in-state $9,000 tuition for four years. When I received my scholarship letter, I received was an out of state scholarship. In order to receive the Lumberjack scholarship, you must have the right qualifications. You have to live in Arizona and have a 3.5 or better when graduating high school. I qualified for both. What I then received was a scholarship for an out of state student. After I corrected their mistake, I then received a $2,500 scholarship. I called NAU's financial aid and they told me that I had a 3.4 so I did not qualify. I had a 3.57 GPA. I knew that for a fact. At the end of my senior year, I had a 3.64. I called them again and they told me that I still did not qualify according to their records and that I should send in my official transcripts which should take 30-60 days to process.

I went to orientation and finally received the help I needed. A graduate student working for financial aid gave me her email and told me that if I still haven't received the Lumberjack Scholarship in a certain amount of time, to have my high school student advisor email my transcripts to her. After the certain amount of time, I called NAU financial aid again, and again they told me the same thing, that I did not qualify. So I emailed the graduate student and so did my advisor and literally two days afterwards, I got an email saying I received the Lumberjack Scholarship.

There were more students than I thought who had a similar story to mine. If you KNOW you qualify for a better scholarship than what you received, you are going to have to fight for it."
College Freshman,2,"On campus food is really not healthy. The food tastes great when you first get there, but as the semester goes on, you will become tired of on campus food. If you have a food allergy of some sort, good luck on finding non contaminated food, especially if you are gluten free. Even if you are not allergic to any types of food, the food messes with most students' stomachs in a ver not pleasant way. The Starbucks coffee at the union is always burnt, but the coffee at Scholar's corner (in the Cline library), in my opinion is the best place to get coffee. If you want a good meal plan, I suggest getting the 10 meals a week with $400 dining dollars a semester. I believe it is the best deal. Make sure you spend all of your meals each week. If you do not spend all of your meals each week, you are still paying for the meals that you don't use. NAU is also starting roll over meals for the Fall 2015 semester and on. So if you don't spend all of your meals one week, you can use them the next. BUT they put a limit on how many meals roll over."
College Freshman,2,More lenient with drugs than parking violations
College Freshman,2,Do not receive all the aid that is needed
College Freshman,2,Certain off campus housings should be discounted for students and certain transportation should be provided.
College Freshman,2,Have discounts for native americans! Especially since we are minorities and have very less money as it is! We don't have to pay for housing at least!
College Sophomore,2,It's been rough because I live on my own but I don't get financial assistance from my parents so the burden of responsibility for finding scholarships has been on me.  The school hasn't been very helpful with the process either
College Freshman,2,People charge way too much for small apartments around campus.
College Freshman,2,"Using a meal plan on campus makes it easy to pay and process food. It is simple and easy to use transfers and dining dollars however, there are not many choices for transfers. I feel that the price for a meal plan is to expensive compared to the food we receive and the amount. There is not enough choices and I get sick of the food because its consistently the same."
College Freshman,2,I was not eligible for any scholarships. I am nit sure what that looks like.
College Freshman,2,"I had trouble with proving my state citizenship and then because they didn't fix my 'in-state' residency, I missed my opportunity to get financial aid."
College Freshman,2,Parking permits are outrageously expensive.
College Freshman,2,I just do not find it fair that I really didn't receive any financial aid and they expect my family to pay for everything or get loans and be in debt for the rest of my life.
College Junior,2,"I'm nervous to go out past a certain time, but NAU has a security that walks with you."
College Sophomore,2,I have been trying to start an internship in my field but have not been accepted. There were not many opportunities on campus for me.
College Junior,2,"The housing on campus is very poor. It is fantastic for freshman, but upperclassmen are left to their own devices. Most live off-campus due to the fact that most of the housing that was to be designated for upperclassmen is now exclusively for freshman. As a freshman, my room was immaculate and I had plenty of space. The hall was quiet, despite being located adjacent to the front desk. The cost was low, and they are dedicated to getting as many freshman into on-campus housing as possible. It is almost required. Now, I am having a very hard time getting onto campus and all of my peers are having to live off campus with multiple roommates so they are able to afford fairly expensive local housing."
College Junior,2,"Moving onto campus as a freshman, I knew at least a dozen of my fellow peers suffered horrible stomach aches when adjusting to the food offered on campus. Whether this was simply their poor choices in food or the food itself, I'm not sure. I do know that we only had one place on campus that claimed to serve organic food and it was established much to the chagrin of administration. I would go grocery shopping and buy my own food, supplementing with snacks I bought at the small eatery next door to my dorm. The hours at this particular spot were fantastic, open until very late at night for us night owls. Freshman are mostly the only ones who use the food facilities on campus, most others go shopping or eat locally in town."
College Senior,2,If you can stay on campus it's better. You will often pay about the same if not more in rent and utilities and you would for a dorm room. Housing in general is limited due to limited land available for building. Many of the apartments near campus that house students are know for their constant noise and partying. The co-signer and overall requirements for many of the apartments are also very unreasonable. If you are going to live off campus your best bet it to steer clear of commercial properties despite the nice amenities and rent from private property
Sophomore,1,"The online experience was a lot different from attending in person. the abrupt change from attending school in person to having to switch to all of our classes being online made it very difficult to navigate. It felt as if the professors were very disorganized and didn't know either how to go about the online sessions. It felt chaotic and all over the place. It also felt unfair because I as well as many other students do not thrive in online learning, It felt boring, tedious and overwhelming. I hope to never have to do that again. 0/10"
Sophomore,1,Most of my professors took forever to grade or give enough time to do assignments before they were do. I was mostly assigned to interact with my classmates via discussion boards and do more work than I usually do.
Graduate Student,1,"Sadly my Alma Mater is an excuse for an institution. They are only focused on the benefit to themselves (i.e. Rita Cheng) rather then the safety and needs of their students. Faculty only cares about whats going into their pockets to the point where students are left out to dry during office hours, scheduled meetings and other ""resources"" that are provided on campus. Not to mention the living and parking situations on campus are hazardous and disgusting. If this institution wishes to have a better relationship with its students and its community I believe they should start weeding out the poor choices in employees first along with rebuilding the bacteria filled campus buildings."
Freshman,1,The academic counselors were not helpful at all. they were also always busy. they made you feel stupid if you didn't know how to do something.
Freshman,1,I learned that you should really consider the options of studying away from home. It is a huge transition and can be difficult. NAU really needs better financial services.
Freshman,1,"I live a suite-style dorm, and my roommates and I have had some issues with one of our suitemates, and it caused my roommates to move out. The suitemate we've had issues with was caught with illegal substances in her room, and they are doing nothing about it.  The PD confiscated what they found, I know there has to be a lot more than what they found.  The RA's and RHD isn't doing anything about it and they are asking us to move out, but I feel like that it is NOT FAIR, because we weren't the ones with the illegal substances.  I feel as if or suitemate that got caught should have heavy consequences, like being kicked out of the dorms, because, since this is a drug free campus and also, because shes been slamming doors and yelling all the time.  Our RHD is using the excuse, ""Oh it's just college"".  I feel like that is the worse possible thing she could've said.  Also, for over a year, I've dealt with nothing but negative things with this school."
Senior,1,"If you're on the tour and you ask a passing NAU student what they think of this school, don't be surprised when they break down crying.
The professors have no repercussions for not teaching the material that is on the exam.
President cheng has no repercussions for approving unnecessary construction, increasing tuition, decreasing services, and removing resources.
97% Acceptance means you won't get your classes. 
Freshmen are the majority of campus.
Only 52% will graduate.

Flagstaff landlord will overcharge you and evict if you protest unlivable conditions.

There will never be a snow day. 

You toured in summer but the semester is mostly winter conditions.

I hate NAU, the Walmert-esk ""value"" that they advertise. It's truly representative of a company that sells a 4 year product, that'll require 5 years of commitment, and start failing after 2 years.

Value your time & money.  Start at community college & then go to a better university than NAU.
Seniors are 78% of the 48% who dropout"
College Sophomore,1,Not a big school for sports
College Freshman,1,it best to live on campus your first year here at NAU you will meet a lot of interesting people and you never no if you will meet your best friend.
College Freshman,1,"small town, if you like the cold you will love it here. It snows on occasion and mostly everything is walking distance. Busses are avalible when in need. Great overall experience i have had so far."
College Junior,1,"There's hardly enough space for two people, let alone three if you get stuck in one of those dorms. There are not enough dorms to house all students that are accepted. There are not enough options for 2 people dorms as you go through your first year. The second year you're battling it out to get a good dorm that isn't crowded, and by your junior year you're basically out of luck and have to find an apartment since you're not priority on the housing list. Students don't take care of the dorms and because of that, the prices get bumped. The prices are also pretty outrageous for what you get. They are pretty poorly kept and cleaned. Overall, I'd suggest just getting an apartment before coming to NAU. It saves you a lot of money in the long run and you'll be secure in a home while you're attending college."
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life is interesting. A little weird as well.
College Freshman,1,i didn't get any financial aid from the school i had to get my own loans
College Sophomore,1,"The Hot Spot especially is not the greatest of dining halls compared to the Dub. Better, more food options. Not always he same thing."
College Junior,1,They're awful. They do literally nothing for the campus or society.
College Junior,1,I do not have an internship.
College Senior,1,The people that work in the office have little to no idea what they are talking about when it comes tom financial aid. These lose documents all the time and multiple years in a row I am only offered a really low amount of aid until I appeal and petition for more.
College Freshman,1,"My school was kind of rude to me as i went through the program, yes there were a few people that did help me out along the was, but most of the time people were just unkind and not wanting to help me advance my education and training any further. Most of the time all I heard from some people was ""oh that's interesting"" in a nasty tone."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am sure most students would hesitate to call this campus strict. The notable exception is parking and speed limits. You must have the correct permit to be parked in a given lot or you will undoubtedly be ticketed. It doesn't take much for parking services to decide to have your vehicle towed, either. Parking rules are much more lenient on weekends; however, NAUPD takes enforcing the ridiculously low speed limits on campus quite seriously. Proceed with caution."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I spent four years surrounded by dunces, and believe me, I am not just talking about the students."
Recent Alumnus,1,"NAU is your typical state university. Therefore, the dating scene is probably fairly similar to collegiate stereotypes from movies and television. A lot of guys are jerks and a lot of the girls are similarly unpleasant. If you go to parties, you will meet plenty of people, but whether they are actually people you want to know is another story. Getting involved in campus activities, whether that's participating in Greek Life or attending events hosted by Sun Entertainment, is definitely the best way to meet people who share your interests."
College Junior,1,It really is terrible.  You have to pay an arm and a leg to get on campus parking and if you don't the parking services swarm like vultures and will give you a $100+ ticket if you park in the wrong place for 15 minutes.  They literally sit there and watch for people in the wrong place.
College Senior,1,They built a new dorm on a parking lot when there was already limited parking.
College Freshman,1,"I hate the cold, and the wind only makes it worse!"
College Freshman,1,I've had a hard time making friends in the dorm and  I don't even have a roommate so there's no one to talk to
College Freshman,1,"My experience with living on campus has not been the best, the various types of people I am meeting and how their different from meeting them to just living in the same room."
College Freshman,1,"Dining halls serve terrible food, that is usually food. There are very few options, and there are duplicate options all over campus, instead of more diverse options (such as havimg multiple salad locations..)"
College Freshman,1,"Parking services are like nazis, they wanna give everyone a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,Printing is ridiculously expensive. Invest in a printer.
College Freshman,1,its too cold to go out
College Junior,1,We often are viewed as a school with bad teams and the games are not the most popular activitiey on  campus and many leave half way through.
College Freshman,1,"When I go outside my room I'm not sure if I'm smelling a skunk or weed. People are drunk all the time! I've never been forced to try either but because I choose not to go to be around those substances. The policy enforcement is pretty weak, they let people slide a lot."
College Freshman,1,It's too cold! I hate having to wait in 10 degree or lower weather for a bus or having to walk across campus in the weather. It decreases my motivation to go to class. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"Economics, and the entire business department, is a complete joke at NAU. Everything is presented in the most braindead and reduced form possible. Nothing is mathematized at all and there's only one econometrics course. An economist who can't do math or perform econometric analysis is pretty near worthless. Calculus I-III, linear algebra, and differential equations weren't required despite being a necessity for admission to any graduate finance or econ schools. Intermediate level micro at this school resembles first year principles at better institutions. I exited this economics program having never even maximized a utility function or used a Lagrange multiplier. They need to overhaul their curriculum, add a mathematical economics course, and add at least a time series econometrics course. Finance was similarly dumbed down with no explanation of the underlying theories behind anything being done in class. The professors in the econ department were fiercely partisan and used classes to spread their ideologies, but at that point I welcomed it because I was so sick of hearing the opposite ideology in my general studies requirement classes. 

Unless you're studying accounting and planning to do the MBA-ACC here, avoid this business school like the plague!!"
Recent Alumnus,1,Horrible gym and staff. Outdated equipment and planet fitness-esque stupid rules. It's never busy though. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"I think that permit costs are ridiculous, considering I had to arrive super early, and drive around and around the lot to find parking.  South campus may be better, but all my classes were on North campus.  Parking always sold out, cost a ton, and was incredibly inconvenient."
College Freshman,1,No one goes to the games or tailgates 
College Freshman,1,"Its a school that attracts the unattractive. There are ZERO hot guys, and absolutely no attractive or even bearably pretty girls "
College Freshman,1,"No one goes, our teams sucks, our tail gates ant even big"
College Sophomore,1,"440$ for a parking pass! Almost as much as my books this semester. In fact I couldn't buy all my books because I purchased the one academic year parking pass. No discounts for veterans, hybrids, electric cars, and if you're an employee you only save 40$"
College Junior,1,"Minor infractions can lead to a night in jail for many places around campus. It all depends on how many arrests the police feel like giving in one day. You may get lucky with the law sometimes, but unlucky more than often."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is extremely expensive, especially if you want a spot in the parking garage. Also, the spots fill up very quickly even if you do pay for a pass."
College Sophomore,1,I do not agree with the parking system. We pay over $400 to park in one parking lot all year. I feel as if we should choose and be able to pick at least 4 parking areas we can park in.
College Freshman,1,"If I could have an internship with anything that relates to my major I would take it because I will be able to get the experience that I need to become successful. If it's not with my major and it's something I enjoy, I'd also still take it because I could learn something by doing what I enjoy."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is horrid.  The permits are terribly expensive and they only cover one parking lot on campus, so if you have a permit for a north campus lot and most of your classes are on south you better get used to waiting for the bus. There is overflow parking but now you even  need a permit for that. Only one parking lot, that I know of, does not require a permit but you will be hard pressed to find a spot to park there ever. The ticket and fine costs are atrocious, especially when the amount given when it is your first offense."
College Junior,1,The computers are slow and have lots of problems. It would be nice if they were of higher quality.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Sports are kind of a joke here. I think the Cross Country team and the quidditch team are the only ones who ever win consistently. Football has a following, but they aren't historically a very good team. Tailgating and tradition does go on at the games though. It's just not a very big sports culture here."
College Senior,1,The parking on campus is very cumbersome.  They make the passes pretty expensive and do not have many day-only options.  There are hardly any metered parking spots and the parking services people are generally hated on campus.  Tickets are extremely expensive and they will boot you and then laugh at you as you cry out of frustration.
College Freshman,1,"There are essentially no rules. Nothing is ever upheld and if so, it is very minor. Rules have become just a guideline or suggestion, instead of actual rules."
College Freshman,1,"Well, I am not involved with Greek life on part is because I don't feel welcomed I feel like there is a certain image and certain lifestyle that I am not part of so I choose not to be involved. From what I hear around campus some of the soroties or fraterneties aren't so great amd the students involved are pretty rude amd disrespectful."
College Junior,1,Living off campus is not recommended because rent off campus is way too high.
College Freshman,1,I have had the worst experience with financial aid all I could receive was my pell grant  and I was offered 2 other loans which was no where near the amount of my college tuition  and financial aid is not assisting me with other options except for telling me to take out a private loan which I have got denied for every one I suggest speaking to financial aid and get a clear understanding of how much they are willing to assist you with before you make any commit to any college.
College Freshman,1,As an Accounting major I feel confident in finding a job after i graduate my school is not very helpful in assisting with anything  I would do it all over again except I would research more about the school I chose and getting scholarships. My career goals are to graduate college and pursue my major.
College Freshman,1,They were literally no help. They were always busy and half of them dont know what they are doing.
College Senior,1,because you can hardly find parking permits are expensive and they ticket you for everything
College Junior,1,The universities parking is absolutely terrible in opinion. They offer a year permit or a semester that are said to be reasonably priced but not for 300 to 600 dollars amount that it costs. The permits that the campus offers only allows for that permit to be used in designated areas around campus that always fill quickly leaving on to always depend on the school transit system.
College Freshman,1,The computers in the dorm are out of date and turn off without warning
College Senior,1,It's a horrible place to park. If you live off campus you can only park on one Parkin lot at the end of south campus. Quite a long walk to north campus.
College Junior,1,"The financial aid office is not very well managed. Each semester I have to go in to fix something wrong with my financial aid. Last year, I almost didn't get my Pell Grant because someone forgot to check a box on my financial aid awards. They are courteous, but not always very helpful."
College Freshman,1,There is always someone smoking something on campus and then I see alcohol in the dorms as well.

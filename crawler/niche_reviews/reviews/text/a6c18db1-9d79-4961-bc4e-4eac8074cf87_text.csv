Senior,5,"Baylor has a strong, loving community that truly cares about students growing and achieving their goals."
Alum,5,"Professors are amazing and very passionate about contributing to the community and helping students. The campus is beautiful and people are generally very friendly and courteous. Things can get a little boring on the weekends if you're not into partying, but once you enter sophomore or junior year and people live off campus, it gets a lot better. I loved Baylor and I'm incredibly grateful that I am now an alumna. I wish I could've spent even more time there. I have made so many incredible memories, from football games to studying with friends in Moody to Sundown Sessions to just hanging around playing games with friends. I have made lifelong friends and many connections. I love Baylor."
Niche User,5,Very helpful and informative during college searches! The community on the campus is very welcoming and supportive of each other!
Niche User,5,Supported online learning through various teaching platforms. The professors exceeded my expectations of online learning!
Alum,5,"N/A - Did not have any online courses while at Baylor. When I was going those were few and far between, although technology is used a great deal in class (in person)."
Sophomore,5,All of my professors transitioned very well into the online learning environment. I felt as though I was receiving the same quality education that Baylor promotes.
Sophomore,5,A very inclusive environment with excellent professors. Supplemental Instruction programs offer a reinforced learning experience.
Freshman,5,Baylor is an amazing institution that cares greatly about its students. This school goes through great lengths to ensure that its students are well taken care of.
Freshman,5,"I have not personally taken any courses online yet, but I do have an upcoming online course in the new school year. I have only heard great things about Baylor's online courses."
Freshman,5,An excellent college for someone to grow in what they love to do. you will grow for the better and end up feeling like your best self
Freshman,5,Easy for anyone to use and easy to access when you need to. Didn't have a hard time logging in or keeping up with the material
Junior,5,"Baylor does an incredible job at providing opportunities for students to find a place on campus and get involved in a way that will be beneficial and meaningful to them. From events, student organizations, and the intentionality of the professors as they engage with students - I've always felt supported and like I had a team to back me as I make choices in school and about my future."
Senior,5,Great University. Has improved in terms of diversity and acceptance of a wide variety of people. Enjoyed my 4 years here.
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my first year experience at Baylor University. I have met so many diverse, fun, wonderful people, many of whom I call dear friends. The campus is beautiful with many trees and it is small enough that I feel a real sense of community. I have truly felt at home while at Baylor, the classes challenge me and I feel myself growing academically and personally. I feel very proud to call myself a Baylor Bear."
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online, but I know other students who have taken the courses and they are known to be just as amazing as in-person classes. The online programs use the same professors that are on campus, which is a great perk if you can't be on the campus!"
Alum,5,"Attending Baylor University was the best decision of my life. I was an out-of-state student and it was my first time ever traveling to another state. I fell in love with Baylor for the tradition, the quality education, religion, and the school spirit. I would recommend Baylor to anyone living inside and outside of Texas because the entire college education experience is complete at Baylor and I don't think that it could have been replicated for me anywhere else. I loved the faculty, got involved in Student Government, and spent a lot of time on campus and in the Waco community. Waco, TX. has become a hidden gem and you have to live there to discover how special it is. I miss it to this day and will forever be thankful and grateful for my time at BU. Sic'em Bears!"
Freshman,5,"I have not taken online classes at Baylor yet, but I'm guessing they would be just as excellent as the other learning methods at Baylor."
Freshman,5,"I love Baylor because you feel like you are a part of a family.  All the facilities are very nice, and the people there are amazing.  I have made some of my greatest friendships at Baylor."
Freshman,5,"The communication between my advisors and I has been easy and the feedback is quick. I've been openly welcomed through constant emails and ""gifts"" sent via mail; all of which is helping to get me even more excited about attending in the fall."
Junior,5,"I love the school so much, i want my kids to go here. The professors actually care and invest and you! Best place ever!"
Junior,5,"Online school has been nice with covid and it hasnt been to crazy! I love the school so much, i want my kids to go here. The professors actually care and invest and you! Best place ever!"
Freshman,5,"Everybody is so friendly. From the moment I first visited the campus during my college search, I've felt welcomed."
Junior,5,Fairly easy. Professors made online learning productive and feasible. Professors were understanding  of individual student's circumstances.
Freshman,5,I am taking online classes at Baylor and they are great! Professors really work with you and I believe people should really consider them over some face to face classes.
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Baylor, the environment is more than beautiful and the staff is extremely  supportive of your goals. Overall, great University!"
Freshman,5,"I am taking 3 classes online in the fall. I have not done anything with them yet, but I have done orientation and academic advising with Baylor online. My academic adviser was super helpful and was able to easily work around the setbacks of quarantine."
Freshman,5,"Baylor University is a great choice for a four year home! The campus is gorgeous, being an old university you expect it to look rundown and outdated, but it is in an amazing condition, and the interiors of buildings like the school of business are super modern. The people at Baylor are also super friendly. Professors feel like friends, and your classmates feel like family. Sic 'Em!"
Freshman,5,Baylor has a variety of friendly students and staff that make you feel at home with this open community. It is a spectacular college to attend to with their electrifying community of students and academic performances.
Freshman,5,The online learning experience at Baylor was very professional when navigating through it. The teachers help along each step of the way and I am able to obtain the same capable knowledge as I would in a classroom.
Junior,5,All my professors switched to online teaching incredibly well. They made the tests fair for the circumstances and adjusted the course load to reflect online learning.
Junior,5,Been at Baylor for two years now. It's a great research facility. My major department has wonderful and passionate professors. The campus is gorgeous. Dorms are good. The class sizes are smaller than at other universities and the people here are very kind. Only downside for me is that the gym could be better.
Freshman,5,"As soon as I walked onto the Baylor Campus it felt like where I was supposed to be. Everyone was so welcoming, and the campus its self is just beautiful. My favorite thing about Baylor is it medium size. You get the feel as well as all of the perks  of a big school, but you have smaller classes, so you're not just a number in the classroom, and you can have more one on one time with your professors. Another aspect of Baylor that stood out to me was all of the opportunities it has on campus. Various extra curricular, numerous clubs and sports teams, and an amazing outlet for religious faith. My experience with staff has been astounding, all willing to help in any way they can. I don't think I would change one thing about this school. Baylor University is the perfect place to be."
Freshman,5,"Im actually taking two online classes this summer. Ive been in contact with my professors, and both have been extremely helpful and are always willing to answer my questions. The online learning tools are very simple to use and easy to understand. Baylor has made their online learning a fool proof system and very user friendly. I don't have any complaints about it."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed the smaller school atmosphere. The campus is beautiful and the architecture has so much history behind it. From the very beginning, I knew the staff at Baylor was there for me every step of the way. The inclusion of the parents to keep them involved and informed is key to the application process and making important decisions. But I must say that the best part of Baylor is the strong christian beliefs that is shared among the entire staff and students. I felt at home as soon as I stepped foot at Baylor."
Junior,5,Baylor university's online learning experience was better than any other college I've been to. They have someone helping you navigate your courses and offer online or even in-person assistance
Junior,5,"The environment that surrounds the campus is astounding. People from across the world travel to Baylor university to experience the captivating traditions Baylor bears create week after week. From running the Baylor line to Christmas on 5th street, Baylor constantly looks for ways to not just make your money worth, but to assure you that you made the right decision in choosing your college and education. One experience of this was welcome week when I first moved in. There are community leaders that make you feel welcome into the apartment complex of where you'll be staying by helping you move in and offer stress free Sundays or painting with a twist, activities that are designed for you to meet others and on occasion, even get free food! If anyone hits the mark for overachieving, its Baylor and it's where you want to be."
Sophomore,5,"So far, Baylor has made sure that every single student feels loved and included through activities and classes. I love that every professor is kind, the president is involved in lots, and I always feel safe. They don't push religion on anyone and the education is superior."
Sophomore,5,"The best college experience I could ask for. It is big enough to have research opportunities/ be “known” in academics and sports, but it is small enough to foster good student/ staff relationships and not just feel like a “number”. Christian values and fun university-wide  traditions make it unique and different than every other school. Campus is also beautiful! This university is incredible and has been a great environment for me to grow in many ways. I feel so blessed to go here and I would highly recommend it!!!"
Graduate Student,5,"I love Baylor so much! I transferred from a community college, which I did not enjoy, and Baylor was such a breath of fresh air! Everyone is so loving, and I immediately felt at home when I stepped foot on campus."
Freshman,5,"I am an out of state student and coming to Baylor was one of the best decisions that I had ever made. I was able to meet some of my best friends in the whole world and my teachers are kind, compassionate, and they genuinely want to see me succeed. Everyone says this about their school, but Baylor students can agree that the Baylor experience is different than any other schooling experience."
Niche User,5,The people were very kind towards me and were quick to help others. The energy of everyone made me feel like I was at home already.
Freshman,5,"Great school with challenging, yet rewarding academics. Campus is beautiful and most professors are top-tier in their scholarly and teaching ability. Definitely recommend studying here"
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy Baylor university for my college experience. If you are looking for a private university that is not super small than Baylor is the one for you. The party scene is not the best and the sorority life is mediocre. On the other hand, spiritual life and religion are high and many people have good values stored in them when they grew up. Classes are hard. I've heard that majors like communication are easier and people don't do much, but being in a science major, I study all day and do spend a quite large amount of time in the library. Classes are not impossible to get like at a state school but some do get filled up more than others especially the ones with good professors. Overall I feel like the professors really do want you to succeed and care a lot about your education, and have really enjoyed Baylor as a whole."
Freshman,5,"I am an enrolling freshman at Baylor. In the midst of the coronavirus, Baylor has been very helpful with communication. They have definitely eased some of my stress for this next year."
Sophomore,5,"Baylor is a beautiful campus, with small classes & professors who care about not just your grade, but your well being. The Christian environment and tight knit family feel of the student body is like no other school"
Junior,5,"I love the traditions, there are so many at Baylor that you have something going on about once a month"
Freshman,4,The online experience was new and  exciting due to how its a change of scenery and the classes I took were amazing and I learned so much about being yourself and staying positive.
Sophomore,4,"The academics, the faculty, and the resources of Baylor University are all fantastic! It is also very in-tune with its Christian morals and standards. That being said however, Baylor is still a bit closed minded and traditional in its values. Not necessarily a bad thing- just something to be aware of."
Sophomore,4,Baylor has an amazing sense of community and amazing resources. I wish that in some aspects they were open minded and pushed the boundaries of certain aspects of traditional southern and Christian culture
Alum,4,"I mean of course it sucked, but professors were very accommodating and kind. I'm grateful to them for being so compassionate during such a difficult time."
Alum,4,"Baylor has the best of both worlds in regards to large state schools vs smaller institutions. Has the resources, alumni network, and sports that a larger university would have while also being small enough to know your professors personally, decent class sizes, and community feel when you step on campus. The only complaint I have is the close-minded views that you will occasionally run into (as you would expect going to a Baptist school). And the student body could stand to be more diverse, of course."
Junior,4,"All of my classes were switched online last March during the pandemic and I was surprised with how well professors handled it. The quality of the online class definitely varied by department... I found that the more upper-level courses were taught the best with a little less organization and thought being given to the more core classes. Overall, I think Baylor did a great job with such a short amount of time to prepare. I'm hopeful for new systems and plans they have in place for coming semesters and online courses."
Senior,4,"Not the best, but it was a quick turnaround for the things they provided for us and it did not hinder my learning."
Sophomore,4,"I have taken many courses online at Baylor, both during the regular semester and summer and I was pleasantly surprised and encouraged by how well the instructors conveyed the material in the online format. I was able to manage my own schedule, sometimes I had mandatory zoom meetings for class time or additional instruction. Online classes have really given me some freedom with my schedule, allowing me to complete assignments in different locations than my desk. Technical issues seem to be the only downside to online learning in my experience  As long as you practice good discipline and time management, online learning is a great resource."
Junior,4,"One of Baylor's strengths is its small class sizes and community focus. The transfer to online courses with professors not used to an online environment was not easy, but professors are extremely flexible and understanding."
Junior,4,"Baylor University is an amazing school with strong core values and a dedication to student life. I work as a Community Leader (RA) in the freshmen women's dormitory and I have not heard of another school that loves its student as much as Baylor. As a Business student, I know that my professors care about me, know me by name, and will do their best to help me achieve success. If you're even just thinking about attending Baylor, please consider it! It's truly special to be at a university so centered around its students."
Junior,4,I love that Baylor has so much to offer in terms of career opportunities. It gives you a sense of togetherness and brings so many different cultures and perspectives to the table. They have a fabulous team of professors that guide you throughout your college.
Junior,4,I took summer classes and half of my spring semester is online. All went smoothly and the professors were very supportive and understanding of the circumstances which really helped a lot. They also made sure to provide so many extra resources both for academics and for their students health.
Freshman,4,I had to attend orientation online but the website was done well and instructions over email were given clearly so to avoid any confusion.
Freshman,4,My very first Line Camp had to be online and it went great. My leader was very informative and I got to learn a lot about the campus traditions in a safe environment.
Junior,4,Most of the people are friendly and kind. Some people are a little more stuck up. I have had a hard time finding where I fit in.
Junior,4,"I love the Baylor bubble, but it truly is a bubble of privilege if you do not pay attention. The school tries really hard to give a great experience for students, but there is a lot of change that still needs to happen. The new President has been doing a great job, and it is a wonderful college."
Junior,4,"I have had a couple of classes online, and majority of the professors are super understanding. They do not make it terrible in certain majors, but the professors are starting to get used to teaching this way."
Sophomore,4,I love the environment of Baylor and the fact that with everything going on they are listening to the voices of their students. The president really goes above and beyond in making sure that her students are protected in and out of the learning environment.
Junior,4,"Baylor is an academically challenging school. Many of the professors care about their subjects of interest and are engaging. The religious background of Baylor is very apparent in everyday life - if you are not a Christian you may feel like an outside. However, like many schools, it is about finding your interests and those who share similar interests to you. Overall, Baylor is a spirited and good school."
Sophomore,4,"Baylor is very welcoming and has many great traditions. Most of the professors are great and really care about the students. One thing I would like to see change in is the cost of tuition and other required costs. It is very expensive and especially because of Covid, they should reduce the price of tuition. I already know several people who are not returning to Baylor in the fall because of the cost."

I already know several people who are not returning to Baylor in the fall because of the cost."
Sophomore,4,The school actually listens to what the students want and really prioritize the experience which the school can give to new students.
Sophomore,4,"I love the community at Baylor. Everyone is super friendly and willing to help in any way possible. I also love how strongly Baylor prides themselves upon their faith-based curriculum. The academics at Baylor are challenging, but they have instilled in my a life-long love of learning. The teachers are very helpful and are willing to help their students in any way possible."
Freshman,4,The online experience at Baylor was necessary to complete my application due to COVID-19. Baylor did not miss a beat when it came to going online with the steps I needed to take to make my college preparation a success. Baylor was already on board with their online tools before the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been a very smooth online process for me.
Junior,4,"I took all of my classes online for Spring 2020 because of COVID-19. While the experience was not all bad, it could be better. All of my professors were really understanding and flexible with deadlines because of student conditions. I did not have the most reliable access to the internet, which did affect learning in some classes, because the Zoom call would lag and I would miss pieces of information."
Junior,4,"Baylor University has allowed me to develop and strengthen my own identity. Coming from a sheltered small town, Baylor has given me opportunities and access to resources that I could have only imagined about prior. There are quite a number of clubs available to the student population that it wouldn't be  problem finding something to enjoy. Amenities such as the gym, the student union building, and more go really enhance the student experience. Small class sizes and approachable, committed professors had really enabled me to enjoy my educational experience more. While there is certainly more work to be done in order to improve Baylor's commitment to diversity and minority populations,  my experience with Baylor has overall been amazing."
Sophomore,4,"Although the semester was cut short, I was still able to have many great experiences. I cannot wait to go back in the fall."
Sophomore,4,I liked the professors. They all seemed to actually care about me as a person and my future. They were also very approachable and also made classes as fun and productive overall. The school as a whole also has a great environment.
Sophomore,4,"Since this Covid stuff, we had our semester online, and though it was difficult, the professors made sure everyone was safe and healthy before shoving a ton of work on us. Most made lecture videos, others did FaceTime calls."
Senior,4,I think Baylor is an excellent university with great academics and ways for students to get involved. I would like to see more diversity at Baylor.
Sophomore,4,"A truly great community that feels like family from the moment you step on campus. Strong academics, caring professors and great student life!"
Sophomore,4,Pretty easy transition to online learning and did feel that I was still learning a lot. The online discussion boards were nice but really did not contribute greatly to my learning
Junior,4,I like the environment and the overall positivity of most of the students and faculty on campus. The location of Baylor is great and there are many activities to do on campus and in the surrounding areas.
Junior,4,With corona we had to shift to online learning and most of my professors were very understanding. They recorded lectures in advance and had tests open for a wide time frame to accommodate students living in different time zones.
Sophomore,4,Baylor has been a great place to grow as a student and person with helpful faculty and amazing professors.
Sophomore,4,"If you like small towns and a welcoming atmosphere, Baylor is a great school. Baylor is known for its medicine and business programs, so if you are interested in any of these careers, this will be a great fit. This institution is a predominantly white institution so diversity is not that great. Also, you will be required to attend chapel for two semesters as well as two religion courses."
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed the atmosphere. Everyone was very genuine and eager to share about Baylor. It was so fun to be able to experience the culture and all aspects of Baylor. The staff was very helpful and kind. The Cowboy Coffee was delicious.
Freshman,4,"Baylor is more than a school, they make you feel more than just a 'number'. That means a lot to me as a current student."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the baylor community, their isnt really anything I would like to change , because I've only had one semester and it was a really awesome semester."
Niche User,4,"Great ambiance/atmosphere, Friendly faces around every corner! Excellent dorming options and dining halls. Disaster preparedness is amazing!"
Niche User,4,"i do not attend baylor however, they have been quick to respond and have been a tremendous amount of help. I highly recommend getting your process started with them."
Freshman,4,"Baylor offers a quality education in a very friendly environment. However, there is not much diversity here."
Freshman,4,"This place has been very friendly to me. The only real complaint I've had is that there are way too many white people here. Guess that's what you'd expected. Anyway, great campus, nice town."
Freshman,4,Baylor is a very inclusive and diverse campus with a community that is always more than willing to help every and all students. The traditions the campus carries ensures everyone is included in the community and establishes a home to involve oneself in.
Niche User,4,"Excellent university with a beautiful campus. As a research university, professors are practicing experts in their field."
Sophomore,4,"You will probably not love the first semester if you are a girl trying to join a sorority due to the rush rules (cannot go out first semester for the most part). After the second semester though, you will not want to ever leave this amazing school. You will meet some of the most genuine and caring people. You will learn to love Waco. You will make friends with your professors because they care so much about your personal success and want to be your friend (in the Business and English departments at least). Also, I would like to say that we should at least get a B+ or A- for the party scene I am a little offended. Just because the parties are not huge, does not mean they suck. I think they're a good size and you will know most people at these parties and so it's basically like partying with a group of 100 friends plus a few random people. ANYWAYS... can't imagine myself at any other school, I have really never known this many caring and genuine people in my life."
Graduate Student,4,"I love the campus! I am in the Communication Sciences and Disorders program, and all of the professors are intentional and kind. The clinic on campus is spacious and a high quality setting for learning."
Freshman,4,Baylor has a very friendly and accepting atmosphere that makes you feel like you’re part of a family. The professors care about how you’re doing and are plainly excited about what they teach.
Sophomore,4,"While in Texas, Baylor can be considered a diverse school. Do keep in mind that it is still Texas and no where near as diverse as schools in different states may be."
Sophomore,4,Good school with very good people. Some questionable policies but for the most part a great place to further your education. :)
Niche User,4,"As a hopeful Baylor Bear, I have toured the campus and I'm impressed with what Baylor has to offer. During the tour, I received important information on what to expect as an incoming freshmen and the rich tradition that goes along with it. Fingers crossed that I'm accepted!"
Freshman,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful and the school tries its hardest to get their students involved. They have a home feeling and host Dr pepper hour every Tuesday (which is Dr Pepper and ice cream). Most of the professors are amazing, unless you get one that isn't used to teaching freshman, then it gets a bit difficult."
Niche User,4,I really don’t have experience with Baylor my mom work there.i know how the place look and it look real good to me.i at they food before and other things went to games and others.
Sophomore,4,"I’ve had a great Baylor experience so far. I love the student to teacher ratio, and it is easy to build relationships with professors at Baylor. I would appreciate for monetary gifts to not go straight to athletics, and renovate buildings, or improve major programs instead."
Junior,4,"Being a student at Baylor, or any college depends on making a way for yourself. Whatever you choose to invest in and the people you connect with with shape your entire four years. However, it is very easy to stay in these pools of influence. If you do not connect with professors, they won't watch out for you, if you focus just on Greek life, you can miss out on other interests of yours.  Although it is a ""Baptist"" school, they are becoming more accepting of other religions and practices which are not traditionally Baptist. Baylor is a place willing to grow, its southern location often hinders that. Tuition is a bit much for what you get. Sports and business building are well funded, all other academics are often left behind in financial support. Great honors programs and student-teacher ratios!"
Sophomore,4,"Baylor is awesome! Professors are really nice! The campus is so beautiful and Moody Library is one of the best! Lady Bears is the champion! Homecoming, Christmas and DIA are really fun! Highly recommend! I hope there will be more Asian restaurants in Waco, and menus at the campus can be more diverse."
Sophomore,4,"While my first year at Baylor was not easy in some aspects, I formed community that was beyond supportive and contributed to my character a great deal. The campus is beautiful and people are so genuinely kind that it makes the college experience fun."
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere of this school. The only thing is that it is very expensive but the staff are very helpful and they have so many programs to help you make the most of your college experience and learning.
Sophomore,4,"Chapel was difficult to really connect with, even for a practicing christian. However, the BIC program really connected all the core classes in a way that interested me."
Niche User,4,"When I took a tour of Baylor, I immediately felt welcomed. The staff that I met were very friendly and answered any questions I had. The campus is beautiful and well maintained. Learning about the history of the campus and how Baylor came to be was interesting. The traditions like, running the Baylor Line and homecoming made it feel like Baylor was truly a family."
Junior,2,"Online learning is a joke. Last semester all of my classes got moved online for the last few weeks and this semester I am taking about half of my course load online, even though I actively tried to avoid online classes. Zoom meeting drag on and some teachers pay no regard to the traditional class length and upload very long (like double or in some cases triple the traditional class length). Classes online are not engaging. Almost no one goes to many of them and those who do have their camera off and hardly speak. A lot of the work feels like busy work and using Lockdown Browser to do tests would be manageable if the program didn’t always crash my computer. However my computer barely handles the program, I don’t have money for a new one, and my current teachers have a zero tolerance policy for technology malfunction - so ridiculous (even though one teacher frequently cancels class do to her own internet issues). Hope things get back to normal soon."
Sophomore,2,It’s is a struggle Professors have come to absolutely overload students with work since they are not seeing them in person.
Alum,2,"The courses were extremely unchallenging, (as compared to my first year at Texas A&M, where I actually had to study) the culture is supremely religious and repressed. The students were all little sycophants spouting their religious rhetoric and actively shunning anyone who did not think, act, or look like them. The greek system reigns supreme--if you are not involved in a Frat/Sorority, you are a non-entity. The best thing I can say about this university is that the administrative staff was always incredibly helpful and friendly and had enough autonomy to take actions that were meaningful. (Literally the opposite from my experience at Sam Houston State) The campus is lovely, but many of the buildings are very old and dilapidated--smelling of mold and mildew. The cost of attending is outrageous. They purport ""the most aid given of any private U in Texas"" but as a transfer student with excellent grades and test scores I was awarded zero aid from the school."
Sophomore,2,"Online was a difficult transition for me. When I was living on campus, I had a routine and was able to study for hours and hours by myself. After going home and doing work online, I found that the home environment came along with many distractions such as having to find a job, having to do chores, and attend to siblings."
Junior,2,"It is a beautiful campus but it lacks diversity. I am currently on the pre-medical track and I think many of the science professors overcomplicate things in order to ""weed out"" people."
Freshman,2,I was satisfied with the education but everything else pretty much sucked. Almost everyone here is the same. Majority of people go home if (they can) on weekends. Not worth the amount of money it costs.
Freshman,2,"If you are looking for diversity this is not the school to go to. Fortunately, there are always things to do on campus like fairs. The workload is DISRESPECTFUL compared to public universities so be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to your studies. The professors so far have not been as understanding and welcoming as everyone claims, but communicating goes a long way (just like any other professor at any university). I spend more time teaching myself material than learning it in class which is normal; however, considering the price of Baylor, it is not worth it."
Freshman,2,"I’m a freshman at baylor and i live in Ruth Collins hall it is literally disgusting i cannot believe the amount i pay to live here. If you’re a girl, odds are you’ll live at crusty collins as well so I’m sorry! I’m transferring next year I’m from Las Vegas and I’m in complete culture shock. Most girls here are so fake especially the ones rushing. The parties are small compared to other big 12 schools but there’s normally one everyweekend which is nice. If you’re looking to have fun and do well baylor is not for you there’s literally nothing fun to do in Waco besides party and half the time they’re not even fun. If you want religion forced down your throat then baylor is for you!! I regret coming here to be so honest the degree plans are all outdated and from the 50s, i feel like I’m waisting my time here. Oh and icing on the cake the only thing we had Going for us is football and now we’re The actual worst at that so don’t even waste your time applying"
Sophomore,2,"If you don't make a group of friends quickly, your chance of making friends within your first year is slim to none. Everyone is extremely (emphasis on extremely) cliquey (extra emphasis on cliquey). Not diverse in terms of political beliefs, race, culture, etc. 95% of the student body here are cookie cutter sheltered private-school rich kids who suddenly want to go buck wild at the first scent of freedom. Parties are boring and sweaty. Tons of people drink regularly, especially frat/sorority typical dorms. The dating scene is either super intense with people getting engaged in 2 months or people who just want to fool around for a few years before the sobering reality of adulthood hits them. Lastly, the Title XI policy here is a complete joke- they don't care if you're sexually assaulted, they care about paying it off and covering it up as quickly as possible. If you're going to have to spend money on any college, don't waste it on this one. There are so many better colleges out there."
Niche User,2,"Overall, Baylor is an excellent university... but it is certainly not for everyone. The student body lacks diversity and the location is not ideal."
College Sophomore,2,Frat houses are where parties are located.
College Sophomore,2,"Frat parties are the only ""grown-up"" parties."
College Sophomore,2,Baylor Title IX is under investigation.
College Sophomore,2,Earle/Teal has a good community. U. House doesn't.
College Junior,2,living on campus sucks. the size of the room that you get for what you are paying for does not compare. do not live on campus any longer than you have to.
College Freshman,2,"Since my freshman year on Baylor has come and passed, there have been numerous sexual assault cases that have come to light. One of my friends and classmate was sexually assaulted at a frat part while she was drunk and we have some frats on campus who are known for drugging girls. Baylor is fairly strict on what they allow in freshman dorms, but that hasn't stopped the host of rapes that have occurred. They need to improve campus safety and Title IX training."
Recent Alumnus,2,I wasn't Greek but found them all annoying as hell.
College Freshman,2,I never felt truly cared for by any of my professors. Professors will never admit they are wrong even if they are. They definitly hyped up the small class sizes more then there actually is. You don't get an easy A ever.
College Freshman,2,I haven't personally experienced it but I heard the alumni network is awful in comparison to other schools.
College Freshman,2,"Sororities and Fraternities at Baylor are literally pointless. First of all, they don't have any housing so they stay in touch with ""meetings"" and ""dinners"". They don't actually throw a lot of on-campus events. People who wear the letters only talk to other people with letters. You can definitely feel the shade if you're non-greek. Don't pressure yourself to try and go just because you want to make friends, though. From what I can tell, the friendships are superficial anyways."
College Freshman,2,"I honestly thought Baylor would be a place I could grow in community and faith and be able to branch out from high school. I was wrong because it is exactly like high school all over again. I went to all the events that they set up to meet new people all year long, however, I still felt alone in the end. There is not much diversity, and wherever they try to create it, it's an obvious barrier. The ""higher powers"" of Baylor don't really care about you or your experience. I never connected with any of the professors there, which is strange since I usually connect with teachers the most. The town of Waco is boring and is quickly becoming a tourist trap for Fixer Upper fans. Unless you are a white conservative who is coming with your high school friends, I would steer clear of this cliquey school."
College Freshman,2,"I chose to live in the oldest womens dorm because of the social aspect of living.  Although the atmosphere is fun and exciting, the dorm is old and rather disgusting.  There is mold growing everywhere and bugs in all of the bathrooms and rooms.  I feel like since tuition is so expensive, I should be able to live in a more cleanly environment."
College Junior,2,"I am just turned off by Greek life in general. They promote community development and service, yet are some of the least diverse, least altruistic organizations around."
College Freshman,2,Tough to get classes and some professors are terrible.
College Sophomore,2,"There are parties every weekend, and all of them are off campus."
College Freshman,2,Nightlife is pretty non-existent and the parties are okay
College Freshman,2,"The parties are okay to almost non-existent. If I could change one thing, it would be to create a better party scene"
College Freshman,2,Frats try to have parties but they're terrible.  They're only trying to hit on girls and get in their pants
College Freshman,2,Frats try to have parties but they're terrible.
College Freshman,2,"If you go to a frat party here and are a female, you will get hit on by creepy drunk guys who just want in your pants.  A lot of sexual abuse happens under the radar here, and Baylor fails to tell you about it.  However, the university did just create a Title 9 office."
College Freshman,2,"Girls become brats and guys become creeps.  The sorority you join automatically defines who you are, as does the fraternity you join.  If you don't participate in Greek life, you're frowned upon."
College Freshman,2,"I don't party much. I've been to three parties all year and all of them weren't that great. I don't drink and going to these parties it seems like you have to get drunk in order to have a good time. I prefer to go to Wild West on Thursday nights to go dancing. Many of the fraternity parties offer a great opportunities to socialize with fraternity brothers and try to get a bid, but it is only useful if you plan to rush and I have no interest in rushing a fraternity."
College Junior,2,The room was tiny and I paid a ton
College Freshman,2,The police officers are complete and total jerks. Parking services look to ticket you for every little thing and there is little parking so it can be expected that one will get at least one ticket.
College Senior,2,"School costs $19000 to attend per semester.  between me and my husband we made $50,000 the year before between the two of us and I only received $1000 in financial aid."
College Freshman,2,"Greeks don't even have houses here. Also people in frats/sororities are usually very cliquey and act like they're in high school. The parties are not good, and Greek life doesn't improve the community."
College Freshman,2,Off campus dining is mainly just fast food places in sketchy areas of Waco. There's no ethnic cuisine and no student discounts.
College Freshman,2,No on campus parties. The ones off campus can be good but Baylor really doesn't have a huge party scene.
College Freshman,2,Financial aid process is difficult and given based on SAT scores. Other scholarships are difficult to apply for and find.
College Freshman,2,"Campus food is not good. The dining halls have decent food when the university has a lot of visitors, but besides that the food is unhealthy, bad, or has hair/bugs. Very little variety. Also the dining halls have terrible hours, the one closest to me is closed during weekends so I usually just don't eat. Had I known about BU's real dining before I came to Baylor, my choice in universities would be different. Shows that Baylor really doesn't care about students and the meal workers are extremely rude."
College Freshman,2,"Personally I feel that if there going to increase tuition and overall cost of attendance, they should at least offer more scholarships to students."
College Freshman,2,We need more restaurants in Waco! I am from Austin and love eating out. I get so tired of the few chain restaurants that are available.
College Freshman,2,"As a family of six, with two older sisters who have already gone to college and have tons of student loans to pay off, financial aid is a necessity for my family and me. Baylor is an expensive school that I truly can't afford. Baylor gave me financial aid, but not nearly enough for me to be able to attend the school for four years."
College Freshman,2,"Let's face it, Waco is unsafe. There's some interesting areas in it, some good stuff. But Baylor is the safe, shining city on the hill and the surrounding area is a little scary. Even so, Baylor is worth dealing with Waco."
College Sophomore,2,I feel that other factors should be taken into account when considering getting financial aid.
College Freshman,2,"I'm currently housed in Kokernot, which is by far the worst dorm I've seen on campus. Everything is out of date and falling apart and I am very unhappy every time I have to come 'home.' Some dorms, like Brooks Flats, are more acceptable, but it's hard for many students since the price is double most other dorms."
College Freshman,2,"The First Year Experience:

South Russel-female residents, recently refurbished, has extremely nice amenities, residents typically do not go greek

Collins-female residents, has new lounge space, decent amenities, residents typically go greek

Kokernot-female residents, decently nice, used as an overflow residence hall, residents typically do not go greek

Penland-Male residents, soon to be refurbished, terrible amenities, residents typically go greek

Martin-Male residents, terrible amenities, residents typically do not go greek

Pretty much the guys get shafted"
College Freshman,2,"Everyone gets at least a little bit of aid, but it usually doesn't cover more than 25% of your cost of attendence (unless you're a national merit finalist or your parents work at Baylor). I got good scholarship because my mom works in higher education and we used a ""tuition exchange"" program."
College Freshman,2,Bayor is expensive and there should be more aid
College Freshman,2,"Baylor could be so great if it didn't do so many things to make the student's lives harder. They hand out parking tickets like Oprah hands out free stuff and they're super strict on attendance policy and if you use your phone in chapel (a required class that everyone has to take), you get kicked out and you're not counted present for the day. But athletes are allowed to talk all they want and be on their phones and none of them get the slightest reprimanding."
College Junior,2,"There are not many quality, off-campus dining options that are close by. Many are either expensive, unhealthy, or open at inconvenient hours. The variety isn't great, but the further out from campus you get the better the options become."
College Senior,2,I have no idea if we have support services that help victims who have been sexually assaulted.
College Senior,2,I did not like eating at the dining halls. I only ate their because I had a meal plan and it was convenient. Most of the hours were very inconvenient.
College Sophomore,2,"I have celiac disease and my diet is restrictive.  While the dining hall is very accommodating, if I do not arrive during designated hours, I will not be able to obtain a suitable meal and will have to eat off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone on campus is white.  I am black, but I am able to make a lot of friends."
College Junior,2,housing is sooo expensive on campus and you do NOT get your monies worth.
College Junior,2,"off-campus housing is expensive if you want a place that is just ""okay"". for the quality you are paying wayyyy more than what you should. picking a place with a pool is unnecessary too. paying extra for a pool isn't ideal when most pools you can just walk into & use without even living there or a membership."
College Junior,2,"The stereotypical Baylor student is rich, white, and Christian. Many people seem to fit this mold quite well, and those who don't tend to feel like they don't fit in."
College Junior,2,It is a baptist university so most of the student population is very much christian
College Junior,2,It's a very expensive school and I wish there were more opportunities for scholarships.
Freshman,1,Horrible horrible horrible. Money hungry and so cold hearted. I worked as a student fundraiser and talked to the most vile alumni and still managed to raise thousands despite the job being literally soul sucking. I was charged a bogus $300 fee after transferring that I have been in an 8 month battle with the university over. The president’s office thanked me for my service but refused to take away the charge. The professors here are not here for you in any way and will refuse to work around your schedule under the guise of teaching you responsibility. Having a job you needed to go to to pay for school wasn’t a good enough excuse for missing SI meetings that happened at the same time. The environment is cut throat and the professors will pit students against one another. Not religiously tolerant or very accepting. Checkout @dearbaylor on instagram for more. Not the place for you unless you’re a white trust fund baby who is planning to be a business major.
Freshman,1,Didn’t take any online but I still have to fill out this portion of the review process. I’m sure classes were fine idk.
Alum,1,n/a did not take any online courses but this app is forcing me to rate it and forcing a 100 character review.
Junior,1,"I am a parent and have a freshman and junior at Baylor. They can never get into the classes they want because all the classes they want are full. I don’t know if it’s because Baylor accepts too many students or if my daughters’ last names begin with W or what the problem is. Even the classes with the worst professors are full. It’s ridiculous. Our 3rd daughter will not be going to Baylor. Also, my oldest two girls have a 3.89 and 3.62 GPAs and have scholarships so maybe that’s why they are stressing out and waiting lists every single semester."
Senior,1,"If the color of skin of your skin isn’t white, do not come to this school. You’ve been warned. It’s a great university, with great professors, but it’s amazing just how racist the student body is. You’ll feel out of place at all times, you won’t date, you’ll have a a hard time making friends, and you’ll be overwhelmed by the obnoxious holier than thou persona of your peers. Unfortunately, there is little to no diversity at this school. Whether that diversity is religious beliefs, ethnicities, or personalities. And whatever diversity is present, is secretly shunned by the majority of the student body. White supremacy is at full force at this school."
Niche User,1,"There is nothing to do in Waco. All you will get to do is go to the movies, eat, or hang out with friends. I suggest not going here. STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!!"
Sophomore,1,Professors made false claims against m y fellow peers in order to get them to drop a class/ switch majors because they simply didn't like them as individuals. they don't try to help you graduate but rather put many restrictions on students hoping to get them to stay longer to make more money.
Works Here,1,"No diversity. If you want to grow in diverse environments for your future and you want to observe a diverse point of view for your career, seek other schools. Your precious four years will be totally wasting."
Junior,1,"Baylor has tried its best to bring me down and throw every obstacle my way. I learned very late in my sophomore year that those in my major have to do an internship, which would not be a problem, but the internship cannot be fulfilled until after second semester senior year (unless a student wishes to do a FASHION internship in Waco at the same time as the senior collection class). Baylor has charged me for everything - parking (which was not clearly defined), books that were specific to Baylor, fountains, tuition rises, materials needed for my major, and just the cost of living there. Before classes even began Freshman year, Baylor made the social aspect of college difficult by putting me in Arbors apartments, where there is not a sense of community, therefore, going through rush was extremely difficult and did not work out. One thing I will say is that my degree program was very accommodating for my minor. Overall, I do not like Baylor."
Niche User,1,"Overrated. It's diverse in the sense that it admits a diverse group of people and then they split into their own little bubbles forever. Waco sucks, no going around that. It's poor and small. People are religious and just live in their own little bubbles. If you want to isolate yourself from reality it's a great place to be. Academically it's mediocre and definitely not worth the money."
College Freshman,1,"The culture of Baylors sexual violence is something that makes me sick every day. How could they go so far to try and cover up sexual violence instances to make their own name look good? They don't care about their students, they just want to keep their ""prestige"". They have an ""Its on Us"" program but it is a joke. They make bystanders feel responsible for rape even though they ignore the fact a majority of rape cases happen when the victim is alone. I will never understand why it took so long for baylor to get a title 9 program. I just pray no one I know EVER has to go through Baylors sexual violence program if smething were to happen to them."
College Freshman,1,"I lived in Collins my freshman year and it was HORRIBLE. I wish I could be dramatic when I say that but it's so true. We had a problem with pests the beginning of the year and it took sooo long to get anyone to deal with it, and they treated us like we were making things up whenever we got anyone to take care of it. The visiting hours are awfully strict. If you live on the sixth floor you only get to have boys on the floor from 1-6pm Saturdays and Sundays. It actually feels like were in the 1840s again. The showers are disgusting. I will say the cleaning crew does a great job and they are very underappreciated for the work they do day in and day out. The CLs were pointless. The building is falling apart. No one respects the quiet hours. Don't live in Collins for the ""tradition"" or for rush because you'll realize how pointless it truly is."
College Sophomore,1,"It depends on the way you look at it.  If you're into going out and getting wasted Thursday-Sunday, you'll love it."
College Freshman,1,Very little racial diversity.  LGBT is not accepted here and you can be kicked out if you openly portray yourself as LGBT
College Freshman,1,"DO NOT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL.  If you are not from Texas and extremely religious, you will not fit in, but rather shamed upon.  Also, if you are not extremely outgoing and a preppy socialite, you will not be accepted in any social aspects.  Baylor is the absolute worst and I know many people who plan to transfer.  Over priced and over exaggerated."
College Freshman,1,"Baylor is very deep into their traditions.  I love my major and think the classes are wonderful, but not all teachers are there to look out for their students.  Many of my teachers have not cared about how students perform.   Do not be fooled by Baylor's campus tours.  They will make everything out to be absolutely perfect, but you will be disappointed. Everyone on the tours seems extremely friendly and like they want you there, but in reality, once you attend the university you see just how much you don't matter to anyone else.  The school is not worth it for the price.  DO NOT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL IF YOU ARE NOT FROM TEXAS.  All students that have previously gone to Texas high schools will stay in their tight-knit friend groups, leaving all out of staters left out for good.  The Greek life is ridiculous.  You will go in and realize that many bonds between sororities and fraternities have already been formed between students who have attended the same Texas schools in the past.  It is very unfair to out of staters.  As far as religion goes, Baylor is a Baptist University and they mean it.  There are two semesters of chapel requirements and also two semesters of required religion classes.  If you are not an extremely religious person DO NOT GO TO BAYLOR.  You will be very judged if you attend Baylor and are not super into your religion. Baylor University and its students are too wound up in their money and religion.  Do not attend this university."
College Sophomore,1,"Baylor is exactly what you would think it would be. You'll have a great time if you're in the Greek life but if you're not you will either have to be in Pre-med to ""have a life"". It's very difficult to meet genuine people. The campus is beautiful and the classes are awesome but the people are the worst."
College Freshman,1,"Baylor has a dry campus and administration is strict on alcohol and drug use, they don't seem to understand that this is college. Parking police are awful and ticket excessively. Also curfew is from 1-10 on weekdays and 1-midnight on weekends."
College Freshman,1,"Living on campus is not the best option. Most people are not happy with dorm life. The people in dorms are not friendly, the cost is high, and there are barely any amenities. Also has curfew hours- people of the opposite gender are not allowed in your dorm past 10 PM on week nights and midnight on weekends."
College Junior,1,"Baylor probably has stricter rules than most nuns do. There's even some anti-gay policies in their handbook. 0/10 would recommend.

Also, the attendance policy- generally it's pretty loose, but different departments like to add their own ridiculous rules. The classes in my major had a policy of only two absences allowed per class- past that, you'd lose a letter grade. So if you missed class three times and previously had an A, you'd have a B; four times, you'd have a C; etc."
College Junior,1,"Getting financial aid is a pain in the ass, almost to the point of being downright impossible. Even if you get some aid, it likely won't be anywhere near enough to cover even half of the outrageous tuition fees."
College Junior,1,"Nobody at Baylor wants to live in campus housing- a lot of that has to do with their moralistic rules. Examples include 'visitation hours' for members of the opposite sex and a no alcohol policy even for students who are of legal drinking age. Some of these make sense for dorms, but not so much for the apartments that Baylor owns. Besides this, the housing is overpriced- the lower end of the price range will get you residence in a shoddy apartment. There's no roommate matching system- you either request to room with someone you already know, or you get randomly placed with some stranger. This is a recipe for disaster, especially in the dorms (due to the size of the room). Yet, there's a roommate agreement form- required for residents to fill out after moving in- that includes things that could be used to pair roommates (could, if whoever's running campus housing had any common sense) such as what time they like to study, whether they mind noise while studying, etc."
College Freshman,1,"There really isn't much wiggle room for one to let loose. The school is very conservative. If you drive regularly, it's been proven that you're guaranteed to get ticketed at least once per semester. Visiting hours vary depending on the dorm and the floor. Of course since it's a religious school they don't allow sex on campus which in my opinion is stupid. We're paying for the dorms so we should be able to bring whomever we feel comfortable with and have consensual sex with whomever we feel comfortable with."
Recent Alumnus,1,I didn't get any from the school
College Junior,1,"Baylor doesn't have enough housing on campus, so that makes it a rather awful experience. Most dorms need renovation badly, and the community between dorm mates is sorely lacking."
College Junior,1,"Greek life at Baylor is just a popularity contest, which they are all losing in. They barely throw any parties, any on-campus events, they don't socialize out of their frat/sorority, very snobby toward those who aren't Greek, look down upon those who aren't Greek, and they are very judgmental toward everyone on campus. There isn't even a Greek row."
College Sophomore,1,"Since I am an international student, I cannot get any financial aid whatsoever except scholarships."
College Sophomore,1,It is the bigger major on campus so there is constant competition for classes and scheduling
College Freshman,1,There is not enough diversity.
College Freshman,1,"I think Baylor made a list somewhere as one of the least diverse schools in the nation. Most everyone is white, christian, decently well-off money wise, and conservative. I can't speak for how that affects those who are effected by diversity as I fit into the normal Baylor stereotype. But there is some diversity on campus. We have multicultural Greek organizations and most Baylor students are extremely happy. While there are many racial groups on campus, they just don't seem to really mix together. Hopefully that is a change that can come about soon and in the future. Baylor is a private Christian university in the south so the majority of students are conservative or extremely conservative and they will make that known."
College Sophomore,1,Parking at Baylor is an absolute nightmare. Plus the fees are outrageous.
College Freshman,1,"There is rarely any parking on campus, and it costs $300 dollars for the year. Parking sucks."
College Freshman,1,"There is absolutely nothing to do in Waco, Texas."
College Freshman,1,Parking is a major issue on campus. The fees are extremely high with very little parking space. Not to mention the Parking Services who will ticket everything.
College Freshman,1,It's pretty bad. I had to go out and find other people that were different than me and the norm. It can be a daunting task. There are very small populations of diverse students and they usually stay within their own friend group.
College Sophomore,1,The weather is very bipolar.
College Sophomore,1,Waco has no place to have a nightlife. Its a place to study and have fun at the library.
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid is a hassle if you accidentally file your fafsa incorrectly and/or if the data retrieval tool from the IRS on the fafsa didn't work.  The reason as to why my experience with financial aid was bad was because the financial aid office fails to directly inform/explain to people what they still need from you, making things complicated, confusing & very stressful. Financial aid office doesn't help students find students loans if they don't have a co-signer either. When the financial aid office does decide to inform a student that either tuition wasn't fully paid or something went wrong, they have the worst timing to inform you. They call the student either days before classes start or when classes are already started and tell them that their classes are going to be cancelled & they will have to leave if it's not paid. Some students are out-of-state, so informing them that their balance isn't paid off right before/during classes when the students moved away from home, moved onto campus, bought all of their supplies and necessities, paid for parking, got their schedule & professors, bought books & other class requirements, etc., is just completely unprofessional, unsympathetic, incommodious and untimely."
College Freshman,1,"There are very few parties, only one club that I know of and its for country dancing. There is almost nothing to do on a weekend if you are underage and if you don't have a car then your only bet is pizza and netflix."
College Junior,1,Public transportation in Waco is not recommended for any students.
College Freshman,1,"No special Greek housing. It is expensive to be a part of a sorority. If you aren't part of one, you get left behind socially."
College Freshman,1,"I am from Colorado, the humidity and heat are the worst. I can't stand being outside for most of the year."
College Freshman,1,"You have to either walk or bike everywhere if you aren't blessed with a car. On weekends, when you don't have a car, you're stuck on campus with nothing to do"
College Sophomore,1,"Never enough spots, horrid drivers. If you want your car on campus, go to class very early to get a spot and incase all spots are full."
College Sophomore,1,"There's definitely not a lot of diversity at Baylor. It's a private, baptist university with a huge Greek life, so let that tell you why it gets a D."
College Sophomore,1,"My experience the first year living on campus was alright, though they put me in kokernot which is an alright place to live at best. This year I had signed up to live in east village, the new place on campus, but they didn't tell us they required traditional meal plans until early June. I don't use up my meal plan and was not notified in March when I signed up about this requirement so I left. Now they won't assign me to a room I want eventhough I have literally given them one criteria and they won't release me from the stupid occupancy ""license"" they told me to sign in order to get assigned. So be warned do NOT sign the occupancy ""license"" until you're sure 100% sure about the details of the place you want to live."
College Sophomore,1,I had a terrible experience living on campus. I was thrown into a room on the day of move in with a person whose roommate had just left because the person was so mean. Needless to say it was a terrible experience. I thought that the university did a horrible job of arranging my particular living situation.
College Sophomore,1,Waco is a very poor city and can be a little scary going off campus. There isn't much to do at all for college students. There are a lot of major cities close by though. Dallas and Austin are only about an hour-hour and a half away.
College Sophomore,1,"Most of the guys are very standoffish and pretentious. The ones that aren't are very strange. They are not very diverse, all spoiled rich boys. The girls are predominately preppy rich sorority girls, very blond and very giggly. There are a few down-to-earth people around, but not many."
College Junior,1,"Everything around campus is fast food. If you don't want fast food, you have to drive pretty far. And at that, there are hardly any good restaurants or ethnic eateries. They are things like Chuy's and Cheddar's."
College Junior,1,"You do not need a car to travel between two distances on campus, which is good because parking is always full. I do not have a car, but everyone complains about parking. There are a lot of bike riders on campus though, and plenty of areas to secure them."
College Sophomore,1,There is really not much to do in Waco. It's completely a college town. No arts to speak of.
College Sophomore,1,"The temperature changes so much, so quickly. It will be 30 degrees when I get dressed for class in the morning, and then 80, by 2 O'clock in the afternoon. Plus, whenever it rains, the campus completely floods."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Baylor has a strong religious background. The campus is dry. Drugs are not tolerated. If you get caught, I think you have to go to student court. If it's bad enough, you can get kicked out.

Off campus, I know lots of people throw parties with alcohol - just don't underage drink because cops tend to stop by.

There's not really a major drug scene at our school, but I have heard about non-ADD students taking ADD medication to help them study."
College Junior,1,"The weather here is always fluctuating. It is always either too hot or too cold one day, and the complete opposite the next. In the summer, the air is more dry and hot than humid. In the winter, it still feels like summer sometimes. It rains a lot in the spring time."
College Freshman,1,"Baylor is a private Baptist school, so they are very strict on the campus rules. If a student is caught on campus with any signs of drinking or drug abuse, then that student is immediatly expelled from school and must leave first thing in the morning the next day. I even know a guy and girl that were expelled immediatly because the CL heard them having sex in the guy's dorm room! Baylor has almost no tolerance for students who break the rules."
College Senior,1,"Though we do have a few minority groups represented, most people are white, come from wealthy christian families and tend to lean towards the far right of the political spectrum. The school is not big on diversity and as a minority student, have felt and experienced it throughout the student body."
College Junior,1,"The parking sticker is extremely expensive, normally around the $200 range and there isn't a lot of parking, at least anywhere relatively close to where you need to be.  Also, Baylor Parking Services are very strict about following the rules.  I haven't met a single person who hasn't been fined at some point, myself included.  Also, there really isn't a need for a car on campus.  There is a great busing program as well as the campus is normally withing walking distance for those living off-campus."
College Junior,1,"Out of the Question – Baylor University is rather conservative.  Alcohol is strictly prohibited on campus, and clubbing is discouraged.  However, students sometimes organize small events in order to hang out with friends, such as movie outings.  Theaters offer student discounts, so watching a theatrical release is rather cheap.  Another activity in Waco that college students enjoy doing is tortilla tossing.  Basically, students meet up at the local suspension bridge and throw tortillas into the river.  If nightlife is an absolute necessity, I'm sure Waco has some nightclubs for anyone who is willing to look.  Waco is a mid-sized town, so the clubs might not be up to most people's clubbing standards."
College Sophomore,1,"I only give the greek life this grade because I am not part of it. That being said, I am not the sorority girl type and haven't found any here that I seem to connect with at all. They are mostly preppy Texas girls who wear leggings and shirts that are drastically too large for them. Not saying that they aren't nice people though! They just don't share my personality. And Greek life is THE ONLY thing going on around campus. So if you're like me and think that the greek life/partying isn't your scene, i would strongly suggest not coming to Baylor. You will find yourself sitting in your dorm/apartment every weekend because there aren't that many other organizations (except for church groups), and Waco has nothing to do."

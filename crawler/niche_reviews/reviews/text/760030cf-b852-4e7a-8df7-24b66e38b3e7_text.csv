Alum,5,This school starts everyone out learning foundation courses that are excellent building blocks for all artists. This approach to art education worked very well for me as student non committed to any specific practice or medium. CCAD teaches you how to work hard enough to thrive as a professional artist when you graduate.
Freshman,5,I really love this school it gives you the opportunity to explore different thing you never done. This school makes you stronger and ready for the real world. I only had one issue with 2 teachers and they were disrespectful but this semester I got better teachers and they are awesome.
Niche User,5,I can’t wait to go here! I’m super excited to be able to experience this. I know I’m going to have so much fun
Freshman,5,"The teachers and faculty are very knowledgeable, helpful, and inclusive. The school has a great and friendly atmosphere where all can feel welcome. There are a lot of assignments given, but it is still easy enough to manage to stay on top of the course load."
Niche User,5,They sent me everything quickly and answered all of my questions asap. I was sent all of the information and everything was explained word for word. They basically walked me through the entire process without any confusion.
Sophomore,5,"Although it is hard work, I really do love the support everyone gives. Everyone is very supportive and although you do have bad times it is worth it in the end. I really am proud to be apart of this college. The college offers free counselling and they have a one campus club for LGBT to feel like themselves."
Alum,5,"At CCAD or any other university, you get out of it what you put into it. I had some great professors that outweighed the not so great professors and these great professors are who helped shape me to be the designer I am now. CCAD professors are extremely well connected in the Columbus design scene and will help you get almost any opportunity, these opportunities are what encouraged me to get my masters degree after undergrad."
Sophomore,5,"CCAD is an excellent school filled with inspiration everywhere I look. I am constantly excelling and being encouraged and taught to push my work to the next level. The work we make looks like professional design work, and it is amazing to be saying that only a year and a half into the program. The connections the school has is amazing and there is a constant contact with alumni and designers both local and national."
Freshman,5,"This college is such a beautiful place! The area is nice, the students are friendly, and professors feel like friends. I have only been here for a few weeks, and I feel as if I have already learned so much! I recommend this college to everyone who has a passion for art and design."
Junior,5,"The staff and students at CCAD are the most welcoming and friendly people which is what made it such an easy choice for me to pick this school to further my education. They teach you the basics so everyone is on the same page. I have been attending this school for 2 years and the passion, hard work and dedication I have seen from my peers is inspiring. I feel incredibly lucky to be learning to eventually live out my dreams."
Freshman,5,I am a fashion design major at Columbus college of art and design. That overall academics are amazing. The classes really push the creativity and makes the artists/designers think outside of the box. Teachers are are great for giving honest opinions to help the artists grow. An unbelievable amazing school
Freshman,5,"I haven't begun classes yet but I did take a tour of the campus and its surrounding locations. So far, it is really great. Everyone is really friendly and informative. Every class has great technological tools as well. CCAD is very diverse, and just by the tour I could tell this. Most people are very accepting there too. They also have many teams of security. The dorms are very nice as well."
Niche User,5,"Best college of Art & Design,the environment is so surreal,it brings out the Artist in you,it fosters all your creativity juices that you feel what it feel like to be a Leonard DA Vince. It makes Design and Art come to life."
Sophomore,5,"This is my first year at CCAD.  As a transfer student from a small community college located in a neighboring state, I find CCAD is exactly what I was looking for!  While it is a small campus, its Academics/Professors are exceptional!  The knowledge which I am receiving is preparing me for positions after graduation, and I feel that I will be able to obtain a position relating to my major without an issue.   

Columbus, as a whole, is growing by leaps and bounds; therefore, there is always something to do.  The only negative thing that I can say about CCAD is relating to the campus food which is not the greatest for the amount paid; however, there are plenty of other options within the general area of the campus to eat/shop!"
Senior,5,"This is a very diverse college with a great location.  There are lots of shops and restaurants in walking distance as it is right in the downtown area, where everything happens."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at the Columbus College of Art and Design has been a very positive one. The community here is great and makes me feel connected. The professors are knowledgeable and are there to help you become a better artists and prepare you for life as an artist. The student body is friendly and accepting and there are many opportunities to meet new people. One of the few things I wish could change would be the price, because it is rather expensive, but they give out scholarships and the advisors are always there to help you find ways to cover the cost. Overall, I really enjoy attending this school and I would recommend it to others looking for an art education."
Niche User,5,I went on an individual visit to Columbus College of Art and Design and was thoroughly impressed.  Many impressive programs and clubs were created and beautiful pieces are continuously produced from the students.  I would love to visit again and can not wait to apply.
Junior,5,Attending Columbus College of Art & Design is one of the best decisions I've ever made! I knew I wanted to work in the graphic design field before I graduated high school and I wanted to attend a school that would teach me everything I needed to know to be a successful designer. Not only does Columbus College of Art & Design have amazing staff but they set you up for a job/internship in your field before graduation. Columbus College of Art & Design has an amazing campus that supports and welcomes everyone with open arms and makes you feel like you're a part of a family.
Sophomore,5,"The people are incredible. The faculty want to see you succeed, and go out of their way to help. The student body is wonderful. There are clubs for just about everything and the campus facilities are great."
Freshman,5,"What I really like about CCAD is how small the campus is. It's not small enough to where it is cramped, but it is small and has a lot of room. It is not like any university I have seen. The size of this school is the right fit for me. Also, I really love how everyone treats each other like actual adults and not based on grade. There is no type of hierarchy, everyone is everyone's coworker almost, even the facility. If there is one complaint I have, it is that the new teachers don't seem to go through any type of teaching course beforehand, as if they had just picked them off the streets. I came from a school district that has great teachers and great academics, so I know a thing or two about good teaching."
Freshman,5,"I overall love the how the food is hand cooked by faculty AND students! I also love how our teachers are all inclusive when it comes to pronouns and/or trigger warnings for those who have those. I also love how immersive the courses are and how big the campus is, since it's in the heart of the city."
Freshman,5,I am only a freshman at CCAD but I really enjoy it so far. The campus and community are great. The classes are fun and the professors are encouraging and helpful. It's great to be surrounded by creative people all of the time.
Freshman,5,CCAD is an amazing school. Everybody there is so friendly and really cares about you. Couldn’t have asked for a better school to go to.
Freshman,5,I love that it is so diverse.  They have so many great classes to take. I dont feel judged and the staff are very passionate and caring!
Sophomore,5,"The teachers and professors work in the fields they teach, so we as students are able to get a better insight and learn more from them, because they practice what they teach."
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore transfer student at CCAD, and coming to this school has been one of the best decisions I have made. I have learned so much in my first semester. I love my classes, there are tons of on-campus resources, and everyone that works for the school has been helpful in my short time here. It was easy for me to make friends with and connect to people that are so much like me."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school, my teachers are great and the head of my major is awesome. always trying to make sure things are going well and that we are getting a good education."
College Junior,5,It truly is a wonderful environment to be in and I hope to be able to continue my studies there.
College Junior,5,Our security is very dependable and really focus on keeping us safe.
College Junior,5,Overall its just a really good school focus on doing what is best for you.
College Junior,5,It is very nice especially the upperclassman dorms are very very nice.
College Junior,5,A close knit community that cares about its students and does it best to provide them what they need for the field they want to go into.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone at CCAD is accepted. That's one of the great parts about this school.
College Freshman,5,This school is the best school for those with a passion for any kind of art.
College Freshman,5,"Accepting of all religions, political beliefs, and sexual orientation."
College Freshman,5,"Reasonable deadlines, appropriate assignments, great professors. Sometimes, even fun assignments."
College Freshman,5,The school is set up to were it evolves around your major. Nothing is unnecessary. The school is specifically art and it makes sure that it's students develop creative ideas and pieces. It would be an honor to graduate from the school Columbus College of Art and Design.
College Freshman,5,"There are literally guards everywhere 24/7 walking around, on bikes in patrol cars at every front desk, they are everywhere and they are all so friendly and willing and nice"
College Freshman,5,It's stressful but its worth it
College Freshman,5,"It's awsome, we have a spray paint booth a gym a laundry mat type room and a small printing facility, we have free cable and free internet and a lounge with an entertainment system on every floor and our rooms are apartment style with bed rooms and a full bathroom and a dining space, its very comfortable and just happy and family like."
College Freshman,5,"My school while deathly stressful has given so many open and brightly lit paths, its hard its so hard that I cry at times but I know its only preparing me for the worst while making the best readily available"
College Freshman,5,The security team has gone above and beyond what is expected of them.
College Freshman,5,"I have been able to make a lot of friends in my dorm, and we are mostly all friendly in the dorms."
College Freshman,5,"$20 will be enough to cover your lunch and maybe dinner, everything is really affordable the most you might spend is $100 unless you spend way too much time in Starbucks. there is places around the city that will give you a discount. There's so many restaurants in the area and you are bound to find something to your liking."
College Freshman,5,"I thoroughly enjoy having all of the amazing teachers over here; they really know their stuff, and I've been learning things I've never knew were existing because of the positive teachers in the CCAD community. Very professional."
College Sophomore,5,The local atmosphere is awesome
College Sophomore,5,The off campus dining in columbus is amazing.
College Sophomore,5,"Fine arts has a lot of unique opportunities to offer, including a private studio for senior students."
College Sophomore,5,"You could eat at different places every day of the week for months without overlap, there are tons of wonderful restaurants within walking distance."
College Sophomore,5,Everything  a large city has to offer. There is a great variety of food as well as a vibrant art scene.
College Sophomore,5,"there is something for everyone to love and do in Columbus, no joke!"
College Sophomore,5,The city of Columbus is full of amazing options! Something for everyone.
College Sophomore,5,every experience with a staff member has been extremely cheerful and helpful. I'm super pleased so far.
College Sophomore,5,"I've been awarded a large academic scholarship, and other grants. which have made the financial process that much smoother."
College Sophomore,5,"Professors are very dedicated to helping students and will spend lots of one on one time during class. They also have office hours most of the time during the week so students can come in then. The workload is not for the faint of heart, but if you are a hard worker you should do just fine."
College Sophomore,5,Fine art's majors get a private studio space their senior year and have a senior thesis exhibition for their work.
College Sophomore,5,Our campus has a very large and active LGBTQ population. There are many international students from all around the world. Most students are more politically left than average.
College Sophomore,5,"Campus security is friendly and all over the campus, they are very visible and helpful and will always escort you if you call them. I have never felt unsafe on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms are right in the middle of campus, you can walk to any of your classes in five minutes or less from the dorms. the dorms are large and modern with an apartment style layout. This cuts down a little on the social atmosphere but it's worth it to get your own private bedroom."
College Sophomore,5,"CCAD is truly a school where each and every student matters. We have small class sizes and professors spend lots of one on one time with you helping you build your skills. All the students are very friendly and welcoming, the older students were very welcoming to freshman and invited us to campus activities and clubs, as well as gave advice on art pieces we were working on."
Freshman,4,"I loved the Industrial Design program. Everyone is a family, professors and students alike are all fun and willing to help out. I suggest being in a motivated mindset to be truly successful. It takes a lot of work to get where you want to be."
Freshman,4,"When the school sent everyone home, the teachers rushed to transition to online. They were efficient and on track while keeping each assignment well adjusted with everyone’s availability and access to the internet."
Sophomore,4,"I am an animation major at CCAD. The animation department is amazing and run very well. However, things such as campus security and housing could be much better. As far as housing, there's barely enough rooms to house the students, so be prepared to live off campus after Freshman year. As far as security, be careful where you park if you park on campus. The school has designated parking lots to park in overnight, but the aren't completely covered by the security cameras. Just be careful or else your car will get broken into (speaking from personal experience)."
Freshman,4,"I am only about a little over halfway through my freshman year, but so far, I really like it here. I have had some of the best teachers in my entire artistic career and have met some of the nicest people on planet earth."
Freshman,4,It’s a great college that is in the middle of downtown.  You can get around by bus or scooters because everything is within reach
Freshman,4,"The Campus is small but very passionate and driven to create art for the community and world. However, community-wise on campus lacks attention and social side part of it since it's a private school, Admissions and staff would help you get the degree you're pursuing on as well. I wish there was an athletics program just to get a feel of physical activity for myself and students."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a Sophomore at CCAD, I am a transfer and have thoroughly been enjoying my experience so far. Everyone that I interact with is extremely nice and welcoming, including the teachers. I have seen teachers go above in beyond in offering help and understanding to students. The school is what you put into it, so you can not expect to succeed if you do not put in the time and the effort. Sometimes the classes I take do not seem the needed to my academic advancement and I have limited options to what I am able to do, due to being a transfer student. But overall I really enjoyed my experience and and have learned a lot."
Junior,4,"I have had a good experience. The negatives were pretty much my own problems, and I love the library and resources to students. Classes are interesting, and there are some cool teachers here."
Senior,4,"Overall this school is wonderful. Every college has it's bad stuff, so trust me when I say this school isn't perfect. As an Illustration major, it took until my third year to really get into what the field is about and the variety opportunities available to us which is frustrating. Some of the not-so-great qualities is the parking, the safety isn't always great on the far side of campus, (though safety is great on the main section,) and the cost is way too high. These details can be frustrating at times but there are ways to make the most of it. You can live off campus to save a ton of money, you can join the wonderful clubs they have available, definitely take part of as many free events as possible because of the free food, there is great free counseling, plus this is a very accepting school for LGBTQ+!"
Junior,4,"Columbus College of Art & Design offers a large amount of diversity within the student body and challenges students to collaborate with one another, mimicking the real world collaborative experience. Despite these strengths, there is an imbalance in the resources offered/given to each major. However, CCAD has overall been an excellent experience and I appreciate the care and support I have received from valuable relationships with my professors."
Alum,4,"Pretty cool loco school. Only bad thing, the school doesn't always think about the commuters. Always look to make the students better. They give out treats during finals week. The logo is a stove burner of ccad. The advertiser are some what cool."
Sophomore,4,Challenges and pushes students in unique ways in the center of a city with a growing and thriving art community.
Sophomore,4,"I like the exposure to the wide variety of art concepts, ideas, and students. It is good to work with and get ideas from a range of students and teachers who are as passionate about art as I am. This gives the opportunity to improve and expand my knowledge."
Senior,4,"CCAD has been a place where opportunities to gain experience as well as knowledge abound. Located in the downtown area allows one to experience not only big city life but also affords one to experience different cultures., as there is a diverse student body. There is something for everyone at CCAD"
Freshman,4,"My experience here so far is great, most teachers do a great job at teaching the students. It was easy to meet new people because everyone is very accepting."
Freshman,4,"I really like Columbus College of Art & Design. The people are very friendly, the professors are extremely helpful and teach you without being pushy, and you're encouraged to pursue creative freedom. Almost all of the projects explore things that I haven't yet learned about, and that's exciting because then I can really get into it. Hanging out on campus can get a little dull, but the surrounding area is certainly full of fun things to do. I've only been attending this school for less than a year, and I'm already learning so much about my major, and really delving into the design world, and I feel like you wouldn't get the same experience as here at any other college. I am also currently involved with the Animation Student Collective, which always has fun, major-related activities for us to do, and it's great!"
Senior,4,"Very good curriculum for Fashion Design, resulting in a well rounded education in the field.  Students are presented with numerous  opportunities for employment and internships."
Sophomore,4,"I love my school, I am currently enrolled and appreciate the fact that the classes are small. It allows for more one on one time with the teachers. Most teachers that I have encountered are great, patient, and understanding. Especially in the Interior Design field. There are a lot of on campus activities to get people more involved, one thing I really appreciate is that my school ID is also my bus pass, it saves me a lot of money during the school year, so if you commute by bus it is a good thing to have. Campus food is pretty good, their lunch, dinners, and special meals change daily. There are other places for food close by for when you need a change of food. Lastly, the campus is small so no one can get lost which I liked."
College Sophomore,4,"There really isn't a drug scene that I've seen. They do take it seriously about drugs, alcohol, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors there are great. They interact with the students very much. They encourage students to do their best, give them advices, and have some small conversation to get them going."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors there are great. They interact with the students very much. They encourage students to do their best, give them advices, and have some small conversation to get them going."
College Sophomore,4,"They provide an online course that tells us about our personal safety, security, and others."
College Sophomore,4,The staff and student body are very friendly. The staff make you feel at home and do help you the best they can if there is any problem need working. The students are friendly and do give you advice to help you out the college years.
College Sophomore,4,The private security staff on campus does a great job keeping us safe. I have never felt at risk on our campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus as a freshmen really builds a foundation for your social life at CCAD. Being involved and getting to know the other residents makes adjusting to your college life much easier. Schottenstein is a great building for that, DSA tends to be more independent and less community driven."
College Sophomore,4,"I've loved my time at CCAD. Though the work load is difficult, I've never second-guessed my decision to come here. It was definitely one of the best decisions I have ever made."
College Freshman,4,Very good and kind security!
College Freshman,4,Teachers are wonderful and once you make some friends everything is so much better! Wide verity of classes. Class size is normally 25 kids (gen classes).
College Freshman,4,"The amount we pay I feel isn't used wisely, other than that and the food I have nothing to say."
College Junior,4,"We're right in downtown columbus, so any trouble that comes our way is usually from outer forces and not from the student body. Weren't they gonna make a quick clinic though? Cmon CCAD, give us the clinic or give us the POD back!"
College Junior,4,"There's a lot of good opportunities for jobs, internships, and other various things during and after school. I need to get on that."
College Junior,4,"I'm a 2nd semester junior, so I'd like to think I've been here long enough. I've been attending summer and saturday classes at CCAD in high school as well. I've seen the campus change, sometimes for the better. The teachers are wonderful and are always willing to help you. The classes, mostly, are engaging. I just wish they would take my suggestions for putting more vegetables in the tuna salad at the cafe seriously. We used to have tomatoes and cucumbers and carrot shavings in it. Now there's just lettuce and tuna. What is this? This isn't tuna salad. This is tuna lettuce. I'm outraged."
College Junior,4,"I'm curious to know where half our money goes. The teachers and the courses help make up for the uncertainty. I've learned a lot and have made good friends here. It's a great place for creative minds to gather and discuss ideas and projects. 

I like the soup here a lot. The tuna needs more vegetables though."
College Freshman,4,The campus police are very approachable and nice. They will walk you to your car at night if you don't want to be alone.
College Freshman,4,"The biggest class I had so far had at most 19 students. For the core classes you will meet someone in a different major than you. Okay Vis Lit, this is the one course that almost the entire campus has to take and hates. Its an okay course for artist that has no background in digital art but for everyone else they know how to use photoshop and illustrator and maybe InDesign. There's two parts to the class and you have to pass Vis Lit 1 to go into 2. But if you're one of those people that rather not step foot into that classroom there is an online course available."
College Freshman,4,"Between studying and not stressing out, the school does its best to have somewhat a monthly week long event/s to help the students unwind and relax. I would recommend any incoming students to not to worry about grades too much. Like if you had a bad grade on an assignment, the teacher will most likely allow to re-do it for a better grade."
College Freshman,4,"There aren't any sports at this school, but there is a gym that is offered in the dorms if needed to work out."
College Freshman,4,My overall experience so far is very different than what I expected it to be. I'm still working on my time management and adjusting to the school's technology.
College Sophomore,4,Internships and working once one graduate's is a ongoing conversation among students and faculty.
College Sophomore,4,"In my opinion the more demanding the professor, the better the results. Not many are like that but they are there."
College Sophomore,4,"It's very expensive for what it is, but it's still very good."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a good school overall. Some professors aren't the most qualified or motivated to be teaching certain classes, and most of them are not very demanding. However, my learning experience so far has been very educational."
College Freshman,4,No reports of sexual or terrible happenings.
College Freshman,4,"Great professors, reasonable class sizes, great variety of art classes."
College Freshman,4,"Great graduate success, internship, job fairs and career services."
College Freshman,4,The workload at some points of the semester have been difficult but is was it is and should be expected.
College Freshman,4,Listening to my majors department and how 90% of graduating students have a job ready when they graduate.
College Freshman,4,"The overall experience has been great so far, I'm only in my first semester and there is still more time for me in college."
College Freshman,4,My overall experience at my school has been great. Going to school in a different state than I grew up in has made me develop as my own human being.
College Junior,4,My experience at Columbus College of Art and Design has been one of excitement and hard work. The curriculum is one of the best I have ever seen for Fashion Design.
College Freshman,4,I really feel that I made the right decision by choosing this campus. It is exactly the environment I was looking for.
College Junior,4,"Classes are hard always challenging, and the assignments are stressful, but I still think it was all worth it. It has me pulling all nighters, given me emotional breakdowns, and a whole bunch of other issues, but I don't regret any of it. It's fulfilling to go here, and I've made some really good friends. I'm following my dream here, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
College Freshman,4,"If you have a good art background you can easily get a decent scholarship but it's also not enough to cover the entire year. I received a $20,000 scholarship but when it's broken down I only receive about $5,000 a quarter and each quarter is about $15,000. Somethings if you tell how poor you are and how its hard on your family, you might get some more money. But you should still keep in mind great test scores and grades will also factor in."
College Freshman,4,"I like to eat out, its better than the market food."
College Freshman,4,There hasn't really been an issue for me and people I know.
College Sophomore,4,Way cheaper that living on-campus
College Sophomore,4,I haven't had any issues.
College Freshman,4,I think off-campus dining is extremely accessible to the students here
College Freshman,4,"I was given a scholarship and that made my decision a lot easier to attend this school. However, it has not been easy taking care of the rest of tuition. I do not have any tips"
College Sophomore,4,Everything is around campus or is just a 15-20 minute walk onto High street where there are many types of ethnic cuisine. I personally love all of the asian restaurants down near the Short North. Everything is not too expensive though.
Freshman,2,"When I first visited CCAD I was so impressed with how inclusive it seemed to be. Having just graduated from high school and moving to CCAD from out of state, I felt like I would have a good support system. Boy was I wrong! Every time I asked for help, I felt shut down or dismissed. Professors are either great or horrible. Some were very unprofessional, rude, and do not teach a thing. I felt like no one cared about my success and when I verbalized my concerns to my Advisor, nothing was ever done about the issue. It is far too expensive for the skills you actually learn. It is all smoke and mirrors but you don't realize it until it is too late. I withdrew after my freshman year. It was a very bad experience for me and now I owe $22k for next to nothing. Security is a farce. I had people bully me and threaten me but security would not help me. If you are not gay, be prepared to be bullied. On the plus side...Food is decent, lots of choices. Close to buses and things to do."
Freshman,2,When COVID hit I was forced to vacate my dorm with 5 days notice. My home state being 500 miles away. I had no choice but to finish Spring semester online which was so difficult for an art student. Professors totally checked out. I literally learned next to nothing.
Freshman,2,"Professors here do well teaching you and making sure you understand the content, but there are also many that dont teach you a thing. You teach yourself how to do most things and then get graded on how well you taught yourself. 99% of your teachers don’t post your grades, you won’t know what you have in your classes until the end of the semester. I’ve had professors mistreat students, and even post about them on social media. Administration never emails back, they don’t tell you when you have paper work they need, they talk down to you like you’re a child and treat you as such. This is the case for many students. Not all administration falls under these lines, but many do. The majority of this school does not care about it’s students, nor do I believe they do what is in our best interest. If I knew this before coming to CCAD, I would have chosen a different school."
College Freshman,2,"I think it is ironic how the school stresses health and taking care of yourself, especially your freshman year, however the food that is available to the students is overpriced and carb saturated causing many problems for students."
College Freshman,2,"No one knows about sports in the school, there are some flyers around campus but other than that it's not really known to students about the sports activities."
College Freshman,2,"There is a lot of club interactions that happen on and off-campus; however sports and athletics are not very involved at our university. The main sports attraction we have is watching football on the many televisions around campus. We do have dodge ball, volleyball, track, and basketball that are all played by our school but are all off-campus events that are held in different areas. They post there meeting times around campus, as well as giving us fliers and posting on the weekly news messenger that we receive in an email."
College Freshman,2,"Most off-campus housing is very expensive or very far away. The campus offers very good on-campus dorms and a great meal plan for all first year students. They do have some off-campus housing available that is affordable but is very hard to find housing with just Columbus College of Art and Design students all living there because of Ohio State University and Columbus State Community College being such a short distance away from this school. I would recommend on-campus living because of how easy it is to get their not having to deal with the heavy traffic as well as how safe it is here. The security on this campus is so outstanding and become familiar with most students. This helps with the general location of the school being just a few blocks short of the soup kitchen, where most homeless people like to come wonder after they eat their meals."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of variety in the food but most of it is really greasy and many students have gotten food poisoning from undercooked meat at the grill. Also, students have found bugs in the food. The vegetable options are almost inedible."
College Junior,2,Keep on top of every single financial aid information you receive.  Be diligent in your attempts to attain aid and exhaust every opportunity to meet with advisors.  Make them your best friends.
College Freshman,2,We don't really focus on sports here. We have clubs but do not have actual teams as far as I know.
College Freshman,2,It seems like a lot of girls are kind of out there at art school and there's not much of a variety.
College Freshman,2,"Being in the middle of downtown, most resturants close before 7 and there are just not a lot of option. You have to go to short north or a neighboring suburb to really go anywhere for dinner."
College Freshman,2,"All of columbus and short north is close by, but if you don't have a car, its too dangerous to walk alone, or even in a group"
College Sophomore,2,There's not much that happens on campus. Not much parties or anything like that. I feel very safe here though the school has a good amount of security officers. There are no sports at this school but there are yoga/zumba nights I'm sure of. And every now and then there will be an event on campus but not that many.
College Sophomore,2,"There seems to be a lot more guys to girls.  also, there's not too much of a sense of diversity.  There's a lot of the same group of people and race of people.  There are more white people as well as a lot of ""hipsters"".  Hipster is a term used to describe a group of people who wear beanies, scarves, and skinny jeans no matter the weather.  They talk about the same things and think they are better than everyone else.  I't sort of maddening.  However, even though there are a lot of clones here there are a handful of genuine, original people who are good, kind-hearted people."
College Junior,2,"Snows a Lot in the Winter – What can we say? This is Ohio. It's to be expected. If you live in the dorms, it shouldn't be much of a problem as they are very close to everything; but the winter weather really stinks for this Texan. Spring is ratty. Summer is lovely, while fall is pleasant."
College Junior,2,"There's Things You Can Do and Places You Can Relax All Over Campus. We have a small little gym that use to be a cafeteria which is ok. There are a ton of places for students to relax with comfortable couches all over the place. Which you will see many student's napping. The area for commuters isn't all that amazing with a few ping-pong tables and and old large screen tv and a smaller one tucked away in the back for gamers. The facility for students who live on campus are pretty sweet. They have a nice new flat screen tv, washers and dryers. New furniture and what not. Kinda makes me feel like the commuters are the red-headed step child for CCAD. We didn't even have a working microwave for about 6 months."
College Junior,2,If you ever lived in Ohio you know it's flat and cold most of the time. We get about one or two months of nice weather during CCAD's fall and spring semester. But when it is nice it's really nice. You'll always get a good breeze. In my personal opinion its way too cold.
College Sophomore,2,The permit cost went up a little this year.. not sure why? We still have limited parking. I like how the overnight price is more expensive because then out of town students are taking up spots for commuters like me.
College Freshman,2,"Sandwiches and the Singing Luch Guy – Although there are many foods to eat it is not always available to every student when they would like it. Mostly sandwiches and just for $6.00 all you can eat. It's only all you can eat when there is enough to eat. Could use implovement. The upside to this sandtastrophy is the singing luch guy he makes a grat sandwich, whichever you like, and he does it with a smile."
College Sophomore,1,"Non existing. There's ""fitness groups"" which don't really do much and the school does provide gyms in the residential buildings. Other than being mindful of what you eat, our school doesn't really pay attention to athleticism or any sports for that matter."
College Freshman,1,It has no parties at college because of the rules.
College Freshman,1,The student body that lives on this campus lacks maturity and I had certain expectations coming to this campus for social life. I have been very disappointed in the social life that exist here at ccad.
College Freshman,1,We do not have sororities or fraternities.
College Sophomore,1,We're in the middle of downtown Columbus so we have a limited amount of parking available to us and parking passes are extremely expensive.
College Freshman,1,"Money isn't an issue for my family with housing. And if it were I'm lucky enough to have grown up 5 minutes away so I would be able to live at home. But for others, the housing that is in safe areas around campus isn't affordable and the affordable housing is in some pretty sketchy areas. It may be difficult to commute because the school doesn't offer a ton of parking either and parking in the city can be difficult."
College Junior,1,"There are freshmen dorms, which on their own aren't terrible.. However there is a very over priced building to live in. I would recommend off campus housing."
College Sophomore,1,The food is really  bad. It tasted like everything was salted an microwave. The main food usually made me sick so i ate a lot of pita and hummus. The places around campus are okay there are  lots  of main cheap restraunts but a lot of the time there was no extra  money to be spent because  it was all spent on extra art supplies.
College Sophomore,1,We have no athletics whatsoever. There is some activities  such as  Harry Potter Quidditch Cup and  Parkour.
College Junior,1,No Sports for Art Students – Other than the activities like yoga and dodge ball there aren't any sports at CCAD. There are no football teams or any teams for that fact. We have a small facilities and I've never really used it but it seems like a tiny gym with a few machines but nothing to excite the masses.

Freshman,5,"I online more that face to face. I get calmed when I do my test online, but if you doing fax to face test  you will get distracted."
Freshman,5,"they Are helpful, the class are   Awesome , and if the students need help they will with there problem."
Sophomore,5,Bay Path is such a flexible college to get a degree from whether you work full time or not. There One a day women's program has so many options for a major along with certificate options. The advisors make sure you stay on the right path towards your degree.
Sophomore,5,"I currently take all of my classes online, but I have taken a hybrid course as well where you meet once a week on the weekend to make sure you understand everything that is going on in the course. The flexibility Bay Path offers it so great for my schedule."
Junior,5,BPU definitely takes the working woman into consideration and makes it possible to complete your degree program entirely online. Amazing.
Junior,5,BPU definitely takes the working woman into consideration and makes it possible to complete your degree program entirely online. Amazing.
Junior,5,Extremely helpful and efficient. Cost-efficiency goes a long way. So many resources and people available to help and very friendly as well
Junior,5,Very caring and supportive. Good curriculum. Resources everywhere. They want you to succeed. The pricing is very good as well. You can either attend in person or take all online which I like.
Freshman,5,"When first applying to different colleges, I wanted to go to a school that valued and recognized their students, which offers a good financial aid package, had a wide range of programs for the major I wanted to pursue, and live in a safe campus. When attending Bay Path University in the fall, all of the things I was looking for were all there in one. It was a small college with a small safe campus that made sure that we were well. Classes were small and the professor knew your name and was always available whenever you needed them. Faculty and staff receive you with a warm welcome and always happy to help out and give advice. The school itself is diverse and included everyone which I liked. I was worried that my first year of college was going to be bad since it was a new school and didnâ€™t know anyone but instead it became one of the greatest experiences I ever had. I fell in love with the school and had the best college experience for my first year there."
Sophomore,5,"Bay Path University is located in Massachusetts in a great town of Longmeadow. I am an online student who is 48 years old and returning back to college after twenty plus years.  I intend to complete my school with a bachelors in two years in the health and wellness program and continue on to gain an masters with nutritiona and fitness.  The online community at Bay Path is called The American Women's College.  I am beyond impressed at the high quality of education I am receiving.  The professors are continually available, all the materials needed are at my fingertips, the knowledge and professionalism is amazing and professors are so encouraging of their students."
Freshman,5,"I am new to Bay Path University. I am an online student out of Georgia. So, far so good. The staff is very knowledgeable, kind and always willing to assist you if needed. I would recommend the school to anyone who is ready to settle down and get college done. It is an accelerated college, so I should finish my bachelors in 3 years and 3 months. I am very excited. I am 48 and this is my first college experience.  I look forward to my journey."
Junior,5,"Bay Path is an extremely warm and welcoming educational institute.  When I was confused about beginning college I had this entire support team that didn't even know me, yet, they were there supporting me.  After I was in Bay Path, I struggled with focus and received support and accountability from the staff and my peers.  I wouldn't go anywhere else."
Freshman,5,Everyone at Baypath is super welcoming and helpful when it comes to helping their students get acclimated on their new journey!
Freshman,5,"Bay Path University is a very good school. I am in their accelerated program online. The way they line everything out is very comprehensive. Their staff is amazing at making sure you are up to speed on all of your classes, and that all of your accounts are in good standing."
Junior,5,"I like that it's small and it's in a nice quaint neighborhood. It's been wonderful attending, all of the professors are helpful, and everyone there genuinely wants you to succeed."
Niche User,5,"Bay Path was a wonderful school to tour and receive information from. Their campus is small with a great ratio between teachers and students. You will have a small community feel yet not feel overwhelmed at the same time. I would recommend checking out this college if you are interested, definitely my top choice as of now."
Sophomore,5,This School is filled with amazing students and professors. Everyone at this school is always friendly. The professors care about your education and will help you if you show signs of needing help. This school provides good technology and resources. There is a tutoring building meant to help students in all subjects.
Junior,5,"Bay Path University has been an amazing experience for me. A week after I found out I was accepted to Bay Path I had found out I was pregnant, but that didn't stop me from continuing my education. The staff and students here at Bay Path have been nothing but supportive and kind to me throughout my experience of being pregnant while going to school and then when I came back after my daughter. All of the professors I have had really care about me and my education and being able to succeed. I high recommended this university to everyone!"
Alum,5,"Amazing college, especially if you are interested in doing online. I was able to work full time while going to school full time."
Alum,5,Great online program. I transferred in for my last two years because I was working full time while raising two children. I needed an online program. It was a little expensive compared to other programs but I absolutely loved it. Their online platform is the best of the three I have used over the years. I really recommend this school.
Freshman,5,I love how Baypath is a small and inclusive community and school with many opportunities for students.
Freshman,5,"Bay Path University is a great college to go to. I loved the professors there. They not only challenge you, but the classes are small, and you are able to engage within this environment with ease. I would not change a thing about this school, because I had the best experience there. I do not regret my decision to go to this school."
Junior,5,I am obsessed with my school. From the second I started talking to someone to get information I was hooked. From the beginning they have been nothing but helpful. They make sure that I have all the information I need to succeed. Every single person I have talked to has been so nice and interested in my well being. I am so happy to have transferred into this amazing school. They have so many opportunities within the college. You actually learn about yourself in some of the classes you take.
Niche User,5,"Right of the bat, I was given an amazing adviser. It has now been a year and a half that I have had her, and she has helped me every step of the way. I have meet the president numerous times, who takes the time out of her day to get to know potential student. I have been to Bay Path multiple times, for events like overnight tours and acceptance dinners. Everybody is kind, and wants the best for their students."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman in Bay Path University. I will be starting my second semester and so far I have loved it. Although the campus is a bit small, it is very comforting and all the professors as well as the students are very welcoming and kind hearted people. They are very motivational and care for your education."
Senior,5,It is great school with caring and intelligent professors. The education system is really good and professors care about what you learn rather than focusing totally on grades.
Sophomore,5,The teachers are very helpful and respond to you in a timely manner. Assignments are graded almost right away. Everything and everything is just so positive and just want to see us students strive and succeed in life.
Junior,5,From my admissions application process to the end of Fall Semester Session 2 of the American Womens College its been a great experiece. All staff and faculty have been very supportive and helpful.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy and think that the academics at my college are wonderful and I have had an overall great experience within the two years I have attended so far. I plan to spend four years at Bay Path and graduate with a Bachelors degree and then further my education at a different institution for my Masters. I highly recommend Bay Path for schooling though if they provide the major in question. They had my major which is Forensic Studies and I love learning about the concepts included.
Sophomore,5,"It's an amazing school overall; however, there can be things done to help them become even better. The academics offered are amazing, and a big majority of the workers are extremely understanding as well as helpful; however, there is no communication between offices to avoid little errors. This makes it hard for students to stay on top of their accounts or classes needed. Advising as a whole needs a LOT of improvement."
Sophomore,5,"The only problem I'v ever had with this university was finding ways to afford it, other than that I would recommend it to other females."
Junior,5,The American Womens College online has made it easy for me to continue school and work full time while balancing all the other things in life. The online platform is by far the best one I have experience since I started my journey with online schools and the instructors are great with response times and making resources available for students.
Sophomore,5,"I started out going to community college a year after high school, I failed terribly. I decided to quit college and focus my energy on working. Something was missing though, so last year I decided what I wanted to do with my life and figure out a way to do it. I searched a lot of colleges, and once I found Baypath I fell in love. I do the online program, and it's structured perfectly for me. I love this school, and the resources and team help me want to continue my education and succeed."
Freshman,5,Bay Path University offers a diverse undergraduate program and cares about their students. They work well and communicate with their students if they have any issues. The application process is simply affordable and easy. I recommend high school graduates to explore their website and ask questions for more help.
Senior,5,BAYPATH is a welcoming community. Everyone works as a team and does their best to provide the best education possible
Junior,5,Bay Path is an amazing school. The teachers are there to teach students and they out a lot of effort into making sure that every student has really learned the material.
Freshman,5,"As a student attending my freshman year at Bay Path University, I find the college to be very effective and on task. The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful. I find comfort in continuing my education within this college. I recommend attending Bay Path to any individual looking to pursue a career."
Niche User,5,"I went there for an overnight to see what it was like as I am an incoming freshman. The students were all very welcoming, helpful, and kind. Meeting the professors and the president and hearing their experience and what they though of the school was informative and helped me in deciding that this is the school i want to attend. The food was above average, breakfast was a delight and lunch and dinner was amazing. So many different options to choose from and all lifestyle eating was welcome. Although a small school nothing beats their campus and the area it is located."
Freshman,5,"I am going to love it at Bay path university and I can't wait to start in the fall of 2018. I'm coming for a small school in West Hartford and I didn't think I would be able to small a good college to go into. However, that was until I found Bay Path and went on my first tour. Right after the tour I instantly know that Bay Path was the school I wanted to spend my next 2-4 years."
Junior,5,"Teachers are great. Very helpful and encouraging. The campus is small but absolutely gorgeous . I have visited a few times, and could never be happier that I am attending in the Fall 2018. I know I will have a great experience."
Junior,5,Love the close community! The professors are the best and are always there to help you with anything. Everyone on campus gets along and looks out for each other.
Junior,5,I am in my fourth semester as an online student.  I love the format and the pace of the program.  I can take up to two classes per session and the sessions are 6 weeks long.  There are 3 sessions per semester.  It's not the traditional semester length but it's perfect for me.  I work full-time and I volunteer with a couple of civic organizations so if this program did not exist I would not be able to complete my degree.  They took all of the credits I had earned at a local community college helping me even more.  I cannot wait to be able to say that I am a proud alumnus of Bay Path University!  Love this program and the opportunities it will afford me.  This program does include a series of classes which are meant to elevate you as a woman and develop your leadership skills and potential.  They are required.
Freshman,5,"So far it has been very nice. The teachers are incredible, the classes are engaging, and the community is very welcoming. There is not much that absolutely needs to be changed."
Graduate Student,5,"Professors are highly qualified, caring and smart.  All the staff and students contribute to a community that feels like home.  And, I am learning a lot!"
Freshman,5,"BayPath has great academics. also, love the fact its an all girl school making it easier to participate in class, improving out confidence."
Junior,5,Bay path is where I found myself. There are different majors to choose from. I l love how everyone is trying to work with you for your needs. Easy to have best  relationships and be close to your professor.
Freshman,5,"Bay Path is a fantastic school! It is perfect for me, and I love it here. I couldn't imagine being anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,"This is my dream school; I love the campus, the professors, the other dedicated students, and the curriculum."
Freshman,5,"I have made many visits to this university and I am extremely impressed with the school. I have met staff in my major, and they are very intelligent and you can tell that they care deeply about the success of the students. The campus is gorgeous and very well maintained. The food is absolutely delicious. I do not have any complaints about the school so far."
Freshman,5,I will be starting Bay Path in the fall and I'm very excited. The admissions and financial aid offices have been more than helpful with my transition to college life.
Freshman,5,Bay Path University had such a friendly community. The campus is so amazing and so beautiful. This University opens up a lot of opportunities for students interest of learning.
Sophomore,5,Attending an all women's university opens up so many doors through my education. I feel supported by my staff and peers and confident in bringing what I have to the table. An all girls school is a life changing experience and thrives off the support of the students and faculty. The academics are intense to the point where it pushes students to their full potential. Bay Path is located in the suburban area of Massachusetts and is surrounded by a beautiful community that often visit the school.
Graduate Student,5,"Bay Path is a diverse, all women's college.  The faculty are engaging and women I have studied with come from all backgrounds.  I'm attending the Saturday classes while I work full-time during the week.  The faculty are wonderful about working with the unique circumstances of those who are balancing studies, work and family life.  My classmates are amazing women, at all seasons of life who are truly dedicated to learning.  I highly recommend Bay Path to those who are seriously thinking about returning to college but have doubts of how they will juggle life and learning.   Bay Path wants their students to thrive and will provide much needed guidance and support."
Junior,5,"Bay Path's American Womens Online Degree Program is great for working, busy ladies of all ages. It is a very fast pace program with 2 classes every six weeks. For someone who is looking to speed up the process of receiving their degree in the convenience of their home; this is the program for you!"
Freshman,5,"Bay Path was not my first choice. However, the more I visited and talked to students and staff I felt an inner peace. I needed a small school, where professors would know my name and my story. I wanted to be able to speak to professors all while them knowing my personal backstory. I finished my first semester with a 4.0 all because of the atmosphere, environment and caring faculty at Bay Path University. I am thriving as a college freshman, and it is because I chose BPU."
College Senior,5,very clean and neat have no problem
College Senior,5,"I have been going to this school for about three years now, I have transfer from another college and ever since I did im glad I made that change. this school engage in many school activities which make you very welcome to new guest and friend on campus. this school gave me more reasons to refer friends and family to attend. I love this school."
College Junior,5,we have a wide variety of girls on campus
College Freshman,5,The professors are very experienced and are amazing teachesr in general. I'm so happy I picked this school.
College Freshman,5,There are plenty of job fairs on campus and there's a center that helps you create a resume and gives you nice places to work/intern at.
Freshman,4,Some professors were really easy on us when during online learning but some professors did not give us a break and they assigned so much work. They would not assign that much during a regular school basis.
Freshman,4,I like that Bay Path University offers a lot of opportunities. There is also a lot of support services on campus.
Freshman,4,"As an entering freshman Bay Path has worked with me to not only create a schedule based on what college level work I have already done, but to make me feel comfortable and ready to go on campus in the fall and be successful."
Sophomore,4,"I am going into my sophomore year at Bay Path and am loving the experience so far. There are the usual blips you get in college like roommate problems and account holds due to missing paperwork and the like, but other than those I have experienced little discord at BPU. The staff are all super uplifting and available for students, my advisor in particular is a big advocate for bringing students with her to national science conferences. Financial Services gave me a scholarship no one knew about because it had gone untouched for so long after I had a conversation with an alum from my hometown. All in all the worst thing about the school so far is that they charge us extra due to Longmeadow town laws stating that the grass must be mowed twice daily and kept in near pristine condition all the time. The wake up call from the mowers every morning while the grass was still green was a tad annoying but it became white noise fairly quickly."
Senior,4,"A very good university, especially for science students as they offer many majors to choose from. Most professors are good, but advisors are lacking in helpfulness. They also offer a lot of online classes which is good for commuter students, like me."
Junior,4,"I'm currently going into my Junior year at Bay Path and I have to say, I love the school. The professors are typically helpful and the courses are challenging, but manageable."
Junior,4,"Baypath is a very beautiful place the landscape is amazing! The staff and faculty professors are very friendly and willing to help if problems arise.  The key aspect in my opinion that is important to have in a college is good relationships with the financial aid office because I had a very not well experience in my other college that I attended for when I was getting my Associates, but in Baypath they are awesome! They don't act rude or disrespectful no matter how simple the question may be!!!  Overall it's great-yes it might be expensive but you can work it out with the financial office . What I would change about this university is the fact that the buildings should contain numbers. It's easier to not get lost if they're numbered because by name the names are kind of long to remember.  It's just easier to get yourself around when buildings are numbered.  That is the only reason why I rated it four stars."
Junior,4,"I love the small classroom sizes where you get to know your professors on a more personal level. Because the undergraduate program is female only, there is a lot of woman empowerment, giving me additional confidence that boosts my self-esteem."
Senior,4,"Overall, I have had a good experience. Professors are wonderful on the whole. Classes can be challenging depending on your strengths. More communication between administration and students would be appreciated."
Junior,4,I like that I can take online classes. What I don't like is that the teachers are around the world. Its like if you have a problem you can't just go the campus and get help form a face to face person.
Junior,4,"The campus is small but beautiful with well-kept lawn. The campus has an environment that feels welcoming, and everyone that you encounter has a friendly smile on their face. Welcome week is when all the transfer students will move on campus a week early and interact with one another in groups and events in order to create a relaxed environment. There were informational tours, leaders, and interactive games that helped the new transferring students learn the campus and who to contact when in need of help. The President is very interactive with her students and often will sit in with a random group during lunch. Bay Path University had helped me overcome my shyness, challenged me, and had provided opportunities to expand my knowledge and help others. The thing that I would like to see changed at Bay Path University is the food. However, they are making improvements as we speak in making a variety of foods available to their students."
Junior,4,"Great professors and a welcoming comminity. I have yet to have a professor that I have not liked! they take time out of their day to get to knw students personally. They are truly there to help. I love the small campus, it is located in a safe town. The campus safety officers are quick to respond."
Junior,4,"Being a Junior here my experience has been great. Everyone here is EXTREMELY NICE.  I have meet many cool peers and I have a lot of amazing professors! Mostly all the professors are here to see you rise not fall. Great school if you are looking for a small school, good academics, and safety is REALLY big here.  BPU was ranked 1st for safest college in Massachusetts. However, BPU is not for everyone. If you are looking for a party school, apply somewhere else.  Like every school, BPU has minor things that need to be changed; better food, better athletics. But, overall I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
Freshman,4,My experience has been a positive one. Everyone has been helpful. Whenever you have a question they try to get back to you as soon as possible. They constantly check on you and your progress. They give opportunity and an open door to address your concerns. It is a very comfortable environment. If there is ever a time where you can't reach someone there is always someone else there to assist you and make sure you get what you need.
Senior,4,"Overall, Bay Path is an outstanding school. In regards to academics, the university employs some of the best staff that take a true interest in each individual student given the small class size. Where the school lacks a bit is on the party scene. The campus is dry, and the town is more of a quiet residential area. However, a quick ride to Springfield solves that issue."
Junior,4,"Although it is an all girl school & isn't too much fun, the professors and advisors aren't amazing. They are always available to help you and go out of their way to make sure that you succeed and are doing what you really want to do with your life."
Sophomore,4,In general it's a great school. I sometimes wish that it had things you see at other campuses but then Bay Path wont feel like home.
Freshman,4,My first semester at Bay Path was full of other young women ready to succeed at college as well as professors and school staff members that were full of support. The food and WELL program could use some tweaking but the good vastly outweighs any bad.
Junior,4,"Bay Path offers an amazing academic experience and connects you with professionals in the community, and opportunities to succeed. Extremely safe community and dedicated staff. Tight-knit and very safe community. "
College Junior,4,The main campus is in a very safe area.  There is campus security as well.
College Junior,4,"So far it has really been a great experience.  Everyone I have come in contact with has been most helpful.  I get the feel that the staff wants to see the students succeed.  Again, I am at the beginning of my journey."
College Junior,4,I am at the beginning of the journey. So far the experience has been great.  Everyone I have come in to contact with has been very helpful.  I am enrolled in their on line program.  The school makes the online experience more personal.
College Junior,4,There are so many programs and the professors are so helpful! Registration is a pretty smooth process as well compared to most schools.
College Freshman,4,The school is very understanding and it's easy to get help when needed.
College Junior,4,Bay path university is a very goal oriented school. I love that all of the students and teachers are there for us. I like that every student is required to have an internship and the career center will help students find them.
College Junior,4,Almost everyone is able to land a job/internship
College Junior,4,I'm a transfer student and am happy with my choice
College Freshman,4,There is always an officer on duty and they come very quickly when called. The police are just down the street as well. I would be willing to sit outside at any hour by myself because I feel very safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,"The professors are very accessible and helpful. They reposed I'm Tim,eh manners to emails and really care about the students. They know you by name and build relationships with to get the most out of your college experience. The class size is small and many people enjoy that."
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus, the public safety officers are very good at what they do and make sure that nothing happens on campus. I don't think a lot happens o campus in terms of crime, but I feel very safe."
College Freshman,4,"The courses and professors at this school are amazing. The classes are designed to challenge you and that is exactly what they do. They are also very interesting and engaging, they are almost never boring. The professors are also very good, they really care about each student and want what is best for each and everyone of us."
College Freshman,4,They provide job fairs so students can look for employment. They are provide opportunities for students to go talk to people who are out in their perspective fields and make connections so they can hopefully get a job as soon as they graduate.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience at my school is a great one. The campus is very small which helps getting to know people and really connecting with other people at the school. The academics are also very good, the professors really help you get to a new level of learning that you didn't think was possible. They really encourage you and push you out of your comfort zone. If I could do the whole college picking process over again, I would definitely still pick the one I'm at because I have made some really great friends and I am being pushed academically."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are very nice and really want to help. 

Classes are generally small which is nice. Although, with the influx of students coming next year I am sure this will change. 

I do good in all my courses so I think they are great."
College Student,4,"A variety of options .Boxing, pole fitness, yoga, meditation, field hockey softball. Etc .We get a personal trainer for life no charge .Fully equipt gym. Welcoming atmosphere for all activities and levels .They encourage healthy living and self love and appreciation."
College Freshman,4,"CAMPO seems great, and I feel like the campus is very safe"
College Freshman,4,The small campus and friendly staff who are always there for you make it great
College Freshman,4,"The freshmen dorms could be better, but the buildings are nice and rooms are fairly large"
College Freshman,4,"I think that the athletic teams here are really great, and the girls on the teams have close bonds"
College Freshman,4,"It's a great small school, but they're growing and making changes and not too many students here are very comfortable with change. Overall it's really great and pretty much everyone gets along really well. Also great professors and you get to know them on a personal level thanks to small class sizes!"
College Junior,4,my class is all nurses currently working
College Junior,4,I am in a pilot progam. I have nothing to judge it against
College Freshman,4,There are no issues with crime on campus. I feel completely safe while on campus. There are always campus police on campus. The number to call to get in contact with campus security is posted in every building in multiple places and it is easy to contact them.
College Freshman,4,"Alumni are very involved on campus, they hold dinners and were participants in orientation. Internships are required to graduate and advisers help to find and follow through with internships. there is a career network online where students can upload resumes to be reviewed and jobs are posted. work study is a big part of campus and confined to no more than 10 hours a week to make sure that students are not overloaded and can manage their work load. This is a department at school that can help with mock interviews and you can even get clothes for interviews if you do not have the means to get appropriate apparel."
College Freshman,4,"The overall experience is great. There are so many activities and things to get involved with. Community service projects are available which I like. The classes so far for me have not been an extreme challenge. Tutors and study sessions and professors are available outside of class to help and answer questions. This makes classes more worth while to take more away from the experience. Professors are passionate about their fields and professions. For example, the forensic science adviser worked in forensics and is available to help people who also want to go into that field like I do. She is helpful with advice and helping to find internships. I love this school and the staff is absolutely fantastic."
College Freshman,4,"The housing process was simple and the cost is reasonable. This school was my second choice and I chose it because of the staff along with the price. The dorms are decent and the environment is nice. People are friendly and stop in and say hi when you leave our door open. The RAs are very friendly and approachable when an issue arises. Kitchenettes are provided with a stove, refrigerator, oven, microwave, etc. There is also a common area in each dorm building with a TV and computers to do homework. There is also one building that is always open to access printers and homework once the library is closed. Security is always around when needed and shuttles are provided to take students to work or internships or to visit other places reasonable distances from the school."
College Freshman,4,"Sports are not very big at Bay Path University because it is an all girls school. Usually football is a popular sport but we do not have that. although, some students are trying to start a powder puff league. School spirit is high with the sports that we do have. Our field hockey team is very skilled and those games have good attendance records. one of our scholarship players is extremely skilled; she played field hockey in the Disney resort in Florida and in Spain!"
College Sophomore,4,"Besides being all women, I would say BPU is pretty diverse. Sometimes the dining hall will have taco night (one time they had churros!) or chinese food. There is a bible study group and a couple other religious clubs. 30-40% of the student body is ethnic."
College Senior,4,I think that our chances of work after are very high
College Senior,4,I think they really care
College Junior,4,School spirit is quite evident.
College Sophomore,4,"I am currently only taking online courses, but my experience with my peers and the professors have been great. Everyone is friendly, welcoming and supportive; we learn a lot from each other. The few times I have been on campus the experience was great as well. The students and faculty were very nice; my advisors have been very helpful and supportive as well."
College Junior,4,"I wish that I could say that it is the best but Bay Path has a long way to go! I am currently in the occupational therapy program and apart from having such an intense curriculum, I also am dealt with the financial burdens of paying for school without the assistance from any of my family members. Bay Path gave me $1000 in additional funds to help me with the costs, however,being that they are a private university and have a lot of financial assistance, I wish they would have given me more money. I am grateful for what I did recentlly receive and am going to look more intently into resources that can help more than my school has."
Recent Alumnus,4,My school has been great so far.
College Freshman,4,"One of the things i like about this college is that their rules are very strict. No alcohol whatsoever, no parties, etc. However, something that can make some girls uncomfortable is the visitation rule because guests such as men can stay 3 nights a week, and that is kind of awkward."
College Freshman,4,"There are many single rooms which it is a good thing! the housing is in good condition, but only one building has air conditioner."
College Freshman,4,plenty of places to dine. Even better if a car is available to travel to Springfield for even more variety
College Freshman,4,Campus strictness is the same for all college campus's
College Freshman,4,Make sure you submit all documents required by the date due. Financial aid advisors will walk you through the process
College Senior,4,A lot of students would say it is a better options for them financially.
Junior,2,"I have been here at this univ for 3 years now & I have faced the most discrimination & in your face racism from students & faculty in my whole life. As a POC your safety is not seen to be top priority. Each year more things happen to POC of all classes & majority ends up transferring out because actions are never taken. For Black History Month they served barbecue chips & said that was the representation of black culture. The education is amazing but with the lack of diversity, ignorant students and faculty, lack of safety, and honestly the lack of a campus life I wish I would have gone elsewhere. This was my top pick for college I boasted about this college to everyone before coming here. Now I hate to walk on this campus that cost too much and seems like all they care about is money. They say they love diversity but they dont. As a WOC I warn others DO NOT COME HERE!"
College Freshman,2,The gym could be better and expanded. Many students don't enjoy working out in there because it's small and uncomfortable.
Recent Alumnus,2,"This school tries very hard to be something it is not. They do not offer much in the way of guiding students towards their career goals and you really have to be forceful in order to get what you want. They charge a disgusting amount of money and lie about the scholarships that you will receive. I would not recommend this school to anyone, especially if they will be a science major."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Bay Path has some strengths, but a tremendous amount of weaknesses. Academically, it seems to be decent. I was involved in the OT program and it was a fair amount of challenging that I appreciated. Faculty is there for you, as class sizes are tiny and they will get to know you. Socially, this school is terrible, and inept. It seems to attract many close-minded girls, that make you question people. The school is majorly made up of liberal individuals that shove their views down your throats. Most people here are either bisexual or a lesbian. If you hold traditional values, this is not a place that will not embrace you or your values. Additionally, the school's campus life is quite dull. Because it is so small, there are only a very limited amount of clubs. The surrounding town and city is dull as well. I have explored around, and there is not all that much to see. Forest Park, however, is very beautiful. Longmeadow is right next to Springfield, a city that is known to be dangerous. There are workers at this school that are paid to mow the lawns everyday and ""show"" people where to park. It is crystal clear that this school charges an obnoxiously unreasonable tuition for idiotic reasons like lawn-mowing, when they should use it to invest in more resources like computers, and a bigger library for the education of their students.

This school, to me, is incredibly ""fluffy."" Aesthically it looks nice, but there isn't much substance to it. It's all a show.

I don't recommend this school to anyone. However, if you can be a commuter, and they have your program, it may be worth looking into. However, I wouldn't promise any largely profound insights from this school, or anything remotely life-changing. It is a small school, small-minded, and far from the college experience I wanted and wish upon others."
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall is always clean, and the staff is very nice! However, the menu is horrible. Too much junk food, and the vegetables are not even that good either."
College Senior,2,"I really did not use my meal plan that much. The food there is something I would not eat often. What I would get there is pizza, fried or grilled chicken and a salad. Who really wants to eat that every day. Sometimes they have excellent dinner and lunch options, but it occasionally and I wished it was every day"
College Junior,2,its not a great city and surrounded by some other poor cities
College Junior,2,"In a dangerous area, there are no apartment buildings nearby, public transportation very limited. Lots of houses to rent but unaffordable."
College Junior,2,There are no sports on campus
College Junior,2,It's a small campus in East Longmeadow that offers one dining hall and very little access to restaurants that are 10+ miles away
College Sophomore,2,im dont really play sports
College Freshman,2,No one really attends sporting events and no one takes the teams seriously because there are so few players.
College Junior,2,Affording school can be very difficult that is why I am on this site.
College Junior,2,Everyone just goes to UMass
College Junior,2,We do not have a track or gym but we do have all major sports.
College Sophomore,2,"selection could be better,something for everyone though"
College Sophomore,2,"There is off campus housing, but mostly very expensive or in high crime areas. Not really worth being off campus unless you lived here a while"
College Sophomore,2,"There is a Dr. on premise during some hours, but only rarely. The hours are inconvenient."
College Senior,2,"The town where my school is located is a very family oriented place so there isn't a lot you can do unless you go out of town. There are never really parties at the school because it is a dry campus so your more likely to go to other campuses if you want to go to parties. Basically if you want to have a little fun out of the the town bring your own transportation because the school doesn't offer anything after ten. Your best bet for night clubs is to go to divas, Max Cap or go to  Boston which is an hour away."
College Freshman,2,nightlife for students isnt really there. there is not much to do around campus or even on off campus because we have a drug and alcohol free campus at bay path college.
College Sophomore,2,"Barely Any Off-Campus Options! Bay Path is not close to any restaurants. Domino's and one or two chinese food places deliver to the campus, but that's about it. If you are lucky enough to have a car, there is a mall about 20 minutes away."
College Senior,2,"Parking passes for the whole school year cost $300, however you'll want to get one fast because they run out quickly. Parking is awful when trying to find a space during the week, more spaces are needed for the amount of passes they give out. A and fine start at $10 and go up from there depending on the violation. There is no large need for a car on campus unless you have a job or internship because the college offers a free shuttle to take students to the malls, Wal-Mart, pharmacys and other places."
College Sophomore,2,The school gave me a couple awards for financial aid which was helpful but not worth much. FAFSA screwed me and didn't give me anything.
College Freshman,2,Greek life at bay path college is very different from most big colleges because we don't have that kind of lifestyle here.
College Freshman,2,"At Bay Path College the dining options could be a lot better. The variety doesn't ever change there is always pizza, salade, and a sandwich area. Students get so use to the food that once we have something better the food at college sucks. You can also have a meal plan some students have 14 meals a week which means 2 meals a day. If you want a quick munch you can go to the cafe and get something at 8:00. The amount of flex dollars you can spend there is up to $100.00."
College Senior,2,"In longmeadow I would believe that the off campus housing was great. Nice safe neighborhoods are  a plus, but not many local attractions in the central location, including dining. Affordability might be higher than average and what a student may can afford on a single income plus other expenses. Roomate needed!"
College Sophomore,2,"Uhhm Well Not So Much â€“ The Athletics at BPC aren't bad- but they aren't wonderful, either. I'm not an athlete, but a few of my friends are, and sorry to say- I can't recall any incidents where our team had won a game or a match. But... Bay Path Football is undefeated"
College Sophomore,2,"During the week from 8am-5pm and on Saturdays from 8am-8pm it is hard to find parking. People have to park very far away in non-parking spot places.  Tickets and fining is very common, its seems lots of people get tickets for not very good reasons.  We have a van that can take people without a vehicle places but sometimes they forget about you, and it wont take you to work which I find ridiculous."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not Much Night Life â€“ There is not much in the way of local night life, and the night life in the adjacent city of Springfield is in an area that I do not feel comfortable going to in the evenings."
College Senior,2,"Off Campus Dinning â€“ There are not many restaurants locating with in close proximity. The restaurants that are convenient and reasonable cost, you need a car to get there."
College Junior,2,Not on My Radar â€“ I don't pay attention to the school's sports.
College Junior,2,"Small Classes â€“ small class sizes to get a more personalized lesson from teachers, cultural events on campus"
College Student,2,You Are Paying to Eat Cereal â€“ The food is rather awful. If you are on any special diet or have specific allergies it is even harder to find food. More than once a week we order delivery just so we are getting food. Make sure you have a back up plan.
College Freshman,2,Bay Path College is an all Womens college. You will see the occasional guy from the graduate program and some times you see brothers and boyfriends. Since there are no boys the girls tend to wear sweatpants to classes and only get really dressed up when it is necessary.
College Junior,2,Its New England weather so its different everyday.
College Freshman,2,"We Need Color Printers â€“ The computers in the computer labs around Bay Path College are okay, but they load and process too slow.  And this school doesn't provide people the Microsoft Office software if they can't afford it.  So we end up having to use the schools slow computers.  And there are no color printers anywhere on campus or at their library that's located off campus.  They claim that there is one, but none has showed up in my search of one.  Bay Path College needs to have at least 3 or 4 color printers on campus.  Buying my own costs too much money; I've put a lot of money into this school, so they should be able to provide color printers."
College Sophomore,2,"Food Is Okay â€“ The food can seem repetitive and somethings they try to change things up so much, that everyone just wants the option of plain pizza or just a sandwich but those aren't always available."
College Sophomore,2,"We Are Small, So Is the Athletic Program â€“ The school is small and so is the athletic program here. We recently started an ice hockey club and we have basketball and softball and soccer teams."
College Sophomore,2,New England â€“ It snows in the Winter and rains in the Spring and the weather is always changing.
College Junior,2,"There Is a Large Range of Girls and There Are No Guys â€“ Bay Path is an all girls school so there are no men to rate. Because of this there is obviously a large range of women. The girls can be very obnoxious at times and they complain a lot about things that students at regular colleges have to deal with all the time, like the food or having more than one exam on the same day."
Freshman,1,"They tell you it's an all-accepting school, yet upon starting my freshman year there was already cliques and issues between many people. The campus is beautiful, but that's where your entire tuition is going. The dorm rooms in Theinert had a bug infestation a few months ago and they didn't have heat. Teachers are severely underpaid. I didn't feel as though I was getting my moneys worth or that it was setting me up in any way for my career path. They advertise about the many clubs they have and all the fun things to do on campus, but upon arrival, you realize there truly isn't much to do and there aren't many clubs either. The food is pretty much the same everyday and there aren't many options. If you have other options, I would definitely explore them."
Freshman,1,"Part 1 of my review

The education is sub-par and the school tried very hard to seem like something it is not to bring in more students. Comparing my visit vs coming to the school, the faculty and students over exaggerated how great the school is. Now I feel cheated and like I am wasting my money.

The student life is terrible, nothing goes on over the weekend since most of the student commute, and clubs virtually do not exist. The school is also terrible about letting the students know about clubs around campus. 

You are basically forced to live on campus unless you commute because off-campus housing is expensive and/or in an unsafe area.  The school is also located in the rich suburbs so there's not much you can do around the area unless you have a car and are willing to drive 20-30 minutes."
College Freshman,1,My school does not have Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life here on campus
College Freshman,1,It is honestly not good at all. You're better off living nearby and commuting.
College Freshman,1,"Dry campus, no partying happens here."
College Junior,1,I think that going to school in Mass explains itself
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life on campus.
College Junior,1,The parking on campus is absolutely ridiculous. Each year the campus expands but the parking lots do not.
College Junior,1,"We have a very limited space, and the parking passes are very expensive."
College Sophomore,1,"A parking pernit costs $300! And that's if you're lucky to get one on time! The parking on campus is very limited. Commuters and residents alike have to fight for spots in the tiny parking lots. Even worse, there is no off-campus parking.You will get a ticket from the campus police if you don't have a parking permit."
College Sophomore,1,No Men â€“ Bay Path is an all girls campus. For me there's not much of a dating scene.
College Senior,1,Not Enough Spots â€“ There are always more cars on campus than spots. People consistently park along sidewalks and areas where there is no parking allowed. This sometimes blocks cars in actual spots from leaving their spots easily and safely. Always try and get 20-30 minutes before class to ensure you get a parking spot.
College Freshman,1,Drinking or Not â€“ The school policies that affect the students is how we can't drink on school campus. There really is no partying but you can party at someone's house if you really wanted to.
College Sophomore,1,"Guys on campus? ha its an all girl school but dont be dissapointed there is always a couple guys on campus, but usually they are somebodies boyfriend. We do have co-ed parties, but not many men come by. We are tryng to change this issue though"
College Junior,1,No Night Life â€“ none
College Student,1,Have a Car Ready to Go â€“ It a dry campus so chances of having any parties  on campus is a zero. It's a rural area  so chances of  being really  close to night club are slim.  If you want to party all most at all clubs is 21+.
College Freshman,1,"Very Strict to the Point of Almost No Life â€“ It is a dry campus and has a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol. It doesn't matter if you are of legal age to drink or not if you are caught with alcohol you get a $100 fine and community service hours
They over react about almost everything because it is an all girls college 
You are only allowed overnight guests three nights out of the week, only one at a time, you must be with your guest at all times unless they are in the main public dining building 
You are not allowed to burn candles or anything in your room we're not even allowed to have toasters in our rooms."
College Freshman,1,"Not a Lot to Do Here â€“ Bay Path College doesn't have very much to offer for fun and interesting things to do here.  All we can do is go to the mall and a few stores, but that's a long way sometimes.  And our van shuttle guys don't like driving us anywhere, so they end the shuttle shifts way too early.  They have sports, but not very many (and the teams aren't even great).  Bay Path needs to come up with ways to keep us all engaged and loving the school and give us later shuttle times.  If they did that, maybe less people would stop transferring out of here."
College Freshman,1,Nothing to do â€“ There's nothing to do besides homework!

Sophomore,5,"Bennington is a really, really special place. I transferred in because I wanted a place without requirements, majors, etc. For that reason, it's perfect--if you're a self-directed, independent thinker who is positive about whatever classes they get and you're able to enjoy a wide variety of topics, the academic environment is awesome. I love the faculty and every course I've taken has been interesting.

Socially, I'm sure you've been told it can be tough if you're not a certain type of person--but if you're like me and you enjoy rich discussion, walking outdoors, house parties, being open, etc., it is a place where you can really thrive. 

I give it five stars because it is very literally perfect for me, but Bennington isn't for everyone. It requires flexibility and openness to thrive. But, if you feel attracted to the idea of being self directed and living in an isolated community in rural Vermont, you probably belong here. I think it was truly the best decision I ever made :-)"
Freshman,5,"Bennington enables students to pursue their passions, learn and practice professional skills, and create close communities both in and out of classes."
Senior,5,"They push you to define and explain your thinking and ideas constantly. At times it's very hard, but the payoff totally worth it. Students design their course of study and must constantly reshape and defend their work."
Sophomore,5,What I like about Bennington College is the ability to combine different areas of study in order to create a major you are satisfied with. The small student body is also advantageous in the classroom where students receive more attention. What I wish would change about the college is that there would be more sports to participate in.
Alum,5,Bennington is an amazing school and such a special place. The faculty is amazing and they take the students very seriously. One of the best places out there for aspiring artists and writers.
College Freshman,5,Campus Safety is very efficient and diligent. I feel very safe on campus at all times.
College Freshman,5,"We aren't voted #1 for campus housing on Princeton Review for nothing! 1st and 2nd street consist of beautiful colonial houses that house around 30-40 people. 3rd street consists of more modern houses with a more dorm-y feel but they are equally as beautiful.  It's really a tight-knit community living environment and you get to assimilate with people of every grade, gender, and part of the world."
College Freshman,5,"The college process was diffficult for me and to be quite honest, I was very close to giving up and not going. Then I found Bennington, a school that sounded too good to be true. Now that I am here, I know that this school is the perfect place for me. From the interesting and unique courses offered each term, to the beautiful houses we live in, to field work term, and to everything in between, this school provides the necessary materials to transform students to well-rounded individuals by graduation."
College Junior,5,"CAMPUS SAFETY IS AMAZING. The staff really care about the students, and their priority is student safety and not to write students up. The are wonderful people who take the time to get to know you and develop a rapport with students. The will remember your name, major, and will soon have inside jokes with you if you treat them with general respect."
College Freshman,5,We stay in houses as opposed to dorms which is really nice because it creates a community feeling. Houses generally do things together and spend a lot of time together. The housing survey when entering school is accurate and the people placed in each house truly belong to that house.
College Sophomore,5,We get the unique opportunity to perform 7-week internships every January-February as part of Field Work Term. This experience allows us to create our own connections and networks and experiences while still getting an education and working towards a degree. The school is extremely helpful in helping us find our internships by pointing us towards alumni with related career paths as well as past internships students have done that are related to our career paths.
College Sophomore,5,"Because Bennington is such a small liberal arts school in Vermont, the residential life is very secluded and tight-knit. All the housing is within one central community which then allows for us as students to become closer with one another. Additionally, our housing is very unique! We have ""colonial houses"" that consists of about 36-40 people per house with 2 house chairs. Each house has it's own personality as well as family-like relationship. Also, everyone lives on campus with freshman and sophomores living in doubles or triples and juniors and seniors living in singles (unless a person requests a medical single due to disability)."
College Sophomore,5,"Bennington is one of the most unique, fascinating, and inspiring places I've ever been. It's a place where you actually learn to THINK, where you're forced to take ownership of your own education and your academic future, where you forge, find, and create the best version of yourself. The student body, the faculty, the administration... all play a vital role in this tight-knit, important, and truly remarkable community."
College Freshman,5,I never found Bennington homogeneous. There are always new things to learn from people.
College Freshman,5,Parties are always fun but not so wild. Socially accepted and enjoyed by the most.
College Freshman,5,"""Dorms like houses"". Bennington dorms are the best."
College Sophomore,5,So much fun - there is NO pressure to be under the influence of any substance.  Parties are safe and supported by student living organizations.
College Sophomore,5,Really exceptional workers that just want to make sure every student feels safe and secure in their living environment.
College Sophomore,5,"Great relationships within disciplines, but without majors, we as students and flow easily between different areas of study.  It's a dream!"
College Sophomore,5,"Students compose their own course of study rather than declaring a major.  This process - called ""The Plan Process"" - is greatly supported by the administration and faculty of Bennington College.  It is an integral aspect of our philosophies as an institution."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus safety officers are very much present on campus, but clarify their role as being a helpful resource rather than authority figures looking to get students in trouble."
College Sophomore,5,It is just a dream - you are placed according to your specific personality and live with a range of students from different grade levels and backgrounds.  Dormitories are treated like houses - its residents: family!
College Sophomore,5,Incredibly rigorous for the independent-minded.
College Sophomore,5,THE FACULTY are the COOLEST most HELPFUL and PASSIONATE folk I have every met. Love em.
College Sophomore,5,"Campus is beautiful. Scenically, I am often left standing and admiring the view. Many campus buildings are very impressive and useful. Others could use renovations or reevaluations. "
College Sophomore,5,"I am so pleased with Bennington. The space, the faculty, the community of my peers - all contribute to an ""education."""
College Sophomore,5,"Campus is like a fantasy world - a safe, sound bubble of beautiful mountains where no one ever gets hurt or robbed. I feel secure leaving my property around my house and my supplies around the studios, and feel a sense of trust and respect within the student body. Campus Safety - ""campo"" - is very friendly (generally) and are truly looking out for our safety."
College Sophomore,5,"FIELD WORK TERM, baby. Bennington students perform four internships before graduating, which they must secure, fulfill, and evaluate themselves. Though we complain often about the obligation and effort required, Bennington works because of this half-semester. Students do some amazing work in the winter that fuels us and feeds us."
College Sophomore,5,"The only program I am in is my own: my own questions, passions, ravings - it's called the Plan Process. Not for everyone, definitely, but a challenging and rigorous life experience for those who need it."
College Sophomore,5,"Bennington is home. So cozy, so accepting, and simply a fantastic space to study & live."
College Senior,5,"Bennington is in the middle of nowhere and is a small campus. People rarely steal, most people leave their doors unlocked. "
College Senior,5,"We don't have majors or minors. You work in what you want to and just need to justify yourself to a committee every term. That means you can do as much interdisciplinary work as you want and as long as you have enough credits you graduate. 

I know the literature classes are rigorous as are the music ones but the crazy hard working students are the visual artists. "
College Senior,5,"The forecast says sunny, but what it means is sunny followed by a five minute hail storm, sudden humidity and then wind gusts. We live in a valley. The weather does what it wants.

Expect heat in the late spring/ early fall. Then beautiful leaves! Then lovely snow everywhere.
"
College Senior,5,"The thing I did not know about Bennington when I applied was actually the best thing about it. You learn what you want.
We don't have majors. We don't have grades (but you can ask for them and they will give them to you). Class sizes are small and professors go by there first names. Basically, the whole experience is about you. Although most people here laugh at the Plan Process it is actually pretty awesome. 

We make our own majors by explaining to a committee of professors what we want to learn while we are here, why we want to do it and how we are going to make it happen. There are no requirements, but don't think that makes it easy. No one tells you what 'your major' should include, you have to figure it out and justify it. You need to be creative and smart, there are no check boxes to tick off to graduate it isn't that simple.

Oh, and we have Field Work Term (FWT) were you are required to find an internship/job anywhere in the world over the winter. Terrifying and fantastic but really helps you figure out what you want to do with your life after school. "
College Sophomore,5,"I grew up in New England so I am used to the weather. We are on campus for two of the most beautiful times of the year, fall when all the leaves are changing and late spring when everything is blooming. We get cold weather and some snow, all of it is manageable. "
College Junior,5,"Academics are phenomenal, and (for the most part) diverse and exciting. Social scene is lovely - finding your people is easier than most places. Facilities? What do you mean facilities....I mean my goodness. Campus life is small and contained, but nice. "
College Junior,5,"No one likes paperwork. Bennington works harder than so many other schools to take care of its students in need. That being said, my roommate had to leave the school because her aid went down due to her dad's new job."
College Junior,5,It is genuinely the best. Swan House Booyah!!!!!!!!
College Junior,5,"Housing at Bennington is definitely one of its perks.  Generally, houses develop their own vibe, which makes them feel more like a community.  All houses are co-ed and mix all years of students.  Rooms are spacious, there's a big common room in every house, and each house has at least one kitchen."
College Junior,5,I love it here. Bennington is a classic Vermont town but with better transportation and more coffee shops! Also delicious Italian food and wonderful small business owners.
Sophomore,4,"Online learning has been tough for everyone, but Bennington made the transition really well. However, I think it is tough being a zoom student trying to seamlessly join an in-person class, so unless the entire class is zooming, it doesn't work really well."
Sophomore,4,Overall Bennington has been a dream! I am able to study exactly what I want and professors are excited to help me. I do with that there were more 4000 lvl digital arts classes.
Freshman,4,"Overall it was pretty enjoyable to be here. It's been great so far for me academically, the teachers are super super friendly and approachable. The resources are adequate. Only major downside is the local area is pretty barren, and it can get pretty lonely here during the winter, which is like most of the school year."
Sophomore,4,"Bennington is an amazing school when it comes to academics and helping freshmen find their way through school. Not only are the professors understanding, but they are also always open to talk to students when they are having trouble. Also, advisers for first year students know how to help with any situation you have or are there if you just need help choosing classes."
Sophomore,4,"No school would be 5 stars for me. I love this school even though sometimes it infuriates me. If you love the city and hate rural places; don't come here. The colonials are the best, so try for those. If you at all want to study business or something very specific, check the curriculum online before you come here before you decide for sure. Even though this school is small, we have crazy opportunities, so don't rule it out."
College Junior,4,"We live in houses of 30-40 people, led by two house chairs. The communities are close-knit and all have different personalities. Unfortunately, it is incredibly difficult and a pain in the ass to change houses if you don't match with the lifestyle of your house. That being said, if you find the right one, it can completely change your house community."
College Freshman,4,"I am able to walk around campus at night and feel completely safe. Health services are great and I have found them to be really useful. Campus safety is a large part of the school but they are not invasive or rude. They just monitor campus and actually don't get a lot of people in trouble unless they are really violating school rules. There is a sense of trust on campus. You can literally leave your stuff in the library, go to dinner then come back and find your stuff untouched. It is wonderful feeling so safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Bennington College is located in a quaint yet vibrant environment. Being from a city, Bennington, Vermont is a whole new experience. Although it is not located in a bustling city, there is a homey and community atmosphere at the school. I have found that every person at the school has a unique and spirited story that got them there. It may be in the middle of Vermont but there is a diverse amount of people, classes, and faculty. Not only is the school an excellent learning community, but the campus is extraordinary. It is a wonderful way to learn surrounded by the Green Mountains of Vermont. I fell in love with Bennington College the moment I first stepped on campus, and that was in the middle of winter, which is really saying something. Along with the engaging and eclectic classes Bennington College offers a unique internship program called the Field Work Term, which is a seven week internship every student participates in. It is a great way to gain work experience and try out the field of work you are interested in."
College Sophomore,4,They are all very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"Our Campus Security knows each of us personally and is always available for us in terms of our security and safety. They attend every party held on campus to ensure everyone is safe and intervene when they observe a situation that is dangerous or concerning. In terms of sexual assault, they are very on top of allegations and enforcing ""No Contact"" orders when allegations are made. The school is extremely supportive in assisting a student through the processes needed to carry through allegations of sexual assault. The school has an absolute no tolerance for even the suggestion of a sexual assault or at the very least, a situation that make any student question their safety. The school also has staff and student volunteers available 24/7 as counselors to confide in anonymously."
College Sophomore,4,"The class sizes are so intimate that I feel supported by both my peers and my professors. This gives me so much more confidence in my work and my studies. I also feel like I have all the resources at hand that are needed for me to become stronger in my desired field and education plan. There are so many unique and versatile class options that aren't offered in other schools that allow for a more personalized experience,"
College Sophomore,4,"At Bennington you create your own curriculum which gives you the unique experience of personalizing and designing your own degree. With this, you don't need to worry about wasting time with unnecessary classes and instead you get to focus all your time and energy on the classes that assist in your intended degree. Bennington also has students do a 7-week internship from January to February. I love this concept at Bennington because it allows us to create connections and work experience while still in school and getting our education."
College Junior,4,"The fin aid office staff are wonderful, however, before every term I have a period where I wonder if I can return or not because the amount they want me to pay is always more than I can afford"
College Junior,4,"All houses are pretty nice, some are messier than others though"
College Junior,4,The admin is great at handling reports
College Junior,4,FWT lets us work at a wide range of interesting jobs
College Junior,4,There are parties every weekend
College Freshman,4,"Girls, being the majority of the college population, are really great. Students usually don't mind touching each other. Guys are more hippies influenced and smart."
College Sophomore,4,"It works for the small size of the school.  But it would be nice to have a bit more computers on campus.  Before classes, printing labs can get quite busy."
College Sophomore,4,The school is close to both a downtown center and a cute New England town.  Both locations have delicious dining options!
College Sophomore,4,Bennington College attracts and crafts individuals.  All people feel comfortable in this environment and absolutely anyone is welcome to join in the conversation.
College Freshman,4,Security is always walking around campus. You feel really protected and since they strive to make connections with students it makes a secure and more comfortable environment.
College Freshman,4,"House style dorms that range from old colonial to brand new and modern. The different styles greatly vary in cleanliness, amenities, social atmosphere etc. Small houses provide close knit communities and help ease transition into college life. House placement is pretty random. "
College Freshman,4,Wireless availability is very helpful. A few available computer labs. Printing is free. Personal computer probably necessary.
College Freshman,4,Very safe and secure. Crime and theft not common. Campus Safety readily available and present. 
College Sophomore,4,"Campus Safety lives up to its name. They really, truly are there to make our campus safe. If this means busting a party, they usually have good reason. Of course, they must obey the rules and enforce the law. "
College Sophomore,4,"Put simply, Bennington is totally weird. It sets itself apart in almost every way from the ""traditional"" college: in housing, in the definition of student-faculty relationships, in free coffee...."
College Sophomore,4,I could not be at Bennington without the Financial Aid office. They have worked with me one-on-one to make sure I can (just barely) afford this place. I could always use another scholarship... but I am very grateful for the school's generosity. 
College Sophomore,4,"Diversity at Bennington is, like everything else, a discussion: as a small and self-defined student body, we are reflecting on our own diversity constantly - criticizing it, appreciating it, creating it. Racially, Bennington is super white - that's a fact. Sexually, there's diversity into the realm of constant orgy. But, for me, these facts don't matter much. Through others' stories and backgrounds, I have found that my peers come from many backgrounds and have a lot to teach me. There are populations, for sure: the rich city kids, the Bennington-alum-raised, the ramen-raised. But having a group of young people who come from many places and are, by necessity, creating a unique identity through the Plan Process and FWT creates a diverse campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I own a desktop computer but absolutely cannot get work done in my room. Crossett Library saves me, though: a whole row of Mac desktops and a line of MacBook Airs that I can borrow and take around the library for a few hours. This resource is helpful in getting work done. Printing is free all over campus, and available 24/7.
I have never worked with tech support, but I've only heard great things. Because of our small size, almost all problems are dealt with very personally."
College Senior,4,"Basically if you are not bothering anyone or being dangerous, you are left alone to do what you want. We don't have RAs, we have house chairs. They are there to help if you need it, not to get you in trouble. Most of campus safety is friendly and does not want to catch you drinking. Just don't be stupid about it and no one cares. "
College Senior,4,"We have Field Work Term (FWT) which is basically the easiest opportunity to find out what you want to do with your life, get experience and make connection. You are actually required to do this. It can be difficult money wise sometimes, but there are a few grants that can help you. People do everything from working on farms, to being part of the youth EU council, shadowing doctors or working with nonprofits for humanitarian needs. You do have to get 210 hours of work done in 7 weeks but you can do it anywhere in the world every winter. "
College Senior,4,"There are quite a few places to park all over campus and while some lots fill up quickly you never won't find a spot. The campus is so small even if you have to park far away from your destination it is not a huge deal.

Do not park where you shouldn't. They are quick with those tickets. "
College Senior,4,"There are a few options for on campus living. We have houses, not dorms and there are three kinds you can live in. The colonials from my experience are the most popular because although they are the oldest they have the best public spaces to hang out in. There are the 70s houses (built to be temporary and yet...) they get a bad rep, but those people that live in them love the community. Also, the new houses. Built in the 90s they tend to be the quietest, cleanest and have nice working spaces but some of the family-like feeling is lost. Bennington is a bubble- all social activities are on campus.

You can also live in one of the non-dorm like houses. The only real difference is those people cook their own food and live a bit farther away."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm going to widen this to people at Bennington to not narrow this to the gender binary. As a person interested in guys, girls and those who don't subscribe to the gender binary, all of them are pretty awesome. Statistically, we have more females than males (only 36% males) but that is not much of a hindrance to people of any sexuality or gender identity. If I had to describe the general type of fashion on campus I would describe it as hippie hobo arty chic. Most people are creative, intelligent and passionate about what they are doing. People can sometimes be an interesting mix of passion and apathy, but that issue comes up more in the larger social life than individual relationships. Dating can be hard on this campus, mostly because it is very small and relationships can get very intense very fast. However, you don't come here to be in a relationship, you come here because you want the individualized educational experience that Bennington offers. "
College Sophomore,4,"I learned the other day that 45% of the college's funds go to Financial Aid for students which is pretty awesome. Personally Financial Aid has been great. Bennington is pretty expensive, but I was offered more money here than other colleges that advertise as ""100% need met.""  A lot of my friends decided to come here because of how much financial aid they offered. More than that they are really great at negotiating. When I was first coming here my dad asked for more money and they gave me 2,500 more semester. "
College Sophomore,4,"There has never been at time at Bennington that I have not felt safe. Our dorms are always open and I never lock my room door. Campus Safety is wonderful, their main purpose is not disciplinary but keeping us all safe. They are all very friendly, kind and helpful (for example: Young Mike always fixes my friend's TV). Ken Collamore, our head of Campus Safety, is really wonderful as well. I have heard different things about Health Services. I personally have always had an amazing experience at health services but my friends have sometimes had bad experiences. An example of this is that though STD testing is offered, apparently they can be slightly judgmental and representatives from SWAG (our Sexual Wellness Advocacy Group) usually recommend going to Plan Parenthood in town instead. However, that being said Health Services are usually very helpful and friendly, especially if you have a cold or minor illness, you can go in and get an awesome ""cold pack"" full of cough drops, ibuprofen and decongestants. "
College Junior,4,My laptop wasn't working for about 3 weeks - it was easy-peasy. I barely missed it.
College Junior,4,"Bennington is very reasonable about what counts - drinking, noise, etc. "
College Junior,4,"Lots of different views saying similar things.  
We have a fair number of international students, who provide the campus with a moderate amount of diversity.  Contrary to popular belief, Bennington is not a college of wealthy art hipsters.  Many students have considerable financial aid packages, don't study art (or only study it on the periphery), and follow the stereotypes generally associated with being a 'hipster.'  "
College Junior,4,"Off-Campus housing is great, however, getting through the school's bullshit to GET off-campus is incredibly difficult."
College Junior,4,"Safety = Excellent
Health = Okay"
College Junior,4,"As in most things, there's the good and the bad.  The good: around 85% of students here are on some financial aid, and many students, myself included, would not be here if it weren't for the generous financial aid I received.  The bad: well I guess this isn't really B-ton's fault, but my financial aid situation took a turn for the worst when my sister graduated college and FAFSA thought I could pay twice as much."
College Junior,4,"In all my time at Bennington, there has never been a moment here that I would describe as ""unsafe.""  Due to Bennington's relative isolation in ze mountains, you hardly ever see anyone on campus who is not a student or faculty member.  There are ""emergency"" booths and lights, though the walk from the Jennings music building back to the houses is a little frightening.  We don't lock our doors or bikes, we don't worry about walking home from other buildings on campus at 3am, and we don't use violence to resolve our differences."
College Junior,4,"Overall, the B-ton policy is to let us be.  Most of us are on a first name basis with campus security officers, who are really here more to make sure everyone's being safe than to ""catch you"" doing something you shouldn't.  Since there are an average of 10-20 students in a Bennington class, most teachers take attendance, and it does count towards your evaluation.  If you want to create a new student organization, you just sort of coordinate with a few interested people, fill out a form or two, and you've got it.  Parking violations are pretty strict, so make sure you get a parking pass for the term and don't leave your car parked in the middle of the street.  You will get fined.  Overall, administration is not strict and the relationships between students and administrators are much more personal than I think you'd find at other schools."
College Junior,4,"We're right in the Green Mountains.  So: extremely pretty, but it gets really cold.  Pack warm."
College Junior,4,"Bennington has a gorgeous campus.  There are a million pretty little study spots for every preference of seclusion.  The tech labs are super nice, the library is beautiful and will procure anything you want to read or watch, if it doesn't have it already, and the campus is more green Vermont beauty than buildings.  We have a plethora of weird little holidays that are campus traditions.  The rec barn is fully stocked with exercise equipment etc. but it's far away from everything else and no one really uses it.  We do have soccer, fencing, and badminton teams, but soccer is the only one currently competing with other schools."
College Junior,4,"I love Bennington.  It's got a really close, vibrant community, full of people who are working on the things they love.  The workload can be hard and it is expensive here, but I feel like I'm really getting a better, broader education here than I could anywhere else."
College Junior,4,"Bennington doesn't have majors; instead, every student designs a Plan for themself based on their own multidisciplinary interests.  This Plan develops throughout your four years and culminates in your senior work.  Workload varies by discipline but is generally heavy and rigorous.  But then, we're all working on stuff we love, so it's not as much of a chore as it could be.  In addition to schoolwork, all students are required to find a seven-week internship related to their studies every winter (Field Work Term), so you graduate with quite a resume."
College Junior,4,"Age of houses ranges from less than 10 years to a little over 80.  Those have been renovated, of course.  Rooms tend to be biggish (for dorm rooms) and nice on the inside; unlike with dorms, these are actual houses, and they're all different from each other.  No cookie-cutter square prefab deal.  You can decorate however you want.  House community is really great; Bennington sorts people into houses based on their personalities so that people with similar interests and habits tend to live together."
College Junior,4,"Anyone at Bennington can have a car, including freshmen.  A car is good to have for visiting places other than Bennington town, since we're a little remote, but if you don't have one there are also buses, and plenty of students do have cars, so you can hitch rides with them.
It costs $120 for the year for a parking permit, and students can park their cars in a few large, clearly labeled lots around campus.  Other lots are reserved for faculty, visitors, etc.  You'll never have trouble finding a space.  Parking distance from class isn't great; most people walk because nothing is much more than five minutes from anything else on foot, but it's not great for students with disabilities.  However, students with mobility problems can get permits from Campus Safety that allow them to park in any spot on campus, which will usually bring you right up to the building you need to be in.  Parking on the streets (all are fire lanes) for more than ten minutes or so will earn you a hefty fine, and they DO enforce that."
College Junior,4,"Bennington has a lot of school-supplied computers, both for general use and with a dedicated lab for all of the digital-heavy arts disciplines--photography, animation, etc.  They're REALLY nice, high-powered Macs for the most part. We've got some really cool tech too, like 3D printers.  The labs get crowded around midterms and finals, so you have to plan carefully, but otherwise they're great.  The wireless network blankets the campus and is free for anyone to use, but can be a little slow."
College Senior,4,"Bennington College feels like a very safe place to be. Absolutely no one locks their door (except for maybe if they are going out of town and don't want their friends drunkenly wandering in) and I very rarely, if ever, have heard of any theft. Students are good at looking out for eachother and their belongings and because of the small size it is normally easy to track missing items down. The campus safety team is very small and interferes infrequently as long as you keep your gatherings smallish and on the quiet side. They will often give you a warning before writing you up but it often depends what sort of mood they are in. Some are harsher than others but it is easy to befriend them and get a little mercy. As they will say themselves, they are there to keep you safe not to get you in trouble."
College Senior,4,"Rated number one for vegan/vegetarian friendly, Bennington has lots of healthy options and for the most part everything is super tasty. The dining hall is super good about listening to our opinions and making changes and adding items to the menu that we request. The dining hall is a super pleasant experience: lots of little rooms with good lighting, fire places, and nicely painted -- most find a room that they like with their friends and stick to it for most of the year."
College Junior,4,"We don't have Campus Police, we have Campus Safety. That already says a lot about Bennington; the officers are there mainly to ensure that students are safe and feel safe in the College's environment. They're always friendly and for the most part we all get along well."
College Freshman,4,"Very solid. Everyone can have a car and parking is really convenient to the dorm. Everyone lives on campus so it's not like there are a lot of commuting students vying for spaces. I've never had trouble with guests parking, either."
College Senior,4,"There are apartments, and small houses both in the town of Bennington and North Bennington. I live off campus, and the place I live is affordable, clean, utilities are included in the rent, and it is very close to school. It is easy to find a place to live off campus, though prices may vary."
College Freshman,4,Health Here Is Great – Everyone is just there to look out for you. They're there if you need it.
College Junior,4,"Campus Safety Stays for Coffee – Campus safety are just sweet people doing their job.  They come through daily and see you living your life and tend to stay and chat.  I guess they can be strict, but only for things that require strictness- as in, safety issues.  Hide your booze when they come through, out of respect for their job, and they won't go looking for it.  I had a cat on campus for over a semester, and campus safety Sue came through, fined me (it's her job), all the while explaining how rotten she thought the rule was.  The next time she came through, she just stayed around and played with her.  The only way you'll get in trouble is if you set something on fire, so don't do that."
College Junior,4,"Small Town With a Great Culture – Bennington looks like a tiny town, and our KFC is Zagat rated, but there are a lot of great restaurants hidden all over the place.  We have great Mexican, gourmet pizzas, fun pubs and the best diners in all of Vermont.  Taco Bell and McDonald's are there at night if you need them and Powers sandwiches are only a ten minute walk away.  Since we're in the middle of Vermont, you'll know lots of people with cars on campus, and chances are there's always someone willing to go run and get fries, coffee or a real dinner with you.  The only downside is Asian food.  There's a really cheap Chinese place, but for Indian or Thai you've got to drive."
Niche User,2,"Only welcoming if you fit in - which is VERY difficult based on what ""fitting in"" is here. People dress like a combination between your grandfather and a wealthy socialite. If you don't look like them good luck. It is really difficult to make friends once the first ten minutes of orientation are over. The food is awful... only okay when parents are visiting. The campus is beautiful but there is nothing going on unless you enjoy going to lectures. The town is boring unless you really enjoy going to Walmart because that is all that is here to do. Parties are people running drunk off their asses, couples making out on the dance floor, and people outside chain smoking cigarettes. If you don't smoke don't bother coming here. If you don't speak enough in class you fail which is tough because the environment in most classes is too overwhelming to get a word in. You either love it here or you hate it there IS NO IN BETWEEN."
College Junior,2,Not much diversity. Mainly rich white kids.
College Junior,2,"Classes are intimate but extremely demanding. Every professor expects his/her class to be the priority. Professors are accessible, but many areas of study only have one or two professors in them, so if you don't like their style, you're kind of screwed. Incredibly stressful curriculum style."
College Junior,2,"Field Work Term. Seven weeks of an internship between fall and spring terms. You are almost completely on your own to find an internship while taking on a full course load. It is INCREDIBLY rare to find a paid internship, meaning that between transportation and living expenses, you're looking at an extra $2000-3000 every year. Sometimes your internships are incredible. Sometimes they are the worst and you get nothing out of it. Either way, you pay for it. The school advertises that it helps students out with expenses in the form of grants, but the amount of money given amounts for about a third of the cost, at most. You also have a MUCH shorter winter break, NO spring break, and are in school for about an extra month, making it difficult to get summer internships."
College Junior,2,"This school is hit or miss. Unfortunately, it's a $60,000 (and rising each year) hit or miss. It takes a very specific type of student to succeed here. You need to be passionate, good under extreme stress, vocal, quirky, driven, and well-read. You have to be able to support an extreme workload as well as a very busy social life, because of the campus involvement that the student body demands. The students here could never be described as mainstream, but the student body makes it's own kind of mainstream; one made up of girls with short bangs, clogs, velvet, and 90's grunge that sway to experimental music and are dedicated to at least one social cause. If you aren't that, you stick out, and not in a good way. You have to be the right kind of liberal weirdo. Republicans beware. You also need to be incredibly self-directed and must have no problem advocating for yourself. You should not go here if you are a procrastinator; you will be crushed."
College Freshman,2,"Do not expect to win a sports scholarship to Bennington College because there are no sports teams. We don't even have school colors or a mascot. But that does not mean there is no school spirit. Bennington is more artsy than athletic. If you are an artist who cares nothing about school sports then Bennington would be a perfect fit. However, there is an athletic facility with weights, ellipticals and other means of exercise. I love to exercise and have to in order to stay sane and have found the recreational gym to be very useful and effective."
College Sophomore,2,Lots of drugs and alcohol. Weed is the most common thing comes after alcohol in parties.
College Sophomore,2,So I talked with recent alumni and they are not earning much. Field Work Term allows you have some internships on your cv but they don't seem working good after your graduation. It was shocked when I read The Economist's College Value Analysis. I would suggest you to take a look at it before coming here.
College Sophomore,2,"I came to Bennington hoping it was going to be a fulfilling experience but then it turned out as the most boring years of my life in this very small campus with little activity. The curriculum changes every year which means you can not take the classes you want in certain semester.  People are not so down to earth so good luck if you are coming from a poor family background. Bennington have an internship program called FWT which will cost you extra 1500-2000 dollars per year so keep that in mine while calculating the cost of attendance. Speaking of cost of attendance, I have to tell you that it increases every year due to tuition increase so you have to make your parents ready for additional $$$ every year."
College Junior,2,Our teams play (and lose) against high schools...
College Freshman,2,Pretty much no sports whatsoever. Club soccer exists but is poorly attended and taken as a joke.
College Freshman,2,Student town houses are few and must be accepted to live in them. Other off-campus housing seems limited and probably costly. Would definitely need own transportation and the school probably would not provide help finding housing.
College Senior,2,"We have a 65/35 female male split here. For those of you in the LGBTQ* section of humanity you will not be alone here at Bennington. The reason I saw 'bad' is not because of that though! The school is so small it creates quite a bit of drama fairly quickly, so watch out for that.

If you happen to be a hetero cis lady, make sure you have a car to head down to Williams if you want a date. For those hetero cis dudes try not to get too cocky when everyone wants to dance with you.

The campus /is/ small, so many times social activities revolve around watching concerts/plays/dances by classmates on the weekends and a lot of the social scene is actually pretty academically driven. I mean, I like it but I think most people would be confused."
College Junior,2,"Racial diversity is pretty darn poor, so are economic background and political/religious beliefs. Sexual orientation however=super diverse."
College Junior,2,"Not gonna lie, a fair chunk of the campus drinks.  And a fair chunk of that group drink a lot.  I don't want to give the impression that the drinking culture here inhibits in any way from the rigor of this place, because people here work hard.  As someone who doesn't drink much and didn't drink at all my first two years, I didn't really feel uncomfortable or pressured to drink, though it was a little strange always being the odd one out.  If you want it and you're looking for it, you'll find it.  If you don't want it and you're not looking for it, no worries."
College Junior,2,"Almost all students live on campus (I think around 90-95%).  I've lived on campus all three years, and I've heard it's hard to get off campus, because you have to get administrative approval, which is tough.  Also, the campus has all that you need on a day-to-day basis, so weighing the pros and cons of living off campus, it's just a lot easier to stay put.  That being said, some students want to live off campus just to get a separation between school and home.  There is a student house in North Bennington which buys local food, and a friend of mine who lived there loved it."
College Junior,2,"Bennington is, basically, terrible for racial diversity and great for gender/sexual diversity.  We have a ton of queer and transgender students, but almost everyone here is white.  Almost everyone here is also liberal, and (somewhat less) very secular.  We have a bunch of relevant campus groups: Queer*, Latin@, Interfaith, and Kulanu (a Jewish group)."
College Junior,2,"I don't drink and don't know much about this.  I don't think we have any nightclubs; we're a small town in Vermont.  There are a couple of popular bars, but for the most part people who drink do so on campus."
College Junior,2,"There are a lot of drugs and alcohol on campus.  There are no social penalties for avoiding substances and many do, but the same is true of those who do partake.  Pretty much anyone who wants to find drugs on campus can, for better or worse.  Bennington's policies about campus drug and alcohol use, and penalties for violations, are in the process of being rewritten, so no clear picture of what they're going to look like quite yet.  "
College Freshman,2,"Maybe Safe, Maybe Not – No, I do not feel like I will ever be kidnapped or mugged on campus, but how safe is letting underage students get away with drinking and drugs? Repeatedly? I know it is college, but there should be limits."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have any sports. There are some students playing soccer occasionally but that's it.
College Freshman,1,"Nobody plays sports. We just got a deal to play soccer with SVC, but nobody cares."
College Senior,1,"The townies actually seemed to hate Bennington students when I first got here but it is getting better. Many of the local shops advertise minor student discounts now. Oh, and there is a pizza truck that plays music and drives onto campus selling pizzas on weekends. That is probably the best thing we have. "
College Senior,1,"If you want clubs you might as well just drive down to NYC. We have 1 bar near us. It is called Kevin's, it is within walking distance and everyone goes there, including your professors. You could go downtown, but there is still nothing there. Unless you want pizza. There is lots of pizza.

Our nightlife is on campus, period. "
College Junior,1,There is no greek life.  period.
College Junior,1,"There is no Greek life at Bennington.  You'll find your community with your house, your classmates, and your friends, and most people find a great little networks for themselves while here. "
College Freshman,1,"No One Really Cares – Campus security is definitely around, which makes you feel really safe. They are an integral part of the community, but they don't really care about alcohol, unless it gets out of hand and unsafe. That's not to say that parties don't get busted because they do. They're there to keep us safe, and everyone knows that and respects that."
College Freshman,1,"Almost Everyone Is White – Diversity is almost non-existant here. I think Bennington is trying to make it better, but most of the kids are white. I don't think anyone is happy about that."
College Junior,1,"I Guess There's a Gym? Bennington students are not athletes.  We have an ""Athlete of the Week"" program to try to encourage kids, but its a running joke to nominate a friend of yours for that one time they played volleyball in middle school.  We have a basketball court, tennis courts and a gym, and I've seen people using them, but we don't have teams.  There's a group of kids that play soccer every week, but I think they lost to the town's high school team."
College Freshman,1,"They Have Em? Maybe I just do not know the right people, but I have almost never heard about any athletic group or club's events."
College Freshman,1,"Shoddy Gym, but Has What Is Needed – The gym is dirty and has old equipment even though tuition is through the roof. Not my favorite."
College Freshman,1,"Sciences a Bust – The school is very arts-oriented but the science department is lacking if one knows the subject one wishes to study. Mine is animal behaviour and the science department has not the time, money, or quantity of teachers that is necessary to give me the education I desired."

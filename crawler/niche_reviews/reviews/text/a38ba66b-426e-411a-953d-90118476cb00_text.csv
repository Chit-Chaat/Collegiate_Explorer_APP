Freshman,5,"So far, it's been great here! My classes are great and my professors are very nice and understanding."
Sophomore,5,"Everyone  I have met has been just been absolutely amazing to me! I transferred in and my counselor took care of absolutely anything I needed, and if she couldn't she got me in touch with who could. I love this school, the scenery, and its academics. I don't think I could have chosen a better school for myself."
Graduate Student,5,The flexibility to take classes online is a huge plus for me. The staff at William Woods University are also very friendly and helpful. This is important to me as a non traditional student. Thank you!
Graduate Student,5,The course work and curriculum constantly challenges me to think about my area of study differently. I am much more effective at my job since joining this program.
Alum,5,William woods is a small knit community where everyone knows each other. The professors were very helpful since the class sizes were smaller I was able to have one on one attention.
Sophomore,5,"This school is honestly beyond words, I absolutely love everything about the school, I have made amazing friends and the teachers are incredible! They are so relatable and helpful with any and all of your needs. The horses are incredible as well, they all have incredible backgrounds and such good attitudes. I love this school, and I never want to leave!"
Sophomore,5,"I personally have not taken any online classes, but from what others say and the taste I got when covid-19 was happening, I would say that the online courses are fantastic"
Niche User,5,"I loved how homey the campus felt, there is a 13:1 teacher to student ratio. It has the small town everybody knows everybody vibe to it. I loved how informative everyone was on helping me decide whether William Woods would be my home away from home or not."
Freshman,5,"William Woods University's campus is beautiful, well organized, and well maintained. All the professors seem to care deeply about their students, including the summer camp students. Everyone is pretty much on a first-name basis."
Sophomore,5,"I have had a great experience so far at William Woods. I am a sophomore and I do cross country as well as indoor and outdoor track. Something great about being a student athlete at William Woods is that teachers understand and are very easy to work with when I have to miss class due to competition. On the other side to that, our coaches are also understanding and easy to work with if I ever need to miss practice due to a class or lab and I am able to arrange another time so I can still get my workout in and do my school work."
Sophomore,5,"WWU is an amazing school! whatever you feel like getting involved in, they have it! from LGBTQ+ to Equestrian, they even have a Quidditch team! Their campus life is fun and inviting, and the little town of Fulton is so nice to go out and have some Ice cream with friends!"
Freshman,5,This is my first year here at William Woods and I have learned so much more than I expected for my first year and the semester isn’t over yet!! The staff here at William Woods are all so helpful and want to see every student succeed. I will definitely be attending the next three years at William Woods.
Alum,5,I graduated from William Woods University in 2017 with my MBA. The campus is absolutely beautiful. The registration and application process is very easy. An administrator helps with each step of the way. The instructors respect and care about their students. Competing the program is easy with all the support WWU provides. Graduation Day was the best day of my life.
Graduate Student,5,"Communication with advisors, professors and generally all staff is amazing and everyone is treated like family."
Junior,5,William Woods University is a small school with dedicated staff and educators who work diligently with their students to create a positive school environment that encourages its students to succeed.
Freshman,5,"This place is very comforting and it has the amazing small town feel. The professors are great, and are more than willing to help when needed. The dorms are decent sized, and they are cozy in the winter. There is a diversity of food offered with each meal. I would definitely recommend this college if you want to go to a small close knit university."
Sophomore,5,"William Woods University offers a lovely small campus feel where professors know you by name and truly want to help you succeed. The equestrian program excels at teaching skills and knowledge that employers look for and prepares you for life after college. Everything on campus is a 5-7 minute walk away. The dorms and food is average, although it's the people that really make the great experience. I highly recommend this school to any highschool graduate who wants to take advantage of available professors and a high-quality learning experience."
Sophomore,5,William Woods is a top notch College that has giving me many wonderful opportunities to succeed and learn. Everyday I am thankful that I choose to attend such a wonderful and unique college. The Equestrian program this school offers has allowed me to study in the specific field of my interest. I can peruse a business and Equine degree all at the same time. Not to mention in the two short years I have been at this college they have provided me with opportunities that I would have never been exposed to before. Overalls this college is one of a kind and truely a wonderful and personal learning environment.
Freshman,5,William Woods is a great university! I'm in the equine program and you definitely get out of it what you put into it. Overall academics and life on campus are great and the food tastes good even though it's a bit repetitive. I would definitely recommend it!
Freshman,5,"I really love this school. It felt like home just a few weeks after moving across the country to be here. Greek life is amazing, I would suggest anyone going here joins. You will meet so many people on campus and be a main part of all leadership on campus. It is huge and encouraging. I am also a horse person in dressage, and the whole equine program is very high quality but tough. It is a beautiful barn with great horses, but people sometimes forget it is your job to keep it that way. The classes are very small, which can be a good thing, and the professors know you very quickly. You also get to know everyone very quickly on campus, it is cozy and very friendly. "
College Junior,5,On religion I feel absolutely accepted when I first got here and heard they had greek I got little nevous. But them knowing I eas a Christian United Methdist things felt alright and i didnt get treated different
College Junior,5,Overall the prfessers now day to day wjat they are going over and have knowledge of the topic
College Junior,5,They really push to the best the policy of the university. To try and make it as safe and fun to go to
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at William Woods University has been spectacular so far! It's best known for its equestrian programs, but no one bats an eye if you're not involved with horses either. It's very friendly and diverse (I feel like there is a representative of every type of person here, and we all mesh together just fine), and since William Woods is such a small college, the professors have more time to form enriching relationships with students, and no one feels swamped by an overwhelming student population. If I had to do everything all over again I would return to William Woods every time."
College Sophomore,5,best school ive been too
College Sophomore,5,This school was one of the best places I have been to
College Freshman,5,"Class size is very small, 30 at the most in one class excluding equestrian classes. You are encouraged to try new things, like American Sign Language. Professors are very friendly and are willing to help students whenever they need it."
College Freshman,5,"I've made close friends, the professors are very helpful. I would choose my school over any others due to how friendly everyone is and my major that will let me persue my passion, teaching theatre."
College Freshman,5,"There is a huge emphasis on how unacceptable sexual harassment. Its a very safe campus. Also, be smart about the situations you put yourself in."
College Freshman,5,"Classes are small, normally 10 to 1. Classes are interesting. Professors are awesome."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love WWU. The small campus is the perfect size for me.
College Senior,5,"I have amazing opportunities to help out around the barns,speak with our vets and farriers,learn about other riding disciplines and take great trips to shows with a great group of horses and students."
College Sophomore,5,"Our campus security is always walking or driving around the school. Also, we have ""emergency"" posts on certain spots of the campus in case something happens to you when no one is around you can go push the button and talk to a security officer right away. One is rightly placed at our school's riding barn in case a horse accident happens when no one is around."
College Freshman,5,Security is strict enough to keep us safe but without preventing students from having a good time.
College Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and well equipped for anything students might need.
College Freshman,5,The EQS program is unique and wonderful. I'm happy to be a part of it.
College Freshman,5,The professors are great and they have the best majors.
College Freshman,5,I've never had an internship but from what I hear they are great.
College Freshman,5,I liked the fact that we had to send in a video of ourselves riding. It ensures that incompetent students aren't admitted.
College Sophomore,5,"This is a great campus. It's not too big but not too small. There are a different variety of majors on this campus. The top three majors you normally see are American Sign Language Interpreters, Equestrian Majors, and Theater Majors. I love the school and the atmosphere around it."
College Sophomore,5,There is a great library on campus with great study rooms and quiet rooms. There is a great work out center that is open at decent hours. There are always great LEAD events to go to and always something cool to learn.
College Sophomore,5,The campus life is great. There is amazing scenery and beautiful lakes on campus. All of the buildings are nice and spacious.
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone in the Sign Language Department are great. They are all very helpful and work with you and practice with you on anything you need help with. The mentors are great and funny; if you need extra practice or help, they will do it."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Greek Life is great on campus. I don't know what it's like to be independent, but I wouldn't change my decision for anything. I love my chapter and the closeness of the entire Greek community. There is always a philanthropy, formal, bonding event, or just people to go to Tucker with. And now that I've graduated, my organization means more to me than ever...I love having that connection with women I meet all over the country. Not to mention, my ties to my chapter."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love the program. After being in my field for awhile, I have come to appreciate the education I recieved even more. We walk out well rounded and with all of the tools to be useful and successful in the industry. I would have liked more guidance on finding jobs, however."
College Senior,5,The school had a variety of majors. The specialty majors such as Equine and American Sign Language are very in depth and intense majors. You will always leave this school knowing everything about your major and a little about all the rest.
Recent Alumnus,5,Drugs are not really an issue on campus. Alcohol is present but not out of control
College Sophomore,5,"I enjoy greek life. I think it has opened multiple opportunities and connections for me. The students here are all pretty much athletes, greek, or both. The housing right now isn't the best but they are about to start building new houses within the year."
Recent Alumnus,5,"GO GREEK. You'll have a hard time standing out on campus if you're not Greek, to be honest. Non-Greeks range from being close friends with Greeks to despising everything about Greek life. But the fact of the matter is, Greeks have better grades, more alumni support, do a ton of community service/raise a ton of money for various charities, and have way more social events. This is all coming from someone who spent time as an independent student and as member of a Greek organization."
Recent Alumnus,5,"There are only a handful of bars in town, but Fulton students certainly know how to rage. The bars are 18+ and if one isn't for some reason, no one goes there, so underage students can go out as well. Greek students definitely party more than independent students, however the athletes certainly hold their own on their off seasons."
Recent Alumnus,5,"If you want to go to William Woods, the financial aid office will do everything in its power to make sure it happens."
College Freshman,5,I think the Academics are great
College Freshman,5,I haven't seen a lot of drug use but there are parties . It is college just be smart.
College Freshman,5,"Professors are great, relatable, and get to know you personally."
College Freshman,5,Fantastic Academic opportunities and the classes are great!
College Freshman,5,Tons of scholarships! Just look!
College Sophomore,5,I am not aware of any drug use at William Woods University. I have never been pressured to use drugs.
College Sophomore,5,"I had no trouble at getting into the education program at the Woods. No challenges I have encountered yet besides the Cbase, and the praxis. The biggest criteria would be maintaining C average grades in all education classes. But as long as you work with your classes that is not very hard to get better than a C."
College Junior,5,"I love my degree program! I feel it has really expanded my knowledge of horse. I would totally do the entire program over again, my only issues were that two classes were changed and i feel that they were changed to less useful curriculum."
College Senior,5,"The freshman dorms are older and very basic, at least they all have air conditioning now. Upperclassmen and returning students have first dibs on the better housing and the apartments are the best, but you have to wait till your second year to get in. Full housing amenities in the apartments, full kitchen, baths and personal in unit laundry makes it like home, so convenient!"
Freshman,4,I am not taking any online classes this semester. We are all in seat for right now unless you are being quarantined. The students that are quarantined usually use ZOOM to be present in the classes and communicate with the teachers.
Freshman,4,This is a great school. I love the small and beautiful campus. The administration truly cares about their students and the community on campus is so close-knit. They have great merit scholarship opportunities that greatly bring down the cost.
Freshman,4,This is truly a premier equestrian school! If you want an equine education that can be truly focused on what you want to do this is the place to go. The number of horses and the level of education available here is great. It is incredibly expensive and every year the tuition goes up. There are some generous scholarships available to students including the LEAD program.
Junior,4,"I like the small school environment and there are a lot of opportunities for student involvement. The athletics are not as strong, due to being more of an academic school, but there is still a lot of support for those that are involved. The professors are very helpful, and that could be due to the small amount of students in the classes."
Senior,4,The small campus is great for networking and making life time bonds. The faculty cares deeply for their students.
Junior,4,"I am in online classes and most of the experiences have been wonderful. Not only am I getting the degree I want, it's in less time than I thought it would be."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently at sophomore at William Woods University.  I enjoyed my freshman year and am anxious to return this fall.  The LEAD program is a very good way to help students adapt to life away from home.  There are always activities, sporting events and leisure opportunities on campus.  The admissions team and counselors are always willing to help if/ when you have questions.  The dinning hall has limited hours and athletes sometimes have a difficult time getting to Tucker after practice.  The professors are effective educators and I am confident I am receiving a quality education.  The overall campus is easy to get around and pleasing to walk around.  I highly recommend this university to high school seniors."
Sophomore,4,"William Woods is a great college. I am an out of state student and they really make it feel like home here and help you focus on your studies. The food could be better but, other than that this is a great place to learn."
College Sophomore,4,"My professors and their respective courses have been very good. The professors are very knowledgeable in their fields, and accommodating to the varying needs of students. Class sizes are always very small, some with a maximum of only twenty or so."
College Sophomore,4,The career center/services at William Woods has been extremely helpful to me. They were very quick to assist me and give me advice on how to best market myself to prospective employers. Very friendly and efficient.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe here on campus. Stealing is almost nonexistent on campus, or at least I've never had to worry about it. There are emergency buttons stationed all around campus, information regarding campus police and safety is readily available, and the location of counseling services and the campus nurse is made known to everyone. William Woods also strongly encourages all students to take an online course about sexual assault called Not Anymore, which details what consent is, the necessity of consent, victims are not responsible for sexual assault, etc. There are even posters in the restrooms detailing statistics about rape, sexual/emotional abuse, and assault among men, women, and the LGBT community. It's well-covered topic here."
College Sophomore,4,"The social atmosphere is wonderful in the dorms. Everyone does their best to respect other's quiet hours and sharing space. While I've never left my room unlocked for more than a couple minutes, I've never felt nervous about someone stealing or snatching something of mine. The dorm hall also offers a TV lounge area, our own laundry room in the basement, and a community kitchen."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is encouraged to attend and support athletic events that take place at the William Woods campus, and team performances are wonderful at displaying good sportsmanship and support for each other. Games are fun to watch as the William Woods teams always put forth their best effort and seem to have fun as they compete. Fan support is excellent and highly positive."
College Sophomore,4,"They're pretty nice. Always bad seeds everywhere, but that doesn't they should all be thought of that way."
College Sophomore,4,"This school is exactly what you expect, good and bad."
College Sophomore,4,school has lots of job and internship opportunities for students
College Senior,4,Of course while you are studying you always think that you have too much homework. All in all the work was a bit much when you work full time and have a family.
College Senior,4,I am employed already so with my degree I am working on getting a higher paying position. My education will help me seek out the right position in my educational field.
College Senior,4,I have enjoyed my time at William woods university and most of the professors there.
College Senior,4,The overall process of getting into the master's program was great. All I had to do was put in my application and the advisor did the rest.
College Senior,4,"I do not live on campus so, I can only tell you what I have heard about the teams and the campus."
College Freshman,4,"Campus Security/Safety encourage students to call them whenever they need them, whether something like a broken down car to crimes. They handle everything as quickly as possible. Everyone is required to register for campus alerts so security can reach the students as fast as possible and works really well. I feel very safe on campus and security is always available to walk/drive you back to your dorm if it's late at night and don't want to walk across campus in the dark by yourself. They work very hard to make sure everyone feels safe."
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of internship opportunities available in your last two years of school. The school offers events to help students to create resumes and portfolios every year.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are really nice and all freshmen stay in 3 buildings connected together, called the Complex. It's a really great way for all of the freshmen to make new friends their first year of college. Most of the dorms are in close walking distance to classes."
College Freshman,4,"While there may only be 4 sororities and 3 fraternities, Greek life is somewhat a big part on campus. They host a wide range of events for everyone to go to and learn something new. They are big on evolving everyone on campus and do lots of charity events."
College Freshman,4,The fitness center is great for not just athletes but for non-athletes too. It is easily accessible by everyone.
College Freshman,4,The equestrian department has a lot of opportunities for jobs and scholarships. As long as you put the effort into it.
College Freshman,4,I am a non-greek because I personally couldn't see myself fitting in with them.
College Freshman,4,"I personally don't participate in varsity sports, but the fitness center is pretty nice."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone here is incredibly friendly, and its a small campus, but not underwhelming"
College Freshman,4,As long as you respect and follow the schools policies you will not be affected in a negative way.
College Freshman,4,Most of the food at Tucker was really good. I really liked the Home Zone they have.
College Sophomore,4,Very well managed and they are well liked.
College Sophomore,4,"I love living on campus! Living in a sorority house is wonderful, very involved on campus as we are housed with greeks and non-greeks. Small campus makes it an easy walk across campus, rarely ever need to drive. Cost is very affordable."
College Student,4,"There are many small, locally-known restaurants that I have gotten to know and love. They are not very far from campus and are easy to get to, and usually pretty cheap."
College Student,4,"I have not yet had to turn to campus security for anything, but I have seen the main campus security officer around campus and he seems friendly and polite. I have had no security concerns on my campus."
College Student,4,"My financial aid experience had a bit of a rough start because I did not know where to start or how to apply for student loans. But the ladies in the financial aid office assisted me through the process quite nicely.

I received a few scholarships from my school, and all are of a good amount and were not excessively difficult to attain."
College Freshman,4,helps to take AP courses if you can I've noticed
College Freshman,4,"Domino's is a popular weekend place, and the only one that delivers to campus. There's also a subway, a Chinese place (HIGHLY recommend!!!!!) and a couple of other places downtown."
College Freshman,4,"Athletes here are known, it depends on if you want to go to the games if  you actually go or not. People around campus love the mascot, Screech, an owl. Most students have some type of owl stuffs in their dorm. Our facilities are good, with a gym, athletic building and couple of other places."
College Sophomore,4,"I like how big our dorm rooms are compared to other ones I have seen. Also, I can get to the farthest spot on campus in just 2 minutes of walking. It is nice to have a bathroom connected to our room too."
College Sophomore,4,"Although there are a lot of fast food restaurants, we have a good variety of nicer restaurants on our main street. Some are very good small businesses."
College Sophomore,4,"We get special points toward a scholarship if we attend a certain amount of athletic events and/or working out at the gym a certain amount of times. It is really nice because I feel a lot of people wouldn't participate as much if there wasn't the incentive. Also, people get points for our intramural sports as well."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a pretty tight nit community around the school. Our main street often likes to host events that our whole campus is always invited to so it's nice. Also, we are only about 30 minutes away from a big city (Columbia) so if we ever get bored or want to go out somewhere we can always go there."
College Junior,4,"Coming from a small town of 1,800 people, Fulton still has that small-town feel while having more options than I ever did at home.  For people coming from a big city, it's boring.  They have a bowling alley, a movie theater, and several parks, as well as various stores to shop at, but they don't have much more than that.  I love Fulton.  It has what I need and I am quite happy with it."
College Junior,4,"Fulton is definitely a college town.  There are multiple fast food places, a few Mom-and-Pop diners, two Chinese places, and various other restaurants within Fulton.  There are also a few nicer places that are generally date night destinations.  Being a college town, most restaurants serve good food and make it worth the expense of eating out."
College Freshman,4,The town is quaint and charming. I love the whole atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is HUGE on campus. They play a big role in most of the school's functions.
College Freshman,4,I feel really safe on campus. Everyone is nice and security is good.
College Freshman,4,"I'm not all that involved in the nightlife but from what I hear, it's good."
College Sophomore,4,"Our school is very welcoming of anyone wanting to participate in something different. I wen into this school with a pre-law minor and changed it to a theater minor. This school has become my second home, I miss my friends, the the teachers and my dorm room. I love being able to be be diverse and be involved in different student organizations and not have to stick with what my major or minor is. Every club is different and you can be a part of anything you want to be!"
College Sophomore,4,"This school is very diverse because they're are so many different programs that you can be a part of. The best part is that I am a theater minor and I welcomed in the theater community with ease. The curriculum for any program is very good, they test your abilities, they slam you with homework but at the end of the day this makes you better at your major. This helps you to be able to prioritize, and use your time management."
College Sophomore,4,"To be an interpreting major is a blessing. I am so excited to want to go back to classes, and see my professors and want to talk to them and be a part of this amazing culture. There is never a dull moment in this interpreting moment, we are such a diverse tight knit group it is amazing. It is so amazing being an interpreting major, I look forward to going back to school!"
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school. I love the people in the Interpreting department, the teachers are absolutely fantastic. They work with you and make sure you have every tool you can possibly imagine to make sure that when you graduate you have a job waiting for you. I am so happy and honored to be able to do what I love and enjoy it while m at school. The program offers internship programs that apply to what you want to do with ASL when you graduate. The curriculum is amazing and hard. It is hard because it tests your abilities, without testing your abilities you wouldn't know you had without the proper schooling."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm currently in the Interpreting program at my school and it is one of the best programs. To get into the program you must apply and then you have to have what is called a test. The test helps the program to decide which ASL class you should start and how long you will be at the school. When the program starts, you have what is called an assessment that will either let you stay in the program, or you would have to retake some classes. It might sound hard, but it is an amazing way!"
College Sophomore,4,"I never went into Greek Life, but from what I heard, it's pretty great. They are all really accepting and do some pretty great things."
College Sophomore,4,Each house is different but great. I lived in Serena and it was in a great location and had the perfect amount of people in it. The houses are always clean and the CA's are always helpful and nice.
College Sophomore,4,Practically everyone is accepting of one another and who they are and what they believe in.
College Sophomore,4,There aren't many problems with the boys an girls on this campus. Everyone pretty much is accepting and nice. They all are well dressed and open.
College Sophomore,4,"My school is in a small town. There are great places to eat, shop, and hang out. There are some great shops and restaurants. Our campus is a very safe place and Campus Security is always there to help."
Freshman,2,"The University was nice and the staff was very helpful and friendly. For me, it wasn't the best fit as the nursing program no longer moved forward. I didn't have the best experiences at William Woods but it allowed me to have a good education."
Senior,2,"Clean but lost in translation. The dorms are subpar at best and the staff has no regard or respect for the students health. Financial aid is minimum, especially for a private university. The dining hall is enough to put even the strongest of stomachs in the emergency room. You would think after as much money as the students pay towards this school that William Woods University would be able to provide decent food and accommodations for its students. When asked, the dining hall will provide accommodations like making grilled cheese or cheese quesadillas for the students. One time when i asked for grilled cheese from one of the workers, not the chef, they will burn it on the outside while leaving the cheese on the inside cold and not melted.🤦‍♀️ it kills me to think this school has such spiteful staff members."
College Sophomore,2,I not in greek but I think its to expensive to join
College Student,2,"The dining hall facilities are of acceptable quality, but the food usually is not. Tucker Dining Hall makes an honest attempt at making ""homemade"" comfort foods, but their attempts usually fall short. The main issue is that some things are served cold when they are supposed to be hot, or foods are not cooked properly (such as rice or vegetables)."
College Sophomore,2,"It's a small campus so it's the same old thing every week. It's horrible going to such a small school where everyone knows everyone and the gossip is worse than high school. If you're in a group then you're great but it's also very easy to feel alone and have barely any friends/people to hangout or party with. Greek life is great for the size of school, but it would be miserable not being in greek life."
College Junior,2,"Some dorms (the newer or bigger buildings) are pretty nice and well-kept, but they have smaller rooms.  The older dorms are more spacious, but they are also slowly falling apart.  As an Equestrian Science student and a current keeper, living on campus makes life a million times easier.  However, it is very expensive to do so, and you either have to live in the apartments and pay more to live there or you have to pay for an expensive meal plan."
College Freshman,2,Everyone pretty much lives on campus. There is really no reason to move off.
College Senior,2,"Small town, little to do must drive a half hour to Columbia or an hour and a half to St. Louis."
College Senior,2,Fulton is a little town adn although it has great little mom and pop shops there are very few so eating out gets old fast.
College Senior,2,"The campus network is bad. You never know when it will work or when you will even be able to connect to the internet. Working on school computers is a little more reliable but they are slow. There are computers located all over campus so you wont have trouble getting one, the problem is using then when the buildings are closed. Also not all campus computers allow you to print."
College Senior,2,If you are an Athlete then its great. Non athletes suffer from the over emphasis on athlet students getting the best and first care.
College Freshman,2,"There's not to much in Fulton other than a couple of pizzerias, some Mexican restaurants, and a diner. Other than that there are some chain restaurants and my personal favorite Lulu's the frozen yogurt shop. Everything is far or a tough walk away though."
College Sophomore,2,The teams are good performance wise and the facilities are pretty nice. School spirit and fan support however are lacking greatly.
College Freshman,2,The computer could use some software updating. The Wi-Fi on campus is also horrible.
College Junior,2,"My financial aid doesn't even cover half the amount of tuition and fees that come with going to this school. It's downright ridiculous that you have to worry about being behind on tuition payments and even paying other bills such as cell phone, car, and medical expenses. Its unfair to the students and many have to drop out because they can't afford to go to the school anymore. It doesn't even matter what your grades are either, because you will still have to pay a ton of money for the school."
College Junior,2,Safety on campus is not the best that it should be. One campus security guard on a night is pathetic. he will take like 30 minutes to get somewhere he is to slow and does not like to move very fast. if something severe happens at once they freak out and don't know how to handle something like it should be. They need more training. I feel better if I am with people if I am alone then that is when I get nervous knowing that security wont do anything about it. 
College Junior,2,Computers around here are ok. The wifi around this place is a total joke. Speed is horrible. For the past 3 years they were promising to get something fixed about it and do something about it. No nothing has been done. I feel like it is a waste to live on campus here because I cant get anything I pay for. 
College Junior,2,"Drugs here are not very common unless it is alcohol. Everyone drinks on campus if not you are seen as a loner. Peer pressure takes a big part of partying allowing people to fall into something they don't want to do very easily. Policy enforcement is very slim around here, nothing is done to change anything. Almost like it is encouraged around here."
College Junior,2,If you are a student here with no form of transportation then you are basically told to find someone with a car if you need to go to the store or something. But if you are on a sports team there are some buses offered to go to the games and things but they are not very fancy. 
College Freshman,2,There are very few on campus parking spots and they fill up quickly. 
Sophomore,1,"Dinning Hall is awful, tuition is rising every year even though the school looks the same and has the same accommodations. For a private school they give very little scholarship sure you can say they give the lead scholarship but that’s just 5,000 off of a $32,000 which isn’t anything special. You can’t bundle acedemic and athletic scholarships either, you just choose the higher one. These reasons are why I chose to transfer."
Senior,1,"William woods universities staff is great if you are talking about the teachers. The residential life is awful and are way to nosey. The security guards invade your privacy and are always following people around. Venita michell is not reliable, and the Greek life committees of IFC and Panhellenic are very unorganized. So the education I good but the life on campus is awful due to terrible staff."
College Sophomore,1,"Tucker dining hall is the worse food that you could put into your body. There are numerous occasions where the food isn't cooked, you receive food poisoning, there is no taste to certain things and the have the worst hours. I don't like eating lunch at 11:30 instead of non, I hate eating dinner at 5:30 instead of 7:00 p.m. Tucker dining hall shouldn't exist, the students pay more for disgusting terrible food than if I ate out or bought my own food from Walmart. I hate Tucker and I wish they would just get rid of it."
College Sophomore,1,The local area around campus is not the best. Its actually kind of scary. I've never met any mean locals but i haven't many of them in the first place. There is not much to do in this area and if you would like to go shopping at a mall or go to an attraction you have to go to columbia.
College Junior,1,there is absolutely nothing to do in this town. This is the most boring town a college could be in. there is nothing here but a walmart and a movie theater. students hate this town. the townies that are around here are really creepy. 
College Junior,1,"Greek life here is a joke. I tried it once it was a total joke. They tried to convince me that I need to communicate with no one but only them cause that was the cool think. I left as soon as possible. Greeks are viewed as how they act cocky, rude, disrespectful, and so on. Greeks are in basically the same housing as independents just not in the same dorms. they think they are something special but they really aren't. "
College Junior,1,Permits around here cost way to much for where we are parking at. The fines I haven't noticed one yet but I heard they can be a joke as well. Parking around campus sucks fills up so quickly. If you want a guaranteed parking spot then you have to park far away from your place you are trying to part at. 
College Junior,1,Off campus dining here really sucks actually. if we want anything we have to travel about half an hour in order to get to a better place to eat. lots of places in town but none are good enough for students in this area. 
College Senior,1,We don't have designated off campus housing. You can only live off campus if you are in the off campus lottery which is hard to be in or if you're a commuter. William woods wants you to live on campus because we're a small school and having students pay for housing is beneficial to the school financially and for life on campus.
College Sophomore,1,The aparments off-campus are known for having wild parties and having cops every other weekend.
College Sophomore,1,Fulton is a very small town with little to nothing to do outside of working or school there are no big name stores you can go to or any sports complex you can go and workout.

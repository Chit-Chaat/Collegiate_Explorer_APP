Junior,5,The academics at William Jewell are rigorous. Students learn how to incorporate critical thinking into their lives.
Junior,5,The online experience at William Jewell is just as if you were in an in-person class. Participation is highly encouraged and oftentimes required. iPads are provided for all students free of charge.
Freshman,5,"I've had such a good experience with William Jewell College if you have any doubts about going to a small college I hope my answer will help. The small class sizes help so much in having an engaging learning experience, the way the Jewell community cares and supports their students and faculty makes the school experience so welcoming and enjoyable, and with all the connections you make with other students and teachers will last a lifetime and will be so fun along the way."
Sophomore,5,"I love Jewell. I am a current student here, and I love every aspect of the campus. The professors and faculty are extremely helpful, and when struggling in a class, your teacher is always on you to help or will direct you to where you can get extra help. The campus is beautiful. Only issue is, most of the sports facilities are extremely outdated. Other than that, love this school."
Freshman,5,"I love love love it here! The academics, the campus, the spirit, all of it. I made so many friends even before school starts for me as a freshman."
Freshman,5,"I love it here! They have amazing financial aid and one of my favorite parts of coming in was Summer Fling, a yearly tradition where the incoming freshman come to campus, tour around KC, and get to spend time with their future classmates ON CAMPUS"
Niche User,5,"So far, the school has been amazing throughout our enrollment process, and getting our son set up for success!"
Senior,5,"Jewell's pretty great, I feel like I'm well-connected and prepared for the field I want to get into, even though it's in the middle of the country where there aren't necessarily a lot of jobs for what I want to do. Also, the grass is A+, which is important, because when my life is going to hell, it's really nice to look at."
Sophomore,5,"William Jewell College is my home. It is a community of students who want to critically think together to achieve scholarship and higher learning. I am a varsity athlete, involved in Greek life, the Pryor Leadership Program and other organizations on campus. This place has changed me for the better and taught me that college is more than parties and fraternities, but actually getting to know individuals around you to grow with. I already have internships lined up thanks to my excellent accounting professors. Love this place, please give it a shot after your first year."
Alum,5,"An education at William Jewell college gave me the ability to obtain a position in my desired field before graduation. The professors were some of the most capable, and intelligent teachers I've had. They always challenged students and never failed to be open to different view points. My education at Jewell gave me an extremely diverse perspective that I hadn't received before."
Freshman,5,"William Jewell is the premier critical thought and inquiry college in the Midwest, and, quite possibly, in the country. The professors here care about their students and help them to succeed while pushing them to do their best,"
Sophomore,5,"William Jewell College is a fantastic school. The academics are very challenging, even for a former high school valedictorian like me, but they are very rewarding. Jewell doesn't just offer a degree, it offers an education. The student life is also very involved in campus activities and organizations, so many opportunities are present to make friends and get to know more people on campus. The campus is small, but it feels bigger with the amount of people you are able to meet when you become involved. Overall, I am having a fantastic college experience here, and I am glad I chose to come to William Jewell College."
Niche User,5,I like the academics found at William Jewell. They really strive to see each student succeed in life.
College Junior,5,"Overall, Jewell is amazing. I wouldn't want to attend any other college."
College Junior,5,The value of a degree from Jewell is extremely high. Graduate schools and employers think highly of their potential employees/students. They understand how difficult Jewell is.
College Junior,5,Campus safety and student life are excellent
College Junior,5,"I am over-the-top grateful for the professors and staff at this school. The biology program is so unique and allows students to publish research by the time they graduate. The teachers love their students, and go out of their way to make sure they succeed."
College Sophomore,5,"The academics on campus are great! If you get a high enough ACT score, you can apply for the Oxbridge Honors Program, which, if you qualify for, will allow you the chance to study at Oxford for an entire year. Even if you are unable to participate in Oxbridge, you still get an amazing education with small class sizes, meaning an easier time getting to speak to your professors."
College Sophomore,5,The diversity on campus is amazing and widely accepted. I think the best thing is that during our orientation we do activities to ensure that we understand the diversity and welcome it with open arms.
College Sophomore,5,"With Jewell being so close to downtown Kansas City, we have a great opportunity as students and future alums to receive internships, jobs, and build networks becasue we went to Jewell."
College Sophomore,5,I know that I would not have joined my sisterhood if it wasn't for going to Jewell. Definitely one of the best choices I've made.
College Sophomore,5,"Jewell has been one of the best choices I've made in my life. If I had not of chosen to go to Jewell, I more than likely would not have joined a sorority."
College Freshman,5,Jewell is a place that every student is to feel safe. Security is easily accessible in every aspect of campus.
College Freshman,5,"At Jewell, teachers care about the students in each class. The teacher to student ratio allows teachers to be able to interact and get to know each student. When one struggles in a class or with a topic, students feel comfortable to be able to approach their professor about problems that they are facing and the teachers are always willing to help the best they can. Jewell makes sure that you walk away with a life time of useful education, not just an education that you used to pass a test and then forget about."
College Freshman,5,"William Jewell is not just a school. Its a place of family. William Jewell believes in creating a family helping environment. If one is stumbling, it is very easy to find someone to help you get back up, whether that is a counselor, friend or teacher, everyone is willing to help everyone succeed. William Jewell is different then other schools and its well worth it."
College Freshman,5,"It's really great. All the financial aid workers are very helpful, and financial aid workshops are regularly held."
College Freshman,5,With it being a liberal arts college they strive to personalize learning for every student.
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus is convenient, saves a ton of commuting time, and enables you to have a good social life while still being extremely busy."
College Freshman,5,My scholarships that i got from the school is why i chose it here
College Freshman,5,Nursing is a great program here and super helpful.
College Freshman,5,We have a very great nursing program.
College Junior,5,"I've met some of the most important people I've ever met in my life at this school. Maybe the actually ""school"" part hasn't been the best, but if I didn't go to this school, I would be missing a few VERY important people, and I wouldn't trade that for the world."
College Junior,5,"There are a few really good places around campus. First you have your major food chains--steak and shake (a great place to go in the wee hours when you're still up working on an assignment), sonic (fun to go there for a happy hour route 44), and chili's and the like. Then you have more ethnic places. The Taj Mahal is an indian place on 291. It is absolutely delicious and the owner is super nice. They have an awesome lunch buffet special that ends around 2pm. Then you have Hunan Garden, a chinese restaurant that is super close to school. They also have an awesome lunch special for 6$ max and you get three entrees! Tasty Thai serves amazing pad thai and they have a pad thai tuesday special--buy one (10$ get one for 1$). I recently discovered Liberty Nutrition (across the street from Hunan)--they serve meal replacement shakes in various flavors. The shakes are super delicious and jewell students get a 1$ discount, making a shake + tea + shot of aloe amount to 5.50$. The owners are also really nice and eager to help. Mi Hacienda is a really good Mexican restuarant that is relatively cheap--about 8$ for a regular plate. Rico's Tacos is a delicious taco joint in Kansas City--they do 1$ tacos on Tuesdays!"
College Junior,5,"Excellent Variety – The education here is a liberal arts education.  Therefore, every student will not just acquire skills within their major(s), but also in other disciplines.  The campus and student population is small, so everyone knows everyone.  There is always something going on on the campus, so you will never be bored."
College Sophomore,5,"The weather doesn't affect Jewell's campus at all. Campus is small making any weather easy to get from one side to another. Jewell's security is also pretty awesome about giving students rides in the rain or snow storms back to their dorm. Even though it is a five minute walk tops, it is better than being soaked walking into your room."
College Sophomore,5,"The education program is very difficult to stay in. Entering is as easy and saying you want to be a teacher. But, the program requires a 3.0 GPA, as well as, a fully loaded academic schedule every semester. There are requirements on test scores, reviews, and care team meetings as well. It is a top rated program with almost a 100% placement rate in the economy now."
College Sophomore,5,"William Jewell is a very diverse campus in student's sexual orientation, cultural background, political and religions views, and socio-economic status. Jewell is known for having students are highly intelligent and opinionated with viable arguments for their opinions. The diversity among students doesn't cause problems. Most of the time, the only challenge you will face with your views is someone else opposing them in the dining hall."
College Sophomore,5,"The financial aid department at Jewell is fantastic. If you are struggling meeting cost or figuring out a form, they are more than willing to help you out. Jewell understands that families may not be able to afford college and they do whatever it takes to help you out!"
College Sophomore,5,"I am an elementary education major. Last year, 34 people graduated in this major. 28 of them automatically were placed into a classroom to teach, the  other 6 chose to not apply for teaching positions to go to graduate school or follow through with another program. Needless to say, the education majors at Jewell are of high quality."
College Sophomore,5,"Liberty is a big city with a little community feel. It has anywhere and everywhere imaginable to eat, drink, hang out, shop and go out. Everyone in Liberty loves a Jewell student. The square will often hold events and specials for Jewell students."
College Sophomore,5,"The academic life at Jewell is awesome. It is considered the Harvard of the Midwest and the classes live up to the name. The best part of Jewell is the Journey Grant. Every student is automatically granted at least $2,000 to study abroad or attend any educational program.  Not only does Jewell offer great classes, the faculty are awesome. They know you on a one to one basis and are always willing to talk to any student when needed. The average class size is around 12 people; the max intro level class is normally around 25 or less."
College Sophomore,5,"The best place about Jewell is the Quad. Students hang out in the middle of this big green grassy space. It has wifi, it is comfortable, and there often activities on campus at this location. There is a new student center being opened with a 24/7 convenience store and state of the art technology and design. The Pryor Learning Commons is to open August 2013."
College Sophomore,5,Jewell is awesome. You definitely get the Kansas City nightlife and the great academic challenge all in one. The people are great. The campus is small. Everyone in Liberty loves a Jewell student too. It is great to be apart of a community that is involved with the school and that is so close to Downtown Kansas City.
College Sophomore,5,You will definitely get your money's worth in academics at William Jewell College.
College Sophomore,5,"It is a great city. Liberty has all of your basic needs. Gas stations, places to have fun, places to shop, and plus we are only 30 minutes for KC"
College Sophomore,5,"If you're looking for a challenge/a place to NOT feel like a statistic/a place where the professors legitimately care and will help you, Jewell's the place. I know I sound like a propaganda-bot, but I speak from experience. No matter the department, the prof's know their stuff."
College Sophomore,5,"I could simply not imagine myself in a better situation. Nearly all of my professors have PhD's in their respective fields, they all are very intelligent, and (perhaps most importantly), we're not statistics to them as students."
College Sophomore,5,School policy is no alcohol for under 21 and no drugs allowed.  This is a Christian College and it has zero tolerance on drinking and drugs.
College Sophomore,5,"Choices, Choices, Choices – There is always something to eat. In the cafeteria itself, there are always at least three choices of entrees, plus pizza, pasta, salad, and cereals. If you don't like the menu in the caf, you can go downstairs to the Cage and order a hamburger, chicken wrap, chicken tenders, fries, and lots of other choices."
College Sophomore,5,Extremely Happy – I love being a business major. The professors have had plenty of success in the business world so I feel very prepared
College Sophomore,5,Internships Are Abundant – Most professors have had lots of experience in the field they are teaching so internships are very abundant and easy to come by
College Sophomore,5,Very Good – Professors are great. Very knowledgable and always willing to help
College Junior,5,"Computer Labs, Printing and More – There is one computer lab and computers throughout the library. Usually, they are not all being used.

Wireless is available throughout campus and is usually decently fast."
College Student,5,"The food was delicious. It made me feel at home, I could choose between a variety of foods and they were made fresh and right in front of you."
College Sophomore,5,"Jewell has a very big 'family' base since we are so small. The student body is diverse in interests, hobbies, affiliations, and majors, but we can all connect easily with the fact that we are Jewell Cardinals. People are very rarely ostracized here."
College Junior,5,"The stereotypical view of a Greek system in which hazing and partying hold key roles are absolutely opposite of what you will find at William Jewell. Greek organizations hold a variety of events, including fundraisers for their philanthropies, mixers, volunteer opportunities and a toned-down version of the anticipated parties. Greek life is incredibly close to the college as a whole and a large number of students participate, or simply support, the Greek community."
College Sophomore,5,"The Greek life at our school is excellent. We are a small liberal arts private college, so Greek takes up 1/3 of the student population. All the women live in a new state-of-the-art complex together, so rivalries are non-existent unless they are petty short ones. Fraternities houses are well-kept by their alums. All of our Greek organizations are close and respectful to each other and to each other's philanthropies. It's definitely a different, more homey, feel than at a big university. That being said, we are national organizations; we don't have 'pretend' Greek like 'oh, this dorm is known at the Epsilon House.' Our Greek life is legitimate."
College Freshman,5,Computers are very accessible at Jewell. We have printers available in the library and each student has an allowance of a certain number of prints per semester which is plenty for the year. Wireless is accessible nearly everywhere on campus and works very well.
College Freshman,5,"Love It. Overall WJC is a perfect fit for me. It's not a perfect school, but the good outweighs the bad."
College Freshman,5,I Love Billy Jewell – I would not have gotten some of the opprotunities at other schools that I have at Jewell.  The campus community is closely knit and there is always several places for a person to fit in.
Freshman,4,If you're interested in a university with a strong academic focus and intimate class sizes then Jewell should be right up your alley. Professors here are overqualified and always have your best interests at heart; they more than capable of forming relationships with their students as a result of the small class sizes. Their CTI courses take the place of gen Ed's so that all four years of here can be focused on accomplishing your major; incentivizing doubles and sometimes even triples. It's large focus in the liberal and performing arts result in a weaker athletic and business base but if these do not interest you there is nothing to worry about. The subpar food is counteracted by many wonderful options throughout the city and the view from The Hill year long is a beautiful one.
Senior,4,"Overall, my experience with Jewell has been incredibly positive. I feel like a name and a face, not just an ID number. I believe my professors and other staff want me to succeed, and everyone on campus does what they can to help myself and every other student."
Senior,4,"William Jewell College is an outstanding institution that places a high priority on academics. A majority of the professors are passionate about their work, but the administrations restrictions on them makes it hard for them to be advocates for the students. It is close enough to Kansas City to go there for the weekend, but focus on school during the week."
Freshman,4,"Jewell is a small college where people are really welcoming. The greek life is really strong on campus but is not essential for your college life. 

The professors are really good, and always willing to help. 

Most students are on a team, so teachers are really understanding with missing classes or having to reschedule exams."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the small community of William Jewell; it allows me to get to know all the students around me, and I’m able to have connections with the professors. The class sizes are small (biggest class I’ve had was about 25 students), and the core curriculum teaches you to think. I would like to see William Jewell improve housing, as some of the buildings are old and have problems. This wouldn’t be too much of an issue, except for students being required to live on campus all four years. I would be in favor of requiring first year students living on campus, but allowing other students to choose their residence."
Freshman,4,Currently a freshman with a Biology degree.  I live in a freshman very small dorm room.  I have been very active since I stepped foot on campus.  I believe that the more involved our in campus life the more likely you are to succeed while in college.  I took classes that challenged me and became more knowledgable because of it.  I got to know my professors because of the small class sizes and felt comfortable talking to them during their office hours.  Either asking for help for talking about what we were studying at the time.  I also have taken advance of the resources that are provided on the campus for help such as tutoring and the writing lab.  Both of which helped me succeed.
Freshman,4,In my experience at William Jewell I have been impressed by the quality of the professors and the amount of effort that goes into each of their lessons. I very much feel that all of the professors I have had the pleasure of working with wish for me to succeed and will ensure they give me every opportunity to succeed!
Sophomore,4,"Besides the food, or the dorms, this school is worth choosing. Especially if you're studying theatre, it's a wild ride experience!!!"
Freshman,4,"William Jewell College is a great school that is extremely underrated. The academics are comparable to some of the best schools in the nation, the professors are amazing, the connections are really valuable, the facilities are wonderful, and the campus is beautiful. My only complaints are that the hours of the places to get food are inconvenient at times and more students should get involved and try to have fun student life on campus."
Freshman,4,The academics at Jewell are extremely prestigious. The professors are very knowledgable and give their students some of the coolest opportunities for undergrads.
Freshman,4,"Having finished my first semester, I can say so far William Jewell is an excellent college. I am in the Oxbridge program and have seen myself become more eager to learn. The teachers are kind and helpful. I love that the teachers know my name. My roommate is great and I study quite a bit."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not going to lie and say it's not there at all, but I've honestly never seen no drugs, alcohol, or anything else."
College Sophomore,4,"Between the professors, classes, campus, and Greek life, I'm always very glad that I chose to go to Jewell."
College Sophomore,4,"All of the students enrolled at Jewell have access to an on campus nurse, counselor, and advisors to go to should they need anything. The staff and faculty are also very serious about campus crimes, and sexual assault. When I asked about the assault I was relieved to hear that they went to the authorities when something happened, but nothing had been heard about by any juniors since they had started; with a school like Jewell, only 1100 students or so, nothing stays quiet for long."
College Junior,4,"Professors care and are willing to help when needed, friends are easy to make. Classes are small and very interactive."
College Sophomore,4,"Jewell is great about offering a variety of courses, but I often feel weighed down by the amount of work I have to do. I basically do not have free time because each class acts like its the only class I have. The registration process is difficult to navigate and frustrating with so few options available and not very flexible options."
College Sophomore,4,"I can't count how many times I have left my wallet in a open area unguarded for hours and no one stole it. Campus is very safe and there a few people on campus who I do not trust, and those people are very easy to avoid."
College Sophomore,4,"There have been a couple of professors that I don't think ever came to really understand the perspective of a student studying something completely different from the topic they were teaching, but for the most part communication with my teachers has been excellent and I think they have helped me achieve my personal best in their classes, no matter the grade."
College Sophomore,4,"Being in the honors program allows me to put some pretty rare and valuable experiences on my resume, even as a sophomore. Being at Jewell allows me with a number of opportunities to pursue local internships and career opportunities that could jumpstart my future career."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life can be very political and somewhat controversial at times, but for the most part, all Greek organizations on campus are very focused on their philanthropies. Parties are rare and usually not well attended."
College Sophomore,4,"Jewell is a great fit for me as far as size of classrooms and building strong relationships with professors, but sometimes the size of the school can be limited to the courses it can provide. For example, my major is music, and I'd like to go into music business, but Jewell only provides one course in music business."
College Freshman,4,Jewell makes sure that each student is on the right path to what they dream of. They provide internships throughout the Kansas City Metro to make that possible. Jewells' courses require dedication and some students feel the need to still hold a part time job outside of school. With that being said Jewell offers a ton of on campus jobs that either are in ones field of study or one that just helps campus community. This college makes sure to provide every opportunity to everyone while making sure one is still able to strive with their education.
College Freshman,4,"Of course sports is a big part of every school experience. But when it comes to sports in college, it is about coming together as a whole and supporting one another whether we win or lose."
College Freshman,4,So far every staff member has been helpful and friendly. I think it is a good fit for me with the class size and easy access to professors.
College Senior,4,"William Jewell requires students to live on campus in the dorms all four years for several reasons.  The main one being due to the vigorous nature of the academic programs at WJC.  The faculty and staff of Jewell want to ensure that all of the students are successful, and therefore, living on campus puts all of the students near campus where they can easily have access to the resources provided for their academic success.  Also, students are recommended to live on campus all four years because it allows them to have the true undergraduate experience, which is extremely rewarding!  Only those who petition for health, financial, or other extreme reasons are permitted to live away from the campus.  But trust me, living in the dormitories is beneficial, as you meet a lot of great people and it is extremely convenient!"
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy my program. It is hard, but I'm learning great things and I have amazing professors and a supporting staff"
College Freshman,4,"Liberty has a ton of restaurants. I mostly eat in the cafeteria, on campus, and buy food from grocery stores to save money. But there are PLENTY of options within 15 mins of campus."
College Freshman,4,I had to write an essay and go through a scary interview
College Freshman,4,"I love my honors program, but it's also a huge commitment"
College Freshman,4,"Teachers are pretty good, but most have liberal views are not open minded."
College Freshman,4,"Its different from other schools and it really doesn't matter if you join or not, nobody treats the other different"
College Freshman,4,"North Kansas City is practically right next to the school, so there is a lot of options not too far from us here at Jewell."
College Freshman,4,There is not much activity until the weekends.
College Freshman,4,There are great technology options here at Jewell.
College Freshman,4,"I applied for financial aid, and the entire process was very easy and informative. I had no problems and got a lot of what I needed."
College Junior,4,"I don't think anybody of importance at my school discriminates. I'm sure there are isolated incidents of ignorant people saying dumb things, but that's not something the school can help."
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy the dorms themselves, and the rooms we are given are typically very nice. The only problem I have is other people. I really do not like how everybody just seems to think that they are the only ones that matter in the dorm. I really don't like that others seem to think that an open door is an invitation, but that's not really the schools fault. My only other problem is the cleanliness of the bathrooms. The staff does the best they can, but the students really just ruin the facilities."
College Junior,4,"One of my favorite things about the school is the speed of the internet connection. The only problem with it is that when a lot of people are out of class and using their computers in the dorms, it tends to get bogged down pretty easily. This isn't as big of a problem when using a wired connection, but sometimes a wired connection just isn't feasible given the size of our rooms."
College Junior,4,"I think that the building I mentioned above sets us apart from other schools. That building is called the Pryor Learning Center, and it's a really nice place. We've got anything a student could possibly need for their projects, including a 3D printer and green screens."
College Junior,4,"I've never been inside any of the athletic facilities, but as far as libraries and other hangouts go, they are really nice. We just got a new building with a ton of new technology in it, and it's really impressive. I do not personally have a use for most of the technology within, but a lot of the students obviously do, as it's always full of people."
College Junior,4,"Great food, better than last years dining; very pleased."
College Freshman,4,"NO complaints. You're always going to have that one group that may be stuck up, but there are plenty of people who are more friendly and willing to make new friendships and connections. Students have their own trends. "
College Freshman,4,"I think that being a music major is tiring, but it is what I want to do. There are plenty of music professors on campus. Being that we only have about 1,100 students, it is easier to get one on one attention if you are struggling. There is always a challenge. "
College Freshman,4,"The study abroad is fantastic. I haven't even gotten to get my application yet, but Jewell does something called the Journey Grant. This is a (minimum) $2,000 grant which you can use to study abroad or do something pointed in the direction of your major. You apply halfway through your sophomore year. 
Professors are friendly and willing/ready to help, and it's easier for that because of the small school size. "
College Freshman,4,"There are a variety of frats/sororities to join. While they do throw the typical parties on campus, they also do great things for the community! Each is dedicated to a certain cause, and they're always raising money to support/donate to the cause. "
College Freshman,4,"The main road off the highway is so jam packed with fun things to do and a multitude of places to eat that range from quick and inexpensive to fancier/pricier. There is a vast amount of ethnic options as well, from sushi, to indian, to Hispanic food, to Asian food. "
College Freshman,4,"The campus safety dept. try to keep everything in order. They make sure that people aren't' parked in the wrong place or a ticket will be there. They are quick to respond to emergency situations and are extremely helpful and nice. If a building is locked, they will come to unlock it for you. They also have emergency buttons in the parking lots so that if there is an emergency, they can be there fast and possibly scare off any trouble makers before a crime happens (aka, a person alone in the parking lot pushing the button could scare off possible offenders). "
College Freshman,4,"They try not to invade on your life and decisions. People will talk to you if they see a problem. Withholding the honor code is probably the most important thing. If people break it, they are required to pay a fee. For example, if one is caught drinking, they are supposed to take an alcohol course and pay a fee. "
College Freshman,4,"Jewell has opened a new building this year (Pryor Learning Center) where students can go to hang out, study, or work in high tech labs for certain areas of interest (green room for video editing, music studio to make music, and a 3d printer are amongst the things they allow us to use). The athletic center is huge and has a swimming pool. There are many intramural sports available for students to join. There are always events and parties going on. "
College Senior,4,It is pretty much never visible. Its a clean school with a great image.
College Junior,4,"We just got a bunch of new computers on campus as an addition to our new campus building, The Pryor Learning Commons. We have computers that are used only for printing and general work--those are normal desktop computers. It's easy to print from these. Then we have higher tech Apple computers used for video and sound editing. You can also print wirelessly from your own laptop to any of the printers on campus--it's super useful and easy to do. We have two other computer labs on campus--one under our administrative building and one in our science building. These two labs have way slower working computers that are really iffy. I would recommend sticking to the PLC. There's really no reason to use the other computers, unless perhaps you need the special programs on the computers in the biochem library (in the science building)."
College Junior,4,"Really all you have to do is apply your senior year (when you are applying for the school) and wait to be notified if you received any. Everyone gets awards based on academics, and we have a lot of athletes who also receive athletic awards. The school gives out a lot of money to its students."
College Junior,4,"The Greek organizations are pretty Panhellenic and are very closely-knit. I think Greek life at Jewell is very important and gives people a place to call home. Greek life at Jewell provides leadership opportunities. However, some of the organizations are very cliquey and only allow ""their type"" in to their organization."
College Junior,4,"Oh So Stylish – You expect to see a lot of lounge pants and over-sized sweaters from college students.  Not at William Jewell.  Everyone always looks their best, no matter how early their first class is.  A lot of people enjoy the Perch (campus cafe) and the Cage (campus burger joint) in the Union, so a lot of people hang out there. You know everyone you see because the campus is so small.  You can easily build relationships at William Jewell; everyone is so accepting."
College Senior,4,"Being in the nursing program is equivalent to a full time job. You're usually in class 4 days a week a minimum of 3 hours each day and then you have a 12 hour clinical on the 5th day of the week. I have learned more about nursing than I ever thought possible between simulation labs, clinicals, and lectures. I very much enjoy the nursing program as challenging as it is, I've learned so much!"
College Senior,4,"This college is well known for its' nursing program, if I had to start over I would still choose this college's reputable program. I am optimistic because of the college I chose that I will not have problems with job placement after graduation."
College Senior,4,The IT department is wonderful! There are plenty of labs and computer rooms that always have open computers to accommodate the number of students on campus.
College Junior,4,The drug scene at WJC is pretty limited.  I have not seen or heard any attempts to solicit participation in this problem
College Freshman,4,There is a wide variety of Majors and minors that students can choose from. The professors are all very knowledgeable in their field of study and they are pretty good at explaining stuff.
College Freshman,4,I am a biology major at William Jewell College. This is a very challenging major with a lot of homework and studying time but it also is once of the best bio programs in the state. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else to get a Bio degree.
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much ethnic diversity, probably because Jewell is an expensive private school, which limits the diversity of its students. Additionally, most of the conservative political views are suffocated by not only other students, but faculty who do not give them a safe environment to express what they believe without being oppressed. There is also a lack of religious students who attend church regularly."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the dorms feel and look like prisons. There are few housing options that are nice and they are pricier, further away from campus, and mostly limited to Greek housing."
College Sophomore,2,"Jewell does not have very good athletic teams. We may have a winning season in a certain sport, but we generally do not win championships. The events are not well attended because the playing is mediocre."
College Freshman,2,First year housing is really bad
College Freshman,2,"The ONLY thing I truly dislike about this school is that it is $40,000 a year. Coming from a middle class family means that we have money, but not extra money lying around. This means I am on my own paying for school. I have $18,000 I had to take out in loans, which is terrifying. It makes me rethink it, but I am still trying my hardest to get more scholarships because I truly do not want to leave Jewell. There are a few opportunities I still have now, so if I do not at least try it will mean I have to leave. "
College Freshman,2,"There are things to do off campus if you know where to go. There's a bowling alley, plenty of places to shop, and local cities you can drive to if you want to go to neighboring shopping malls/centers.  "
College Senior,2,they are really good and fast but there are not a lot of them unfortunately.
College Junior,2,"There's basically no school spirit on campus. The football team especially is not very good, so it's hard to get excited about those games. The soccer teams are good and fun to watch. Each event has at most, probably 20 attendees."
College Junior,2,Athletics are widely supported but our teams are not well known for winning games.
College Junior,2,"I've actually lowered this grade. The transition to GLVC and NCAA D-II has had no noticeable effect outside of more student athletes coming to Jewell. I was hopeful student investment/school spirit would improve, but if anything it's decreased."
College Junior,2,"Personally, I am not a part of Greek Life in any way.  So from the perspective of the outside looking in, I would say it is a serious drawback to the campus because of the campus size.  The majority of the campus is Greek, so it is not anything special.  The Greeks tend to form their own little cliques without realizing it.  Most of the events, especially Homecoming, are not fun because the Greeks tend to take it over and the independents do not have a chance.  The independents are not represented well on the campus in events, surveys, and other things, which is frustrating as an independent myself."
College Senior,2,living off campus i have no access to most of this
College Freshman,2,"On campus there is nothing most of the time. The first few weeks of school and around holidays there are some parties and events, but the rest of the time: Nothing.

Off campus it depends on if you have a car or not. If you do, then there are plenty of places to go and things to do (Again, KC is 20 minutes away). If you don't have a car then there is almost nothing. There's a club or two and bowling alley."
College Freshman,2,"In the school's defense, I'm a city girl. I thought I would do alright in the small town of Liberty, but not so much. While the sounding area is very charming, there is nothing to do and no where to go in WALKING distance. The ""square"" provides a few whimsical shops, but they close early and are closed often. There doesn't appear to be much to recreation things to do (again in walking distance). There are a few clubs and a bowling alley I know, but as far as I can tell there isn't even a park around. The town itself doesn't seem to have many events, or at least that are voiced to students through the college. Kansas City may be a 20 minute drive, but without a car there is no way of getting there."
College Freshman,2,"I don't know much about the options because I'm a first-year so I didn't look into it, however the standard rule is no one is allowed to live off campus for ALL FOUR YEARS except for extenuating circumstances. It is a hassle to ask the school for permission, from what I've heard they really give you the run-around."
College Junior,2,"Students at this campus seem to me to be ""cliquish"" and difficult to become friends with."
College Junior,2,"I received financial aid, however each semester it has taken multiple attempts via phone, email, and in person to get details."
College Junior,2,"There is no local public transportation at this campus.  Security guards are available to escort you to your car if you have stayed late to study in the lab areas.   The student parking is located a distance from campus buildings, and students must walk up the hill and navigate construction areas to reach class buildings"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Lack in School Spirit – The Football team is a joke. We almost never win a game and not very many people show up to support. Although WJC's football is entering into a more respected district, the likelihood of succeeding is slim unless we gain a lot more talent in the next season. 
However, other varsity sports do really well. Our Varsity Soccer teams win a lot of games and have made it into special conferences. Men's Basketball is also known for winning a lot of games. Both of these sports have regular attendees at games."
College Senior,2,"Nothing on Campus – Jewell has just passed a new drinking policy that allows for students of age to have a minimal amount of alcohol and other restricting rules. If you want to drink on campus the only good place to go is the fraternity houses. Off campus there are only a handful of bars in Liberty, but if you really want to go out, go downtown to Westport or the Power and Light District. The drinks can be pretty pricey, and make sure you have a sober driver because the drive is 20 minutes."
Junior,1,"If I could give zero stars I definitely would! This school is definitely messed up and has some serious issues. The administration is very difficult to work with and makes it very difficult for student success. Many students on campus feel unhappy and cheated at the college, and we feel like we pay so much and nothing that was promised gets delivered. Aside from the PLC most buildings on campus have a vast amount of issues throughout the year, the dorm rooms especially. The caf is really bad with minimal food options to choose from, most of us just enjoy the Sunday Ice Cream bar. The cage is where a lot of kids eat but the food there is very greasy and takes forever to get your food. 

Just don't waste your time considering this school as you will not get anything you are promised. You'll end up being unhappy and wonder why you chose the school on the first place."
College Freshman,1,"The dorms are probably the worst thing about Jewell, all the first year dorms are really old and non of them have been updated/taken care of in years."
College Junior,1,"Food is prepared in an unhealthy way, mostly fried or with lots of butter and oil."
College Junior,1,"There is not really any off-campus housing nearby.  There are a few apartments complexes, but you will need a vehicle or a bicycle in order to get to class in a reasonable amount of time.  (By the way, a bicycle is not a good idea on campus because of the hills, which can be impossible to climb at times.)"
College Junior,1,"William Jewell is known for its rigorous academics. The main focus is always studies.  Jewell is also a very small private school where the students are constantly monitored. It is hard to go out or have activities without getting in trouble. If the activity is not approved through student life, they will put an end to it. Jewell does try really hard to have student activities, but only a few people attend. I spend most of my evenings on the weekend home or watching a movie in my dorm."
College Freshman,1,"Almost everyone here is white. There is a handful of other minorities, but mostly white."
College Freshman,1,"I can't speak for all of campus, only my dorm, which is Ely Hall.

The good things about Ely are the community and the distance with campus. The dorm is kinda like a family. You know almost everyone that lives there and we do events and go places together. Its very social. Ely is right next to to everything else on campus. Its a short walk anywhere. Oh, and there is a gym in the basement.

And now the horrible things. Ely wasn't originally built as a dorm, so not all rooms are created equal. Some rooms are large enough that you could room 4 people in them, but most aren't big enough for 1 person. Its like living in a closet. Even with lofted beds, space is limited. The second problem I with Ely it's physical quality. The rooms are disgusting. The carpet flooring look as though it hasn't been changed since the 80s. I'm pretty sure it used to be red, but now its a horrid pink-brown, but the color is hard to see past all the stains that range from yellow glitter-glue to bleach. The wall are made of burlap. If you can't imagine what thats like, its like a wicker basket thats has had a cheese grater taken to it. Our AC/Heater unit breaks all the time, the windows have something wrong with them (its looks like poured milk on them and it forever stuck) and the showers don't drain properly. It just unmaintained, and you pay almost the same price to live in Ely as you do Melrose. (Which is a new hall that is in near perfect condition.) Everyone who has visited me in my dorm has described it as the worst dorm they have ever seen.

Oh yeah, and did I mention we have a brow recluse problem on the 2nd and 3rd floors? No one has been bitten yet this year, but we sure find a lot of those little guys on our bug traps."
College Freshman,1,Predominately white and conservative. It's very obvious.
College Freshman,1,They don't keep things up-to-date nor do they make sure the quality is maintained. The library and computer lab are especially terrible.
College Sophomore,1,"A Few Restaurants, and That's About It! Unfortunately, everything worth doing is in KC, not Liberty. With the exception of a few restaurants (namely Taj Mahal and Los Compas), unless you really like bowling or movies--the only two recreational things in Liberty--you're in for a bad time."
College Freshman,1,"Campus Security.. Doesn't exist. It's one guy driving around in a Ford Escape. You can destroy your dorms, smoke weed, and drink all you want..they will never know. The ones that get caught are just plain retarded."
College Freshman,1,"way below average, and I mean WAY.  The rec center AKA the Mabee center could be the biggest piece of sh** I've ever seen. The campus is pretty though."
College Freshman,1,"Not Great; Looking to Transfer. I live 7 miles away, am entirely financially responsible for my education, and have a medical reason. I was told that despite the rule requiring everyone to live on campus, exemptions were available. While exemptions ARE technically available, you have to bend over backwards to get anywhere close to one. I fought with Student Affairs for 6 weeks before getting an exemption, and even with four appeals, two doctor's notes, and a letter from a lawyer, they still only allowed me a temporary exemption and I'll have to go through it all again if I want to be a commuter next semester. The OxBridge program is great and really challenging. As for their other academics, the teachers and classes are, for the most part, sub-par. I was not impressed and it is definitely not worth the $34,000/year for tuition. If I could just be a part of Oxbridge and nothing else, it would be a decent school, but the administration is awful and money-hungry and the academics are unimpressive. I hear the nursing program is pretty good, though."

College Freshman,1,"Must Have a Car. There isn't really any public transportation, Liberty is a small town and if you want to go anywhere you need a car. Most students have their own, but it wouldn't be difficult to find one to borrow."
College Freshman,1,"Greek or Nothing – At Jewell because it is such a small school, Greek life feels huge even though it's not as big as it seems. If going Greek isn't your thing there can be feelings of exclusion, although it is possible to find cool people outside the Greek system. Most all of the activities are Greek oriented and the best housing by far is Greek."
College Junior,1,"What Am I Paying for? Well I can't complain about the tickets or when they give them out, it's pretty straight forward. Just don't park illegally or in visitor's spots. But they just implemented a $100 fee for parking permits, it's always been free. I'm not even sure why, there's plenty of spots for students and everyone parks in two lots."
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't have a car, you're pretty much screwed unless you find a friend that wants to take you somewhere. Most people have cars, but those that don't have cars have no way of getting around unless they go with friends."
College Junior,1,Wish There Was More Money – I feel most lied to when it came to being able to afford a private college. Sometimes I wish I went to the state school that was giving me a full ride.

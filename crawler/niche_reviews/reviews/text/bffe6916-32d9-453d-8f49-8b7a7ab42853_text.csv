Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed my first year with Furman. As an education major, it was incredible to have field work my very first semester at college"
Sophomore,5,"Furman University is an incredible institution. I've only been there for a year, but I've found it to be second to none. The academics are incredible, much of the faculty is incredible, the campus itself is incredible. I'm looking forward to my next years here."
Sophomore,5,"Some of my professors made this transition to remote learning super easy! In a time that was stressful and unknown to all of us, many of my professors reached out constantly to keep in contact and made assignments and deadlines extremely reasonable! My favorite professor would even schedule phone calls if we wanted to have one - to talk about school, the most current assignments, family life at home, etc. That experience made staying in touch with the routine I had on campus alittle easier."
Sophomore,5,"After wrapping up my first year at Furman, I will say it was amazing. Yes, it was very hard but the professors are dedicated to helping you and actually get to know you personally. The small class sizes help make you discuss more with your professors. Furman has a great reputation for the Greenville/Traveler’s Rest areas which are both growing areas. Furman works with you to get internships and provides many study away programs. If you’re a hardcore party school person, I’ll warn you that Furman is more focused on your education but Downtown Greenville is BOOMING and there’s always something to do. Athletes are fun to attend and the fine arts programs are wonderful.

Oh by the way... The campus is BEAUTIFUL. I love calling this place home."
Alum,5,"Very challenging coursework. Several student groups and extracurriculars. Located between Greenville and Traveler's Rest, SC which are both up-and-coming areas. Furman is also greatly connected in both communities which means they have an abundance of partnerships with local businesses and nonprofits for internships."
Senior,5,A great liberal arts school that has professors who care deeply about their students and their success.
Niche User,5,went on a campus tour and everyone was so nice. They can inform you about the admissions process and everything is super easy.
Niche User,5,"Among all of my options, I have decided on Furman University as being my top choice of colleges. After visiting multiple times, I have determined that the food is wonderful, the students are engaging, and nearly every experience I have had at the school has been fantastic. I hope to be enrolled into Furman and am excited about the possibility of being chosen as one of their students."
Works Here,5,"Furman is a caring community with dedicated faculty, top-notch resources, and a diverse set of beyond-the-classroom opportunities."
Sophomore,5,I love Furman University! The community is great and the staff truly care about the students and their education. I've met so many great people here and the entire experience has been amazing.
Senior,5,"I have loved being a student at Furman University. With the small class sizes, I get to know my professors well, and can individualized help, when needed. I enjoy being at a liberal arts college, because every one of my classes seems to be interwoven with my other classes. This makes learning connect more for me and I feel ready for my next steps!"
Alum,5,"Furman has the most beautiful campus I've ever seen. My favorite location is the famous belltower. I've spent many walks around the peaceful lake just to take my mind off my academics. The academics at Furman is very rigorous. However, the professors and tutors are always helpful and are encouraging."
Niche User,5,Furman seems to be a wonderful college that I have had the pleasure of going to. The relationships with professors are stellar.
Freshman,5,Love the community & campus. Great surrounding city - many things to do. So much to get involved in on camps. Campus is beautiful - makes it feel like home.
Junior,5,"I am currently a junior majoring  in Sustainability Science in the Earth and Environmental Science Department. I LOVE the department.

I also highly recommend the food on campus, it is mostly locally sourced. The dorms and apartments vary but for the most part they have all been very nice. There are a lot of renovations and improvements happening now! 

I'm not really sure why we have a B- in campus safety because I have never felt unsafe or heard of anyone else feeling unsafe. We are a gated campus and every car that enters campus is accounted for. 

We also have a ton of fun. There are frats and sororities that hold events constantly. There is also a shuttle that will take you downtown Greenville on the weekends for free, I do this often instead of an uber!! 

The weather is awesome too! (Coming from a northener) 

Furman has really benefited all aspects of my life and I am so grateful that I found it!"
Freshman,5,I enjoy the people and the atmosphere here. Through the Furman Advantage it is obvious that the school cares and wants to see me succeed.
Niche User,5,"Furman University excels at teacher/student communication and provides each student the unique opportunity to self create a major and educational focus that allows them to not only give back to the community to help find ways that their education can help impact the world.  Additionally, the Furman campus is clean, pristine and provides the students with all of the amenities of a larger university setting."
Niche User,5,"Furman University really focuses on making the undergraduate experience count.  Through its rigorous academics and emphasis on research, internship and study away programs, its sure to give its student the upper hand in real world."
Junior,5,Furman has incredible faculty and professors who go out of their way for students daily. There is a refreshing sense of community on campus. Furman has connections across the globe that advantages their students. One of the most beautiful campuses you’ll ever see. It’s a magnet for driven and ambitious students from all over!
Junior,5,"I like how the professors really challenge you with extremely difficult academics, but are also very accessible to ensure you have the ability to succeed. I also love the campus, it is beautiful! And the surrounding city, Greenville, has so much to offer and adventure spots!"
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely loved my first year at Furman. The campus is stunning, the food is delicious, I always feel safe, the professors are great and really care about you, and I have met really nice people. Downtown Greenville is so cute and there are mountains nearby campus to go hiking. I am so happy here!!!"
Junior,5,"As a rising junior, I believe that Furman University has continuously and continues to provide me with a wide variety of opportunities to carry on a professional pathway towards a lifetime career.  In addition to the wide variety of amenities available on campus, such as the career development center, the internship office, and the writing lab, Furman does its best to provide resources to aid in its advancement of its students.  It provides a great faculty with knowledgeable and renowned professors that attend to small class sizes, perfect to form a great one-on-one relationship with your professor, allowing for a more demanding course study.   It is a very challenging school that expects students to challenge themselves.  It has a great opportunity in Greek Life and students are extremely involved both on and off campus.  Provided the internship office, Furman also gives the opportunity to all of its students to study abroad through the Furman Advantage."
Junior,5,"I attended Furman from 2009 to 2011 and I've recently returned to complete my bachelor's degree. While a Furman education requires a significant financial investment and a high academic aptitude, it's worth it. The campus is beautiful, the class size is relatively small, and the professors really care about their subject and their students. The food at the dining hall is excellent and you don't have to worry about campus safety. If you're considering Furman, it's a great choice, but you need to be prepared to work hard and take advantage of all the opportunities. Even if you don't pursue your major as a career, you will take away skills and relationships to last a lifetime."
Freshman,5,Wonderful school!  Was my number one choice.  Challenging academics.  Great support! Campus is beautiful.  Most professor are terminal degree.  Music department is outstanding!
Sophomore,5,Furman is a place where you will be academically pushed to your limits and then some. Although it is academically challenging you will still find lots of fun activities within student life. The faculty all want to help and see you succeed in any way they can. The inescapable beauty of the nationally acclaimed campus is not only mirrored but amplified by the students you will meet. Every person I have encountered at Furman has been genuinely kind and interested in me as a person. I could not recommend this school in a higher regard! Roll Dins!
Graduate Student,5,It is such a beautiful and diverse campus!! I am excited to begin attending this campus and furthering my education at this school!!
Junior,5,Great School! Excellent Biology Department and beautiful campus. Professors are great but the expectations and classes are really hard.
Sophomore,5,"Love furman!!!!! Well rounded school and ive had so much fun and learnt so much here. The work is hard but really pays off and the social scene here is incredible: theres always something to do!! We have fresh markets, puppies come in so we can play with them, talented symphonies and orchestras, cooking classes, spin/pilates/boot camp classes, banquets, dances, concerts, free massages.... the list goes on and on. Such an amazing school and best decision of my life."
Freshman,5,It's such a beautiful campus! The student life is also amazing and the students themselves are very inviting and are always willing to help others. One on one teacher tutoring is also provided at Furman and it makes studying much easier.
Sophomore,5,"Reviews on here are outdated; present day Furman has a very work hard play hard feeling, bar nights are on Tuesday and Thursday and frat parties are throughout the weekend. Frats have definitely upped their games with the past few classes and frat parties rage, overall good times, if u want to party def can but also depends on who you know (athletes, frats/sororities, etc.)"
Sophomore,5,"Furman is incredible! The academics are very rigorous but the professors are easy to reach and amiable. The campus is gorgeous and is located not too far from downtown. There is always something going on on campus too, whether it's having free donuts outside the library or a local speaker or performance. Everyone is friendly and the environment is very welcoming."
Niche User,5,My dad is an alum so I have been to campus and taken many tours. It is such a beautiful campus. The professors are very personable and easy to talk to. They really want to see you succeed.
Junior,5,"Furman is a beautiful place with wonderful professors who are always willing to help you, nice people, and an amazing rigorous academic program perfect for those who are willing to be challenged. It's in the heart of the most beautiful city in South Carolina and I couldn't be more in love!"
Niche User,5,I am proudly a second generation Furman student! Thankful for this school and the academics it stands for.
College Sophomore,5,I am a sophomore at Furman and I have been very happy with my time here so far. I have loved all of my professors (sometimes not the subject material however with GERs) and saw how much they care about every student and our success. I have gained friendships that challenge me to be a better person everyday. And the campus and its energy never seizes to amaze me. The only thing I would change about Furman is its tuition because I am paying for it in loans and will most likely paying my loans for the next 20-30 years.
College Freshman,5,i HAVE LOVED EVERY COURSE IVE TAKEN AND i HAVE LIKED MOST OF MY PROFESSORS!
College Freshman,5,tHE CAREER POSPECTS AND VALUE OF DEGREE AT fURMAN IS DEFINATELY STRONG. i feel like i will be prepared for real world.
College Freshman,5,"i HAVE NEVER FELT UNSAFE ON THE CAMPUS. fOR EXAMPLE, i HAVE WALKED AT NIGHT AROUND CAMPUS BY MYSELF."
College Freshman,5,Joining a sorority was the best decision I made. i MET SO MANY MORE EOPLE AND IT MADE ME WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN MORME THINGS.
College Freshman,5,The quality of classes is very high and the quality of the professors is even higher in my opinion.
College Sophomore,5,"The Furman University Police Department, or FUPO, is constantly patrolling campus. It always feels safe and there is even a texting safety system in place for emergencies."
College Sophomore,5,Furman has around a 98% job and graduate school placement rating. They provide the help needed for success!
College Sophomore,5,"I personally was not planning on rushing my freshman year, but I am so glad I did. The recruitment process is a lot less cut-throat than other big state schools. Everyone finds a place in the end and ends up enjoying it!"
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Furman. It's truly a hidden gem. We seem to have it all - an absolutely beautiful campus, rigorous academics, helpful and caring faculty, awesome location, incredible resources, research opportunities, state of the art technology, good food, D1 athletics, amazing job/grad school placement rates postgrad... need I say more? Honestly could not have chosen a better school. For some, the only downside to Furman may be its size and its academic rigor. It's not an easy school by any means. But, if you're willing to put in the work, it will all be worth it and you will receive way more than you put in!"
College Freshman,5,"Furman has a very rigorous academic program. No one department lacks infamy for that. Having a good grade in the class is not impossible, the student just has to be willing to put in the time and effort for the A."
College Junior,5,Academics are very rigorous!  Students have to manage their time well and always be prepared for classes.  There are study sessions available as well as tutoring services.
College Junior,5,Furman provides a lot of beneficial opportunities.
College Junior,5,"I love my sorority, but there is no pressure if you don't participate in Greek life. Furman is about 50-50."
College Junior,5,Workload is hard but do-able. Ppl transfer because it's too hard-especially sport ppl. Love professors and they care about the students success. Love the study areas and marker boards.
College Junior,5,I love my classes and the teachers really care about u over anything.
College Junior,5,I've gotten 2 internships already and I'm a junior.
College Junior,5,I love furman and the professor and the environment.
College Junior,5,I love the sense of community at Furman.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here. It is the most beautiful and relaxing campus I have ever stepped foot on. It has challenging academics, and some of the most friendly people you will ever meet. The professors and students all have great relationships with one another and the professors are willing to meet with you and work out any problems that may be evident. This university as a whole, has such a supportive community that no matter what you do, there will be someone around that can help you out."
College Sophomore,5,Furman has the nicest people and best programs.
College Freshman,5,"I love eating off-campus--late night trips to Cook-Out and Krispy Kreme, date nights at Trap Door and Barley's, lunch at Sully's Steamers and Pita Pit... It's all great. Lot's of options!"
College Junior,5,Campus is absolutely beautiful. Easily one of the best in the country.
College Junior,5,Choosing Furman has proven to be one of the best choices I've ever made. I wish I could spend more time here!
College Junior,5,"The music education program at Furman is absolutely fantastic. I feel well-prepared to enter the field, but that I have plenty of resources in my professors when I need their help in the future. The program is challenging and takes 4 years as opposed to the typical 5 years that most other universities require for music education students."
College Junior,5,"The music professors are fantastic, and they will do everything they can to help you make connections, get into grad school, and get jobs upon graduation. Some of my closest friends will be my professors."
Sophomore,4,The professors work hard to help remote students feel connected. The only problem i have encountered is connections issues with Zoom and Moodle
Alum,4,"I did not take any classes online. However, I am sure the online experience would have been just as good as the in-person experience."
Sophomore,4,"I found Furman through my high school counselor. I knew I wanted a school in the South that would set me up for success as I am studying to become a teacher. With a basic general education course, I was studying and observing a local teacher in a real classroom during my first semester as a freshman! This experience along with many others have solidified my decision to become a Paladin. Roll Dins!!"
Freshman,4,"As I am only a freshmen, I can not account for everything, but so far my experience has been wonderful. I have made amazing friends and have learned so much from my classes and the people around me already. The campus is gorgeous and the people are very friendly. However, it is very expensive."
Freshman,4,The community is very welcoming. ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
Alum,4,"At Furman, you are pushed to do your best in an intense academic setting by professors who are truly invested in you. You can find fellow students with whom to connect and not just compete. But there is immense strain on you mentally, and that is made clear by the prevalence of mental illness at Furman."
Sophomore,4,"Furman has been great so far. I started last year and I made great friends and have a great community surrounding me. Some of my professors were truly amazing and some weren't but that happens anywhere. The campus is incredible and most of the staff is helpful. I just wish I understood why tuition goes up every year. Also why they keep cutting funds for different departments like theater and music. I am in the music department and am struggling to continue to attend Furman because financial aid has been cut. Overall, Furman is great, but there is a lot of endowment money and I just don't know where it all goes."
Sophomore,4,"beautiful place. not a party School, many disabled students, good basketball teams, sororities are a big deal for some reason... but they don't have houses. housing- bad"
Freshman,4,"Wonderful and friendly campus. Furman is getting better at responding to incidents, but could still Improve in response time and effort to show the school’s stance."
Sophomore,4,"Furman is a great choice if you’re looking for an academically stimulating challenge. But like any school, it still needs a lot of work. Especially when it comes to diversity and inclusion. You’ll love Furman if your looking for something to call home!"
Junior,4,"I love Furman! Students are generally outgoing and kind, a perk of living in the south. Not a huge ""party"" scene, but there is always definitely enough going on to keep you entertained!"
Junior,4,"Furman University is a very great school with wonderful academic opportunities. I feel like I am important and respected by the professors and staff. Some things that I would change would have to be the billing process, the housing space, parking, and the dining hall options."
Freshman,4,"I personally had a great time at Furman. You have to be a certain type of person to go here, like small schools and skinny white girls that all look alike. Overall, you focus on academics but have fun if you know how to."
Niche User,4,"Furman University has an extremely beautiful campus. The campus is not overwhelmingly big, but still big enough that it is possible to meet someone new every day. The staff are welcoming and everyone in admissions greets you with a smile. Furman is also the highest-ranked liberal arts college in South Carolina. The students that I have met that attend Furman always praise the university and are proud to be Paladins. On all of my campus tours, I have been treated with respect and I never felt like they were a waste of my time. The admissions team makes the tour informative and fun at the same time."
Freshman,4,I feel like Furman University could just be more diverse. A majority of students are white and come from a very high income bracket.
Sophomore,4,"While I recognize that Furman yields a different influence on all its students one aspect of furman that has begun to concern me is the apathy of its students in terms of drug and alcohol abuse/addiction. while yes these choices are often the individuals, the fraternity and sorority presence make its members feel like they are saying no to their brothers and sisters vs simply the alcohol and drugs.  kids can get their hands on ciroc and grey goose and cocaine to even prescription opioids like heroin and fenta. Ive seen beautiful, bright people become apathetic and painfully lost. While furman excels in academic preparation, in the charm of the campus and in almost every other way, do not be fooled by the quaint picture that has been painted by furman; on the outside furman appears as beautiful, dangerously masking the extreme presence of apathy and addiction here and the dangers of the 'fun' many here associate with cocaine, weed and alcohol highs."
Junior,4,"Furman is a really amazing school with great professors and great opportunities for research, study abroad, and extracurriculars. Furman really helps develop with your holistic development and you are surrounded by an extremely supportive student body, faculty and staff."
Freshman,4,I've been getting recruited by Furman for the soccer team and have had a chance to view the campus several times. I love the location and the friendliness of all the students and staff. They make you feel like a family. Furman has a very tight nit community and I really look forward to attending there for the next 4 years.
Freshman,4,"Furman has been a lot more than I have expected. It has been the best of me and the worse of me! Although the academics are extremely rigorous and stressful the hard work really pays off! The professors and faculty become friends, mentor, and a shoulder cry on or vent when necessary! Furman although tough has been the best part of my life. I do not regret coming here at all."
Sophomore,4,"Furman is a wonderful college. The campus is beautiful and the administration is caring. Furman has so many resources to help everyone succeed including internship office, tutoring lab, TAs, etc. The food is good but it is always the same. The campus is beautiful, but the Arts and Theatre departments are not given enough funding for building improvements."
College Sophomore,4,Lots of resources on campus to help students get in touch with career options. Also such a strong connection with Greenville which makes job and internship opportunities greater
College Sophomore,4,"Small class sizes, awesome professors, and a nice variety of courses considering the small student body size"
College Sophomore,4,I feel extremely safe on campus and Furman's police are extremely accessible.
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is a pretty big deal, especially for girls, but if you are not Greek, it is no big deal. There are social opportunities for everyone."
College Sophomore,4,I have had a great experience at Furman. The majority of my professors have been amazing and truly care about my success in and out of the classroom.
College Freshman,4,So many amazing choices. You also have teachers willing to help guide you through the process.
College Freshman,4,"i LOVE MY SCHOOL. tHE POEPLE ARE AMAZING, THE ACADEMICS ARE CHALLENGING and the campus is beautiful."
College Freshman,4,"I have had awesome professors, and I love having small classes and be able to have class discussions."
College Freshman,4,"This school a little overpriced in my opinion, but you get a great education here."
College Freshman,4,"Not very clicky, everyone hangs out with everyone."
College Freshman,4,Very cool to attend games! Furman cares a lot about their athletic programs.
College Freshman,4,"Furman's campus is beautiful. The academics are very challenging, but worth it in the end."
College Freshman,4,I have never been worried about my safety here. There are plenty of preventative measures put in place and our campus police are the best kinds of people.
College Freshman,4,We have a very high statistical likelihood of getting into whatever kind of opportunity you would like after graduating.
College Freshman,4,I didn't ever think I would join Greek life but I wound up doing so somehow and I think it'll be a good thing for me. It'll help my social skills for sure but I guess you could say I'm still a little new to the whole ordeal.
College Freshman,4,"I'm really glad that I decided to come here simply because of the people.  There are great opportunities too and academically it's rigorous and interesting, but lots of other schools have that too. What convinced me was the vibe and the community feel."
College Sophomore,4,I love this school. It truly is a hidden gem!!!!!!
College Freshman,4,"I have, thankfully, never been sexually assaulted or assaulted in general. I do occasionally feel unsafe walking to me car alone at night but that is do the society we live in versus the security of the campus. They did a fantastic job the during orientation telling us our options if we or we knew someone that was sexually assaulted or if there was a gunman, etc..."
College Freshman,4,"Again, I love the relationship between the students and faculty. I don't feel like just a number. My teachers are extremely passionate about their work and about helping us. The only problem is the financial aid. It is an expensive private college and although they do offer a lot of help, it still is not enough so I am forced to live at home because my family cannot afford to send me to college."
College Freshman,4,I would have given it an excellent rating but Furman is very pricey and I come from a poor background so I was unable to live on campus. That means I have to drive 35-40 minutes everyday to attend class and do extracurricular activities on campus which has led to some conflicts since I do work.
College Junior,4,There is a lot of diversity on campus in all areas.
College Junior,4,I always feel very safe on campus.
College Junior,4,"Most professors are outstanding.  All of them know me by name and speak to me outside of classes when I see them.  Some have even had us visit their homes for socials or taken classes out to eat.  However, there are a few who seem to pride themselves on making things unreasonably difficult in their subjects."
College Junior,4,"Most of the professors are very helpful and know you by name.  You get a great education, but Furman expects a lot of of its students.  There are no easy classes."
College Junior,4,Safe ride is the best
College Junior,4,It's 60% Greek life. I love it. I was in one but disaffiliated bc money and petty.
College Junior,4,A lot of students are involved on campus and are very supportive of the way the campus looks.
College Freshman,4,I have a lot to learn and this is the place to do it.
College Freshman,4,"Great people and Professors, a lot of fun. Social life is pretty good, definitely look into playing some club sports like rugby for example."
College Junior,4,"Because of the size of Furman, the professors get to know you incredibly quickly and take a personal interest in you. It's really nice to have a support group made up of experts in your field!"
College Junior,4,"I couldn't imagine going to any other school. Furman University provides a close knit community that supports its students in their educational pursuits. While walking around campus you can always see friends and new people, so it's hard to have met everyone. The people at Furman, students and professors, make it the school it is. The majority of the students find a good balance between having fun and studying and the professors are very professional and expect a lot of you, while also being a supportive friend."
College Senior,4,"Everything about the music department at Furman has been fantastic. The professors are all proficient teachers and performers, and the classes offer a nice challenge without being too overwhelming. Also, there are so many opportunities to perform, accompany, and learn from various masters from around the nation. However, being a transfer student from a junior college, it was a little difficult getting adjusted to how things work around Furman. That being said, Furman has been an amazing experience for me thus far."
College Freshman,4,"I've only recently started working out at the PAC, and I very much like the facilities that we have. I haven't participated in any campus sports, though, so I can't speak on that."
College Freshman,4,"Great job! I haven't had much personal experience with the administration, but keep up whatever you're doing."
College Freshman,4,Scholarship Day convinced me that Furman is for me
College Freshman,4,Living on campus really works for me!!
College Junior,4,"Depending on which dorm you are placed in, campus housing is fine. There are some SoHo dorms I would avoid, but the proximity to classes and general atmosphere of the dorms and apartments is great. I am glad that everyone lives on campus, it means you're never more than five minutes away from your classes and your friends."
College Junior,4,"The music department is great, and I know that my professors will always support me."
College Junior,4,"My experience has been that classes are as easy or as challenging as you make them. I never to assigned reading, but I pay attention in class and take notes, then I review my notes a little before midterms and finals, and I got a 4.0 this semester."
College Junior,4,"The music department is great, but rather self-involved. I don't have any friends outside of the music department because it is so time consuming."
Freshman,2,The campus is extremely small. There is no social aspect. Academics are extremely challenging so prepare to study all the time. Dorms need to be renovated. Greek life isn't big at all. Greenville is gorgeous if you have time to go visit it. Everything is a 10 minute walk. Campus police is overbearing. Advisors are either angels sent from heaven above or don't know a single thing about the college or majors or anything.
Freshman,2,"If you are coming to school strictly to get an education, Furman is the perfect place. But I am the type of person who also wants to experience the college lifestyle and meet the kinda people that I'm going to be close with for life. As its been said already, there are a lot of narrow minded people, girls especially. Hard to find genuine people which is one of the major things that attracted me here. Frat parties are awkward even if you aren't an awkward person. It really does feel like high school all over again."
College Junior,2,Not involved in Greek life
College Freshman,2,not a lot of weed but weirdly lots of cocaine users.
College Freshman,2,I think people should ay more attention to the vARISTY SPORTS. I feel like people attend tailgates of things for the social aspect and then don't even go to the games.
College Sophomore,2,"The Vinings, the off-campus housing, has no furniture and Furman doesn't cover amenities. Plus, it's ridiculously expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"If you want frat parties, you have to know who to ask. If you want public parties and are under 21, your only option is the barn, which is terrifying. Your best bet if you're under 21 is to go to a friend's apartment (plan your own small get together)."
College Sophomore,2,There are never any utensils or plates in the DH. They took out a lot of seating to make that Mongolian BBQ and so there is never enough seating during the busy hours. There are also not a lot of healthy food options in the DH. The Paddock takes forever to serve you and Einstein's also takes a long time even with many workers.
College Freshman,2,I almost never go to DH.  I get groceries and eat in my room most of the time.
College Senior,2,"As far as parties are concerned, Furman doesn't allow them. So if there are a group of people in your apt & someone calls a noise complaint, campus police won't say ""you guys need to quiet down"", they'll will basically check everyone's ID's, breathalyze the entire room, and screw up the rest of your semester."
College Sophomore,2,"It's hard to get around if you don't have a car. Options are very limited,"
College Senior,2,"One of my least favorite aspects of Furman. The restaurants are fine, but the dining hall fails fairly often, and I resort to eating cereal or PB&J to not waste meals. Food is also overpriced."
College Sophomore,2,"Dating is so weak at this school. It can be very hard to intermingle and I'm not quite sure how I got my current boyfriend, but I don't know how the hell I'm going to go about finding someone else if we break up. 

Girls are very beautiful here, the guys are more average. There are a range of students dressing up or in sweats in class. I don't party, but a lot of people complain that the party scene is ridiculously weak."
College Sophomore,2,"Majority are affluent, sheltered, white, and religious. However, I do believe the student body is relatively open-minded when it comes to most things."
College Sophomore,2,Furman doesn't have that many connections because the only people that know of Furman are in the South East
College Sophomore,2,There is absolutely no school spirit at Furman when it comes to sports. If someone tells you otherwise they are lying through their teeth. Intramural sports are big with fraternities but there is no school involvement with athletics and athletes in general are not treated nearly as highly as they are at state schools
College Sophomore,2,Furman is very cliquy. Some would say high school x2. The problem is that because the school is small and the greek community is even smaller. Those who do not join a fraternity or sorority get left out of basically all social life within Furman. Furman is also ranked top 20 for the most socially awkward students in the country which gives you some perspective
College Junior,2,Lots of rich white kids.
College Freshman,2,Campus police are crazy about parking!
College Freshman,2,"Nightlife is really lame, expect to be home by 1 am"
College Junior,2,"Transportation is minimal, its a free for all with the shuttle. You never know how long you will have to wait for the shuttle to come, anywhere from 5 min to an hour.  Impossible to plan because there is no schedule of when the bus will come where."
College Junior,2,"We don't have a safety problem, but the administration could be doing more to keep it that way. Lighting paths and enforcing sexual assaults, and cases of stalking."
College Junior,2,A lot of energy spent on giving violations and less on student safety.
College Junior,2,Too many students for available rooms.
College Junior,2,"Most people here are white, conservative, middle-to-upper class.  There's not many people of different races here."
College Freshman,2,"Some good looking girls but most are socially awkward. A lot of the guys are tools and dress overly preppy to try to seem ""fratty"". The overall dynamic is awkward"
Recent Alumnus,2,The athletics on campus are not a huge focal point.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The campus is small and they have a bus on the weekends to downtown, but it is unreliable."
College Freshman,2,"The police force can be pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. First-time offenders get a letter sent home, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it. If you're going to drink then drink, but don't start advertising keg parties in your room. You will get busted! - this sample review pretty much sums it up actually."
College Freshman,2,"Frats are not that great, parties are fairly quiet otherwise the school will shut them down"
College Junior,2,"There are decent choices, but it's a bit of a drive to get to them.  And if you don't have a car it's impossible to get to any of them."
College Junior,2,There are not many parking options and a lot of rules about where you can and can not park.  The campus police are like vultures and hand out a lot of tickets.
College Senior,2,"For the most part, Furman is a pretty reserved and conservative school.  The security is everywhere at all hours, and they are always trying to keep parties and gatherings from happening on campus. Two years ago was the first year that alcohol was permitted for students 21 and up, and security treats the campus as if it has not changed.  To make matters worse, in many cases, neighboring students are the first to get others in trouble with security, because that is the nature of the school."
College Freshman,2,"Welcome to the Club – If diversity is a big deal to you, then Furman is not the place for you. The stereotype of Furman as a country club isn't 100% true, but it's a pretty damn nice place and people dress like it. Overall, there are a few gay people, and the only blacks are really the athletes. Most students come from well-off families, but as the school has really pushed financial aid over the last couple years there is starting to be more socioeconomic diversity among students."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Lack of Variety and Options – Compared to most college towns surrounded by a hub of restaurants and numerous different options, the area around Furman is severely limited. The on campus option including the dining hall offers a good variety and healthy choices however the remaining restaurant choices are typically fast food and lack variety and accessibility."
College Junior,2,"A Mixed Review – If you're under 21 and not in a sorority, the options are dismal.  Independents don't get the chance to go to many parties and a typical night is going out to eat and trying to find something to do.  Once you're 21, downtown is a fun option.  The Furman bus picks people up, so no real worries about designated drivers. I usually go to Clemson to get my partying fix."
College Sophomore,2,"Students are required to live on campus anyway.  The only exceptions are to live with your family, if you have a medical excuse, to be with a spouse, or if you have a financial reason.  However, I have seen plenty of people denied with a true medical reason.

I gave it a C because the Vinings is a good, Furman-owned option off campus.  Only available to seniors though."
College Sophomore,2,Unless You're Greek. The freshman dorms are pretty bad - South Housing's Blackwell is probably a bit shabbier than your average prison. Don't expect much comfort unless you're in one of the sorority or fraternity halls.
College Sophomore,2,"Students are divided into two ""sections"" - the super-religious preppy stuck-up greeks (60-70%) and the ""fringe kids"" that are there for the education/location/campus. Faculty will help you out as much as they can, but don't expect any forgiveness as far as school policy goes. It's very difficult to get back on your feet if you have a bad semester."
College Freshman,2,"Well the nightlife at Furman is pretty underground unless you go off campus to downtown Greenville, there are plenty of bars and clubs on the weekends. They are geared more toward the college crowds so that is a plus. In terms of on campus parties are not tolerated so they are done in secrecy as a result of the new policy in which you can be fined a couple of hundred dollars for being caught housing a party. Other than that there is nothing to do on campus unless you count fountain housing or finding something fun to do with your friends. My recommendation, make friends with upperclassmen, they live in the apartments and you will have a blast."
Alum,1,"By putting a ridiculous price on education, you aren’t actually making it any better. In terms of academic rigour, it really wasn’t that terrible. They handle sexual assault and dating violence horribly. They lack sufficient accomodation for sufferers of chronic illness as well as mental illness. The school is a bubble. Do not be fooled when they call themselves diverse. Truly. There is little cultural, religious, or ethnic diversity. Old white men still make up a majority of the faculty. On campus housing is required, yet terrible. Dining options are limited and not open late enough. Social life comprises of a bunch of cliques. Even the faculty are clique-ish. When I was going through immense depression,  I couldn’t miss a day of class without my whole department knowing. Furman can put fancy branding about the Furman “advantage” and up their price all they want, but they will never be a diverse, safe learning environment."
Freshman,1,This school was like returning to the cliques of high school. I have never been to  more judgmental place. If youre a girl and you dont put on no-makeup-makeup every day and a lily pulitzer dress you wont be accepted. If you want to move off campus to save money you cant. If you want to be unique in any way and not another greek like zombie you will be an outcast. I am transferring out after two semesters here.
College Sophomore,1,There is no off-campus housing options unless you get special permission. You have to be approved and its a hassle.
College Freshman,1,Too many parties and underage drinking.
College Sophomore,1,"The food at Furman is probably the thing that Most students complain about. If you don't believe me, down load the app Yik Yak. It is an app that allows students to anonymously make comments on campus based on location. About 50% of these posts are about how bad the food is. Aramark runs Furman's food program. They have a scale from 1-8 based on food quality that they can provide. Prison food (which they supply a lot) has a food quality of 1. Furman's food quality that they are willing to pay for through Aramark is a 3. Students pay $55,000 a year to go to Furman and eat terrible food. The hours are weird and they make you buy a meal plan even though you can go to the grocery store for an entire year and make your own food for half the price of campus meals."
College Sophomore,1,"Furman is pretty strict when it comes to drinking on campus. FUPO is going to new lengths to break up the fun. Having 8+ in a North Village appartment is considered a party WITH OR WITH OUT ALCOHOL, which is ridiculous. Overall very strict"
College Sophomore,1,"It is impossible to park anywhere that your parking ticket does not assign, you will get ticketed immediately"
College Sophomore,1,Housing lottery is awful. Upper class men have ended up in alcohol free dorms. Housing is way over priced for what you get.
College Sophomore,1,"Furman makes it impossible for you to live off campus because that would mean that the housing department does not get your money. The housing department at Furman is absolutely awful. North Village is the only place on campus where students can drink if they are of age, but since Furman does not want anyone to live off campus, they have resulted to putting JUNIORS IN DORMS. Which is absolutely ridiculous! In that case, a 21 year old could not drink in his room because dorms are alcohol free."
College Sophomore,1,"Furman, although they advertise as a very diverse school, they are not. The only black people at school are athletes and if they aren't, there maybe 5-10 of them, and about 1/3 are gay. The majority of the school about 85% is white rich christian conservatives from the South. Some are racist, some aren't. International students are on campus but they don't have much of a presence. Overall, very white southern and rich."
College Sophomore,1,"If you want to go out to a Furman fraternity party, you must be either rushing a fraternity in the fall, part of the fraternity throwing the party or a sorority girl. Athletes and Independents are generally not welcome at the real fraternities on campus who throw the best parties. But, now that Jason Cassidy is running greek life, parties at Furman are becoming scarce. With threats of some fraternities getting kicked off campus, fraternities are now having fewer parties. Since it is illegal to have a party in North Village and every where else on campus is dry, the only option for future classes is going to be the Barn and Downtown Greenville which can get pricey. If you want to have a good time and drink, do not come to Furman because they are making it harder every year for students to drink."
College Junior,1,Dining hall is not very good and the other places don't serve anything that wonderful and is very overpriced.
College Junior,1,It is disgusting how narrow-minded many people are here.
College Freshman,1,"Not a fun school, extremely overpriced, average academics with a ridiculous coarse load (mostly busy work), has a really small feel. The feeling is that you are at a boarding school, many students call furman a ""glorified high school"". Furman loves to toot their own horn about how great it is but in reality the extremely expensive tuition is paying for the nice looking campus. You basically pay to get to see cool fountains and a pond. This is not a normal college experience."
College Freshman,1,Furman Police will try to get you for anything. Alcohol is regarded as the devil.
College Freshman,1,"The fraternity parties are terrible. They are more awkward than parties in highschool. Alcohol is scarce, drinking games are reserved for members of the fraternity basically, and girls are not attractive. The school makes it institutionally impossible for fraternities to have fun, as they will shut them down if there is a lot of alcohol, noise, people, or fun at the parties. Most parties get capped at about 200 people. This school is not for those seeking to have fun."
College Senior,1,"Furman forces students to live on campus so that they can charge more for tuition. They offer only one set of ""off-campus"" apartments that are less than a 2 minute drive from the campus and are owned by the university. These are expensive so many students opt to not live in them."
College Junior,1,"Non-existent.  This is a horrible aspect of Furman, as it creates a mega-bubble on campus and you don't really leave campus very often, especially if you don't have a car."
College Sophomore,1,Greenville Is Very Deceptive – take time to get off the very nice main street and you will find that Greenville drops off into a very bad all over town very quickly.
College Sophomore,1,"I once read a review of Furman's social scene as a bunch of 8 year olds having slumber party. The dating scene is exactly that, you date or you don't hook up. The girls are okay at best but lack the social skills to make them truly appealing. If your looking for a social scene different than what other schools can offer than sign on up."

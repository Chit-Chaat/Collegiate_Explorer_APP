Sophomore,5,The professors are very helpful. There are many resources given to students to pass their courses. The campus is very beautiful. The staff are very nice. The building are kept clean.
Sophomore,5,I haven’t taken any online classes. This upcoming semester they have resumed in-class classes. As per the reviews the online classes are just like the actual classes where you get involved as much and can ask questions like a traditional classroom.
Sophomore,5,I would be transferring to IIT this upcoming semester. I’m very excited and hope to embark on a journey to achieve the impossible. I intend to become an aerospace engineer and contribute my skills and efforts to the betterment of the future.
Senior,5,"Everyone wants you to succeed.  Good blend of student population. City of Chicago is amazing.  Athletics department cares for you as a person and student as much as an athlete. Constantly adding or renovating buildings. Expensive, but classes are usually smaller especially as you get to the senior year or graduate.  Good hands on labs.  Lots of opportunities for interaction."
Graduate Student,5,"I love the Chicago-Kent Law School at IIT- the career center has been so helpful , responsive, and comprehensive and I couldn't be more appreciative."
Niche User,5,Since Illinois Institute of Technology is in the southside of Chicago the environment around the campus is very vibrant. The surrounding neighborhoods are full of a variety of activities to keep you busy. The vibe on campus is very safe and diverse.
Junior,5,Overall it has been a great experience. Great professors and amazing clubs.  I found that a lot of senor students are willing to help out new students. I actually has some of the best advice from senors and my first year here
Freshman,5,"IIT has great social opportunities, including The Bog where you can play arcade games and bowling. There are also pool tables in other locations where you can relax with friends."
Freshman,5,"I love my teachers and understand what they teach. If a school with spirit is what you're looking for,  this probably isn't the place for you, but it's really easy to get a job on campus and I think the location is very convenient."
Senior,5,Illinois Tech is a great academic school. The curriculum is much more major-related compared to most universities. This is nice because you aren’t wasting money on humanities or social science classes that will never be relevant to your career.
Freshman,5,"Illinois Tech is an awesome place for a child to grow and evolve. The curriculum is lenient which gives opportunities to choose any majors with any minors.
The infrastructure is really very good.
Being a small school, it provides a lot of job and co curricular opportunities.
Public Safety works really hard to make this college a safer place."
Niche User,5,"Its an amazing university with unlimited opportunities in the great city of Chicago!  So much to do, so many options for entertainment.  Transportation is a breeze with two L train lines with direct access to the campus.   New facilities, architectural buildings with updated and modern interiors.   Very diverse student body, lots of groups, clubs and other ways to be involved in student life."
Freshman,5,"Very friendly and patient staff. Beautiful campus. Very diverse body of students, which makes a wonderful experience."
Graduate Student,5,"I am currently enrolled in their Law School program for the upcoming Fall Semester. I am very excited to continue my education at Kent College of Law through the Illinois Institute of Technology. So far, I've only had great experiences through the application process. In addition, the handful of emails I have exchanged with various departments have been quick and professional."
Junior,5,"I love the location of the school. The most attractive attribute is the people working there and students. However, the interior of the buildings should be updated in my opinion."
Junior,5,"I am a Junior at Illinois Tech majoring in Biomedical Engineering. I'm the captain of the Men's Swim Team, President of Water Polo club, and member of Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity. As a student here at Illinois Tech I feel that I am able to manage and do everything I want to do. I enjoy being able swim and do what I love, while still studying something meaningful. I have made a lot of friends and connections here that have made my life and career prospects better in ways I could not have imagined."
Senior,5,Tough school but you really do learn valuable skills and knowledge that is applicable to your major. The overall student life can be improved but then again it’s an engineering school so you can’t expect too much of a social life.
Freshman,5,"The whole experience has been amazing till now. At IIT, it is so diverse that you get to meet people from every corner of the world. Along with this, I got to make so many friends and learn about their culture and the different languages that they use. For the academics, the professors are really nice and they make sure that you get to know about their office hours so that you can meet them concerning any problem. They are also really helpful; they expect you to come to come to them for any kind of help."
Freshman,5,"I like the majors offered, I like the people and the location (the fact that it is near downtown Chicago). I like the fact that the school has high quality education which is hard yes, but it will prepare you perfectly for your future career. I think the food could be a bit better but other than that I am not sure I would have any major complaints to be honest. The price is big of course, but it is a private school. There is a lot of international people which is something I personally like."
Freshman,5,food is great. professor is great. housing is great. a good academic atmosphere. it is safe. campus is famous.
Freshman,5,"According to the academic standing, you may think the school lives, breathes, and eat technology and work, when in reality it is a place of learning and a place to de-stress. It a place where the teachers will not let you go down without a fight."
Niche User,5,"So far it has been great. They are very helpful with any questions you have, there is always someone there to help you.  It does not matter if you call, go in person, or email them, they get back to you as soon as possible."
Freshman,5,The school is fantastic. A little pricey but besides that it is a great option to attend college. They offer lots of scholarship opportunity so you should be sure to check those out.
Sophomore,5,"Illinois Tech is a small and underrated university that stretches every endowment dollar it gets. For a school of its academic caliber, I feel that it is certainly underfunded and undervalued. The professors are aware of the academic prestige of IIT's history, and work diligently to maintain the rigorous level study to turn out the most equipped graduates they can. Due to this commitment and a lack of necessary funding, the university suffers on most every other facet, from facilities and amenities to simple maintenance. As a result, IIT attracts students who value the academic and professional focus of the Chicago-based university, and students who either aren't concerned with the lack of investment in student life, or who are willing to make do with what they are offered."
Sophomore,5,"IIT is a great school for tech majors.  It is very diverse with almost 200 countries represented in its student population.  The campus is very safe, but the areas outside are not as safe.  Professors are great and there is a lot of value in the school  All students receive some type of scholarship."
Freshman,5,"According to my survey, of 500 students in Illinois tech, 455 students (91%) do not like food served here. 250 students participated in my survey are international students. 99% of them do not like food here. Therefore, I have requested to Illinois Tech's Resident Hall Association to change college's meal plan and food."
College Senior,5,"A close nit community of individual who are looking to better themselves, their houses, and the college itself."
College Freshman,5,"I feel safe on campus, there are times where the school will notify us not to go to a certain place around the off campus during certain times due to safety issues. But public safety is always handy and very helpful when needed, they are willing to give rides from the library and from your dorm if you do not feel safe walking some place by yourself. There are the little boxes that you can push if you need emergency help. I believe campus is safe but just like anywhere else is it better if you do not leave late at night by yourself, have a buddy system when traveling off campus."
College Junior,5,"I haven't been here for that long, but so far, I have not heard of any issues with safety and healthy."
College Junior,5,Careers and business is a big thing here. Networking is very important.
College Sophomore,5,There are a large amount of stations at which in a push of a button the school's security is called. This alongside with the many security cameras in place make me feel safe.
College Sophomore,5,As I have stated before I love this school and I am proud to be a student of IIT.
College Sophomore,5,There are alot of services if one is seeking a job and the people that work on those services are very responsive.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school, the teachers are all responsive and worry about any falling grades or help when asked. The classes are very interesting and find myself enjoying any time spent at school."
College Junior,5,The councillors contacted ne often to make sure I submitted the proper documents on time
College Sophomore,5,Professors gives their best with a lot of homework. Test are the key to your better grades and homework is key for better test score.
College Sophomore,5,"I received great scholarship awards at IIT. Out of the fifteen schools I applied to, this one gave me by far the best financial package and allowed me to succeed. One of the main reasons I attended this school, along with the quality of their computer science program."
College Freshman,5,The financial aid process was easy to deal with. There were no hassle at least from my part. I appealed for more money from the school and it did not take long and was easy to handle.
College Freshman,5,IIT is very generous with its financial aid. I've received a full tuition scholarship.
College Freshman,5,I would believe it if someone told me that we have the most diverse campus in the states. I am 1 of 6 white guys on my floor. I am also 1 of 3 americans.
College Freshman,5,Professors preparing you for the real world. You will get a job and a good one at that.
College Freshman,5,IIT is willing to give handouts.
College Freshman,5,"Its Chicago, its up to you whether you find a good option."
College Freshman,5,IT'S CHICAGO! The possibilities are endless! It depends on you to find a good restaurant though ( there are many ).
College Freshman,5,This school is great if you're planning on staying in the Chicago land area. No matter what you choose i'm not sure if I've ever heard of someone making under $45k after they graduate. Its a well known tech/engineering school in Chicago. Its a 99.9% guaranteed success at getting a job in your field after you graduate. Homework after your first year mostly consists of projects. Your first year it mostly consists of small assignments like high school. As long as you show respect towards your professor they're lenient on attendance.
College Freshman,5,"If you have above or around a 30, expect to have some money your way. Also, I hear from the international students that the school offers a lot of money to them too."
College Freshman,5,"Its Chicago, who cares about campus. Get out of your dorms and take either one of TWO train lines directly into Chicago where you can do anything. We also have several buses going through campus, one goes straight into downtown and another goes straight to Navy Pier. We also have a South West going Metra train. As long as youre smart and travel in groups and stay out of the South East side of campus you will be fine. IIT's Public Safety is great, there are emergency buttons all over campus and theyre usually quite easy to get to."
College Freshman,5,"Although being placed on the South Side of Chicago, the projects have been taken down defeating a large portion of the threat towards campus. The rest is taken care of by our private police force armed, ready to serve and protect. There are some bad reviews on the public safety force but it mostly consists of negligible things like 3 guys being scared to walk a half mile to the dorms late at night or something along those lines."
College Freshman,5,"If My frat got kicked off campus I would transfer out of here. The social scene at this school is god awful and the people in the dorms are generally not very social at all, even on weekends. Going Greek can be great for everyone and is not at all stereotypical. I have brothers who go out and get drunk all the time and I have brothers who are the complete opposite yet everyone still fits in. Its a great way to have a much better social community."
College Freshman,5,"Living just 2 L stops from the heart of the city is one of the main reasons I can tolerate this school. Everything about Chicago is awesome as long as you refrain from walking south. If chicago is known for anything it's pizza, wind and gangs; all of which are plentiful. Even today there was a shooting a 2 blocks south off campus. I don't know anyone who has actually dealt with any sort of real danger. Public safety are armed and everywhere. Chicago is awesome."
College Freshman,5,"if you want to go to school and get out with a job, come here. Internships and all that is great, but as long as you don't do excessively bad or major in psych, you will get a job"
College Sophomore,5,"Engineering program can make you or break you. Especially the last two years, or so I've heard. Its wonderful to watch yourself grow and learn at the level of the rest. There are many many smart people and it takes extra effort to keep up when you come from a lower level school, but there's always a reason why one was accepted in the first place. Teachers are always willing to help, and if not there is always free help on campus."
College Junior,5,"The IIT Greek community is one of the greatest hidden gems of this campus.  The Greek community usually has a higher GPA than the total undergraduate GPA in addition to being heavily involved in other student organizations.  IIT greeks don't fall into the stereotypes given to their brothers and sisters at state schools.  IIT Greeks believe in working hard toward making themselves better people and living by their organizations values.  Greeks are also big contributors to local community services projects and their own chapter philanthropy groups.  Furthermore, greeks are passionate about IIT and want to help positively impact the university by regularly meeting with administrators and teaming up with other student organizations.  Internally, the greeks are very supportive of one another and have a great attitude towards the greek community."
College Junior,5,"As a Tech school, IIT students usually are among the top paid students in the recent grad group.  Additionally, the campus hosts a career fair every semester that companies come to looking to hire IIT students for jobs, internships, and Co-Ops."
College Junior,5,"The city of Chicago has everything you could ever want and then some.  IIT's campus is close to 2 CTA stops that allow students to easily travel into the city and explore. We are only 3 miles south of the loop, meaning a run to the lake or a bike ride downtown are also a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon. It's hard to be bored when you have access to so much."
College Junior,5,"IIT's public safety unit is what makes this campus the safest in the city of the Chicago.  They heavily patrol campus on foot, bike, and patrol cars.  They also provide an escort service on and off campus.  Additionally, there are emergency buttons sprinkled around campus for students to push if they ever feel in danger. I have never felt unsafe walking around campus at night and all of the sidewalks are well lit."
College Sophomore,5,"The security of this school is incredible! There's easy access, and many options available. There are incidents, but no security is impenetrable."
College Sophomore,5,"The greek life holds most of the events on campus, and doesn't hold back in extravagance!"
College Junior,5,A sense of security and the knowledge that help is not far away in most situations academically and socially.
College Junior,5,"This is Chicago, you can find any type of food that you desire, I don't know about the student discounts."
Junior,4,"Great for academic experience, professional preparation and building connections.  There are quality classes and degrees offered here, all of which are designed to ensure students obtain the necessary education and experience needed to be successful in the workforce. However, if seeking traditional ""college experience"", probably not the best option."
Junior,4,"After the pandemic hit, I moved to online full time.  Although there have been some challenges holding classes online for both the teachers and the students at first, both sides were eventually able to adapt to the novel experience, which allowed for a quality learning experience for everyone."
Sophomore,4,The online experience was very efficient and helpful. The professors were very helpful and explained everything they were doing.
Junior,4,"What attracted me to IIT was that it is more of a specialized school, so from my view, Architecture and Engineering are their main areas that they prioritize. As an Architecture major, this was really great because they put a lot into the department, ensuring students can have different computer programs and workshop facilities. I also like how the campus is located in the city and can be easily gone into through the green line that travels through campus. Chicago is an important city for studying architecture because there are so many new and old buildings to study from so I feel I have had a huge opportunity to learn from the area. I think one thing the school could improve on is updating certain facilities and technology. I have already seen some improvements this past year so I think IIT is heading in the right direction."
Junior,4,"Because of COVID, we all had to transition to online learning. At first, I was overwhelmed because I imagined this past semester being one where I would use the workshop and be building a lot of models, but as we transitioned, I realized that this experience would be helpful because computer modeling and creating digital drawings was an area of my major that I was the least experienced in so I would get a lot of practice from this. I thought my professors helped us throughout it out. My studio professor used video chatting and sharing screens of our work to constructively analyze our work and give direct feedback. The only downside with meeting virtually in class with our professors was the ability of other students to hear in on our work. It helped to see what other students were doing, but it also made the reviews more stressful."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Illinois Institute of Technology has been a fairly good one. They've been reasonable and accommodating, and I've been enjoying my time there. I've been able to explore and branch out more than I thought possible in large part due to the many opportunities presented at IIT and the surrounding Chicago area. Overall, IIT is a very good school; admittedly it wasn't my first choice of school, but it turned out to be my best choice in the long run."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, it is a pretty good school for the money. After scholarships and grants, it would've costed me basically the same if I went to any Georgia School. The faculty are open to talk to, and the academic quality it good. Only thing that could use a little more work are the food options and dorms, but I know IIT is at least working on expanding dorms."
Junior,4,"This was my first choice school and I'm still so glad I came here! The professors are knowledgeable and experienced, the students are always willing to help out, and everyone else is always there for you. The area around the campus can be a little unsafe sometimes but the school itself is a safe place to be, tuition can be high but they provide financial assistance, and the job placement and opportunities are amazing!"
Junior,4,"Usually online classes are on par with the ones taken in person – the coursework is flexible enough to be taken either on campus or online, the professors and/or their TAs are easy to reach, and they take the proper steps to encourage students to interact with one another even from the confines of their homes."
Junior,4,My experience is kinda unique. The move to online classes was rough for me. I luckily have very supportive professors as well as a good Resource Center on campus.
Senior,4,"This school is not as expensive as it seems at face value, so for many students this school may be a better option than a different local public college. It is primarily an engineering school and I wouldn't attend if you want to major in mathematics, music/arts, and so on. There are better math programs and the courses here seem to be mostly complementary to other majors. The same may be true of other majors outside engineering, computer science, and so on."
Freshman,4,"I've only been at this school for a year and I can already tell you that the dorms are SMALL. Not only that the food is mediocre and the only parties happening are at frats in their basements. But, I've met some friends and the professors are proactive with their students because of the small student to teacher ratio. Of course, I can't speak on all teachers, but some are good and others are better left with their degrees and nothing more. The sports here are small compared to other schools, there aren't mnay options for them, but social clubs and events are in surplus, so there's always a give and take opportunity happening here."
Junior,4,"IIT is a good university if you are interested in engineering. The faculty is excellent, very helpful. The main campus is small compared to other universities but it helps create a sense of family between the students."
Freshman,4,"Illinois Tech is a great school dedicated to allowing students to pursue their careers via hard work and plenty of fun. The advisors and teachers are great people who will try what they can to help you. The only limiting factor would be yourself in this situation. There are many activities and facilities to quench your need for extra learning or excitement, my personal favorites being the gaming center and the Bog"
Junior,4,It is a great place to study. It is tough but the education is amazing and you can easily find jobs with a degree from here.
Sophomore,4,"Illinois Institute of Technology offers a great educational program. This school will set you up with the tools needed to succeed after graduation. However, this school is not very social nor is there a large party culture. This is a school that one goes to in order to get stuff done."
Graduate Student,4,University is very diverse. A lot of activities and events happen every week. A lot of resources available.
Niche User,4,Im excited to apply for illinois institute of technology. It has a variety of majors and lovely classrooms. It has a promising atmosphere and nice dorms. Space is always a problem but cant be solved.
Senior,4,"I am pursuing a Co-Terminal degree at IIT for a Masters in Aerospace and Mechanical engineering and a bachelor's degree in Aerospace engineering.  I really enjoy the things that I learn at IIT.  The education that I receive here will actually help me in the real world.  I have already been using the advanced engineering knowledge that I learned at my job with the Air Force. 

However, campus life is far below par. It seems as though IIT just throws money at problems without coming up with a feasible solution that will actually work. For example, there is a heavily used sidewalk on campus, that floods and stays flooded for 3 days after it rains.  We have to choose to either ruin our shoes or walk in the street. 

Overall I think my education at IIT is valuable to have.  I know that I will not have trouble finding a job when I graduate and I am excited to start my career."
Freshman,4,"Illinois Institute of Tech is a good school for anyone looking to enter into a STEM or architecture related field. It has an extraordinary amount of international students which means you can make friends and learn about things you otherwise never would. Also, most all the professors I've had so far have cared deeply about their students academic wellbeing and are willing to meet with you when they have the time if you need help in class. This means you are able to catch up in classes you thought you had no hope of passing which truly applied to me this semester when my calculus professor helped me pull myself out of a hole I had gotten myself in gradewise by meeting with me to practice the material during lunchtime."
Freshman,4,The academics are excellent and many courses are available. The campus is easy to navigate. There's lots of different student organizations and activities you can get involved with and meet great people.
Graduate Student,4,"A diverse student body, with a lot of foreigner students and more than a few foreign-born professors. The area isn't the safest but it is easy to reach through Metra or CTA which makes the location still ideal. Academics are about as you can expect: high work means you do well. Not easy As. Biology equipment actually good and there is a feeling that the department is growing."
Junior,4,"PROS: My first semester as a transfer student at IIT was very good. I learned a lot, I met great people, and I enjoyed living in one of the best cities in the world. The professors are caring, well-informed, and professional. Everything you need can be found on campus or within a mile from campus. The red line and green line CTA trains are super close by campus. 

CONS: There is a lack of diversity at the school; there are a lot of asian and white students and not a lot of hispanic and black students on campus. Many students are weird and nerdy. The greek life is not that good. The school is expensive. The area immediately around campus has high levels of crime."
Junior,4,IIT has been an amazing experience for me. It's my first semester there and already I can't have all of it. There are plenty of research and career opportunities from professors. All the professors are willing to help. There are career fairs which brings along nation's best companies on campus to seek talent from IIT.
Alum,4,"IIT is a state of the art school. It is a hidden gem in the southside of the city. The neighbor could be a bit suspicious at times, but I never felt unsafe. I was able to get a great education and be active on campus. There are great achievements coming for the TECH arena that have been birthed from IIT. Glad to be part of the IIT family."
Sophomore,4,"Illinois Tech has very high standards for their undergraduate programs making the education very challenging but worth the hard work you put into it.  There is very little student life compared to other schools.  Also, IIT has very good research involvement for their students giving them a step above other undergraduates at other universities."
Freshman,4,What I like most about this university is how diverse it is. This school really embraces all of our identity differences and helps us relate to one another. The academics and amazing as well as they have really committed student that are very willing to fully dive into a topic/subject. Overall experience has been great because of the supportive staff  that are flexible to the students .
Junior,4,The university has allowed me to further my growth in the field of aerospace engineering by giving me access to the Boeing branch located in Chicago. I was able to obtain an internship with Boeing thanks to my involvement in the aerospace club in my university.
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoy the diverse interactions with students, visitors and faculty. Everyone is here to pursue lofty goals and it's interesting to see what the difference in the goals are across the different kinds of people here from many different places."
Alum,4,"Great school for STEM degrees in the South Side of Chicago.  Not much of a traditional college social scene, but plenty of on campus organizations and events."
Freshman,4,"Illinois thus far has been very generous to me in regards to helping me pay through the tuition. Though there have been some rough areas in applying for more aid and such, overall it is manageable. I would like, however, for the school to take a greater look at applicant's merit and reward more aid for things such as early STEM involvement  on top of just merit aid"
Junior,4,"Perfect size for a school, lots of opportunities for research and experience, small class sizes for 1 on 1 time with professors and a challenging and rewarding environment."
Freshman,4,"The school is small and has a community feel. Most professors are really good and the campus is easily navigable. Having Chicago right at your fingertips is another huge perk. However, social life at IIT can be hard to find/get into, and the food and dorms (MSV in particular) are average and sometimes downright poor."
Graduate Student,4,"I attend the Chicago-Kent College of Law at the Illinois Institute of Technology. Nice, modern facility located downtown Chicago in a safer area near I-94. Staff is exceptional and very driven to ensure that their students are learning and intrigued. Many clubs and organizations available to join. Students are not too competitive, and are willing to work together and support each other. High tuition cost."
Freshman,4,"We’re currently in the middle of figuring out food contracts, I’d like to see that change. Overall the education is very good, but it lacks in certain clubs like the arts, and is very very tech based which in cases can be a bad thing. While there is a lot of commuter students, they can’t attend a lot of events because they commute, and that’s made some of my friends feel left out."
Graduate Student,4,"Facilities are good. Some professors really care about students. Funding seems to have taken a hit these days, so fees is being increased every now and then. Safety in the areas adjoining the university is a concern."
Sophomore,4,"I like the diverse studies the school has to offer. The campus is a good size and easy to navigate. The facilities and services offered are very well kept. However, the surrounding area tends to be unsafe especially at night for students who are walking alone."
Senior,4,I like the fact that the teachers actually care about their students; as well as the fact that the class are usually small so you are able to communicate with your professor more than at other universities
Senior,4,"The work can be difficult, but there are many systems in place to help. The Academic Resource center, office hours, and a good work ethic should help. As with any school, there are good professors and not so good professors. The not so good professors always understand what they are teaching very well, but may not be the best at teaching it; this usually just requires a little more effort of the part of the student. The good teachers are very good.  Depending on how much you are willing to pay the options for housing range from fine to very nice. The campus is very diverse with students from all around the world. Located in Chicago, it is near an area that could be thought of as dangerous, but there is also a police station a block away from the school and roaming campus security. Given that the school is in Chicago, it also provides an opportunity to explore the many restaurants, museums, parks, and other attractions of the area; they're just a train or bus ride away."
Junior,4,I've been at this school for almost 3 years now. The scholarship awarded to me was great. I was drawn to IIT because of the program I was interested in: Information Technology. The courses I have taken really encourage practical and hands on experience. There's so much diversity as the school represents over 100 countries.
Freshman,4,"IIT is a really good school, filled with plenty of dedicated professors and counselors.  Everyone seems to be concerned with the students' futures."
Senior,4,IIT is a great school with amazing diversity. It's smaller than most universities and really wants to graduate their students. They provide a lot of ways to help students. There are a lot of ways to be involved on campus.
Alum,4,Great school to attend especially if you are interested in studying engineering or computer science. Classes are small and you are able to get the attention you deserve from professors. The professors have high expectations so be prepared to work hard
Alum,4,"Illinois Institute of Technology offers a great selection of resources for students and the teachers all have an evident great passion for teaching! Illinois Institute of Technology also holds an phenomenal career fair that opens up many doors for students of all majors along with having many resources and events that get you well prepared to present yourself at the career fair. At Illinois Institute of Technology, there is also the ARC resource center that almost always has passionate tutors on hand to help you with just about any academic subject. The school hosts a great number of campus-wide events that help you bond with and meet new students as well as having very welcoming Greek Life. The only downside I can think of is that getting an on-campus job is exceedingly difficult."
Niche User,4,"The university is great and it has impressive buildings. In terms of academics it is not easy if you are a party person but if you work hard and have a little nerdy in you, you will find it very impressive and never regret choosing IIT."
Alum,4,"I just graduated from illinois institute of technology with major in information technology and management. The past 4 years I spent in this school were the best of my life. Learned a lot of things, met a lot of nice people. Everything was great except the food in the center court wasn't that good. Overall i had great experience with very good professors"
Freshman,4,"I love the professors and the classes you are able to take! The community of people at the school are wonderful people to be around, but more importantly, the education you get from this school is fantastic. The only downside is that the campus is a little old compared to the time we live in right now. Overall, an amazing university."
College Student,4,Illinois Tech has dedicated resources for looking into matter like these. It's pretty good on safety.
College Student,4,Overall experience at Illinois Tech has been great.
College Student,4,If you're really interested in mixed cultures then Illinois Tech on campus facilities are one of the best places to stay.
College Student,4,Illinois Tech Greek Life is one of the most known things in and around campus and its awesome.
College Student,4,"The coaches, the staff, the resources all are pretty good at their work."
College Student,4,"It's a great school for your career. You can ask for any resources available, and the staff is equally helpful. You can always get research interests in this school and lot of career opportunities as well."
College Senior,4,The athletic community is amazing but the overall vibe from the school towards athletics is that yeah it exist and that's furthest the care seems to extend.
College Sophomore,4,Health people are very kind and helpful
College Sophomore,4,The SCHOOL has been around for a very long time and has connections with many different law firms and companies that help to get students hired right out of Law school.
College Sophomore,4,So far I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge.
College Junior,4,"There is much diversity. Sometimes you might find some non-accepting people, but that is very rare."
College Junior,4,"If you don't want anything to do with it, you don't have to, but if you do it's there. No real peer pressure when you don't want to drink, you just have to say NO."
Recent Alumnus,4,they are nice people that know about the programs
Sophomore,2,"My experience at IIT has been poor so far. Despite being relatively social and spending a couple months to find a solid group of friends, I have nearly nothing to show for it. Most of the people here are shallow, far too nerdy/quiet to relate to, or completely and utterly fake. Most resemble the children from a suburban middle school I went to, which means petty and underhanded beef is the norm. I can't speak much on athletes, but the gym is quite small and shoved in the corner, and often it takes time to use the real equipment. The frats here are honestly small and sad, with some of the more tolerable frats being completely dry. Your RA is luck of the draw. I had a good one in my first year, and hope to have the same luck this coming semester. Professors are generally poor and most of the learning is teaching yourself online. One of my professors was a complete psycho, and HALF the class got the dean to intervene for the sake of our grades. This place has drained me."
Sophomore,2,"This coming semester will be online, but from the looks of it teaching myself using resources such as Khan Academy or Chegg will be a must."
Sophomore,2,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic Illinois Institute of Technology has taken to online instruction until further notice. I've experienced their online instruction first-hand, and it is not the best. IIT was clearly ill-prepared to transition to a strictly online platform and it really shows. It honestly makes me miss classroom instruction a lot. The online instruction is serviceable at best, but it is not something that can satisfactorily replace classroom instruction."
Freshman,2,"Didn’t learn much and didn’t have to attend every class to pass. Wouldn’t recommend to others, seemed like a waste of money."
Junior,2,"Just about everyone in administration has handled this poorly. Not entirely sure it is their fault, but it still looks very bad on them. Housing prices and tuition went up, moving out students going home was mismanaged, and any updates they gave us that seemed to benefit us (especially financially) were very quickly walked back in a subsequent email. There are so many things I love at this school, and they have provided me with good support and some financial aid, however at a time like this it is not enough. They were providing just enough, and are still providing exactly that much even with a shelter in place order/quarantine during the most serious global pandemic to have really ever happened."
Freshman,2,"I like the course rigor and challenging classes available, however, the atmosphere and social community is nonexistent and makes it difficult for me to stay motivated."
Niche User,2,"I didn't have a pleasant experience at my time at IIT, the dorms were awful, and so where my hall-mates. There was a lot of bullying and racism in the dorms, and I didn't always feel safe in the neighborhood. I was lucky to make a few good friends, and have an excellent roommate my second semester. I joined the Esports as their treasurer, so I cannot complain about their extracurricular activities, The professors on the other hand,  did not teach well. Many students in classes, including myself never understood what was going on, and ended up not doing too well and every test. The average score on any test was usually a C."
Niche User,2,I was robbed on campus and the security on campus was not helpful in any real manner. I ended up transferring colleges. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into if you decide to go there
College Sophomore,2,"Since the school is surrounded by a horrible and dangerous neighborhood I wouldn't spend late nights on campus. During the early morning and midday it is usually pretty safe, but at night I wouldn't be caught on campus.There are security and police officers working at the school throughout the day, so that makes the campus fill a little more safe."
College Sophomore,2,I haven't been involved in greek life at all. It seems to be an unnecessary part of college life from my perspective.
College Sophomore,2,"The main focus of this school is to teach future biologist, engineers, and computer scientist, etc. The focus is not on athletics, although it does help raise school spirit. In the classroom is where our hawks soar, not on the soccer or football field."
College Junior,2,I don't participate in the sporting events and neither are the events adequately promoted so I don't know much about the athletics program.
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't a ton of off campus dining nearby, unless you want to go to Chinatown or the city for dining. I wish there were more locations in Bronzeville to dine."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much talk of parties except at the Pi Kapp's frat house.
College Freshman,2,"The food doesn't always look fresh, portions are very small, needs more variety"
College Freshman,2,"There are a decent number of sports teams. From what I've seen, many people in the school do not care about sports or show any spirit for them. I myself do not care about the sports."
College Freshman,2,We have greek football and a bunch of other sports that probably exist.
College Freshman,2,"the housing sucks and is too expensive. The rules in the resident halls are pretty bogus. It was like 30 degrees today, had my window open all day, and my room is still too damn hot. they force you to spend way to much on a food contract and its easily twice as expensive as it should be. Cheap, crappy room + cheapest food is about $10k a year."
College Sophomore,2,Not a part school. Can be if you look for it.
College Sophomore,2,There are very few benefits to living off campus just as there are on campus. Both are bad choices.
College Junior,2,It is a dangerous neighborhood
College Junior,2,I didn't even know we had a gym
College Student,2,"Getting a bid at a frat here is the easiest thing on campus. Literally anyone, and i mean anyone, can get into a fraternity here. The frats and sororities throw the lamest parties imaginable, with most of them acting as if it was middle school again, with the guys in one circle talking, and maybe the four girls that showed up in another circle."
College Student,2,Frats and sororities are a joke.
College Student,2,"There is literally no school spirit. No one attends any of the athletic events. Our Basketball team, which is apparently one of our biggest sports, lost almost every single game against even the most mediocre schools. I only went to two games and both times there was maybe 35 people in the stands. I dont even know how our soccer and baseball teams did."
College Sophomore,2,"As the social life is pretty dull, so it the dating scene. There is also a general attitude about school that ""grades trumps everything else""  so people tend to put relationships on the back burner"
College Sophomore,2,"Winters are ridiculously cold and Summer's are unbelievably hot. But its Chicago, what do you expect?"
College Sophomore,2,I feel the school tries to create the athletics at our school because the administrators believe all universities must have sports. I personally think IIT doesn't need athletics and that money could just go to providing more facilities for students to use.
College Sophomore,2,"This is one of the few areas in which IIT is lacking. Hardly anyone shows up to games or even talks about them besides the athletes themselves. Once, they even offered free food to anyone who came to try and entice people. 

The gym is well-stocked with equipment, but it is in a concrete room on the bottom floor, which makes it pretty dreary. The basketball and badminton courts are nice though."
College Freshman,2,"the parties hosted in the school ""bar"" are major fails because hardly no one shows up, but there have been a few ones around"
College Sophomore,2,"The place around campus are not very good. I think people are going to get tired of eating at dining hall too. However, the campus is not far from Chicago downtown, if you have time that will be a good option."
College Freshman,2,"It's Chicago weather so it's sort of bipolar. Some days it's hot and other days, it's cold. It gets really cold in the winter and it gets really hot in the summer. It's really important to always have a winter jacket handy."
Recent Alumnus,2,The athletic program is pretty decent however if you are looking for a Big Ten experience this is not for you
College Sophomore,2,Chicago has horrible weather. It is always changing and makes it hard to prepare for the weather.
College Freshman,2,"There are plenty of on campus parking lots, however the cost of a parking permit is insane! But since both the green line and red line trains are on campus as well, a car is not entirely necessary to get around the city."
College Freshman,2,"Very little drinking and very little drug use. Some frats occasionally smoke but its almost ; like everybody goes through these phases. Again, we are just talking about pot in these phases but still public safety can be strict about it. Although we do have a bar on campus and they did card most people (not me but I knew the bartenders). Still the bar was really for enjoying a beer with your friends and not for getting trashed."
College Sophomore,2,Not too many good places to eat on campus that are even open throughout the day.  Need to improve quality of 10-West as well as the Commons food.
College Junior,2,"I would love to give this school a higher grade, but the professor's come from their field of work, with a bad understanding of how classes are supposed to be taught, especially at a tech school."
College Senior,2,They should allow students to use the underground tunnel that starts at Stuart Building and connects to other buildings for extreme weather cases.
College Senior,2,"Very expensive, charging much more than what it's worth."
Senior,1,"Choosing IIT was the single worst decision of my life.  They bring students in by offering huge scholarships, but the school is rated as having the 5th unhappiest student body in the country and it's because they students are treated like garbage once we are here.  The food is worse than what my high school had, the dishes aren't always clean, and many of the dorm halls have cockroaches or had to be closed due to mold.  It is an institute of technology, and yet what little technology we have is 10 years old and often broken.  The school made cutbacks and the first people it hired were the health and wellness staff, specifically the therapists and counselors, so if you wanted to see someone it was a 3 month wait.  I could go on but in short there are professors that care, but many of them have left because the administration does not care about our quality of life once they have our money."
Junior,1,"Not a lot of culture on campus aside from the architecture. Low quality teaching you could get anywhere else just more expensive. Research opportunities are mostly overblown for advertising and they go to the architecture students. Sort of depressing student body elbow deep in studying alone. It's hard to make and keep study groups. Really hit or miss on admin. A few are outstanding while others don't deserve their paycheck. Ironically, OTS is really bad."
Senior,1,"Last semester at IIT before graduation and I can safely say I'm ready to put this place behind me. The surrounding city is really quite nice, so that is a decent respite from IIT campus life. IT and Security departments both have issues with not being able to problem-solve or remain professional. I've not met so many depressed people in the same room or witnessed this general deflated attitude on a college campus. Most people will tell you that you will become accustomed to being treated poorly by staff and professors, and that they had the same experience and stayed out of desperation. The hardest pill to swallow was the low standard of teaching by 3/5 of my professors (i.e., speaking abnormally quietly, forgetting to give or grade homework, 3-4 week delays in receiving grades). I used to be shocked at the low teaching quality and now I expect it so as not to be constantly disappointed. Good luck."
Freshman,1,"This School absolutely sucks... it wouldn't be that bad if you could just live on the north side and commute BUT NO they make you live on campus for ""social reasons"" when in reality no one is social at all. This place is smaller than my high school and they only spend money on new public safety cars EVERY YEAR... The campus is gross. Just go to U of I instead"
Niche User,1,"Poor facilities, mediocre faculty, terrible, high-crime area, mediocre academics at best. Really, really not a good choice. Don't bother applying here -- and if you do get stuck here, plan on transferring ASAP to help your sanity."
Junior,1,"For its massive tuition bill, Illinois Tech fails to deliver anything close to what $60,000 per year would be worth. The university is located in the south side of Chicago (translation: the hood), and the campus buildings fit in with the surrounding area. We hear reports of students getting mugged/robbed every week -- and I doubt every instance of this happening is reported. Academics are mediocre overall -- there are a few professors that make the university bearable while you work on your applications to transfer to a better school."
Alum,1,"I hated my experience at this school.  I hated the type of students that went there, the sub-par professors that could care less about their students, and some of the staff was mean.  It was bad."
College Senior,1,Horrible price for horrible living conditions
College Senior,1,"They do not offer Greek Life for all students such as Black American fraternities and sororities. They are not interested in having any Black fraternities or sororities on the campus of Illinois Institute of Technology either and that is because they are not interested in increasing the Black American population on this campus, which only makes up less than 1% of the total student population (not including Africans or Caribbeans)."
College Junior,1,"It's a handful of minorities and you are reminded of it unless you speak and act like the majority and even then you are the accepted ""minority"". You will be reminded that you are a minority."
College Junior,1,Pay a lot of money to teach yourself and get tested on things you were expected to learn on your own and not covered in the classroom. I mean just utter garbage.
College Junior,1,I've had to consistently teach myself and get tested on things I was never taught but expected to learn on my own now tell me is that the reason you pay these people a large of of money for? GARBAGE!!!! They are predominantly focused on giving you a ton of work to do and getting through a large amount of poorly explained topics. Putting out students that have shown they can teach themselves and handle a lot of work with little guidance however that sounds like a job and not a university. That sounds like something you get paid for and not what you pay for -_-.
College Freshman,1,I was in danger of getting jumped once and I called to get escorted back to campus (I was literally 3 blocks off campus) and they refused to pick me up. They suggested I call the police instead and wait for them.
College Freshman,1,"At IIT you can't use the 1-10 scale for girls, you have to add a 3 point curve to get the average somewhere acceptable. I have legitimately never seen any girl higher than an 8. There are a lot of hot Brazilians but they are all speaking Portuguese and have boyfriends. If you want to meet girls, take some good photos of yourself and make a tinder account. Or make friends with someone at Loyola because all the girls seem to hide up there."
College Freshman,1,"Plain and simple, the school doesn't give a f*** about anyone without a diploma."
College Sophomore,1,"I will not defend this horrid excuse for food, fairness, nor safety. The food is overpriced, poor quality, mandatory for dormers. The quality decreases while the prices skyrocket each year."
College Junior,1,I don't know anyone on campus. I go out to the northside of the city
College Student,1,"This winter in Chicago lasted 6 months. 6 Months!! Apparently it was the worst winter in years. The wind hurts your face when you walk to class, and although the University does its best to keep snow and sleet off the sidewalks, it will always be a problem."
College Sophomore,1,The dorms and on campus housing have little to no night life. If you desire for entertainment you should try to explore the city with friends.
College Sophomore,1,Sodexo controls everything at IIT. They do an okay job listening to students but ultimately are out to make money for themselves.
College Student,1,There are little to no athletics offered by the Illinois Institute of Technology
College Freshman,1,"Greek life rarely holds large parties but prefers mixers for themselves and another Frat or Sorority. I am not saying that there are the stereotypical frat guys and sororitutes as Greek life is kind of unnoticeable, but those who are Greek are usually hanging out with their own friends."
College Freshman,1,"Being a Tech school, sports are not a huge thing. We have a few teams on campus but events aren't very popular as most students are international and only here for a year."
College Freshman,1,There are some activities that are started by students but most of the time noone shows up. A few parties at the frats but you have to be invited to get in. Not a good school if all you care about is have fun
College Senior,1,"As a graduate student majoring in electrical engineering I have been offered NOTHING from school or the department and I am therefore wasting a large portion of valuable study and research time on finding alternative sources of funding/loans and jobs most of which are unsuccessful and financial concern has been a big distraction to my studies. There have even been cases where I have run short on basic living expenses. I've even known PhD students in our department who have personally funded their own living expenses AND TUITION while doing research for the department at the same time! I have no time for recreation or social life because I am constantly busy seeking alternative resources to finance my tuition and living expenses which has also been a big barrier to my studies since I have difficulty focusing on school due to my financial burdens. I do NOT recommend attending this school to anyone and I have thought of and searched for other schools to transfer to but unfortunately due to the amount of credit hours passed at this school, all of my credit hours wouldn't have been transferred and it was too late so I decided to stay at IIT for now until completion of M.Sc."
College Junior,1,"Truly Speaking, I am the Student who has not experience the night life because there is no time to go for the night life. Even on the weekends i am not free so i have no experience of night life. But according to my Friends review its best. But i really not experience it yet."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Your Traditional Frats... in a Bad Way. The Greeks live in their own housing on campus which is the same as the rest of the affordable housing, only with nice living rooms. Getting in is not extremely difficult either. The members do not seem to develop superiority complexes from joining, usually anyway. They are not very loud or exciting Greeks. Rarely do they hold parties and those parties are usually ice cream social events. They do not hold much importance on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Greeks Where? There are probably 5 fraternities and only 2 sororities and they live in the quad. Besides Rush week when they have a lot of free food and games the Greeks don't really do much, or at least nothing that I've seen. They have their parties, but it's a tech school so the parties aren't that great."
College Freshman,1,International Central – There are mostly international students on campus. Most of the students you see on a regular basis are Asian. The majority for the school diversity statistics is white though and I find that hard to believe considering the only white people I see are in the very few fraternities and sororities on campus or play sports. Most of the ethnic groups stick together and don't talk too much outside of their race so diversity isn't very plentiful.
College Freshman,1,"Nightlife doesnt exist, even for those who are of age or to those who are just looking to have a good time. This is possibly because of the heavy course loads that everyone would rather end up studying than go out and have some fun"
College Freshman,1,"The House of Smoke and Mirrors – The office of housing and residential services blows a lot of smoke, toots their own flute and flexes their own botox inflated muscle in order to inflate their own egos, often RAs are an infamous power trip, especially when we have had an entire hall infested with mold and harmful chemicals and alcohol poisoning and the use of hard core drugs is swept under the rug. More concerned ""liability"" then resident safety and service."
College Freshman,1,"The dating scene here is fairly miserable, all the ""good dates"" decide to date off campus typically. That being said, there is an abundance of pretentious, over-rated and over-sexed individuals, male and female."
College Freshman,1,"Off-campus at IIT means typically inner city Chicagoans who were accepted, but can't afford to pay for housing - if you don't want to interact with the campus AT ALL then off campus is the way to go, but no, we won't help you"
College Freshman,1,"everything else is a glorious, expensive ways of four+ years of your life"
College Freshman,1,"I Wouldn't Choose It, Hence Why I'm Transferring – I was going to handle the deplorable social atmosphere and focus on my academics, however, I found my degree program to be not much more than a scam.
The problem is between the students and the administrators.  Students who think they have actually accomplished something with a high school diploma and an acceptance letter to IIT (which, with us accepting 60+% of applicants, coming from your trusty FWS student who works in the admissions office, is NOT at all impressive), think they know it all, and are not willing to learn, and administrators willing to oblige their egos in an attempt to keep bleeding money out of their parents' coffers, the ""diversity"" factor only looks good on paper."
College Freshman,1,We Are a School of Divisions – ...Greek life is one of the divisions I find most annoying. They don't contribute much to the campus other than an unnessacary air of smugness
College Freshman,1,"We Are a Tech School – ...that does not mean the school officials know anything about computers, or that technical support does either/will answer any complaint before the next upgrade comes out

Computers aren't particularly accessible, they assume you have your own..."
College Senior,1,They give transfer students next to nothing and the financial aid bursar's office are notoriously difficult to deal with.
College Junior,1,"Students at IIT could care less about athletics at this school. I wish this school had a real track, basketball or football team but it doesn't. Most of the teams are mediocre and even when we have a good team, still no one cares because the rest are so bad. Even the athletes act like sports at IIT is just a joke, I could never play on a team like this.."
College Freshman,1,"Social Life Sucks Here – Though this is a small campus, you would barely know the people here. It is like people are afraid to talk to others. A large majority of the students here are international students. The sports suck here, they don't even have basketball, football, softball, or a suitable track team. The athletes don't take it seriously either. The student center, also known as the BOG, sucks, it's really small and there really isn't anyqthinqg qto do other than play video games. If u want to have fun, you have to pay money. As a matter of fact, there is a charge for everything here, things you wouldn't imagine. The only plus here are the connections you get as far as graduating and finding jobs. The Greek system here is very weak. I even think some of these frats and sororities are made up. They aren't reLy taken seriously. You have to make your own fun which can be very difficult since most of the fun in Chicago closes at certain times. The only positive is that u get U passes to travel arou d Chicago and visit the fun at other schools."

Sophomore,5,"I love that Corban is so diverse and truly cares about each student that is on their campus. I was actually about to attend a different college, but changed my mind two months before the fall term at Corban started. They were so welcoming and allowed me to be able to come, even though it was very late and I missed the deadlines.  The professors are so caring and kind. It is a highly educational University and there is nothing I would change about it."
Niche User,5,"Corban has an amazing campus in the woods. They even have a hammock club because they have a grove of trees in the center, perfect for hammock's. They have a little chapel and it makes me feel like I'm at Christian Camp, so I feel very safe. They could improve some of the older buildings. It used to be a tuberculosis hospital a long time ago."
Sophomore,5,"Corban isn't perfect, but no college is. You can get an education at any college around the world and get the same old degree no matter what, but Corban University provides you with the personal relationships and connections that will actually matter to you in the long run. The students, professors, and staff here are one-of-a-kind and the most genuine people you will ever meet, and you can feel the difference right when you step foot on the campus."
Sophomore,5,I love Corban University! It's a great school with wonderful people. I have enjoyed attending school and learning more about Salem's community. The classes are great and I am enjoying everything I am learning. The campus life is amazing and I would recommend students to live on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely adore the environment. I love the faculty, I love the staff, I love the atmosphere and other students. It seems as though everyone there truly wants to be, they have a want to grow academically and spiritually. Sometimes the sports teams seem disconnected, but I see the coaches really working hard to take apart that stigma and make our campus more familial."
Senior,5,I visited the campus and found the atmosphere to be extremely welcoming and inviting. All of the individuals that I met there were extremely kind and positive.
Niche User,5,My experience at Corban university was excellent and warm. the staff there and their guides were so cheerful and ready to answer any questions. the atmosphere was peaceful and potential was felt from every student.
Freshman,5,"Corban University is by far the best school I could imagine for being a Christian scholar. So far being here has been more than I could have imagined in classes, athletics, and even building friendships. The personal involvement the professors have in your success builds a solid foundation for each and every students future. I feel like I really belong in this university due to the nature of all of the students who are welcoming, professors who are welcoming, and even coaches being welcoming."
Freshman,5,"The environment of the campus is peaceful and calm. The faculty are extremely welcoming and helpful with any questions anyone has about entering college. The campus is absolutely beautiful and very in tune with nature, they have clubs and activities for everyone, and with all the options given, people can even find a new hobby. Overall Corban University is amazing."
Niche User,5,I have looked at Corban University since my freshman year of high school. I have visited the campus twice and absolutely love it. It seems like a close tight-knit campus and the people all seem generally happy to be there. The school has an amazing criminology department. I am proud to have been accepted there for the fall of 2019.
Freshman,5,"This is the second semester of my freshman year, so far Corban has a very homely feel. I know everyone name and its easy to connect with others"
Freshman,5,"The motto for Corban to educate students to make a difference in the world for Jesus Christ holds true. The atmosphere is welcoming and faith-filled. The staff gets to know you personally and works to see you succeed, even if that means going out of their way to help you or taking the time to pray for you."
Freshman,5,"Coming from overseas, I didn't know what to expect. American culture is different, and I needed a place to call home. Corban has been that home, and it's amazing."
Sophomore,5,"Corban is truly a second home to me. The community is so warm and welcoming. Some of the facilities need upgrading, but I know that it is already in the works, and will be done relatively soon."
Niche User,5,A great school for christians that want to have a stronger connection to god and friends at the same time
Freshman,5,"Corban is perfect for anyone wanting to grow in their faith. It's small, which is perfect for me because I come from a very small town and I will get one on one time with my teachers"
Junior,5,"Corban is an amazing experience! As soon as I walked on campus I knew that it was my home, not because of the Gorgeous  trees or awesome programs, but because of the community. It's a big family of believers who love and support each other through all the ups and downs of  college life. I'm so glad I chose Corban!"
Senior,5,"I have loved Corban. It is a great school with great professors. The best thing about the school is the people. It is a positive community that supports you every day. Corban has a pretty campus that provides beautiful sunsets in the evenings too. 

Athletic events are really fun too. Because Corban has a small student body with about 1,000 students, you know everyone and being able to support the athletes is like supporting all of your friends. People are genuinely nice here and the staff members are very supportive of all people. 

Tuition is expensive, but there are scholarships out there to help you with the cost."
Junior,5,"Corban is an outstanding university. It is full of the best prophesors in this country and some are even top ranking in the world for their field of work. There are many different focuses at Corban as well as sports and extra curricular activities. This university also has some of the best students anywhere around. Corban has been talked about as the school you attend to find a wife or husband. Well, That statement isn't exactly correct, but it isn't exactly wrong either. Many of my close friends have ended up married and I am well on my way to asking the question! It's just not time yet. So, Corban is great! And the people are the best! "
College Freshman,5,"FYI, no such thing as 'sexual orientation' on campus here! You are what God made you, and you can't change that."
College Freshman,5,"They never have problems with alcohol - they just make sure everybody knows that it's not allowed on campus, and off campus it's allowed only if you are of legal age. And people respect that here."
College Freshman,5,"Class sizes are small. Professors are great. Workload - there's a lot of reading, but this is college, dude!"
College Freshman,5,"Most Corban students find a job quickly after they get their degree. All students have to do community service and normally they have to have a lot of internship hours as well, which helps build their resume and skill while in college so that they are prepared afterward."
College Freshman,5,Corban is rated 4th in the nation by Niche for campus safety - need I say more???
College Freshman,5,This school is awesome. The community is the best you will find anywhere - anybody here is willing to immediately drop what they are doing to pray for you if you ask them to. The professors are truly great at what they do - Corban hires only the best!
College Senior,5,I am an online student
College Senior,5,I am an online student have been very successful with course work with the dedication from instructors.
College Senior,5,I have been able to learn a lot at this school. My experience has been one that I can share with others who need to further education. The instructors are every helpful and offer assistance and guide a student through the course work.
College Freshman,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus. I don't experience fear walking by myself at night.
College Freshman,5,All courses i have taken are very engaging and the professors actually care about who you are and how you will succeed and it is a really awesome feeling.
College Freshman,5,"Dorm life is really fun and helps you build community, a place for every type of person and a fun way to experience college life!"
College Freshman,5,Very unique environment and i wouldn't change a thing.
College Freshman,5,"We have a great campus security staff, no crimes going on."
College Freshman,5,The quality of alumni network is fantastic.
College Freshman,5,Great professors who are experts in many fields not just theirs.
College Freshman,5,The housing is one of the greatest experiences here.
College Freshman,5,This school has such a great sense of community.
College Junior,5,"Very few, if any, drugs on campus."
College Junior,5,People from all over the country and the world!
College Junior,5,Several majors offered and a very good program for all of them.
College Junior,5,Small class sizes and the professors really get to know you.
College Junior,5,Great community and housing opportunities
College Junior,5,This school has a great community and is such a good place to be academically
College Freshman,5,I love the small class sizes that Corban has. This helps the profs connect more to us and helps us feel like they care about us instead of feeling like just another number in the crowd. The course material is generally interesting and easy to follow and study.
College Freshman,5,"From what I have heard, almost everyone graduates with several job offers or can easily find a job after graduation. We are well prepared for whatever job we apply for/are offered."
College Freshman,5,"I love living in the dorms and having that network of people. Most of the time people do get their first choice in housing but it isn't surprising to have the second choice. Aggard and Farrar are probably the farthest from most of the classes while PVG, Baylio, and Davidson are the closest. All of the bathrooms are cleaned everyday in the work week and are pretty nice for communal bathrooms."
College Freshman,5,"I love the professors and the classroom atmosphere. They engage well with students and try not to do long-winded lectures. The profs are very approachable and are willing to help when I am stuck on something, they want us to succeed and give a lot of grace when needed. Chapel worship and speakers are very well done. If I did the process again, Corban would still be my top choice. The biblical training and friendships I have gained are priceless and makes some of the struggles all worthwhile."
College Freshman,5,"It isn't perfect at all; however, you just cannot help but fall in love with the place. It is quite literally on top of a hill and is a spectacular campus. Overall, I'm blessed to attend this college."
College Freshman,5,"I really enjoy my college experience, and I love Corban."
College Sophomore,5,So far it's been amazing. The staff and faculty are willing to help and answer any questions that you may have and I really feel like I've found a community which I really belong.
College Sophomore,5,I love Corban University so far! The professors are genuine. We are challenged daily and the community is incredible. I feel like I'm going to have an amazing experience and grow academically as well as spiritually!
College Sophomore,5,"Corban University has created an environment in which I am stretched and grown academically, emotionally, socially, and spiritually. A day doesn't go by where I don't learn something new, either about a subject in class, or about myself. I am becoming a part of my community here, and I am learning how to have a successful position in the world. I believe that people can make the world a better place, and Corban is teaching me how to do that. They aren't just teaching me how to survive--but also how to thrive and how to help others thrive in the process. I love being a part of the Corban community, which is special and unique in so many ways. But I also love learning how to be a part of the world community, and I am becoming more and more excited to participate in it."
College Junior,5,"Corban University offers an amazing on campus life. Living arrangements in the dorms range from a double to a quad, and the quality of room depends on which dorm the student chooses. Changing rooms or dorms if dissatisfaction does occur is quick, easy, and painless. However, the brother and sister dorm activities and lifestyles are amazing. From random holiday parties to spontaneous trips and the open and welcoming atmosphere, Corban provides a fantastic place to live many students call home."
College Freshman,5,I love working with kids and learning how to teach
College Freshman,5,Keep doing what you're doing
College Freshman,5,I find it better than my High school
College Freshman,5,I feel completely safe and at ease here at Corban.
College Freshman,5,"Safety on campus is very important. There is a state penitentiary a block away, but that does not mean that our campus is in any way unsafe."
College Freshman,5,"I love the classes I am taking here. Although I am a freshman and taking general ed classes, everything is taught very well. The professors really care about our education and will gladly talk to you about grades and class material. The curriculum is interesting to me and I think that with the education I am receiving I will be able to successfully get into the grad school of my choice and, eventually, the career of my choice. 

The workload is reasonable. Of course there is a lot of work to do but I think that goes without saying. I don't ever feel overwhelmed with the amount of work that needs to be done as long as I stay on schedule and complete all my work on time. I think the professors understand how difficult it is to be a student sometimes and assign homework accordingly."
College Freshman,5,The school genuinely cares for its students and works hard to give as much aid as they can.
Senior,4,"Online classes are exceptional. The professor manages the class through email and voice thread.  All students participate and lenience is given to those who need extra time to work, but they will need to clarify that to the professor in advance."
Senior,4,"My experience at Corban University has been great! Professors really do care, unlike the other three Universities I have attended.However, I wish there was not so many hills. On the other hand, its good exercise."
Junior,4,"Corban is a great option for Christian students who are looking for a quality education. I am enjoying the counseling psychology program. The faculty are very kind and accommodating. Plus, the campus is beautiful and quiet."
Junior,4,"When Covid hit, the professors did a great job quickly converting to an online platform. Communication was understandably a bit difficult, but  overall I think the transition went remarkably smooth."
Freshman,4,I love the community and friendships forming at Corban University. The school is small and because the school is small you grow connections with everyone. You aren't just some person who could blend in the classroom or the cafeteria everyone stands out and everyone is important. The professors care about you and goes out of their way to help you. If you are looking for a small school I totally recommend Corban University! It is a fantastic school and I can't wait to go back for the fall semester.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience is very good because Corban University is a great place to make friends, like any other college, but it's also a good place to grow spiritually if you are a Christian. Most of the professors genuinely do care about the students. The student leadership is good for those who like to be involved in that. There are a lot of degree options and study abroad options. The downside to this school is the cost. The food and the housing are not worth the price."
Senior,4,The class sizes are so small which allows deep connections with the faculty members. They do need to improve the process for transfer students.
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Corban University. What I appreciate the most about this school is the community it brings to its students. the small campus and class sizes, along with the opportunities presented in the dorms create an environment that I feel so lucky to be a part of."
Junior,4,"Corban University has such a welcoming environment. This can easily be shown through the faculty and students. Close relationships are grown because of the small class sizes. This private Christian college encourages growth in your faith through chapels, friendships, professors, and biblical classes. Since the campus is built on a hill, the climb up and down the hill from classes can get tiring. However, my overal experience with Corban has been great and I’m glad I’ve had the experience of attending there."
Junior,4,"I have just started at Corban, but I really love that it is a university that is aligned with my faith and my belief system. The administration has been above and beyond when it has come to admissions, and course planning. I really cannot wait to get deeper into my studies with them, as I know that this is a wonderful education."
Sophomore,4,I love the Bible classes and how they bring  the Bible into other classes like math as well. The teachers are well knowledgeable too. The food is not very good though. Not a lot of variety or healthy.
Junior,4,"Corban is a private Christian college that is ideal for those who prefer a small campus and are interested in being involved with a close, great community. Small class sizes allow for more personal education that is very involved."
Sophomore,4,"I love Corban University. If you are looking for a Christian school with good morals and a family environment then this is the school for you. With amazing professors and friendly people, this school has everything a student could hope for. And the mandatory biblical studies minor is something that will really help your relationship with God grow. I learn something new at Corban everyday and I am looking forward to the short time I have left here."
Freshman,4,"The best part of Corban is the community, and it was the deciding factor over other colleges for me. There are people here who do not really care about their faith all too much, but there are a great many of people who are some of best people you'll ever meet. They will help shape you in your faith, and share many fun experiences with you. The majority of professors are amazing, and all of them are knowledgeable about what they teach. The only things I would change here is the food, it is good enough but you get sick of it quickly, and the cost. However, the cost of going here has been well worth it."
Sophomore,4,"I have loved being at Corban. It is a truly beautiful campus, with such a connection between students and faculty. The smaller environment creates a more personal experience for a student, which I have come to really enjoy. Corban gives the best for their students and the professors want to guide you in your educational journey and give advice as often as they can."
Freshman,4,"The school has a tight knit community that is easy to become a part of. However, any of the students have low motivation to get anything higher than a C in most classes which disappoints me. The professors tend to stoop to their level to bring the grades up rather than maintain high expectations."
College Freshman,4,"The one thing I don't really like is that some of the dorms are a little far from the rest of campus - Farrar especially, which just happens to be the one that I'm in. Overall, however, the on-campus housing is just great."
College Sophomore,4,"I have a few years to go here, but we are aware that the career services on campus are very helpful. Corban also has the ""Corban Promise"", which is that if you complete 4 years, and don't get a job of a certain base salary, Corban will help pay off your student loans."
College Sophomore,4,"Learning curve from High School to college level, but the professors are great, courses interesting, and ratio of professors to students is excellent."
College Sophomore,4,no alcohol allowed on campus - Christian environment at all times
College Sophomore,4,"As a baseball player, I may be biased, but CORBAN is a great college for athletics.  We are part of the Cascade Region, NAIA, and very competitive. Many sports to choose from, and many students are here because of sports!"
College Sophomore,4,"I live in Southern California, and was recruited to play Baseball at Corban in Salem, OR.  The transition was extremely hard for me, being away from home and trying to figure out college life (academic and athletic).  However, the faith based lifestyle made it easy to make friends, and I eased into dorm life and classes pretty quickly. The campus is beautiful (it RAINS a lot, which is new to me being from Los Angeles) - and local church was easy to find for Sunday worship services. Very good choice., looking forward to another stellar year."
College Sophomore,4,"From what I hear, most graduates find a job very close to right after they finish up school"
College Sophomore,4,Nothing really happens on campus which is a pretty good thing
College Sophomore,4,The dorms have a variety of uniqueness and some of them are better and newer than others. The community life is great but some dorms are closer to the main part of campus than others
College Sophomore,4,Every sport at Corban has had some type of success over the years. I think that a big reason for that is the atmosphere around campus regarding the sports. God is a part of everything and is highly encouraged by both the athletes and coaches.
College Freshman,4,"Amity High School celebrates sports as much as academics. Students are heavily involved in multiple sports, each putting in hundreds of hours over a school year. Both athletes and non-athletes are very supportive, and attend most sport functions."
College Freshman,4,The professors genuinely care about your education.
College Freshman,4,It really isn't that bad on our campus. There arent that many drugs at all
College Freshman,4,"Corban has been a great experience. It has had it's ups and downs, but that is to be expected. I have made great friends, and I have had great professors. I would recommend Corban to most Christians seeking higher education."
College Freshman,4,"I'm in the elementary education program, and over 98% of education graduates from Corban receive jobs immediately. I believe the other departments are successful as well."
College Freshman,4,"I really like Corban. I had a tough time at the beginning, but I do enjoy it now. The professors are excellent. My only complaints are that the food is awful, and the cost is so high."
College Freshman,4,"Parties/going to bars is almost unheard of to me. There are students that have gone off campus to party but ended up getting caught. On campus there are some activities planned for the evenings but they are kind of far between. Most of the time halls will go and do something like watch movies together but as for going out to bars on a regular basis, I am not aware of those who do."
College Freshman,4,"No parties really happen on campus besides ASB/SAB approved campus wide events. Dorms/halls do go out and do things but as for parties, that doesn't really happen on a dry campus. The approved events have been really fun and I enjoy the rootbeer kegs."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy studying here. The profs are really engaging and almost always have their office doors open so they are easily accessible if you are stuck on a class assignment or just need to chat. They tend to be fairly quick with email responses as well. Some classes do take longer to do assignments than others but that is to be expected. Rarely have I been given busy work as profs generally respect our time and realize we have assignments in other classes too. I usually study in my room since it is comfortable but we do have several study rooms in the library and the study room in PVG is really nice to use for group projects.
College Freshman,4,"We have a large number of international students on campus, especially from a sister school in Indonesia. They tend to stay in their own groups but they are lovely people when you get to know them. I have not heard anyone speak negatively against having international students on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Since our campus is a dry campus, there is no access to alcohol/drugs here. I have heard of people going to other schools to party but if caught, they are reprimanded. The school lightened the alcohol policy so anyone over 21 can drink but they are pretty strict with minors and drug use is out of the question. Even though marijuana is legal in Oregon, it is against school policy to partake since it is still considered federally illegal. I have had no peer pressure to go and party off campus by any of my friends here."
College Freshman,4,We get a lot of tips about safety and campus security is great at keeping everyone safe.
College Freshman,4,A lot of people in the Salem area value students who have degrees from Corban because those students are hardworking and have a lot of integrity.
College Freshman,4,"We have great teams, but we need more sports."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Super easy, application, a few forms, an essay about your own life. They honestly want to get to know you as a person before you attend."
College Freshman,4,"I live in one of the oldest dorms, Aagard, which is an all-girls dorm, but I still love it.  Because our dorm is so old, we don't have air conditioning, and there are days that the hot water (and the radiators) go out, but we all still love our building, and I wouldn't want to move to a different one.  Aagard has character, and our common ""suffering"" brings us together as a dorm.  Aagard is a bit quieter than some of the other dorms, I've heard, but as an introvert, I appreciate that.  There are still fun things going on, though, and always doors open if you want to chat with people.  We have a great laundry room, and hangout areas on every floor.  Lots of places if you want to watch a movie with friends or do homework.  

We also have a great relationship with our brother dorm, Farrar, and are very very close to the dining hall - perk!"
College Freshman,4,"Corban is a Christian school, and I feel as if I am always being encouraged to grow deeper in my faith, whether it is professors encouraging me to ""get my butt into church"" or teaching me how to read Scripture better.  We also have great community.  Because we are such a small school, I see many of the same people over and over - even if I don't know someone's name, I feel like we aren't strangers, and I can joke around with people who I have never officially met.  Because we are all Christian, I know we have common values at least."
College Junior,4,Lots of events going on but hardly ever partying and never drinking/drugs.
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus, we have pretty good campus security as well. We are not located right in the city which helps, we are kind of out in the country part of Salem. We are located near a prison but we don't have any problems."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't personally research their career center/services. But I personally feel confident, I am pursuing a career in medical field and will need additional schooling but I feel as it will not be a problem getting into graduate school."
College Freshman,4,"Quality of courses are pretty good, professors really want you to do well, they will challenge you but they are doing for the best. The classes are small more like a high school setting rather than a big university with huge lecture halls, there are more one on one contact with professors which I think is helpful. There are not a ton of courses offered but they pertain to your degree and get you what you need. I'm not super crazy about the gen-ed classes but honestly who is..? If possible take advantage of college level classes in high school and getting them transferred it pays off in the end!!"
College Freshman,4,Some dorms are kind of old and could use some updating but there are some that are fairly new. They also need to add more dorms as they are growing in population.
College Freshman,4,"They are part of NAIA Cascade Colligate Conference, one of the most competitive conferences in NAIA. Teams and coaches are great. Students support the teams, due to small school most students uasually know one or more of the players on the team. Facilities could use some updating but they are in the process of doing to. Sports play a big part in this school which is a cool experience to be apart of."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy my time here. I have met many amazing people. Professors can be challenging but we also learn a lot from them. They are also very caring about their students and their success, not only in their careers but also growing as a person. It is a small school that doesn't have many of the things larger schools offer, ex. lots of class options, major options, up to date technology. But we receive a good education and a place to grow spiritually. This school they focus on not only creating professionals but servants for Christ which is priceless and an amazing thing to be a part of."
College Freshman,4,"Even with the fact that there are 2 prisons down the road from the school, I feel extremely safe. We have campus patrol 24/7 and if for some reason we don't feel safe walking back to our dorm, we have the security number on the back of our ID card and they will walk us back. Our safety is their #1 concern and I know I am safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Sometimes it is hard to know when/what sporting event is happening but from the few soccer games and cross country meets I have attended, they are wonderful. All of the teams seem to mesh well with each other and play well as teams. The athletic facilities available are pretty good  and are well maintained. With the slight lack of ""advertising"" it makes it hard to plan ahead to attend games but there is still a good turnout for events that I have seen."
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus, and campus security does a great job of insuring that I feel that way."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't had an opportunity to explore employment/student center facilities. Nevertheless, from what I've witnessed in friends and adjunct professors, the prospects are quite lovely."
College Freshman,4,Aagard is a great place to live if you like large and spacious living spaces.
College Sophomore,4,"Corban University was a great school from the get-go. I felt really welcome and loved it the minute I stepped onto campus. The professors and staff here are always willing to help a student out, whether it be dealing with academics, family issues, you name it!  I think my favorite part about this school would have to be the countless number of extracurricular activities here on campus. There are so many opportunities for the students to get involved and get to know each other. I would choose this school if I could do it all over again. I would choose Corban because it's just that awesome! I mean, the community is great, the classes are challenging, the food is good, and I hardly ever get bored here. Corban University is the place to be!"
College Senior,4,"I have had a wonderful Experience with my time at Corban University so far. I have been blessed with the opportunity to play baseball and receive a wonderful Education. I was born and raised in the Church, and grew up in the public school system, when I realized I got the opportunity to not only receive and education from a prestigious Christian school, but also play baseball, I couldn't be any more overjoyed. The only thing is money has been tight the past years due to my limited ability to work with a heavy load of classes, and year round baseball commitment. I would greatly appreciate any help in form in scholarship as I look to finish my education."
College Junior,4,"Recently Corban has reviewed and amended it's alcohol policy, allowing those who are of age to drink off campus as long as alcohol consumption is responsible--there is still no alcohol, drugs, or tobacco products allowed on campus; I appreciate the change because it keep sCorban free of a potentially rowdy party crowd, but doesn't introduce false pretenses of how life would be outside a religious campus. Campus security doesn't necessarily patrol noise violations--fellow dorm-mates and RA's are very spot-on on protecting other hallmates from sound pollution."
College Junior,4,"Corban doesn't offer a plethora of scholarships other than academic and athletic scholarships. Most of their support for students goes to those who are financially unable. Work hard and take as many college courses as possible in high school or excel at a sport, and if worried about being unable to attend do to lack of financial aid, don't be afraid to send a letter of your story to the financial aid department."
College Freshman,4,It was good but I still can't afford this school
Freshman,2,"I really enjoy being in my hall and my roommates are incredible, but the people in my major are really rude and the professor is one of the main reasons why I am leaving. He picks his favorites and treats the rest of his ""non favorites"" poorly."
College Freshman,2,"The school is 97% White & 3% Other. IF you're brown, please come!"
College Student,2,The food isn't bad and there are always different options.
College Junior,2,"It is kind of tough to get off campus if you don't have a car, as Corban's campus is just south of Salem. On the plus side though, most people in the dorms are more than willing to take their friends on the town for just about any reason. The closest bus station is about a mile away though, so if you really need to go somewhere and no one will take you there is that option."
College Freshman,2,"There is no public transportation on campus. The nearest bus stop is about a 30 minute walk from campus, or so I'm told. Almost everyone just finds a friend to carpool with. This can be difficult, especially at the beginning of the year when you're still meeting people."
College Freshman,2,"Corban is full of Christians who are ""straight as arrows."" If you do happen to meet someone who has made the same, or similar mistakes you have, keep that person close. In my personal experience, sharing mistakes in my life at Corban has been a hit and miss. Sometimes you can see that a person genuinely cares about what your saying. The majority of the time though, I feel as if the person you are talking to just is talking to you to ""check a box off their list."""
College Freshman,2,Well I haven't had the experience of looking for apartments here in Salem because I am required to live on campus for my first two years of school. There aren't vary many options for apartments super close to school and it would be at least a 5 minute drive to get to school from anywhere around here.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Bad but Not Good – We are a growing school and are looking to expand and grow different buildings. On the list is a new library. Our library building is old, but the quality is good. Our gym is also small, but our athletic department took off a few years ago and I believe a new gym is in the works."
College Senior,2,Lots of White Students – The majority of students are white.  We have are gaining more diversity with international students.
College Sophomore,2,"Lacking the Funds – Corban is a great school for social, spiritual, and academic growth, but if there was one thing I'd change about Corban, it'd be the majors.  Corban just does not have enough majors to offer students.  The most likely reason is that Corban does not have enough funds to support professors to create additional majors."
College Sophomore,2,"Rain, Rain Go Away – It rains a lot here from about November to April..."
Recent Alumnus,2,"As far as off campus housing... you will have to search for this yourself.  However, there is a board where students can find rooms for rent.  The actual cost of living off campus is more than it is to actually live on campus."
Freshman,1,"Corban is not at all what I thought it would be. I toured and thought it was the perfect fit for me, yet now that I am student here I completely change my mind. My residence hall has mold throughout the entire building, the heaters work but are incredibly loud and unpredictable, the air quality in the building is so awful that certain family members of mine can't even come in the building for more than 30minutes. The food is not fresh and healthy like they said it is, it all comes pre-packeged and frozen. It's an okay school, but not at all worth it. Especially considering the cost of tuition."
College Freshman,1,No parties anywhere! Unless you live off campus
College Freshman,1,There is literally NO party scene on our campus.
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"The dining here at Corban University couldn't ever be raved over. But then again, how many schools have you gone to where you felt like the dining was an actual ""experience?"" Students basically eat in the dining hall to be filled and fellowship with friends. In short, the food is nothing above average. There are not many options compared with other schools and the food plan is difficult to deal with due to the limited plan options. On a positive note, this school does offer a coffee shop and snack shop that students can purchase goods from with their ""warrior dollars"" which are rolled into most meal plans."
College Sophomore,1,"We sign a commitment form at the beggining of every year that states you will not partake in any illegal substances or alcohol as long as you are enrolled in the university, even if you are of legal age. We also have strict hours and days when the opposite sex is allowed in rooms (i.e. a guy is allowed in a girl's room from 5-10pm on Fridays or visa versa) to help relieve temptaion. These can be a struggle to follow sometimes, but everyone who applies to Corban is aware of these and learns to adjust."

Junior,5,The way they have set up the blackboard learning environment has made online classes very easy to keep up with. The system they use flows smoothly and makes communication easy.
Junior,5,the teachers have been fantastic and the classes have all been challenging but useful. The online program that they have set up has made transitioning to all online courses easy to do. I have had no problems at all with the program i am in.
Alum,5,I took several classes over two summer semesters online and was very satisfied with the quality of my grades.
Junior,5,The main courses to my degree have zoom video classes so I am still getting the in person experience without having to relocate. The professors are amazingly helpful and respond quickly to emails.
Sophomore,5,"The University of North Dakota, is the most diverse school I have ever seen, not only in race, but in gender, sexual orientation, and religion. The best part is that the University of North Dakota has over 100 organized clubs for every one in a different niche. Yet, the student body as a whole, is so accepting of all. One thing I would like to see change is the graduation rate of the University, whether it be all student choices or maybe the expense of colleen, I would like to see accommodation made for those who may not be on the right path to graduation."
Sophomore,5,It was very easy and simple to apply. There weren't any tricks when applying. The application was easy to read and the instructions were simple.
Alum,5,"I took all my classes online, the classes were interactive and the teachers were knowledgeable. If I had questions staff were quick to respond and find solutions. Getting my degree fully online allowed me to also work full time."
Alum,5,Good staff and easily accessible resources. It prepared me to advance in my field and I was able to get a job once I graduated. Staff want to see you succeed.
Sophomore,5,Would love to see more class options about the history of the Sioux tribe!  Its extremely interesting how they got their name
Sophomore,5,"One of the most underrated schools! Love it here, great education & friends. 90% of the professors are great & super helpful"
Sophomore,5,I had to take online classes at the University of North Dakota due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The teachers were able to adjust to online quickly and efficiently. I thought that their adjusted methods of homework and tests were easy to follow and complete.
Freshman,5,"The best decision I've ever made was choosing to come to Grand Forks. Despite the cold weather, I have met the best people, experienced things I couldn't have experienced anywhere else, and had fun on top of getting a great education. The professors, most of the time, are great but there are also a few that could definitely go. The campus feels safe 24/7 and I can't see myself being at any other school."
Junior,5,"The University of North Dakota is a very diverse university that excels in including all students with no limitations. There are different campus organizations that anybody can be a part of. There is no discrimination in these organizations, in classes or majors, or in how students are treated at UND. UND has a wide range of courses to choose from and because of this, there is something for everyone here."
Freshman,5,"The University of North Dakota was such a great choice for me! The small town atmosphere really helped me feel at home before I even unpacked my bags. The campus is gorgeous, and a brisk, short walk to class is perfect to start your day! There are so many different organizations and clubs for you to join, anyone could find their lifelong friends. The classes and professors have that midwestern hospitality and are always willing to lend a helping hand. I love this college. I never want to leave!"
Freshman,5,The school has been welcoming and very involved in the process of become a student. They have connected kids in each grade with other kids so people can find roommates and friends.
Niche User,5,"UND offers so much for their students. When I walk around campus and see the busy lives of my fellow students, I know it's a great place for me to be. The atmosphere literally is cold, but the atmosphere the people have created there is fun and energetic. I am going into the medical field there. I have seen the type of courses and equipment they have to offer. with them, I can watch a simulated birth of a child. I can take every extent of a procedure I would take on a real human just the same as I can do on their human replica robot. I am beyond excited for my future."
Graduate Student,5,I've really enjoyed my time at UND. There are a ton of events going on all the time. There is a lot of diversity considering the location of this school.
Freshman,5,"I am in the Aviation program and I must say it is so much better than I would have ever imagined. The people here are great, there are so many opportunities, and the professors are always very knowledgeable. I would recommend this university to anyone who is interested in going to an aviation field of any kind. It is a well renowned university and rightly so."
Freshman,5,"This is a great university. I have been apart of it for only a few months, but they really care about you. They want you to succeed in getting your degree, and every step of the way they will help you get there. This college will always be there for you when you need help."
Freshman,5,Since I stepped on to the university I fell in love with the atmosphere. I was friendly and inviting. From here I found a new family that I connect and love very much. I have formed friendships that will last lifetimes. Even though I don't know what my career will be I have many opportunities to explore many majors and aspects at this college.
Niche User,5,"I loved the layout of the campus! It was super easy and quick to get around, facilities were updated, dorms were very good sized for freshman. All around great energy on that campus, no complaints!"
Niche User,5,"I have had a great experience applying and getting accepted to this college. I do not currently attend the school, since I am a high school senior, and have yet to graduate. However, I plan to attend this school for the duration of my college studies. I have been to the school for a campus visit and tour, and was extremely impressed with everything I saw there. UND has also impressed me since my visit, sending me plenty of emails to keep me reminded of important upcoming events, and letters as well, including one for Christmas. Overall, I have been very impressed with the school, which I will most likely attend this school very soon."
Freshman,5,"Since I have been a UND, it is almost impossible not to get super connected. There are so many great people and organizations as well as fantastic professors ready to help you learn. I have also found many on campus resources that make the college experience the best that it can be."
Freshman,5,"North Dakota is a large college with a small town feel. The professors will get to know you, and you will become close with your classmates. The campus is beautiful and the cold weather is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be."
Freshman,5,The University of North Dakota is a great school! You will see many kind faces just by going to class and the professors are helpful and kind. They provide their students support such as one on one session for a paper.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus and the housing, it makes me feel at home! The food is decent some days, but sometimes it feels like a home-cooked meal. I vibe with a lot of people considering im from the midwest. There are many programs and clubs you can join to get involved. Everything is pretty accessible such as the dining center, library, and even the classrooms."
Sophomore,5,"It was a very welcoming campus with lots of activities to help you get accustomed to living on campus and meeting new people. There were always people ready to answer any questions I had about the college experience. The teachers also always offered help if you were having trouble understanding any of the material. There were office hours you could attend to have one-on-one help with the instructor, or you could go the tutor center and meet with one of your peers that could explain the material to you in a way you can maybe understand better. One of the things I would like to see change is to be able to take food in a to-go container out of the dining center."
Senior,5,"I greatly enjoy the Atmospheric Sciences department and overall feel and site of the campus, including the variety at the dining center.  It is an affordable place that is easier to gain experience."
Senior,5,"I have met a lot of nice students and the faculty members are just as nice, if not better. there are a few faculty members I don't like and I've met some rude students but I have done so every campus I have been to. But I felt connected to this campus when I first came here and I am glad I chose UND. They are not hard graders, they want to make sure you understood what they were teaching you but they also wanted the best for you. Some classes are hard, but it's college, not high school lol. I am graduating from this college and my GPA and grades are better here than the other colleges I have attended, to the point I might be graduating with honors (fingers crossed) and I am doing it as a single parent. I am glad to be an alum student and will support this school as much as possible. I am thankful I was given a second chance by them because I have been doing great here ever since :)"
Freshman,5,"Good university who are interested in the aviation related majors or field. Very cheap and affordable compared to the competition, ERAU."
Freshman,5,I like meeting new people and the food. I wish more of the teachers spoke fluent English so they were easier to understand.
Freshman,5,"I love the University of North Dakota due to the atmosphere. There are great Athletics to attend and are very fun. The Professors here honestly care for your well-being and try to assist in anyway possible. The advisors I have interacted with are always easy to reach and answer any questions i may have. The housing is awesome with great maintenance. The dining center employees always greet you with a smile, and the food is amazing considering its college food. There are busses that help transport students to class so you don't have to walk in the freezing cold. The experience I have had is like no other, I would recommend UND to anyone!"
Graduate Student,5,"I am an online Forensic Psychology graduate student, and so far my experience has been great! The tuition is in-state price no matter where you live, and the professors are very helpful and understanding. The coursework is interesting and I've had no trouble using Blackboard (site used to access classes). I'd definitely recommend UND!"
Niche User,5,"The University of North Dakota is an amazing campus. Everyone is so friendly and the professors care about the students. The housing at UND is like none I have ever toured. The food and cafeterias are modern and really good. The town of Grand Forks is awesome and is a bigger town, but has the feeling of a small town. The outdoor opportunities around town are amazing. UND has one of the best aviation programs in the country as well. Overall, it is an amazing college."
Niche User,5,"I went on a tour of the campus, and then another tour of their aerospace program and it was top notch. Very professional and extremely detailed. Before the tour, I had toured another school and they were not nearly as detailed or in depth as UND. Very good job!"
Freshman,5,"So far I have been enjoying my experience at the Univeristy of North Dakota. I am a commercial aviation major, so the classes I have been taking are valuable and enhancing my learning for the future. The campus at UND is very nice. All of my classes are easily accessible by walking. It’s small “cozy” campus has made it enjoyable for me and it fits my needs and want. Plus it helped me adapt to my new live here in North Dakota without feeling like I was stuck in a huge campus. All of my teachers love what they do and want to make sure the student get value out of the classes they take while helping them complete requirements for essential studies. Overall, UND is a great college for anyone who is looking for a small college feel. Also, if you are interested in going into commercial aviation, medical, and education, UND has great programs for those degrees. UND has been a great college and I am looking forward to my future at this university!"
Senior,5,"This campus has great teachers who are willing to work with you, I like the all classes are on one street, and the campus is very safe"
Junior,5,The mechanical engineering course is online. The program is the only ABET accredited in the United States.
Senior,5,"Started school here in 2015, not knowing what to expect. Since then I have been enjoying this school. Hockey is a big deal here."
Sophomore,5,"UND is a relatively small campus. I like this because the winter can be so harsh here that it's nice to walk short distances to get to class. I haven't had a single bad experience with a professor. My advisor is wonderful! She offers plenty of help whenever I need it, and genuinely seems to care about my academic success. There are always fun activities going on for you to meet new people! They occasionally have game nights, free food, movie nights, etcetera. If you like peace and quiet, good places to study are the library and the memorial union. The only thing I would dock points off for would be that there is limited parking available for students that live off campus."
Junior,5,"I love this campus, and it truly feels like home. With somewhere around 12,000-15,000students enrolled here, it feels big but not too big. The campus is beautiful and everything is within walking distance (when it’s not 20 below). Sports are decent, and the hockey teams is consistently one of the best in the nation. There is definitely a big party scene if you are into that. Academics seem to be good, at least in my field. College is what you make it. The only big criticisms I would have is parking isn’t that great and it’s always cold. With that being said, I love the people here and professsors really seem to care. I wouldn’t want to be going anywhere else."
Senior,5,UND is a very diverse population of many different cultures and majors. The instructors care about the students and prepare them for life in all aspects.
Freshman,5,This university has excellent professors in all areas of study that I have had contact. My music professors are top notch which is why I chose this school.
Sophomore,5,"The University of North Dakota is a great school to be at, it is overall a good combination of social scene and academics. The only thing I don't like is the weather and the costs of tuition, books, etc."
Freshman,5,"My first exposure to UND was when I attending a tour back in November 2017. It was designed specifically for certain majors, mine being Nursing. They did a fantastic job talking about all the aspects of the program and what to expect. Walking through the SIMS rooms in the nursing building was first rate. We were introduced to current seniors in the program. Everyone of them did a wonderful job making us all comfortable and showing us the different rooms. At first, I was a bit overwhelmed but by the time the tour was over, I was very confident in my decision to attend UND. Every person I came into contact that day made my decision more conclusive. I am very excited to begin my journey at UND ."
Junior,5,"I attend UND through the DEDP program which is 99% online.   I have to do most of my transactions via internet or phone.   I find the website to be user friendly, even more so are the people who I have spoken with in the administration.  Everyone I have contacted has been friendly and willing to go above and beyond what is expected to assist me.  I have had the same experience with professors and the DEDP program personnel.  Even though I am not on campus, I feel a great sense of pride in the University of North Dakota."
Graduate Student,5,"I am in my last semester of the UND Special Ed online masters program before my internship and then graduation next semester. I have truly enjoyed the courses I have taken as I am learning so much valuable information that I can apply to my career. I enjoyed analyzing the characteristics of students with learning disabilities and the various approaches and methods used to foster ideal learning environments in the classroom. I had the opportunity to learn from professors who exemplify what they teach, and benefited from hands on experience to implement what I have learned. My professors and the entire college are so understanding, thoughtful, and caring. They want to help you succeed and work with you. They even called me in Florida to make sure I was okay and offer extended deadlines after Hurricane Irma. This is also the cheapest, quickest way to get my degree and really learn my stuff so I can be the most educated, experienced, and effective educator I can be. I love this place!"
Freshman,5,My first year's experience at UND has been more than I have ever imagined. I have met so many friends that I can see being in my life forever. I have had great experiences with all my professors. They are very helpful and wish nothing but success in each and every student. I would highly recommend UND as a potential option for those looking for a university. I am so glad I chose UND.
Niche User,5,"I have not attended the University of North Dakota, but I have stayed on campus when I attended Girls State the summer of 2017. I would rate my overall experience as a 5 out of 5. I met new people everywhere I went at campus, and they were all friendly towards me. They could probably tell I was not a current student, and they were not afraid to ask if I needed anything. I dormed in Selke Hall, and my experience there was great. The hall did not smell weird, and everything was kept clean all the time."
Senior,5,My experience at UND has been very positive. The school has pushed me to work hard and excel in all my classes.
Freshman,5,Great experience! Love the University of North Dakota. Fun school and amazing campus. Have fun everyday I am here
Graduate Student,5,They make it really easy to get signed up for classes and get all your stuff taken care of before the semester starts. I am a distance student and had no idea how to get started and they helped me every step of the way.
Graduate Student,5,"I love UND! It's a great school, and my department and professors are amazing! They really care about the students. Just two relatively minor things I would change if I could: 1.) The icy roads and sidewalks, and 2.) Being so far away from my parents (who are in Texas)."
Niche User,5,All the faculty and students are very welcoming and helpful. The University of North Dakota wants you to succeed. I toured there before I chose to go to college there and the atmosphere was calming. I felt like I was at home and I was very comfortable.
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed my experience so far at the University of North Dakota. I like how social everyone is. I have nothing that I would change.
Freshman,5,"The University of North Dakota provides a safe, judgement free environment.  There is constant reassurance that help is on campus regarding mental health, physical health, tutoring sessions, and more.  My experience has been nothing less than amazing, the professors are understanding and I felt like home the first day I walked on campus."
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere at this school. Overall, I have had great professors and have done pretty well. I've made a lot of friends and I have gotten involved in a variety of different clubs and events."
Niche User,5,Great flight program for those interested! Also one of the best hockey teams in the nation! Beautiful campus and many fraternities and sororities for those who love the Greek life!
Senior,4,"Overall, UND is a great school to go to. The only issue I have is the lack of mask mandate, or enforcing of covid protocals."
Senior,4,"Overall, the online classes at UND have been really good. The professors are responsive, and the test taking process is easy and smooth."
Alum,4,"This is the flagship school of North Dakota and is generally pretty good.  Grand Forks is an agricultural/college-based community.  It has a great small city vibe.  College bars are everywhere and the locals are really friendly.

The professors are very accessible to the point of delivering papers to their front door if you needed to work late.  The campus is generally beautiful outside of a few modernist buildings.  Plus, you have REA which rivals NHL arenas.  

The party scene is pretty good.  Fraternities and the bars are top notch like any school with a D-1A football school.  

UND is very inexpensive, and the ROI is what you make of it. 

As for diversity, it's North Dakota.  It's whites and a small percentage of Native Americans.

Student Life is what you make of it also.  You can stay in your dorm for four years and play video games, or go outside."
Junior,4,I love the versatility of the courses offered. I love that I am able to live far away from campus and have a multitude of online courses available to choose from. The only thing I would improve is their website. It can be hard to navigate.
Sophomore,4,"My learning at the Universiyt of North Dakota was switch oline due to COVID-19. The school, having many international studnets, let those who could not go back home stay in the dorms on campus. Everyone else who could was instructed to go home for the saftey of others, as it shoudl have been. My online lectures were very much the same as before, every class would have normal lecture time in ZOOM, so all students could be present and particulate. For labs, great simulations were given and explained by professors so that we could both see an understand underlying effects of all real life simulated tasks.  Homework was on the same pace as the course, and was quite fairly the same. Extra tutoring hours and ZOOM meeting were held for all classes before an exam would take place. School online at the University of North Dakota was very much the same to in school class setting, and all accommodations where made when need be."
Sophomore,4,"I am not really a fan of online learning. However, UND professors make it seem like you are in the classroom. Technical services are fully prepared to tackle any technical issue that might occur."
Sophomore,4,"At the University of North Dakota, I liked how diverse it was. There were many different cultures represented. I also liked how the school had a lot of activities and clubs that anyone could participate in."
Freshman,4,The classes weren’t the most well prepared but they were still effective and learnable. I struggled but still succeeded.
Sophomore,4,"My time at the University of North Dakota has been better than I ever expected. I grew up in California my entire life, and I never envisioned going to UND, until it was my only choice. Trust me, I thought it was going to be terrible. I thought the winters were going to be the end of me and I was going to be bored all the time. That's exactly the opposite of what I found. I learned that the people at this campus are incredibly caring, understanding, and friendly. North Dakota nice as they say! I am rarely bored as there is a lot to do here in North Dakota! The winters can be rough if you hate the cold like me, but snow days are a plus and being able to say I lived through a -62 degree cold front makes you sound pretty bada**! Most of my professors have been so helpful to my education, however, they do have the bad eggs. Just as anyone who knows a little bit about the subject and they will tell you the good professors and the bad ones! I hope you choose UND because I'm proud I did!"
Freshman,4,"Greetings to whom it may concern,
My experience at the University of North Dakota has been different this year, to say the least, but staff and administration have been very accommodating. The campus is beautiful and intimate students feel important and welcomed."
Niche User,4,"I'd have to say that I liked everything I had to see at UND. The faculty were easy to talk to and helpful about answering questions, the assigned tour guide was very friendly and had some great stories about his life and experience on campus. The food court seems amazing, plenty of options and all of its included in tuition so you don't have to worry about food ,which is a definite plus. There are plenty of things on campus helpful for students, such as a wellness center, a library, plenty of printers around the main building in case you've forgotten anything. All in all it seems that UND is proud to go out of its way for its students."
Freshman,4,University of North Dakota has extremely good professors who care and dedicate their time to each and every student.
Sophomore,4,"It is a decent university. It is hard to get financial aid. The food is good sometimes, they have 2 dining centers and an airport cafe. They have a shuttle to the airport which is nice."
Sophomore,4,"The school dedicates a lot of resources to the hockey and aerospace programs, leaving several other programs underfunded. However, the teaching staff is generally good and the resources on campus are nice."
Freshman,4,"The University of North Dakota has many advantages with some drawbacks. The education within and community of the college are both good, but as you can imagine the winter is not enjoyable. It is of course out of their control, but does put a damper on the overall college experience."
Freshman,4,"It's a very good school with nice teachers and beautiful scenery. I like the food too, but the meal plans are a bit strange. Tuition is between 9 and 12 thousand per semester for most people, but it's a little bit more for aviation students. My only problem would be the Wi-fi. I've only just started my 2nd semester and they've changed their Wi-fi around about 4 times. The most recent one is pretty bad, but I'm sure they're working on it. 
In the end, the college is amazing. I'm really enjoying my time here too."
Senior,4,"I transferred into the University of North Dakota in my second year. It was an amazing decision to do so. Since, I have met some amazing people and had the opportunity to learn from wonderful professors. I was given the opportunity to join the UND Love Your Melon Crew and have volunteered with them for two years now. I've met inspiring children and families battling cancer. Creating events to raise awareness for pediatric cancer and relating organizations. Attending University of North Dakota has given me countless opportunity I will cherish forever."
Sophomore,4,"I think the campus is amazing and the diversity among students is incredible. It genuinely feels like home away from home while on campus. There are so many events going on that get students more involved, especially when living on campus. The only bad thing about campus is all of the construction going on and they do it all at once, so it is hard to find easy ways to get to class or study areas."
Freshman,4,The University of North Dakota is an excellent place to further one's education. Smaller class sizes and a low teacher to student ratio is one key part of UND's excellence. I have fully enjoyed learning and being apart of the UND community.
Junior,4,"UND has been very kind to me. It has helped me grow in lots of ways; the classes I have taken so far have further increased my interest in the course I am taking. It has also kept me active by having activities on campus, the hockey games are the most fun. The environment they create is one you have to experience in person. I met some of my best friends in the dorms, so I have no complaints there. The only thing that I wish was better would be the safety of the campus. Some places on campus are dark and scary to walk past. As a girl, I am always worried about my safety and I would hope the campus focuses on it as well."
Senior,4,Online distance engineering program is outstanding.  Faculty is always willing to help and the summer labs are informative and fun.
Sophomore,4,Faculty promote students to ask questions and want them to learn. They will go out of their way to help you if you show an interest of you wanting to learn what is being taught.
Niche User,4,A good school with decent programs and teachers (if you're lucky). Best party school in North Dakota and mostly only known for its aviation program.
Junior,4,"I like the atmosphere of UND. Everybody is so friendly and it’s a safe environment. The classes are challenging but not without help. There are some professors that let you fend for yourself but the majority of professors do not want to see their students fail so they really push for students to seek help when they need it, the earlier the better. I like the small community feel with the big university population."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed the visit I had to UND, they made me feel very welcomed and were open to any and all questions. There were many options open to me and meet many of my requirements."
Freshman,4,"North Dakota is a great school, has incredible athletics and a great student body. Everyone is always extremely positive and supportive of those around them, however the level of education isn't as high as some other state schools."
Junior,4,I enjoy the atmosphere and size of the campus. It is a very college community feel and everything is pretty close together when going out.
Freshman,4,The University of North Dakota is a great school to consider applying to as well as going to. The campus is very well put together and everything is close by to the dorms as well as close to other buildings.
Freshman,4,It is a beautiful campus in a beautiful state. It has great facilities and a wonderful faculty. The cost is also very reasonable for a four year college.
Freshman,4,University of North Dakota is a great school. Lots of different things to get involved with on campus.
Freshman,4,"Amazing academics, opportunities, and people. Classes and professors were great. So many clubs to take a part in. It was really easy to apply, they had everything step by step. Contacting UND was also easy, they would get back to you right away."
Freshman,4,I love the university of North Dakota. I have had positive experiences with all my teachers and everyone is always willing to help. They offer so many degree programs there is something for everyone. The hockey games are a blast as well! If I had to change something it would be that there are more places to eat on campus and there are more underground tunnels to stay out of the cold.
Sophomore,4,"The faculty and staff are willing to help with anything you may need. Campus is easy to navigate and very beautiful. At UND, you will find the resources necessary for success."
Junior,4,"I like how close almost all the classes are depending on your major and how they have many programs to help you will whatever you need. I wish they would have better dinning serves's, especially when it comes to the Memorial Union."
Sophomore,4,My experience at the University of North Dakota has been pretty good so far! The students and professor are all really nice and helpful. Campus is beautiful and easy to get around. There are many events and groups that occur every week so there is no way you could get bored. Everyone is has one goal in mind and that is be successful and to graduate.
Freshman,4,"Very nice campus, however it is in the middle of nowhere. There wasn't much that interested me in the area, but it was a good start to my college career."
Junior,4,So far my experience at the university of North Dakota has been good. The professors care about your success and the teaching department is fantastic.
Sophomore,4,UND was an amazing school. I am so happy I choose to go to this wonderful school. Living on campus was a great experience. I made so many good friends and some great memories when I was living on campus.
Junior,4,"After spending three years here I like that I am able to go to my professors or advisors anytime I need help with anything. The campus is really pretty in the spring when the leaves are starting to come back, and hockey season is the best!"
Niche User,4,I am currently attending a different University in Minnesota but I am transferring to the University of North Dakota in the fall of 2018. I am interested in the Athletic Training /Sports Medicine program. UND has a solid program and have hands on experience for the students to learn. Although the UND campus is much larger than the University I am currently at it is very user friendly and everyone seems extremely nice and helpful. I am excited to transfer and continue my education and participate in the intermural programs. The housing experience has been an eye opener as rent is much more expensive at UND and that is why I need to apply for as many scholarships as possible. I am looking forward to this new opportunity to continue my collage degree at UND. Thank you.
Alum,4,"The University of North Dakota is a beautiful campus with great professors. The only issue is the administration disregards Student and Alumns' thoughts and concerns, disrespecting the tradition and culture of what the University of North Dakota once stood for.  It's embarrassing and shameful."
Graduate Student,4,Staff are very friendly. Faculty truly try to help students and provide guidance with your major. Campus is easy to navigate.
Freshman,4,"I love University of North Dakota and truly believe that it is an excellent school, however, I think that the chemistry department could be improved."
Junior,4,"I was apprehensive at first, but I have found my new home. The mid-west people I've met here have been the nicest and most supportive group of people I have ever met, essentially making them my new family. I love the campus and the profs are great. I really don't know what I would do without this place as it has generated a new opportunity for me to learn and grow."
Freshman,4,"I fell in love with this college the moment I stepped on campus. Everyone cares about you and your success. Unlike other public colleges, most UND general requirement courses are small in class size."
Niche User,4,This is  really good school and I like it a lot. This school makes going back to school easier with the online classes and the resources that are provided. The teachers are very quick with responding back.
Freshman,4,"I like how willing professors are to help you in any way they can. For the most part, I've experienced a very positive environment. The teaching skills staff has here is excellent so far in my education."
Senior,4,"Even as an online student I can appreciate the diversity of the student body. There are students of all ages and backgrounds. Most of the professors seem to appreciate the fact that online students are not really interested in ""fluff"" so they keep the material to the point.  What I appreciate the most about UND is financial options. Online students only have to pay the same rate as in-state students and you can enroll in 3 to 5 month payment plans. My one real issue is some professors are not quite as clear on what works when it comes to teaching online versus in a classroom. There are some aspects of the classroom experience that simply don't work when you try to apply them online. I sometimes feel there are professors at UND who don't really get that. All in all, I think UND's online degree program is a very great option for people who want to further their education without breaking the bank or putting their life on hold."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed the hockey atmosphere, but you have to kind of like cold snowy weather. The campus was spread out, and only some of the dorms are connected to the dining center."
Freshman,4,"The University of North Dakota provides a fair educational value for its price when compared to its peers.  Albeit, its isolated position in the country greatly increases the travel expenses for individuals who do not live in the general vicinity of the facility."
Graduate Student,4,I have been at UND since 2009. I Love the atmosphere and all the opportunities the college and community provides. It is definitely a place I can see myself living and continuing my schooling.
Sophomore,4,"UND provides students with a wonderful and wide array of academics, an excellent student life both on campus and the surrounding area, and I have met many great people. The only thing I would like to see change is the admissions and financial aid staff. It was very difficult to get everything straightened out at first before attending, which is why I am giving it four stars. However, I would recommend attending UND, especially those interested in an aerospace major."
Junior,4,"One thing I really liked about UND was the fact that there was something for everyone, whether is was within academics or by getting involved with different organizations on campus. The campus was not too big or too small, and there was always a familiar face wherever I went. The school pride and support was, and continues to be, tremendous and can be seen throughout the entire community, especially when it came to supporting our athletics. The professors care for their students and want all of them to succeed. They were always very helpful and I never experienced any problems with any professor. All in all, my experience at UND has been amazing and I'm so grateful for the opportunities I have been given and all of the memories I have made here."
Sophomore,4,"The University of North Dakota is just the college I was looking for! Not only did it have my major, it's academics and staff allow many other options for classes to choose from all while creating and maintaining a safe and learning friendly environment. On top of that, there are many available extra curriculars to meet anyone's needs and wants!"
Alum,4,The University of North Dakota is an exciting school. It has lots of possibilities for the ultimate university experience. They offer a wide range of classes which i found interesting and helpful. It makes for a more fun educational journey.
Sophomore,4,"Good school with some great professors. Location wasn't the best, especially if you're looking for a big city. The main reason I didn't stay is because they didn't have the academic program I was looking for."
Senior,4,"I love the community. I would argue that it's hard to find a more welcoming community of people. Additionally, I have come across many supportive professors at the university. On the negative end, there has been a series of budget cuts that has forced the university to get rid of professors, programs, and a variety of other important things to the school."
Junior,4,"This is a really good school for Aerospace. The english department is above average too, There are a lot of liberal professors though. As long as you're careful with your words this school is great."
Freshman,4,What i like about the university of North Dakota is the small campus feel while still being a decently sized university. Hockey games are a unique culture and tradition at this University.
Sophomore,4,"I currently enjoy my experience at the University of North Dakota very much. I am a Commercial Aviation major, and think that the aeronautic education I am receiving is second to none. The staff is well educated and experienced, and always very helpful. The low cost of tuition helps to ease the costs of an aviation education."
Freshman,2,"The UND Aviation program is run by a bunch of people who have excelled in their subject, but those said people make it feel as if I shouldn’t be allowed the same opportunity to excel as they did; when I do something wrong they don’t reach out to help instead, they give you rude and sometimes just blatantly  offensive criticisms and why “you shouldn’t have missed this” with no explanation at all. They like people that look like them and only like them."
Junior,2,The college is overpriced for online courses. The counselors and teachers do not respond to your questions. I have been a student for over 2 years and my transfer credits have not been evaluated.
Freshman,2,"I would not recommend this school to anyone unless they want to go into aviation or law. Grand Forks has nothing for college students to do. Hockey games are fun, but only men's since they cut women's hockey from a HOCKEY SCHOOL. I guess our football and basketball team has improved, but the school keeps cutting sports so your options are limited. The party scene is okay, but the frats are disgusting, so I don't recommend those. If you can find a house party sometimes those are fun, but the cops like to shut those down. The food has no variety and there shutting down Terrace which is the only dining center with somewhat quality food. The campus smells bad in the spring and sometimes the fall. The winter is miserable. Always windy, cold, and icy. They advertise tunnels, but only have one. The dorms and campus buildings are outdated, as in they still use chalkboards! Freshman classes are huge and while I've had some good professors, I've also had some bad ones. There are better schools!"
College Junior,2,"Here for school nothing else at this point. Coming from a larger city the pace and attitude of life is far too different and finding a like minded group of people has been near impossible. The classes showcase the lack of quality education in rural America as most classes have been absolute jokes and my major classes are the only ones that require any sort of work at all to get a decent grade. Most students care more about the logo on the school's hockey jersey than their actual grades or performance and drinking on the weekend means even more to them. It's not rare to hear people complain about how they're going to fail out of freshman business classes because they've been partying too hard. The best crowd of people seems to be the ones in upper level aviation, law or medical classes. International students also make the campus a better place but get ready for subtle and not so subtle racism from the locals when you hang out with them. North Dakota was a mistake and I regret choosing to go here every day."
College Freshman,2,"They have very limited scholarship options at the university.  The financial aid process was easy to do,"
College Freshman,2,Hard to find decent priced places close to campus
College Freshman,2,To receive decent funding I guess you're parents have to be REALLY POOR
Recent Alumnus,2,Housing is pretty limited.  You'll find that the quality of housing available is relatively poor in regard to the price points.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The party scene here is vastly over exaggerated and embellished.  Like all schools, the first few weeks are really lively and then it begins to taper off where the party scene becomes limited to smaller house parties and exclusive fraternity parties.  If of age, the bars become a weekend norm after a while.  The party scene is really hit or miss.  There is an abundance of binge drinking to compensate for the lack of party scene but that's expected with the weather.  This school is no comparison to most state schools around the country."
College Freshman,2,"If I was not attending school in Grand Forks, North Dakota, the city, as well as state would be totally irrelevant to me in every aspect. Grand Forks is the definition of a college town, with the University being the real attraction for many people. The oil industry has increased train traffic through the Forks, but man, this town is dead."
College Freshman,2,"The University of North Dakota is, last I checked, the #1 Binge Drinking School in the country. Not exactly a highly coveted status, but one we have nonetheless. The campus is dry and the school officials are fairly good about cracking down on underage drinking in the dorms. However, the University PD is ruthless in their hunt for people walking home from parties inebriated."
College Sophomore,2,"Living in the dorms was quite a buzzkill for me.  I lived in Noren Hall and all the RA's were friendly at first but they all have their power trip.  I came to the conclusion later in the year that they snoop around a bit too much and stick their noses into things.  Even if its something minor, like being loud a few minutes past quiet hours.  They snoop and get people into trouble.  The community was nice and it's a great place to meet people, but the RA's are very strict and it made me feel like uncomfortable.  This really ruined my experience living in the dorms."
College Sophomore,2,Very little philanthropic activities and often known for doing super crazy things
College Sophomore,2,Its very cold and is unmotivating at times to go to class
College Sophomore,2,"Anything that makes the university money, such as parking, is much more strictly enforced than anything that concerns student welfare"
College Sophomore,2,"Its a huge cultural issue, very prevalent, its basically just expected and a right of passage to go out drinking and doing other stuff. There isnt a lot of other options on campus that are well promoted"
College Junior,2,"in the world its bad , so why would you expect it to be any less on campus.   too many adults think its no big deal- thus kids think the same."
College Freshman,2,They try to be strict but people break rules anyway.
College Sophomore,2,cold..but this winter has been horrible country wide.
College Sophomore,2,"It's very wind in Grand Forks, ND which makes it unbearable during the winter where it can get up to 50 below zero. But, if you buy a parka and winter supplies, you'll be prepared because they don't cancel classes for a little bit of snow or if it's 40 below zero."
College Junior,2,Limited scholarships through the school.
College Sophomore,2,"its scary to walk alone at night as a girl.  people drink a lot and can get out of control, guys can be forward, sexual assault is present on the occasion.  health services are not great, the doctors are very slow and not so patient or helpful."
College Sophomore,2,"most people drink, those who don't often are bored at parties."
College Sophomore,2,"the teaching assistants basically teach the class and many times they are bad teachers, sometimes they have accents that are difficult to understand."
College Freshman,2,UND is pretty average-below average in every aspect. You go here because you're from ND or MN or you're an aviation kid.
College Freshman,2,"UND is very cliquey and most people stay with their friends from high school. Cool if you're from ND or MN, sucks if you're not."
College Sophomore,2,This is North Dakota. You should know what you're getting yourself into. It's cold. You learn to deal with it. Summers are pretty nice.
College Senior,2,super cold and with with occasional flooding
College Sophomore,2,"North Dakota is not a considerably diverse state in general, which reflects the lack of diversity on the campus. Most of the students are white, of Christian background, moderate socioeconomic background, and heterosexual. Although there has been a push for more diversity in the area, it is not common for an ""outside"" or someone who is not of the norm to be accepted by the community. A greater need for open-mindedness and acceptance is necessary within this community along with a push for more diversity in all aspects of the word. "
College Sophomore,2,"I recieved aid through the federal government, but nothing from UND. I'm very disappointed by their availability of scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel they dont reward you for your work as much as other schools do, there isnt a ton of scholarships, pretty much only 3 and the rest are based on ethnicity which i find ironic because were supposed to be equal and fair yet we give native americans and asians and african americans etc everything and if you dont have a trace of anything in you you get nothing."
College Sophomore,2,Sometimes I wonder if I would've enjoyed college more if I went somewhere else. UND isn't very homey I feel like a number not a name.
College Sophomore,2,The labs are always full and speed and network connection is very slow and sometimes unreliable.
College Sophomore,2,It is very cold up here and the wind is the worst part. If you can handle that then the snow is a lot of fun and winters here are great.
College Sophomore,2,"There's a lot of choices for off-campus dining at UND, but nothing that great. It's a lot of your usual fast food joints. It's nice to have them around when you have a craving or don't have time to eat on campus. But UND offers food at all times whether it's dining hours or ""to-go"" food times. I prefer the healthy, all-you-can-eat meals on campus."
College Junior,2,"I would say the strictness on campus is a C because the campus police can be very strict about underage drinking. In the dorms, noise restrictions and privacy is somewhat limited with suitemates and wings. It's pretty strict."
College Senior,2,"Grand Forks has a lot of housing that is near campus but the quality is horrible.  There are really nice apartments near campus, but they are super expensive.  The housing that is semi-cheaper are the places that have problems, the landlords never fix anything and the apartment buildings are always really strict on everything else."
College Freshman,2,"It depends on what building you are trying to get to. Usually parking is not good, even with a permit. There's almost no chance of parking without a permit, unless you're willing to get a ticket."
College Sophomore,2,The diversity and UND is fairly decent considering the extreme weather that tends to keep students of many ethnicities away.
College Freshman,2,Average. There are many foreign students whom travel here from China to study aviation and also many samalians so the culture is very diverse. Most students enjoy hockey and other winter activities.
College Freshman,2,The apartments here in grand forks are usually very expensive. It is a good choice if you are interested in living with a roommate but if not then I recommend living on campus. There are many apartments located near campus and on the bus routes.
College Junior,2,Fieldwork is required.  No pay received generally.
College Sophomore,2,"The strictness at the University of North Dakota primarily depends on who you are dealing with, whether it be a professor, RA, city police officer, or university police officer. Be polite if you get into trouble."
College Sophomore,2,The food is not of the highest quality. There are three dining centers open throughout the day and the last one remains open until 11 pm.
College Sophomore,2,Parking on campus requires each person using the lot to buy a permit and park in designated areas. Due to recent growth of the student body it becomes difficult to find available spots during peak school hours.
College Senior,2,"Winter can be a brutal thing at UND.  Be prepared for below zero temperatures with bitter cold wind chill (during the winter). With that being said; Spring, Summer, and Fall are perfect!"
College Sophomore,2,"the weather here is really up and down. It gets very cold here and we also get a lot of snow. Classes are hardly cancelled, unless it is a total blizzard. It's not too bad of a walk when it not a nice day because the campus is pretty compact."
College Freshman,2,"There is not a great deal of diversity. The University is mostly made up of white and asian students, and small town/suburb economic backgrounds."
College Freshman,2,The Greek life on campus has a reputation of being trashy and is not viewed to highly by those who are non-Greeks.
College Senior,2,It is too cold and windy. I can't take a bus from the library late nights so I have to be frozen out at the street.
College Freshman,2,Really don't pay any attention to them. The frats have all the parties though.
College Sophomore,2,"People say they are strict on alcohol, but the truly are not. I say cut all of Greek life, its useless and they get away with too much."
College Sophomore,2,The only sport that people care about is Men's hockey. Every other sport is forgotten about.
College Sophomore,2,"Coming from a town of 7000, I thought Grand Forks would be an upgrade. Unfortunately it feels like an even smaller city than my hometown. I'm not used to being in such a remote place. It will be a transition to anyone who is used to living in a populated area."
College Sophomore,2,The parties/ bar scene is for +21 only. The downtown bars are pretty typical of average small towns. The best bet for 21 and younger are the house parties. They are relatively close to campus and you can leave when you feel like it without a car.
College Sophomore,2,"It's a lot of hype. They make it sound really cool to be in greek life at UND, but in my experience and some of my friends experiences they really don't do much."
College Sophomore,2,"UND is know for bieng good for only a few majors. If you are Aviation, Education (mostly early childhood), or Nursing, it's perfect. It lacks in some areas, for example the math program is terrible in my opinion."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the girls have way higher standards than they are attractive, most are from the Twin Cities, Minnesota area and lack some common sense."
College Freshman,2,Greeks are usually the typical douche bags. Some catch a bad rap from others. Are just getting off suspension and so parties are picking up. Sometimes don't let you in if your not with more girls than guys
College Freshman,2,"State of ND sucks, never come here."
Niche User,1,cold all the time. they cut women's sports. red pepper is pretty good though. dorms are small and not well mapped out but they get the job done.
Niche User,1,"I contacted this facility and another facility for a bachelors in forensic psychology. The other facility wrote me back the same day, while North Dakota took another day. The email from the assistant director did not make any sense (she sent a link for ""enrollment anytime"" courses which she admitted had nothing to do with the major, but I specifically said forensic psychology and would've liked to receive information on just that- even if it wasn't for ""enrollment anytime""). I responded back by saying I am interested in learning more about the program so that I can apply. That was 14 days ago. I'm already enrolled at another facility who have kept in contact with me through out the process. I guess I was the ""once in a while"" fluke... but it sure did kind of suck to not hear back at all."
Niche User,1,"Stay away from the distance learning program unless you'd like to be treated as an afterthought. Plodding through this course was miserable work, though I earned a 95. I waited weeks for my final grade, and had to hound them to put it in so I could get the transcript to my employer. I've had a considerable amount of online learning experiences; this was the worst bar none."
Alum,1,"I was a commercial aviation major from 2007-2011. I graduate and didnt get a job from the college as a flight instructor. They do not gaurantee flight instructor jobs, even after youve paid them 150,000 in flight instruction costs. I currently do not fly because most pilots at the major airlines are military pilots anyway. It is a very competitive profession and contrary to what they say, there are plenty of pilots out there.  Be very wary of this flight school. You may consider going to a 2 yr school instead or picking a different 4 yr degree."
College Senior,1,"Over priced, low quality, on or off campus"
College Senior,1,Given the choice I would not reapply to the school
Recent Alumnus,1,"The typical North Dakota cuisine; commercial restaurants, diners and a limited selection of original eateries.  If you're not from the upper Midwest you will be hard pressed to satisfy your taste buds."
College Freshman,1,"No scholarship opportunities that I can find, the aviation programs are notoriously expensive, but the school has not done much to help out."
College Sophomore,1,"Drinking at UND is a big part social life.  However, it's almost impossible to not get caught and law enforcement and RA's included go snooping around just to get people in trouble.  Also, police just take you to jail even if its just your first minor.  It's true, I had a friend who literally drank two beers and recieved his first minor ever and was taken to jail for it.  There are some pretty shady stuff going on with University Police here.  Also, the dorms have a policy where if the RA's even suspect a slight hint of alcohol being in the room, they call the police.  Then once police arrive they threaten you to take you to jail if you don't let them into your room.  Also, University Police were pretty biased on who they gave out minors too.  I had a friend (girl) who lived on the floor above me and they had the cops called on them one night.  When the cops arrived all they did was take their booze and left.  No one recieved minors.  University Police and the RA's ruined my experience at UND."
College Sophomore,1,"Grand Forks, North Dakota is probably the dullest place to live. There's one mall, but it's so outdated and there aren't that many useful stores in it anyhow. There were three Walmarts there the last time I visited, and there's a lot of restaurants, but other that eating out or going to buy notebooks at Walmart, there is absolutely nothing to do in that town. The public busing system is also terrible and very unreliable. Grand Forks is a very Christian based town, and is very, very conservative, which isn't really a good thing in my opinion."
College Sophomore,1,"I am very disappointed in the lack of response to the number of sexual assaults on campus. I lived next to a kid my freshman year who would boast about drugging and raping girls at frat parties, and even after he'd been reported, UPD and campus security made no motion whatsoever to investigate the issue. The same kid also later in the year assaulted me, and when I reported it to my RA, I was told that there was nothing that could be done about it. It honestly disgusts me the way this campus is so lax about sex crimes and is the reason I chose to take some time off from it. After everything that happened, I DO NOT feel safe in the dorms, and I most definitely do not feel safe walking alone outside after dark, especially on the weekends when the frat parties are in full swing."
College Junior,1,winters are about unbearable here- too much snow and way too cold
College Sophomore,1,It's really difficult to find a good place to live off campus. Landlords are corrupt and apartments are expensive and UND doesn't help to find cost affordable places to live.
College Sophomore,1,it is extremely cold. i thought  had experienced cold growing up I'm Minnesota but i was rudely awakened by the windchill factor in grand forks/ north dakota in general.  It snows a lot and we get snow days/ cold days and school is cancelled.
College Freshman,1,The weather is terrible. Windchill can get down to 60 below and snow everywhere for months on end. 
College Junior,1,"Squires is the nicest of the dining centers. Only Wilkerson is open on the weekends. The Union is the most convenient for me being off-campus.  

The food gets old fast."
College Junior,1,The weather is very bad. I've lived here my entire life and for those people who think winter has been bad these last two years are wrong. The lowest it's been is -30*F maybe -40*F on a day or two with wind. But in the past there's been a stretch of two weeks around January and February where it's -50*F with the sun out. In the spring it varies last year it was cold and snowy til May but the year before that it was nice out before March.
College Sophomore,1,"There is only about 8% of the student population that interacts in Greek Life. Frats hold parties, Sororities throw water balloons at you to try to recruit you...  it's typical of Northern Greek life, but lacking compared to Southern Schools."
College Freshman,1,"Winter is horrible. It gets extremely cold and there's so much snow and ice. Classes will get cancelled if it's very dangerous, but because every winter is bad, classes are not cancelled often."
College Junior,1,"They aren't joking when they say the weather at the University of North Dakota is awful. Winters are bitterly cold and the wind is just dreadful. There are several videos of students ice skating to classes on the sidewalks. Despite copious amounts of snow and ice, classes are rarely cancelled. Anyone attending this university should definitely invest in a good pair of shoes with excellent traction. However, once it warms up the weather can be absolutely beautiful."
College Freshman,1,They oversell the parking lots usually especially the dorm parking lots. So you paid for a parking spot in your dorm but you hardly get a parking spot because it's always full. I remember coming back from work around 10 or 11 and I'd have to park three blocks away because there was no spots open.
College Freshman,1,"Parking at the University of North Dakota is always a problem. Placement, spaces and prices are difficult"
College Sophomore,1,It was very windy and uncomfortable at times and the smell of the french fry factory carried in the wind.
College Student,1,"Personally, the school does not have everything together that they should. The professors are more focused on weeding out who will actually stick with the class than focusing on helping the students succeed. It takes weeks for the University to get back to you when you contact them. Overall, I would never recommend this college to a single person. "
College Sophomore,1,The parking at UND is terrible. The cost for permits are $150.00. However they do not have enough parking spots for all the student in the dorms so it really does not make sense. I have personally recieved two tickets because of the parking not being aware of the student parking. The parking lots are scattered across campus and split up into different sections so you have to know which letter is on your permit to park in certian areas.
College Sophomore,1,Awful. Buying a $150 parking pass DOES NOT guarantee a parking spot. Spots are limited and the parking office constantly patrols all lots making it overly  necessary to park in the correct area and within the lines.
College Junior,1,"I can't get any financial aid because my parents supposedly make to much.  My parents can't afford to pay for college so I am paying for it myself.  I am all on loans and I can barely get enough in loan money to cover tuition costs. There is financial aid for students that have disabilities ( ex. ADD), which I have but I do not qualify for that financial aid either because of my parents income."
College Sophomore,1,"There are a few lots on campus that are smaller than they should be. The parking permits are over priced and only made for one lot, so you're out of luck if you want to park anywhere else on campus. very limited street access parking."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is diffult to access and far away from residence halls. The different parking permits are confusing and result in many parking tickets. A shuttle is provided for transportation, but vehicle parking is frustrating and inflexible."
College Freshman,1,"It gets pretty cold in North Dakota, especially Grand Forks. The summer is warmer, but very windy. Be prepared to bundle up in order to walk between classes."
College Sophomore,1,"7 months out of 9 the weather is horrible at UND. We live in the armpit of North Dakota so it is very cold, snowy, and gross."
College Freshman,1,"The parties held are mostly for people to get drunk and have sex. There are a lot of sororities and fraternities available to join. There are rape fraternities at the University of North Dakota and there are girls in sororities that are loud, obnoxious, and slutty."
College Freshman,1,Its a good school I just don't like North Dakota.  They have a good aviation program and ROTC programs though.
College Freshman,1,"Since North Dakota is known for its terrible winters, the weather here sucks, but everyone knows that before they come here. The biggest inconvenience is with aviation and it makes it difficult to fly sometimes."
College Student,1,Spring is gonna be tough on this student from East Texas!  I don't live in the snow but I'm going to school in it!  It's cold!!!!
College Freshman,1,"North Face Capital – The on-going joke is that if hell-freezes over, we might get a late start. Maybe. Don't waste your time wishing for class to to cancelled even though we get TONS of snow it's not uncommon for temperatures to drop into the negative 20s with wind chill. Honestly, it's miserable so just remember to bundle up with layers because they crank the heat in classrooms. Silver lining? Campus is gorgeous when it snows! And there's usually always someone giving away free hot chocolate."
College Freshman,1,"The worst!!! Always cold. Always windy. Yes, you will need to have multiple winter coats. I have 4."
College Freshman,1,"Seriously, this is the most terrible weather I've been in. I'm from WI, and it's awful."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The University of North Dakota is the worse school I have even taken a class from. The teachers do not know what is going on most of the time and it is apparent they could care less about the students. The staff at the school is unwilling to talk to students in a productive manner and honestly seem like they have a stick up their huge butts. UND is money-hungry while offering poor educational classes. I took my online class in one day and got an A. I did not get a transcript from that class and it is apparent no one monitors the online classes. The quality of education sucks. Who are all these foreign teachers they are hiring? What is going on UND?? Get your act together. In conclusion, I want my money back your worthless pile of crap school."
College Junior,1,"If I Can Do It All Over Again – If I can do this whole after high school thing all over again I'd wait to have kids, wait to go to college until I was officially positive what I wanted to for sure do, and I'd save up lots of money because life away from home is a heck of a lot harder if you don't have any money saved up."

Niche User,5,I loved campus when I visited a couple of times can't wait to be there in the fall of 2020!! Woo Hoo!
Freshman,5,"Ever since I came to Bethel its been nothing but good times, its really easy to make friends and come out of one's shell. The professors care about the students and will make sure to help in any way."
Niche User,5,"When I attended Bethel College for a college visit, I felt very welcomed. everyone on campus opened my mother and me with open arms and a warm smile on their face."
Freshman,5,"Very nice place, friendly staff and students. Seem as if they are there to help, not to see you fail."
Freshman,5,"I loved the tour that was given to me on my visit.  The campus is beautiful with so many trees.  The cafeteria was very clean.  The food choices were superior.  Since I am a science major, I was excited to see a new science building.  I was also impressed with the amount of research opportunities in the science department.  The freshman dorms were clean.  The staff members I met were very knowledgeable about Bethel and the opportunities provided there."
Senior,5,"Bethel College is an excellent place to receive an education. Professors are extremely helpful and want to do all they can, but you also have to be in touch with yourself so that can you see what needs to be done or ask for help. Bethel can sometimes be demanding, but if you reach out and work hard, most of the resources are there. However, not everything you will need is within the college. For example, I knew that I wanted to pursue studying a foreign language, and chose German - then I studied abroad for 9 months. One of my best decisions was taking that opportunity. Doing something like that can help you appreciate your school even more! Bethel offers so much to its students, but you have to take your own initiative as well, even if it can often feel uncomfortable. We all get scared and nervous. Bethel has helped me realize that I can turn those hardships into something valuable. I know that I am never alone, no matter how I feel. I am more at ease in this supportive community."
Niche User,5,The faculty is extremely kind and concerned with each and every student. Each student is noticed by the faculty to ensure a positive and promising experience and education through the school.
College Junior,5,"Bethel is known as the Harvard of the Plains, and it is for good reason. Academics here are challenging, and that is recognized by employers, who look highly on potential employees with degrees from this school! To have a degree from Bethel holds more weight then the same degree from a state school would."
College Junior,5,"I love the classes that are offered. I have yet to be disappointed by a lack of class choices. My professors are very engaging, know students by their names, and do an incredibly good job at being available to help students outside of class times! The largest class I have been in here had 30 students."
College Junior,5,"I feel incredibly safe on campus. Often, I am up late studying, but I never worry about walking around campus alone at night. Both the campus and community feel very safe!"
College Junior,5,"I live in what we call a mod, which is a communal living set up where nine people live together with a communal living space and bathroom. You choose who you live with, so, essentially, I am living with eight of my best friends! We have a blast! Admittedly, sometimes it is hard to do homework with so much going on, but I never feel that my social life is lacking."
College Junior,5,"A good number of our teams are in building seasons (yes, that is a polite way of saying we could be better), but we have a stellar golf program with one of the best courses in the state (Sand Creek), and also a historically superb tennis team. Student involvement in sports is very high, with a majority of students also involved in athletics. The fan base from the community is amazing for the size of the school and the town!"
College Junior,5,"Bethel has become my home. I love the community, and the people who I live with. Bethel is big enough to offer a diverse set of classes, yet small enough to have classes that are engaging and feel personal (I am in several classes this semester with under 10 people). I love that I know the names of most of the people that I pass on the sidewalks. As cliche as it may sound, Bethel is a place I feel like I belong!"
College Senior,5,You can really build connections to find a job that you will enjoy after college.
College Senior,5,We have some great Faculty Members who look out for every student on campus!
College Junior,5,"We're a dry campus but people often don't follow those rules. Most of it is just social and as a person who doesn't drink, I've never felt pressured by my friends to drink or made to feel bad for not drinking."
College Junior,5,The professors here really care about you as a person and can provide individual help due to the small class sizes.
College Sophomore,5,All my professors are very knowledgeable and the class sizes are small.  We have lots of courses to choose from and have several strong programs
College Sophomore,5,I love Bethel.  It has been a great place for me to grow in many areas of my life.  I love playing soccer and singing in choir.  Bethel had everything I wanted in a school so I would choose it again.
College Junior,5,I am a social work major wanting to go into law enforcement. The degree doesn't exactly fit my career choice but my advisor works tirelessly to give me a variety of experiences to help me in Law enforcement.
College Junior,5,I am a social work major wanting to go into law enforcement. The degree doesn't exactly fit my career choice but my advisor works tirelessly to give me a variety of experiences to help me in Law enforcement.
College Freshman,5,The career services are great at Bethel. Students get emails every once in a while with job opportunities on campus and from the Newton area. I have already found a part-time job in the Alumni Relations office and I have only been here for around three weeks.
College Freshman,5,"Although I have only been here for around three weeks, Bethel already feels like home."
College Junior,5,"Classes are a big part of what makes Bethel great.  We have so many professors that stay late and come in early, outside of their office hours time, to help even just one student who may be struggling in their class.  Bethel's small class sizes make individualized attention a priority, and that for me has been such a big factor in my success in college. Bethel also offers a wide variety of majors and classes.  And if your major isn't offered, then you can work with an advisor to create an individualized major!"
College Junior,5,"Bethel is the place to be if you want to get connections.  So many alumni have gone on to do great things and be leaders in their industry.  Bethel puts a big emphasis on alumni relations, so we often have alumni come talk to us and connect with us on campus.  This is a great opportunity for students to meet someone who works in their field of interest, and it's a great networking opportunity for potential internships/jobs.  I'm interested in medicine, and Bethel has helped get me connected with alumni that are doctors.  They are always eager to have me come shadow them and they are a huge help!"
College Junior,5,"Bethel College is a very safe place to be at all times of the day and night.  We have very little crime on our campus and in the Newton/North Newton community in general.  However, our campus does have several safety measures in place, such as emergency phones.  We also have campus security information readily available, and everyone is made aware of the safety procedures at the beginning of each school year.  I often work late nights in the library, and I feel very safe walking back to my room on campus even late at night."
College Freshman,5,"Even though I have only been attending Bethel for around three weeks, I already feel like I am an important member of the community. Everyone is so genuine and the professors really do care about your success."
College Junior,5,The professors here are amazing. They are always willing to meet with students one on one. They have study sessions the night before exams for last minute questions which is very helpful as well. The classes are diverse and it is a genuine liberal arts education.
College Junior,5,It means something to be a Bethel grad. Whenever I tell people that I go to Bethel their eyes light up. The career center is very helpful on campus and the alumni are great.
College Junior,5,"The professors are dedicated to helping you learn. For the size of Bethel, there is a wide variety of courses. Classes are small so it is easy to get to know your professor and classmates, making discussion less intimidating."
College Senior,5,"Our professors are top-notch. We have a staggering amount of Ph.D's who know their stuff. The workload is certainly more, but nothing more egregious than a peer school."
College Senior,5,"We have fun, but know when to get work done. A ""work hard, play hard"" mentality."
College Sophomore,5,"As a gay student at a religiously affiliated college, I am amazed how progressive and excepting Bethel has been. In fact, most professors would highly discourage homophobic or closed minded individuals from attending."
College Senior,5,"Honestly, what can we say with this limited space?"
College Sophomore,5,Its gonna happen... but you don't have to participate. Nearly all of my friends participate but I have not had a drop of alcohol yet.
College Senior,5,There are only a few spiders and dead bodies.
College Senior,5,I can't describe in 50 characters how great it is.
College Sophomore,5,"Bethel is known as being academically rigorous, and area employers know so. Applicants with a Bethel degree are commonly sought after more so than other applicants."
College Sophomore,5,"I've attended several colleges, and Bethel is far better than the others in my opinion. Professors are incredibly intelligent and could even teach you about fields other than their own. Classes are usually very small, and that creates a comfortable atmosphere to learn and interact with your classmates. The small classes also keep you engaged in the content. The classrooms in Will Academic Center are very advanced and packed with technology. Easily they best environment to learn in on campus. It houses the Department of Business and Economics, and the Department of Nursing."
College Sophomore,5,"Considering nursing is our most popular program... I typically always fell safe because I know there are trained medical personal always close by. Many students also practice pacifism and strongly promote peace. Lighting could be improved... but they seem to but constantly updating that issue. Very minimal theft and we have close ties with the local police department. The police department is actually across the street, so response time is unparalleled."
College Junior,5,"Bethel College not only offers rigorous academic instruction and numerous opportunities for participation, but also all the resources that you need to build a successful and fulfilling life.  Bethel's professors come in early and stay late to help even just one student in their class who might be struggling.  Campus faculty, staff, and student leaders go out of their way to make sure everyone finds their place at Bethel, whether that be through student activities, clubs, sports, or just hanging out in the Caf.  I am in the best place, with the best people, experiencing the best opportunities.  Bethel can be just about anything you want it to be, and I'm so glad that I chose it to be my home for four years."
College Sophomore,5,"Some buildings are rather outdated, but they are maintained to a good standard and provide unique housing options to fit your taste. I was concerned with housing when I was searching for colleges, but have really appreciated the relaxed nature of housing at Bethel. The residential community really makes living on campus enjoyable and weekends exciting."
College Sophomore,5,"Bethel College uses a rigorous academic curriculum paired with highly passionate and knowledgable faculty to truly offer a superior higher education. Bethel students are among the most motivated and eager individuals I have ever met. There is a common phrase on campus, know as ""Bethel busy"", which means Bethel students are commonly heavily involved around campus. And its very true. You will be successful at Bethel."
College Junior,5,I absolutely love Bethel College. It has helped me grow academically as well as spiritually. This is a great place to get involved with many different things and find out who you are. I have grown up so much in the past three years and I believe that Bethel has shaped me to be a great citizen of the world. The professors here are always willing to help however they can. They make the curriculum difficult but give everyone the resources to succeed.
College Junior,5,"I would choose Bethel again for the strong feeling of community. Due to the small campus and student enrollment, everyone knows everyone. You are able to develop relationships with professors because they know your name. At Bethel you aren't a number. The professors care about you and your future and want to help you succeed."
College Junior,5,Professors love getting one on one time with students. All it takes is an email to a professor to set up a time to meet about possible problems in the class. The profs here are all very easy to work with
College Senior,5,"Bethel is a well-known school in the area, very easy to get a job after you graduate."
College Senior,5,"I never lock my door, I feel very safe here and I trust my peers."
Recent Alumnus,5,Class sizes are small and professors truly care about student success. They all know who I am and value my input in class. We use first names and even have class dinners outside of school on occasion. You can befriend your instructors here.
College Freshman,5,"Professors really care about the topic they are teaching and care about the students as well. Courses and course work are a bit harder than many schools, but this is simply because they want to make sure students are getting a good education. Class sizes are quite small, which makes for a more comfortable environment for students to have discussions and ask any questions that they may have. The only downside of a small college such as Bethel is that if there is something that you really want to specify in, they may not have all the classes you need."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I have never felt unsafe while on campus. The police station is across the street, and everyone is so familiar with each other, crime is rarely an issue."
College Senior,5,"The professors really care about me. All of my professors know who I am, what activities I am involved in, and what my future plans are. They are incredibly helpful and always eager to assist me in anyway possible. They have helped me get jobs/internships over the summer, and they continue to prepare me for after graduation."
College Freshman,5,"I feel extremely safe here on campus. Located in a smaller town, you don't hear about much crime or violence. Many students who are from bigger cities comment on how much safer and at ease they feel on campus."
Recent Alumnus,5,I feel very at home and the community is excellent. I feel as though I have the opportunity to excel in every aspect of college life here.
College Freshman,5,"After taking a year off after high school to do voluntary service, I was a bit nervous about the transition back to school. However, after the first few days here at Bethel, my worries were put to rest. Bethel is such a welcoming place. After just a few weeks here, I feel like part of a tight-knit community. I also really appreciate the small class sizes. I feel so much more comfortable to ask for help if I need clarification on something, and the professors are approachable and seem to genuinely care about the success of their students. I would choose Bethel again in a heartbeat."
College Sophomore,5,I love my classes and my professors are very knowledgeable and willing to actually help students be the best they can be.
College Sophomore,5,"Bethel's small size makes for a tight knit community of students and faculty. The Liberal Arts Education provided here allows for participation across a wide spectrum from athletics to the arts and humanities, all while receiving a quality education in a variety of major programs of study."
College Freshman,5,From what I've seen and heard from friends for a small private college we have a very nice weight room and track field.
College Sophomore,5,He has to be the best if it's ranked 3rd in the nation and is mostly known for academics and our exquisite nursing program
College Student,5,"I love this school, it brings all of the things I want to do plus my education and makes it easy to ""do it all""."
Junior,4,"Bethel is a small private school  in a charming town where there are lots of opportunities to grow as a person and academically. The professors here are fantastic and the courses are rigorous, yet not impossible. One thing to know is that if you want to part, there are people for that, if you don't, there are people for you too! The dorms aren't anything special and neither is the food, but Mojo's, the coffee house on campus is amazing!"
Junior,4,Bethel College is a pretty good college. These last two years that i have been there the professors have helped me out so much because they want to see me succeed and make it. I feel comfortable on the campus and everyone there is really nice and they will welcome you with warm arms. With it being a small campus it is a bit easy to get to know the students and staff all over campus. Bethel is just an overall pretty good school and i would reccomend it to any high school seniors or college transfers.
Junior,4,"I loved how personable the campus was. As a transfer student from a private school then to D1 school and then to Bethel, I felt at home. The only thing that stopped me from giving a 5/5 rating would be the school graduation requirements. It's a mennonite affiliated college but I'm not religious so I struggle with finding any enjoyment in completing the requirements."
Freshman,4,"Bethel College is a smaller community that invests time in each and every student. Without the large campus feel, the school focuses on making sure each student is successful by providing qualified educators, an abundance of resources, and community involvement activities. Instead of only making sure students are taking classes, they provided community service opportunities and extracurricular activities to further the social ability of students."
College Sophomore,4,I love all my teachers. The small class sizes are great.
College Sophomore,4,"I have never felt peer pressured to do something I did not want to do. I have also not heard from anyone else of peer pressure to drink or do drugs. There definitely is drinking, but there's going to be drinking anywhere you go. I feel very safe on campus."
College Senior,4,Professors are always willing to help with anything you would need to succeed. They really care about how well you do.
College Senior,4,I think we have a great housing accommodations. I really like the atmosphere of the Mods.
College Senior,4,"I would choose Bethel again because of the community feeling. I really like how big my class sizes are and how the professors are always willing to work with you. I also am involved in many organizations and have some leadership roles, which i think will look great on a resume!"
College Junior,4,We have a variety of classes in many subjects with very knowledgable professors.
College Junior,4,We have a lot of diversity on campus of different forms. This sometimes caused tension but it also opens up a lot of opportunities for good conversation.
College Junior,4,Professors are incredibly helpful in getting you internships which can and often do lead to careers.
College Junior,4,Campus housing is great. It really helps build community and is helpful for meeting new people and forming connections.
College Junior,4,Bethel college has really helped me grow as a person more so through the community of the college than through the classes though the classes that I take for my major are very helpful and informative.
College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of opportunities to get in touch with many former students or internships, you just have to put yourself out there."
College Sophomore,4,"I really have enjoyed my on campus living experience the last 2 years, with the close proximity to class and other buildings.  I also love that all my friends live relatively close to me."
College Junior,4,Academics are the biggest part of Bethel. They put a lot of time into it and value commitments.
College Junior,4,It's a dry campus but it happens.
College Junior,4,There is a large portion of time devoted to making sure people feel safe.
College Junior,4,I feel very safe on campus. There are very few instances of people getting in dangerous situations.
College Junior,4,"The on-campus housing is very near the buildings for classes, which is nice."
College Junior,4,"What I love about Bethel is the opportunity to be involved as you want. I am in three high-level music ensembles and am not a music major. Almost everyone on campus is involved in something, whether it be sports, music, or campus organizations. It creates a good sense of community and definitely contributes to a great liberal arts education."
College Freshman,4,"In general I feel very safe on campus. Crimes likes stealing or graffiti are not very common at all. I do, however, know a classmate who has been a victim of sexual assault, but I am not clear on whether or not it happened on campus or not."
College Junior,4,Bethel is perfect for someone who wants a college experience that includes professors and community to drive you to be the best you can be. Standards are high and expected to be met. It is a top rated school in Forbes Magazine for a reason. Many people who continue their masters express great ease regarding assignments due to the great educational foundation Bethel College provides.
College Junior,4,"Living on campus has helped me feel a deep sense of belonging at Bethel.  While some students do choose to live off campus, the majority of traditional students life in the residence halls on campus.  There are three residence halls.  One residence hall is just for first-time freshman, and the other two are for everyone else.  Haury Hall, the one that freshman live in, is a traditional residence hall with double rooms and community bathrooms.  Living in Haury definitely helped me meet fellow classmates that I may not have interacted with otherwise.  Voth Hall is the newest residence hall and is has suite-style apartments, with two people to a room that share a bathroom with two other people."
College Freshman,4,The athletic teams themselves here at Bethel are pretty decent and the fan support is amazing.
College Junior,4,The faculty and staff take reports very seriously and work really hard to make everyone feel safe.
College Junior,4,"Bethel has a tough science program. They have very difficult classes, but these classes prepare students well for future graduate school."
College Junior,4,"Generally, Bethel feels pretty safe. There are some areas that are not very light in the evening, but otherwise I feel safe on campus."
College Senior,4,"We've had a few issues recently where minority students have not felt included, but they subsided."
College Sophomore,4,I've never felt unsafe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,I live in the mods (basically 9 people who decide they want to live together). Community in that sort of a situation is easy and really fun.
College Sophomore,4,"A small school. Comes with positives and negatives. Getting really involved (""Bethel-Busy"") is crazy easy. Academically, a very rigorous institution. Stress is normal, and becomes sort of a fact of life. Community among students is generally really great. School monetary resources aren't the greatest (again, it's a small institution) but Bethel is a great place to be a big fish in a small pond."
College Sophomore,4,"Bethel College focuses on academics, while athletics are typically considered a privilege. All athletes are first and foremost students. Bethel excels in academics... but that leaves slightly less time and attentions to sports. Rightfully so. Well over half of all students are involved in athletics, and they are a big factor of the campus atmosphere. Especially intramural sports, where nearly everyone has opportunity to participate throughout the year. Bethel's athletic facilities are incredible considering our size and focus on academia."
College Junior,4,I live in Warkentin Court also known as the mods. The social atmosphere is the reason I love it so much. Dorms are never going to be amazing no matter where you go. The mods are a home away from home for me. I live with eight other girls and can walk and see my friends in other mods. It is pretty great.
College Junior,4,"I enjoy living on campus because it is so close to everything and I am able to see more people. Because I live on campus, I only have to take a couple of steps before reaching my friends in a different mod. The dorms aren't the best quality, but they aren't awful and the perks of living on campus outweigh the perks of living off campus."
College Junior,4,Bethel has a wide variety of students that attend every year and that is shown with the student involvement on campus. There are so many things to get involved with and be a part of. It is amazing how many different personalities can feel at home at one place but Bethel makes it happen!
College Junior,4,"I haven't really looked into this for myself, but many of my friends have had success."
College Senior,4,"We are not the most diverse school; however, we are very accepting."
College Senior,4,"If you have a problem, the CA's care about your safety, overy you breaking rules."
College Senior,4,"There isn't as big of a variety of classes as a state school. However, the professors are amazing, and willing to create a class if there is enough interest."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are plenty of connections through Bethel in the state of Kansas, and professors, advisers, and student life offer a lot of support for post-graduation success. It differs slightly if you are out of state. Most connections are simply near Bethel."
College Senior,4,College just would not be the same living off campus. The dorms are a great way to hang out with friends and meet new people.
College Freshman,4,The value of a degree from Bethel is much greater than a degree from a state school. Staff work closely with students to prepare them for jobs after graduation.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Some of the dorms are old and need renovation, but overall I love living here. The atmosphere is amazing, and the dorms are beyond sufficient for living."
College Sophomore,4,The school has a very good academic program
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty comfortable here
College Sophomore,4,It's been a good experience so far
College Junior,4,"I love Bethel a lot! I feel like I will be able to function well in the real world, once I get out. i would absolutely choose bethel again because I feel like I am growing a lot as a person. I like some convos because I learn a lot about other experiences"
College Sophomore,4,I have heard from a lot of friends that bethel helps set up job internships very efficiently.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe. Always police driving around checking on campus, and the staff and Ca's take their jobs very seriously."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school, but the a lot of students feel the need to be coddled every step of the way. Teachers are great though!"
College Freshman,4,The schooling and education on campus is top of the line
College Freshman,4,school taught me how to never give up when things get hard.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy the music program.  The teachers really care and are always engaged to help you learn.
College Freshman,4,"Bethel is truly a great school. The people here are very friendly and fun. I was unsure about this place when I first got here but I soon fit in with some friends and now I'm loving it. The professors are very understanding of you show up or have a reasonable reason for lot being there, and most of the time of you set up that you are diligent they will be more understanding about late work. For a freshman who was deathly afraid of college it is a very nice and easy transition. I would pick this school again."
College Sophomore,4,Professor's are well rounded and always want the best for you.
College Sophomore,4,Plenty of people I know that graduated and already had jobs in their field of studying
College Sophomore,4,You're college experience is what you make it out to be either fun or boring. This school plans events and things to get stundents involved and not always be stuck in the dorm. When there's nothing really to do we have other cities not that far to go to and have fun but most people don't. It's your college experience and what you do with it. I've had  significant amount of fun just being me and being positive.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a lot of racial diversity on campus. Generally the campus is very accepting of religious or sexual beliefs. Politics is mostly one to avoid, I'd say. "
College Junior,2,"Students don't generally believe other students. They would take the side of the football player before the side of the victim. Student attitudes toward safety are shockingly negative. Many students don't care about what happens on campus. Student life does their best to deal with sexual assault and harassment charges, but every system had its flaws."
Recent Alumnus,2,Our teams are not and have not been successful while I've been here and the athletic facilities are relatively poor aside from the stadium. The atmosphere around sports and sporting events is friendly.
College Sophomore,2,"Bethel is not good at sports. We have good facilities though. The school spirit is very low. This is definitely a school you should come to primarily if academics interest you, because it seems like those that come solely for athletics end up leaving. "
College Freshman,2,They not to strick . The police is pretty small not to much so thier not really on anything aslong as you respect  them
College Junior,2,"While there are places to go in Newton, the attraction wears off fairly fast. There are a few locations where students are regular patrons, and we do have good shopping access. But the cultural, sports/recreation, and positive attitudes towards students aspects are severely lacking."
College Sophomore,2,"There is practically no nightlife at Bethel.  A few places in Newton.  If you want nightlife, have to go to Wichita."
College Sophomore,2,"Applied for a lot of outside scholarships, unable to receive any."
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing in Newton, Kansas."
Junior,1,"Awful school. They are not flexible at all with classes, very limited academic options. They are not helpful with financial aid, they changed my FAFSA number AFTER I was enrolled. Small campus with nothing to do. It feels like an average size high school with how teachers treat the students, not a college. 

The athletic facilities & teams are all awful as well. This school will put you in 30-40 thousand in loan debt with nothing to show for it. 

Save your money & go to a public university and get a better & more recognizable degree."
College Senior,1,We do not have a greek life system on Bethel's campus.
College Junior,1,We do not have or need Greek life.
College Freshman,1,We do not have a Greek life and I wish they would add that to our school.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have fraternities nor sororities.
College Freshman,1,No transportation at all. Campus is easy to get around. Public transportation is not an option
College Freshman,1,Easy school to get into. Application process is very easy and admissions are very nice and will do their best to get you in to school
College Freshman,1,There's no buses really available . Its not the main city a mile down is where the buses start to run

Senior,5,I love this school. I have established strong connections with my professors and classmates due to the small class sizes and the attentiveness of all staff at the school. They really care about their students!
Senior,5,"Whittier College has made the transition to online learning as simple and effective as possible. Instead of forcing us to be overwhelmed with a full load of Zoom classes, we're now on a 7 week module system taking only 2 classes per module. This allows for enhanced focus on a smaller portion of classes while still getting the necessary credits for the year. It has been beyond beneficial for me during the pandemic."
Freshman,5,"I am only an incoming freshmen, but I already feel so welcomed by all the staff and students. I love and appreciate all the work they've been doing during this pandemic."
Freshman,5,The zoom meetings to welcome freshmen have been very effective and resourceful. I can't wait to be a part of their community.
Freshman,5,"Personally, my professors made the transition to online classes a very smooth and accommodating process. I did not feel like I was given less or more work from my professors. Instead, I felt less motivated to do homework because I was distracted at home, but that was on my end. Resources were still available, even after the semester was over. I was still able to go to office hours and connect virtually with other faculty.  I also was still able to connect with my classmates. The experience is definitely not the same as being in class, but I still think Whittier did a good job."
Junior,5,The professors transitioned really well into remote learning and gave students enough leverage to catch up.
Freshman,5,"Excited that they invited to visit the campus after watching me play football, I really liked the campus, will ove to be able to attend and play in their football team"
Freshman,5,"Whittier College offers a very welcoming environment with many resources for students including free tutoring, printing, and counseling. Moreover, the smaller  student body size allows for a tight-nit and supportive community."
Alum,5,"Whittier College is one of the most unique and fascinating liberal arts colleges in the country. 

Professors at Whittier are easily accessible and always willing to help outside of class. One aspect of the school I will always be grateful for was how amazing our faculty was when it came to helping you learn and grow as a student. 

The college taught me not only how to be mindful, become a better problem-solver, and critical thinker. But most importantly, how to build meaningful relationships. Through all the vicissitudes and changes that occurred in the U.S. during my four years here, it was great to see how students from all walks of life developed relationships, came together and learned from one another. 

If you are looking for a highly diverse school that will challenge you, allow you to feel valued and respected on campus, and provide you a purposeful liberal arts education, consider Whittier College."
Senior,5,"I was able to get a lot of attention from the professors. There are always opportunities to get involved and the professors really want you to excel. They put teaching above everything else and are willing to sit down with you for a while and discuss content and career options. Plus, the facilities are pretty nice."
Senior,5,"I enjoyed the small class sizes, allowing for more easy access to professors. This was very helpful when I had any questions which benefited my learning."
Sophomore,5,Very accommodating and has positive staff and attitude. I feel welcomed and know they are behind me and my continued education.
Freshman,5,"CAAS, Center for Advising and Academic Success, is always providing students with different events. Some of the workshops include resume building, adjusting to college,and more.Whittier College uses Handshake so if you get Work Study in your Financial Aid Packet then you go on Handshake and apply to different on campus jobs. 
The classes are small so you get to know your Professor better as well as get one on one help if needed. The Professors all have Office Hours sometime during the week. Office Hours are there so that if a student has a problem or needs an answer they can reach the professor easily during those hours."
Sophomore,5,I like that I have the opportunity to get close with professors since Whittier college is a small school. Generally the professors are around in case I have some questions about class topics. I also like that the classes are relatively small so there is not like 300 people classes.
Sophomore,5,"Overall Whittier college is a really good school. There's a lot of diversity with all the students and faculty. It is definitely a smaller campus, meaning the class sizes are also smaller, so if you're looking for a large stadium type of classroom setting this most likely isn't the school for you. Since the class sizes are smaller, it's a lot easier working one on one with your professors. Great experience so far, it also is a very pretty campus, although small, but it does make it easier finding all of your classes."
Junior,5,"I am going into my Junior year at Whittier College and I can tell anyone who is considering it as there school, or is already planning to attend in the Fall, that it is an excellent choice. This is especially true if you are looking for a campus where it is easy to meet people and is not overly congested with a large student population. Here you can make genuine connections with fellow students and professors/faculty that you will most likely see on a day-to-day basis. There are also plenty of advantages to going to a private college with a smaller than average student body: smaller class sizes that allow you to make a deeper, more personal connection with educators, a decent sized campus that is easy to navigate, plenty of recreational activities throughout the school year to help alleviate stress, and so much more."
Freshman,5,The diversity that it offers as well as the small class size.  The staff at Whittier are very professional and extremely helpful when needed.
Freshman,5,"I love the liberal arts aspect and love how small and tight knit our school community is.  Being right in the center of Whittier provides easy access to local restaurants and close to downtown LA, Disneyland, beach, other LA county towns. Being able to make lifelong friends is also amazing and getting to know every single professor."
Freshman,5,"Everything about Whittier is great. It’s a small campus, with small class sizes. Professors are there to help whenever needed. The only that should probably change is the food."
Alum,5,"Attending Whittier College was a blessing in disguise. Although my approach in going to college was to pursue professional sports, I came out with a business degree and the 1st in my family to graduate college. With all of the madness of being a teenage parent and life's drama in San Francisco, being away at college gave me the space to think long term and make valuable connections to better my life and my family."
Niche User,5,I have had the opportunity to take a campus tour and found the environment to be inviting. Also I have spoken to some Admissions counselors who have been to my school. All have been so kind and helped me through the Admissions process.
Niche User,5,"It was greta. I had lots of fun. I hope to be able to go back and experience  the campus life soon.  She contacted previous students who believed in saving their notes, which I was able to utilize.In the end, my efforts proved to be worth the time and stress. I scored a five on the test, learned how to teach myself the content, and learned to seek out more resources, whether it be through teachers or videos. These newfound skills will enable me to thrive in the intimidating, self-learning environment present in the UC system."
Junior,5,Small class size and excellent professors. Easily accessible and pretty campus. Academic and professional counseling.
Sophomore,5,Such a positive environment! The staff is ready and willing to help no matter how big or small the question or problem is. It is a smaller class size so you get to know your peers and professors better and it helps to form connects to kick start your career.
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I had a positive experience during my first year at Whittier College. From the very beginning, I took classes where my professors weren't afraid to stay after class to help me out."
Alum,5,"I was going through extremely rough personal times during my undergrad years. I am grateful that Whittier College was a place for me to feel safe during these rough, unspeakable times. I am even more grateful for the fact that I received an excellent education and experience at this college. 
Finding a job after graduation was extremely difficult. I found a job through Whittier College and it was terrible. I won't name the company, but I was being asked to work for 10 hours in one day or just 1 hour a day. I feel that jobs offered through the college should be vetted. Other than that, it is still an excellent school and I will always be grateful for Whittier College and all it has taught me during my time there."
Junior,5,"whittier, so far, has provided me with an excellent education, however, i do think it lacks more student life activities. it is especially is uninclusive of its commuter students which is most likely why i feel it needs improvement in student life activities."
Sophomore,5,"One of the best things about Whittier College is that it is a small diverse college. When looking at colleges and deciding which one I wanted to go to Whittier was on my top list. I really like how they everyone connected which will be by email, class facebook group, social media accounts."
Niche User,5,"I was recently admitted to Whittier College, and also recruited to play lacrosse there. I have grown up always going to the school for events such as games. I love the school and everything about it, however if I could change anything, I would update the dorms and clean them up a bit. Just for easier more comfortable living. Other than that everything else is great."
Freshman,5,My favorite part about this school is how caring the professors are and how willing they are to help you succeed! One thing that can change is add more classes for the liberal arts program.
Freshman,5,"Whittier College is such an amazing school. All the staff in the offices bring  such positive vibes to the campus and make you feel welcome. This school has a really good reputation and I love to be part of that. I would not change anything about this school because everyone, even students, are there to help you succeed and become a mature adult. They make sure we are put in the right path. The professors are very nice and help us do a great job. The campus itself is beautiful with such amazing flowers and trees. It brings such a great environment."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy the small campus feel and the ability to connect with faculty. It is the perfect school for those who need a smaller class size in order to succeed. I enjoy the sense of the community and promise of networking that goes on. The energy of the campus is very balanced. There are loads of resources that benefit us while we are attending as well as transitioning out of college.
Junior,5,"Whittier College is truly an amazing place. The classes are fantastic, the people are great and the overall quality of campus life is satisfactory."
Niche User,5,Whittier College is a very unique environment where people can feel safe. People take their academic very seriously in order to graduate within four years.
Sophomore,5,Upon my first semester I fell in love with the campus because of it's gorgeous scenery and great views. The more I got to experience being a student and meeting new people/professors i realized that there is such a great learning environment that is safe and allows for great conversations and open dialogues about any issues being faced by any person/community.
Freshman,5,"Such a beautiful ""home-away-from-home"" campus. It really is worth the tuition, as there are so many opportunities and benefits that come with the school. The students are overall very diverse, nice, and most of all, respectful. The professors and faculty are so helpful, understanding, and they make themselves so approachable to the students."
Senior,5,"At first, I struggled to see the reason why I really wanted to attend Whittier College. But as I graduate early with a Business Major with a Concentration in Management, I finally realize the amazing education I was blessed with in liberal arts. I have a great knowledge in many areas in which I can utilize in the business I plan to work with. I definitely recommend this college as the professors truly care for your success. "
Freshman,5,"What I like about Whittier so far would have to be the people on campus and the class sizes! I love that I am able to interact between my professors and peers. Coming from a public school to now a private school...I am really enjoying the change. What I would like to see change here on campus would be the amount of people who go to sporting events. Having a huge crowd behind you whether you are doing good or not shows that the school had pride, regardless of the score. "
College Sophomore,5,"Though we don't have ""frats"" and ""sororities"", we have ""societies"", which only pertain to this college. Since joining one, there is always going to be backlash, but I think it's wonderful to have a group treat you as a family, especially if you're out-of-state. You also build all kinds of skills joining one that you can't really get in a regular setting."
College Junior,5,I love the courses I have taken at Whittier so far. The professors are excellent and they offer a huge amount of help.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my professors so much, I try to take classes with them again."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel entirely safe on Whittier, even with its open environment.

The Campus Security officers take their job seriously, and are worthy of respect."
College Sophomore,5,I certainly would choose my school again if I knew what I would be getting. Whittier is the only college for me. The community is like a slice of grace hidden away in the mountains of California.
College Freshman,5,"Professors know who you are, students aren't just a number."
College Freshman,5,I love where I work on campus. They are so welcoming.
College Freshman,5,"Campus provides us with health services whenever they are needed, and campus safety is available 24/7. We receive warning texts and emails whenever there is a safety threat, and we have guards roaming campus all the time."
Recent Alumnus,5,Someone reached out to me to answer any questions and provide help immediately after I began my application.
College Freshman,5,"At the end of everyday, I can safely say that I have learned something or that I had a meaningful conversation with someone in class or outside of the classroom."
College Freshman,5,Whittier College is great in helping its students succeed. I work for the Call center and I can say that most people are extremely happy with their time here at Whittier and have had a successful career.
College Freshman,5,"All the societies on campus are very active, even alumni return to the society gatherings!"
College Freshman,5,The professors and the staff work hard to help students succeed in what ever ways they can. They are very easy to talk to and will often times go out of their way to help.
College Freshman,5,Proffessors are great and easy to reach out too! You will learn as much as possible! Great curriculum that is slightly difficult.
College Freshman,5,"Feel safe all the time, nothing ever happens, campus police are everywhere."
College Sophomore,5,"My semester in Whittier College has gone great! It's just what I wanted in an education. It has the mixture of the size of a small high school classroom and a more vigorous curriculum. In addition to this, this school also has faculty and instructors that have time to focus more on the students since the classes are not always lecture halls of 100+ students."
College Junior,5,"I previously attended NYU, which is an exhilarating place with very little support. Whittier College has thus far been just as exciting, and much more supportive and accessible! I am so proud to be a Poet."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I am a recent alumn. Whittier College provided the best liberal arts experience I could have imagined! Small class sizes and remarkable instructors who treated each individual with respect and dignity. Whittier is a diamond in the rough as most people mistake it for a community college, but for those who have ever had the opportunity to visit the campus or sit in on a lecture, the one thing that can be linked between Whittier College and a community college is the word community itself! Whittier has an awesome community: faculty, staff, and students alike! It is because of my experience at Whittier that I have chosen to pursue and further my education in the medical field. This small liberal arts college showed me how to give back to my community and take ownership of the things that are important, like education a cleaner and greener planet, and the capacity to show compassion in every day situations."
College Sophomore,5,So much freedom to do whatever. It's awesome
College Sophomore,5,"Professors have an open door policy meaning you never have to schedule an appointment, just walk in. Courses are easy to get into since its a small school as well."
College Junior,5,Getting a place off campus it a lot cheaper then on campus
College Junior,5,"Love the math and physics department, professor and students are great. We have our own little community. I want to get my Ph.D."
Freshman,4,"Professors did an excellent job transitioning to online. They were well prepared, which eased the transition for students. They really made sure we did not lose the personal connection that the school is known for."
Freshman,4,"All of my classes moved to online at the start of the pandemic. Every single one of my professors did the best they could, but my forensic psychology professor was truly exceptional. She taught material online in the form of crime and forensics documentaries and films she had us watch, and even walked us through a mock trial entirely on Zoom."
Freshman,4,"When I stand in the middle of the campus, I feel at home. I feel calmness and security. The environment is so relaxing. It truly does contain a diverse and unique group of students, all of whom are friendly. Resources are readily accessible and approachable, as the staff are always accommodating. My only issue is that they do not have a lot of majors to choose from and for the cost, it definitely can make one question. I just wish they were more helpful with middle-income students in finding scholarships to pay for the tuition. (Not just loans) Overall, great but expensive school. Something to think about."
Senior,4,"Teachers were very understanding due to the shift of being home 24/7. They offered more time to work on assignments and offered more explanation on the assignments at hand. The school offered credit/no credit as an option, as well"
Junior,4,"I loved how small and tight knit the campus community is, it really gives students a chance to have that one on one time with faculty and advisors. There are a lot of things to get involved in on campus but because it is small getting into certain classes might be a challenge"
Freshman,4,Whittier College is a beautiful campus. Classes are small and teachers are easily accessible. The diversity at the school is wonderful and staff is friendly. So far the only upgrade I would make is to the baseball field.
Sophomore,4,Whittier College is the best option for a 4 year university because of how small it is. You feel very connected to your professors and they make you feel like you aren’t alone while you’re on this journey through college.
Alum,4,"I liked the diversity, the camaraderie, the student-to-professor ratio, and the small-school environment. Every school has it's problems, and throughout my experience it ranged from treatment of workers, representation of our students of color, and increased equality across the board - but those things have come a long way and students are very active in getting those changes."
Sophomore,4,"They are very inclusive and making sure people from different racial, or ethnic backgrounds feel included, as well as people with different gender identity or sexual orientation. There is much they try to provide for commuters as well as the overall student involvement."
Sophomore,4,Whittier College is overall a great campus. The small classes provide you to have time to ask and get questions answered by the professors. If I ever have any questions I email my professors and usually get a response within that same day. The campus is lovley and has many spots to sit and study.
Niche User,4,"The campus is a little spread out, so it may take a little to get used to, to try and get to classes. It does a great job at mixing contemporary life and history, specially since the school has been around for many years already."
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student from another four year liberal arts college. Comparing Whittier to my old school, I greatly enjoy the time that I spend on campus and in class. The professors are engaging and knowledgeable."
Senior,4,"I love how quiet the campus is and the small student body.  The amount of flexibility and support by the professors is astounding; they match you with a professor that teaches in the subject you are interested in pursuing, and it is easy to change.  Some of the secretaries are not very nice, but they are avoidable.  A drawback is they have frequently hired professors on and it is hard to constantly trial and error course plans.  They have a wide variety of classes at in the morning and early afternoon, but not as much at night.  As a commuter, I cannot speak for the food or housing, though I have heard many complaints."
Niche User,4,"I was recently accepted into Whittier. I visited the campus a few weeks ago and it is beautiful, small, and in a good location. Only problem I saw was that dorms seemed to be a bit of a hassle to get to and from."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman here, so far I can say that the college is friendly and the classes are interesting. Residence halls are old, dirty, and I've seen bugs in them, so they're definitely not the best. The food here is really good, at least in my opinion! I'm overall enjoying my time here so far."
Sophomore,4,Being a small school I enjoy the community and vibes that it has. Professors are helpful and make themselves available to the students.
Sophomore,4,I am entering my second year at Whittier college but so far academically enjoyed the school and majority of my professors. The campus is small however and have heard dorms are small and that the fire alarm goes off at night due to construction. But still that's how most dorms are if live on campus. I still have enjoyed the school better then I was anticipating going in and teachers have been helpful mostly in office hours
Sophomore,4,I love my professors and the knowledge I've acquired here. I wish there was more diversity and better food but other then that I've enjoyed this school.
Sophomore,4,"Whittier College has a fun and studious environment that is safe to live. uptown Whittier is nearby making it accessible to small cafes, a movie theatre, and boutiques etc. It has adequate resources for students with disabilities. Residential life is located on campus, making it easy for students who live on campus to get to class on time. In addition, there is a three-story library with access to computers, printers, study rooms, and MADLAB where students can rent laptops, chargers, and HDMI cords. For freshman, there are career fairs during orientation week. The Whittier College Career Center offers multiple job opportunities to Poets (Whittier College Students). There is a fine balance of healthy food at the C.I. (Campus Inn). There is also a bookstore, where you can order your textbooks,  stationary, etc. Whittier College has events that occur throughout the year. They include talent showcases, a variety of graduation ceremonies and just dance now competitions for freshman."
Sophomore,4,"Whittier College is very friendly and inclusive, as a campus and in the classroom. Whenever I am on campus, and I walk by any professor that I have had in the past, they say hello to me by name and will have conversation with me. There are so many opportunities to have academic help in the tutoring center, the library, and professor office hours. There is also many opportunities to speak about how one feels on anything occurring in the world. The campus is beautiful and is in the perfect part of the town of Whittier. It's so great to have my friend's be a part of my everyday experience as well."
Freshman,4,"I think I made the right choice coming to Whittier. I am absolutely in love with the campus and overall atmosphere of the school. I was worried about the size at first (it is quite small), but after attending my first semester I enjoy the fact that it allows for a more community-like experience. Everyone is so kind and welcoming. I also feel secure yet free. The food at the CI is amazing, there are so much options to choose from. I loved all my professors and classes so far. Also, uptown Whittier it just a close walk! It’s my favorite place to just Rome around when I’m bored!"
Freshman,4,I thoroughly enjoyed attending a small school such as Whittier. The people here are great as well as the overall culture. The residence halls could use some work.
Alum,4,Professors are excellent and really care about their students.  Admin transparency really needs work and the career center could some attention.
Junior,4,Whittier College is a private College smaller than the normal Cal States or Universities. Their smaller classroom provide advantages for students to be more involved in class and have more interactions with professors. Their unique programs and activities helped fellow students to have a more suitable environment and better involvement.
Junior,4,The professors are really helpful and are available most of the time. Students are real friendly here and it is a very diverse campus. Students can always get help from several services whether it be tutoring or searching for fellowships or scholarships to study abroad or gain experience for their future career.
Freshman,4,"Whittier College is a college that prides itself in its small size and, overall, diverse campus. The teachers are passionate about what they are teaching, they are incredibly understanding with you, and work with you to see what you want out of your future. In short, it is a small school for big dreams."
Niche User,4,I just started using Niche. It's simple to use. I haven't run into any problems. Has plenty of no essay scholarships.
Sophomore,4,"HONESTLY MY FIRST YEAR HERE AT WHITTIER WAS PRETTY CHALLENGING. BUT THEN AGAIN I HAD MENTORS WHO GUIDED ME AND IT WAS SUPER GREAT BECAUSE NOW I AM GIVING BACK TO MY COMMUNITY. THE ADVISORS REALLY HELP YOU OUT WITH YOUR ACADEMICS. THERE ARE SEVERAL PROGRAMS TO HELP YOU WITH ANY CHALLENGE YOU MAY BE FACING. ONLY THING THE SCHOOL REALLY HAS TO WORK ON IS GETTING NEW DORMS. THERE HAS BEEN AN UPGRADE IN PARKING AND BUILDINGS BUT NOT WHERE THE STUDENTS HOUSE AND THAT'S NOT WORTH $50,000 IF IT HASN'T HAD ANY NEW RENOVATIONS WITH LOW MAINTENANCE STAFF WHO NEEDS HELP AND GETS PAID LESS FOR A PRIVATE SCHOOL THAT CHARGES THEIR STUDENTS A LOT."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed the school very much. It's academic departments offer much needed learning and success to each of their students. Also, their athletics are top in their division. I sincerely loved the college life experience on the campus "
College Sophomore,4,"I've seen lots of people get in groups and go out partying, haven't done it myself however. Seems like everyone takes care of each other and make sure everyone's safe and having fun."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors can vary, but they're all willing to help in one way or another. The curriculum is challenging. The registration is brutal, lots of people can barely manage to get the classes they need to graduate. Study areas include the library, lounges in the dorm buildings, The Spot, really anywhere you see fit basically."
College Sophomore,4,I have yet to meet someone who treats me differently based on who I am. The diversity is wonderful.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't really see anyone whipping out drugs on sight, they usually do it off campus if anything."
College Sophomore,4,"Having only been here a year, it's been a great experience for me. I love it here."
College Sophomore,4,A degree from this school in my idea pulls weight. Its  a great school.
College Sophomore,4,Our teams are good for division three and the sports complex is amazing and available for non athletes as well.
College Sophomore,4,My school is great small class sizes and quality one on one time with professors at any given time
College Freshman,4,I love how the class size is small because it allows for professors to teach and help their students individually. There is a wide variety of courses available to students that fit their majors adequately.
College Freshman,4,Campus safety hass never been an issue for me I feel safe on campus no matter what time of day.
College Freshman,4,"As being part of the womens water polo team, i would have to say that sports are competitive and bring a lot of pride to our school. The athletic facilities on campus would have to be one of the best ive seen while exploring my college options.Team performance here is stellar and people have a lot of school spirit. The fans give off very positive and supporting energy."
College Freshman,4,"What makes my school unique is how united the students are as a whole I am gad to have chosen the school I will attend because I feel like this school cares about its student academic success more  the other schools. Not only does my school offer the tools to strive academically, it also insures success beyond graduating; most schools do not help with success after graduation. A unique factor about my school is that it is wiling to help with a student and makes it  their priority."
College Freshman,4,I haven't been here for very long but it's been good.
College Freshman,4,We're not known for our sports but everyone still loves it
College Sophomore,4,The school offers a wonderful work study program that many students utilize to their advantage.
College Sophomore,4,I have loved every professor I have been assigned to and have gotten along well with all of them.
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus is great! The people are friendly and I have never had an issue with my neighbors or roommates.
College Sophomore,4,"Our school actually has non-Greek fraternities and sororities, but our one charter societies are just as great! Getting in is as difficult as any other Greek society, but the rewards are astounding!"
College Sophomore,4,"People love Whittier football, water polo, baseball and volleyball games. They are all favored campus pastimes."
College Junior,4,"I have really enjoyed my time here. Though there are things I might change, you would find that at any school. I have established great friendships here, with both my peers and mentors, and find the work I do here to be valuable."
College Junior,4,"There are great opportunities for further education after Whittier, and for those looking to go into the job field after graduation, the prospects are good for that, too."
College Junior,4,"Whittier College isn't Greek-affiliated, but we do have societies, which are very similar to fraternities and sororities, aside from the housing. I pledged my freshman year and am so thankful I did for the bonds that I have with my sisters."
College Junior,4,"Whittier College has been one of the greatest choices I have made thus far. It is definitely a school where your experience is what you make of it. If you foster genuine connections with your peers and the faculty, you will have an abundance of opportunities during your time here!"
College Freshman,4,I love this school. it really works for me.
College Freshman,4,Campus safety is always driving around campus making sure everything is safe.
College Freshman,4,You aren't just a number here at whittier
College Freshman,4,"The professors can be pretty difficult, but are willing to help you when you hop on the struggle bus."
College Freshman,4,"The staff is pretty good at helping students with their academic success, and are great at when they do."
College Freshman,4,"The quality of the dorms really depends on which year you are. The freshman dorms are obviously the worst on campus. They do not have air conditioning, and freshman are pretty inconsiderate to other people when it comes to cleanliness. Overall, they are liveable and won't be bad if everyone works together. The dorms improve emensely as the years pass. The Junior and Senior dorms are great. The buildings are nice, the rooms are fairly spacious, and the facility does their best to keep everything in ship-shape."
College Freshman,4,"Sports are a huge part of life on campus. When walking through, it seems as though at least 80% of the students are involved in an athletic activity, and love doing so!"
College Junior,4,I am a kinesiology major and professors in this department are very educated in driven. What stood out to me most and has impacted my life tremedmously is poli-sci professor Mcbride. He connects with his students and really cares for their success not only in the classroom but outside as well.
Sophomore,2,"I enjoy the professors and the convenience of it being so close to my house. However, if your not a social person, i would recommend going there. The campus is very small and there are barely any students. Its hard to make any social interaction, especially when you commute. The academics are awesome tho, highly recommend for scholars out there. So far, I haven't had the best time of my life in at Whittier College. They do have a good cafeteria and gym."
College Junior,2,"Although, Whittier College does not have a greek life it does have societies. The societies are indeed very bad. They have terrible reputations for being unpopular. They are not wanted amongst most students and the events they hold do not have a high attendance."
College Sophomore,2,I really do not think that this college cares at all about the students' well-being.
College Sophomore,2,"I honestly would not recommend anyone attend this school.  Of course, there will be the rare few that actually enjoy what this campus has to offer, but I am among a large group of students who are fed up with how this school operates.  That is why I plan on transferring out once this semester comes to an end."
College Sophomore,2,"It seems that basically everyone who joins a ""society"" as they are called on our campus, sticks their nose in the air towards most non-society members.  They go beyond having simple pride in what they have become a part of, but take everything too seriously and tend to ""look down upon"" others."
College Sophomore,2,"The school disregards our overall safety and seems to not understand the every day stresses we go through just with classes alone, not to mention that most students here are part of some sort of extracurricular activity (sports, societies, etc.)  It seems as though most professors, and especially the ""higher-ups"" (President, Dean) seem to only care about the financial aspect of everything."
College Freshman,2,"I personally don't like living in the dorms. We have to share four showers between 45 girls. There is always hair everywhere. Some people don't know how to respect the rules, such as quiet hours. Social atmosphere isn't very great. Everyone has their own cliques and does their own thing. It is very expensive and the dorms aren't very nice."
College Freshman,2,The facilities for athletics are nice but the football team is Terrible
Recent Alumnus,2,"I attended this school for three years before transferring. This school is extremely money hungry and the administration is god awful but some of the professors are a saving grace. The career center is an absolute joke as the top employers they bring in are the YMCA and the parks and rec services. There are little to no internship opportunities outside of the boys and girls club and jumpstart. Parking is free though which is super nice. The dining hall is terrible and they don't let anyone sell food on campus which makes it hard to fundraise. The science department is really underfunded and they do a good job of coercing students to do the Whittier Scholars Program which is essentially a build your own major program. This program is a trap of sorts as most 'Scholars' major in majors that have little to no job prospects. The dorms are absolutely terrible as well. for $11,000 you get no AC, leaky roofs, small living conditions, and a whole lot of plumbing problems. Overall the school is a solid D and way too expensive."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are some good teachers, but the way education was structured and the requirements for lib ed were confusing and difficult to connect."
College Freshman,2,A lot of the campus security officers here don't seem interested in the actual safety and concerns of the students.
College Junior,2,There is pretty much nothing to do in Whittier and it is so far from the freeway you don't want to drive anywhere because it takes so long.
College Junior,2,The financial aid office does try its best to work with you but sometimes it gets annoying. I was supposed to receive a refund once and they gave me a lot of excuses as to why I could not receive and suggested I apply for another loan if I needed the money.
College Sophomore,2,The school doesn't offer much. They only mildly reference you anything. Not the most helpful
College Sophomore,2,"Whittier is a very old town, and so is its selection of fun."
College Junior,2,"You need to know someone. If you are new and someone doesn't approach you, your not going to know!"
College Junior,2,Try giving more financial aid to students in the United States other than giving everything to the foreign kids.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is a long process and barely receive any aid, I was force to apply many loans."
College Sophomore,2,Gave me the run around between the financial aid office and business office.
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid is alright. You have to beg and clear up bills every now and then. They are a bit stingy on money
College Junior,2,Nobody really cares about the sports teams here. They are fun to do if you enjoy the sport and want to stay in shape though.
College Freshman,2,They will not provide us enough support and I may have to transfer if my family cannot make ends meet.
College Freshman,2,"I had the worst experience with on campus housing. The residential life department is terrible and have made it miserable for me to live on campus. Many of my friends love living on campus, so it may have been an individual experience, but overall I was really disappointed"
College Freshman,2,"Living in freshman dorms means that you have a lot of campus safety making sure there is no underage drinking. They will often check dorm rooms if they feel they have a reason to. Other than that, being smart and careful goes a long way at Whittier"
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of gangs. And Whittier is somewhat far from all the cities so unless you have a car it is hard to get to places/\.
College Freshman,2,Transportation is really bad around whittier. taking the metro is so much harder then what people may think.
College Freshman,2,The school I go to is increasing the cost of tuition and my family may not be able to afford it. If worst comes to worst I may have to transfer which would be hard for me because I love the academic services I am provided and the small classrooms. The financial aid office told me that my family can afford it but they do not know that we are investing money in services for my autistic brother. They do not know that the other property we own is causing problems. We are trying to sell it so we can receive the money we need for my college but it belongs to some of our family and they are making things difficult for us. It may say on paper that we can afford it but the reality is I may have to transfer and I worry that I may  not receive the academic help I need elsewhere.
College Freshman,2,I have a laptop but for some reason it will never connect to the Wi-Fi at my school. I use computers at my school but depending on the time of the day it can be hard to get one.
College Sophomore,2,There is no athletics at the school only intramurals.
College Freshman,2,Registering and transferring process is bad
College Freshman,2,I have no friends cause they don't accept me because I don't drink.  The few friends I have live nearby so they go home almost every other day.  The dorm is close to class which is nice.
College Freshman,2,"I was pressured by my team to drink so I quit.  Other reasons were involved, but I was not going to be pressured into drinking.  The reason I go home every weekend is because no one is on campus.  Everyone is partying and I don't want to be involved with that."
College Freshman,2,The parking here is terrible
College Freshman,2,"Permit costs are INSANE, which is pretty bad because in order to go anywhere outside of campus (minus Uptown Whittier, which is walkable) you need a car."
College Freshman,2,"There is only one place to live off campus through the school, and I have heard it is really bad because there are students living there, and other tenants who don't attend Whittier College living there. Also if you do want to live off campus, like getting your own apt not through the school, it is really hard. You can't really move off campus easily until you are a senior. They give you a really hard time when trying to move off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus safety is too strict, and very lazy. "
College Sophomore,2,"There is CAAS for athletes and societies to use with lots of computers. The internet sucks and you have to sign in every time, sometimes it doesn't work. Professors do use technology when necessary."
College Sophomore,2,I am on the track team and we cannot host any meets which is annoying.
College Sophomore,2,"Whittier College is not exactly on the nice part of Whittier, but Whittier is pretty safe, I guess"
College Sophomore,2,"Uptown Whittier is nice to walk through, but pretty small"
College Sophomore,2,"Well the city my school is in (whittier) is a suburb city near Los Angeles so unless you know residents of the city there is nothing to do, there is uptown Whittier which is cool if your unfamiliar with the place but if that is not your cup of joe you can just hang out in Los Angeles"
College Junior,2,Small are to be much of a night life. Not much going on around the campus besides house parties.
College Sophomore,2,Public Transportation is alright if you know how to use the bus and know where to get the bus.
College Sophomore,2,Unless you have a car or know someone that has a car nightlife is non-existent.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the people don't have the drive. Everyone helps eachother out in class. Not competitive much.
College Junior,2,"The Campus Inn is not the best place to eat because of the policies Bon Appetit has placed.  I am glad I only have a 5 meal plan bc anything more just isn't worth it, unless maybe you live on campus. The workers are great and The Spot is good too. Downside, The Spot doesn't open until 10 am."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's a private school, and so it has a kind of WASPy vibe, even though there are a decent number of people from other races, religions and socioeconomic backgrounds."
College Senior,2,"If you're ""lucky"", you'll get Turner, but the A/C doesn't work right sometimes.  All the other dorms don't have A/C, except Harris I think.  So it'll get hot.  The bathrooms are cleaned overall well, the rooms are small and some have triples.  Single dorm room life is best.

Check off campus housing b/c it's cheaper, if possible.  If someone else trashes your floor or dorm, you'll have to pay for some of it, most likely."
College Freshman,2,"no emphasized, but that makes it easier to get on a team"
College Sophomore,2,very little flexibility with meal plan options. the price difference between the options isn't that significant.
College Junior,2,Average. Food is not horrible but not amazing. Breakfast is the best meal by far. Sometimes have random really good meals. Chicken Parm is by far the best. You will here everyone on campus talking about it when it is chicken parm day!
College Sophomore,2,"Gym Is Old – Our gym is pretty tiny & cramped, plus old equipment"
Recent Alumnus,2,More Needed.. There needs to be more parking available to all students and faculty
College Sophomore,2,"Chicken Parm is the only good day to go to lunch and expect to eat. Dinner is usually terrible. To be honest, I live off of cereal and sandwiches. Some people don't mind the food. The pizza is usually pretty good, and the burgers are consistently edible. And on good days the fries are delicious. But that's all junk food! The salad bar lacks, and there is NEVER a selection of fresh fruit. It's California! You'd think they would be able to give us more fruit than cantaloupe."
College Freshman,2,Hard to Get Anywhere – There are sometimes events or dances hosted by the societies on our campus. They are a huge part of the culture on campus. Other than that there are only house parties and you have to get an invite or know someone who knows about them to go and usually finding a ride to them is a pain.
College Freshman,2,Uptown is very nice but is lacking in things to do. Even though LA is only 14 miles away there are few ways to get there and explore. There are no shuttles of any kind to get you there.
College Junior,2,"You Need a Car – Being in California, it's hard to survive without a car.  Don't take the buses into the LA at night because that's when the homeless people ride the bus and you'll get hit up for money."
College Junior,2,"Labs Get Crowded During Crunch Times – They are loud especially in CAAS, center for academic advising and success, because of all the sports kids who need study hours.  The library is packed when it comes time for midterms and finals so it's best to get work done in your own room."
College Junior,2,"Pleasant on Campus, but Small – Whittier College is a tiny little college that sits up on the hillside of Whittier.  Don't be fooled by its quaintness though.  Make sure you want a small town/small school feel before applying."
College Junior,2,The Parking near the dorms is horribe; hardlyever any parking.  Once a parking spot is found the spaces are very small.
Junior,1,"While the academics and professors were great, I had to withdraw the third week of the semester due to a family emergency. Not only did the Dean make a big deal out of it, financial aid was the absolute worst. Financial aid claims I never submitted the authorization form, which I did. I'm stuck with a $2,800 bill for literally 6 days of class. There's no winning with these evil bureaucratic institutions."
Freshman,1,"This place is an out of control party school. My son left after one year. Kids drink and smoke pot during the day, academics were underwhelming, almost no oversight from counselors and an 'anything goes' in the dorm policy. I would urge no parent to send their child here. It should be taken off the 'schools that change lives' list.. unless you want it to change it for the worse."
Freshman,1,"Extremely disappointing.  What I was hoping to experience at Whittier was something life changing and amazing to say the least. I wanted something that was different than high school as I had not enjoyed high school at all. And what I got by coming to Whittier College was high school all over again. If you enjoyed high school then by all means Whittier is the place to be. But if you loathe high school and want something new, you will transfer out after your first year and feel just really let down. This is of course my current situation.  Be wise in your college search."
College Freshman,1,"I live in Stauffer Hall which is a first year dorm and it is terrible. The lack of air conditioning and even air flow in the building leaves the place smelly and hot. The bathrooms always have urine of the flow and in the summer the humidity reaches levels similar to being in a jungle. If you have never gone to the bathroom and come out sweating, go to Whittier College. The carpets smell of marijuana and puke and the ceilings in the bathroom, something we students call ""Pee rain"". Even the lounge accommodations are nasty. The chairs and couches are disgusting and I don't even want to think about what has happened on them with all the stains they have. Not to mention they have holes and smell funny. The rooms inside my dorm are actually pretty big. My roommate and I love comfortably unless someone is smoking outside our window, which happens a lot."
College Freshman,1,Were not allowed to live off campus.
College Freshman,1,Everything closes before 9 and everything is so far away
College Freshman,1,"The beds are small,no one cleans up after themselves in the bathroom and only 2 shower stalls work."
College Junior,1,If there is a party it is very small and everyone just gets wasted. Horrible music and no dancing whatsoever.
College Sophomore,1,We don;t have greek life and it sucks!
College Freshman,1,Drugs are a huge part of Whittier. They are everywhere. Especially in the Whittier community/ The school does not know how to deal with the drugs here.
College Freshman,1,The people here are extremely unattractive. REALLY UNATTRACTIVE. No one cares about how they look.
College Freshman,1,"Whittier really really needs to work on this. I never feel safe on campus. The Campus Safety are great. They do their best to protect all of us, but it just is not enough. Whittier is in a really sketchy neighborhood, and the people that live in Whittier are really weird. The amount of sexual assault cases at this school is ridiculous. It has happened so many times since I've been here, and the school does not know how to handle it. Keep this in mind when you are applying."
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, if you are looking to be a pre-med student, this is not a good school for you. There is no ""medical program"" and although the teachers will try to help you, most of the work is expected to be completed with out the help from faculty members, which is impossible when you are trying to go to medical school."
College Freshman,1,Whittier College is not Greek affiliated.
College Sophomore,1,No greeks. Societies are stupid.
College Sophomore,1,"Small school, small parties where you know everyone. Campus safety is very strict."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't do either, if that would male you feel better, but it's common at parties."
College Sophomore,1,Not enough room for all the cars that people are bringing and commuter have to come early to get a good spot.
College Sophomore,1,Only two places to eat on campus. The CI which the meal plan goes to and the Spot where you have to pay.
College Senior,1,"The parking situation is pretty awful. Parking is a breeze before 9am, but a nightmare anytime later than that. There aren't enough spots for the number of students, commuters or non-commuters (but commuters in particular). Campus Safety lives to hand out parking tickets, especially if a student parks in a designated ""visitor"" space. And despite parking being a constant gripe, if you're late to class because you can't find parking, professors generally don't accept it as an excuse. Spaces are constantly getting taken for community events happening on campus, with little notice and no parking alternatives for students."

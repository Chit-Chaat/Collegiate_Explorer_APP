Graduate Student,5,"i had already taken online classes and in person, when corona hit, my in person changed to online but i was already familiar and comfortable with it. but my professor was new to it and it did take some adjustment for her and she could still improve. improvements- she should have all the modules and assignments posted online when the course begins so students can see whats coming up and work ahead if they want to. my other teacher is very very slow at grading assignments online. there are some technical glitches with mc-graw-hill Connect homework and in eCanvas when uploading/copying an assignment into a discussion area it screws up all the formatting and you have to reupload all images and videos and that isn't straight forward either. it takes me approx. 1 hour to reformat and post an assignment in the discussion and i have to plan on that when an assignment has a time deadline."
Graduate Student,5,"i did undergrad and now doing graduate work at EMU. i have had a good experience. my undergrad was almost all on campus and my grad has been mainly online, which I now prefer. the campus is beautiful, some buildings need updating but they are working on that. the college of business is highly recommended. the availability of classes needs to be increased, some are only offered certain semesters and most have only 1 option."
Senior,5,I love doing online classes. I helps me be able to do my job while making time for my classes. The classes allow me to work at my own pace and get done what I need to get done.
Senior,5,I enjoy that I am able to do my work online and go at my pace. The teachers are helpful and are willing to help with whatever you need.
Graduate Student,5,The online learning experience was an easy transition for me because of how prepared the faculty was.
Graduate Student,5,Eastern Michigan is an excellent school. I currently attend for the Dietetics and Human Nutrition program and the faculty /learning experience is distinguished.
Junior,5,"My online learning experience with Eastern Michigan University has far exceed my expectations. The professors are really helpful even when they are working through changes of their own with having to be online due to the pandemic. The professors have really organized canvas shells, hold zoom meetings even when it is an asynchronous class in order to be there for their students, and respond very helpful and quickly through email."
Junior,5,"I love everything about Eastern Michigan University. I was originally a student at Wayne State, but transferred for the exceptional atmosphere and teaching program at Eastern Michigan University. I also admire the diversity and inclusion this school has to offer. The only thing that I would change about Eastern Michigan is the parking. It is such a great school that many students attend and/or would love to attend. I personally believe if they found a way to increase their parking space that they could accommodate  more students."
Sophomore,5,My college experience with EMU has been good so far.  The advisor for Social Work (the major I am going into) has been very helpful and available to me.  The teachers all seem to be available and flexible in the times of COVID.
Sophomore,5,"This is my first semester all online at EMU, and so far it seems to be well set up on Canvas online.  I like the option of having to log onto zoom and meet with the class, so I am more accountable."
Freshman,5,"Eastern Michigan is an excellent university to attend for anyone looking to have a fun, small college experience!"
Junior,5,My experience at Eastern has been brief but it has been great so far. Everyone has been so helpful and understanding. I've been treated with respect and no judgement which is big value for me.
Junior,5,I have not started yet the online courses but so far it seems very easy to navigate and I have many friends tell me what a great experience it was
Freshman,5,"I love EMU. It’s very diverse, the teachers are nice, the campus is cozy. I had a good freshman year to start my college experience here."
Freshman,5,"The Admissions Office at Eastern Michigan University is one of the best features they have. Always answering your questions and hoping to help in any way they can, they work extremely hard to make sure they provide any and all information they can to students. The overall friendliness at EMU has also been one of the most comforting things an incoming freshman could ask for."
Freshman,5,"My online learning experience has been very amazing, they have been extremely helpful and considerate, especially during the crazy times the world is currently experiencing."
Sophomore,5,I loved that the staff at Eastern loved their students and they cared for us. If you needed any kind of help they will always help you and make sure that you’re ok. The only thing I would change about Eastern is their parking policy.
Freshman,5,"I have had an amazing experience with Eastern Michigan University so far! I have been able to apply for clubs and scholarships already, and it is only June. I also love the campus, I think that everything is fairly close together but not too crammed, which I personally like. I am very excited to attend the school in the fall."
Freshman,5,"I have been able to take online classes through Eastern Michigan for the summer semester and so far my experience has been great. The professors have been very helpful and hands on with all the students, despite it being only online classes."
Sophomore,5,"When I first visited Eastern Michigan University, the first thing I noticed was how friendly everyone there was. I immediately decided I wanted to attend and I’m glad I did. Everyone I’ve met has been so helpful and kind. The campus is beautiful, and housing is great. I met some amazing people there and wonderful professors. I am grateful to have been given the opportunity to attend this university."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy going to school here, I like that the campus is small and the buildings are easy to find. I highly recommend this school to people who are looking at colleges."
Junior,5,"I just completed my second year at Eastern and my experience at Eastern both years has been great! When I first made my decision to go to Eastern, I didn’t know how to feel but I promise it isn’t so bad after all. All the professors I’ve had so far were amazing at teaching and very helpful. You’ll meet a lot of new people from different backgrounds which is really nice. As a commuter, I don’t know much about campus food or dorm life, but I can assure that everything else has been pretty solid :)"
Junior,5,"Online classes at Eastern are great for
those who can stay on top of things. I took two online classes before the COVID-19 situation and I enjoyed both classes so much, which made transition into fully online classes during the COVID-19 impacted Winter 2020 semester easier for me to transition into. I will say I prefer in person lecture and being able to hear the professor teach face to face in person but my experience with online classes has been fabulous."
Senior,5,I loved my online classes. Easy to follow and the professors are always quick to help. They let you work at your own pace and that’s what I like.
Senior,5,I love my school despite things that randomly happen! This is my senior year and I can’t wait to become an alumni! You can always choose what you wanna do and the lifestyle you want. The school is very diverse and inclusive and you will always find someone who is like you. There’s so many campus life things you can do and join. We have great professors and the food is decent.
Senior,5,I like how diverse the campus is. I love the city of Ypsilanti its like a second home to me. The people on campus is friendly. I would  just stay clear of the physics department!
Sophomore,5,Eastern Michigan University has broadened my outlook on my future. While being here I have been able to use many resources and have had professors help me reach my full potential. It is a great university to help you find the path you want and help find organizations that you want to take part in.
Junior,5,"Eastern Michigan University is an outstanding college. I knew I wanted to go there as soon as I visited. What I first liked about it was the size of the college and it did not have any roads going through campus. 
Now that I have been there for three years there are so many other features EMU offers that I love. Its teachers and advisors have never failed to help me and answer my questions. I enjoy the diversity of its students because I think it is important for a college to show it does not discriminate."
Junior,5,"Eastern Michigan is a great place to attend school at. The campus is beautiful, the school makes sure they provide students with a very diverse and accepting community, and the people around campus are so nice. There is a lot to do on campus and around campus. Professors are so nice and helpful when you go to them with problems."
Senior,5,"I loved my experience with Eastern Michigan University's RN to BSN online program because each class was 7 weeks long and the entire program was very affordable compared to others. Most of my teachers were great (a few were not), but the program was relatively flexible in that if you needed to take a semester off, you could pause and pick back up - as long as you finish the program in 5 years. Other than the first and the last, the classes did not need to be taken in a specific order, and there were a few electives to choose from. The entire program consisted of ten 3 credit classes. I would recommend EMU's online RN to BSN program to anyone looking for a convenient program with flexibility."
Niche User,5,I liked the flexibility of being able to do Distance Education. The professors for my particular major (dietetics) have been great and personable. My only critique is that some of my correspondence with other departments wasn't as helpful or friendly.
Senior,5,I have enjoyed my time at Eastern Michigan University. The professors are knowledgeable about the subjects they teach as well as caring to each and every student. I like how they bring up real life stories that relate to the subjects that they are lecturing and don't just read off power point slides. The only downfall I have with Eastern is the parking-there just doesn't seem to be enough of it. You are able to buy a parking pass but there is no guarantee that  there will be parking available in those lots.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, everything is easy to walk to. The parking costs a little bit but parking passes make life easier. The advisors are fantastic and truly helped me make sure I was choosing the right path for me. They also have a Harry Potter class which counts as one of your gen eds!"
Junior,5,"Although I do not see a lot of minorities, a least not in any of my classes, I have not had a problem with being treated differently so far."
Niche User,5,"Eastern Michigan University is an excellent University with a beautiful campus, wonderful staff and administrators, and very bright students. In addition to an excellent school program, Eastern Michigan's womens basketball team the Eagles is a great basketball team with an excellent coaching staff, wonderful teammates, and an overall great energy."
Freshman,5,"I think that Eastern Michigan University is great. They have so many resources for all kinds of situations; for example, the LGBTQ+ Resource Center which is an amazing place for those who might need a little help finding out who they are which is what college is all about. I haven't really met that many rude people on campus so far which I find amazing. People will hold doors for you and hold the elevator which helps instead of going up 5 flights of stairs. I've had some great professors as well and I've felt comfortable in my classes with the professor and the other students as well. I think something that could change is more flexibility in the programs and academic degrees. At other schools I was interested in you were required to take a set amount of classes but the other half was up to you so you could personalize your degree for your interests and I think that would be a great thing to do at EMU which could interest a lot more people into coming to this wonderful university."
Niche User,5,I love the campus! The atmosphere is very friendly and the teachers are always so helpful. I also enjoy that there are always events happening to keep all students engaged throughout campus. I would recommend Eastern Michigan to anyone that wants more of an intimate class setting but still have a campus feel.
Freshman,5,"This is my first year and I have enjoyed everything minute of it. From the different organizations/clubs to the professor I have had nothing but the best experience. 
Something I would change, is way more free money to get while you are attending their college. I plan on graduating from here and would really like more financial assistance."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern Michigan University overall is a very good school with very accommodating  instructors and staff. While it is true this school may not offer as much financial aid as larger schools, it makes up for it by providing quality academics and on-campus activities. It is a very diverse school, with a large racial and LGBT minority student body; and much more working class atmosphere than UMich or MSU.

The biggest disadvantage to attending Eastern is the social and party scene. Since Eastern is a commuter school, which means most students go home after class, don't expect big parties or a deep involvement in student orgs.

If you can tolerate the lack of a social scene, you'll find that the food and dorms are good, and Ypsilanti is a fantastic city to explore."
Graduate Student,5,"Eastern is a great campus located close to Ann arbor which has great food/bars, activities and events. The campus is nice but they do lack in the food area. They have a small student area with about 5 restaurants and a few other spots on campus."
Freshman,5,"Eastern is a wonderful school. Most all of the teachers are very nice, and the students are too. The food is a little lack luster, but it could be worse. Another complaint is the college of business is off campus, so if you are a business student you either have to drive there or take the free bus that comes every 20 minutes. The campus really feels like home though and I’d say to everyone who is interested in this school to come on a tour!"
Sophomore,5,"Eastern Michigan is the best school I could have chosen, it is diverse, inviting, full of kindness and love, academically brilliant and more. This campus has so much to offer and so many opportunities to grow. I would recommend this school to anyone and everyone looking for a good college experience."
Senior,5,EMU is a great college and the professors are all amazing. I am delighted with my experience here and I want to continue my education at this college.
Sophomore,5,"I love Eastern! I cannot imagine myself any other place. The orientation process allowed me to meet all of my friends and MOST classroom sizes are no more than 40 people, if that. This allows me to connect with people in my classes! You get into athletic events for free with your student ID which is really cool! The campus is beautiful and there are a lot of historical buildings!"
Senior,5,"What I really like about Eastern Michigan University is that it is very diverse and connected with students of color and highly support people from different, beliefs, and cultures. I also really like how Eastern is committed to students success by offering a range of sources to help students receive more help for their classes."
Freshman,5,"Since being a freshman at Eastern Michigan University I have developed so many life skills and tons of critical thinking. I have grew so much mentally in the past three months that I have been here and I love it. here, everyone is like a huge family. They are always here to laugh with you, cry with you and so much more. i love my University!"
Freshman,5,I love Eastern Michigan University because this is a college that makes you feel welcomed. This school has many opportunities.
Freshman,5,I loved the supportive people on campus and they really put a lot of effort to make sure that you are graduating on time and finding the perfect major in the process.
Freshman,5,I love eastern as a whole. The environment is extraordinary. The professors are really involved in their students education and the campus is very welcoming.
Sophomore,5,"It is a small university, not too intimidating, very diverse and welcoming, the professors are very helpful and really concerned about their students."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Eastern Michigan and so far, I love it here. It is a great place to get an education. Class sizes aren't too large. The education is great and student focused. I look forward to continuing my college education here."
Niche User,5,"They have plenty of programs to offer, hundreds of on campus activities, trips they go, and overall the campus is beautiful!"
Freshman,5,"My experience has been great, I am just now applying to the university and have had a great experience searching through their website to find out more about the program I am interested in. It was very easy and simple to request a conversation with an admissions representative to find out more information."
Senior,5,"Eastern Michigan University is a great college that offers a variety of programs to suit your educational needs.  The teaching staff is wonderful, and always assists when I have questions.  They are professional and have the utmost integrity when it comes to being professors.  I have enjoyed my experience at Eastern Michigan University, and would continue my education here after I graduate if needed."
Freshman,5,I really like their music program. Esspecially thr marching band.  I'm really excited to see how the theater program really works here. My theater and band class are extremely enjoyable so far.
Sophomore,5,"I personally love Eastern! There are many resources here on campus, professors who care about their students, and it's very easy to get involved at school to help you feel more welcome and at home. I highly recommend Eastern!"
Niche User,5,Eastern Michigan University has a great campus and many luxuries in the surrounding areas. It gives you a great chance to explore and get to know  a new city.
Senior,5,"I'm currently attending, I really enjoy my classes and professors and my major. The campus is great, very walkable and its something always going on."
Niche User,5,I had a college tour to Eastern Michigan University and it was a good experience i really liked it and would enjoy going back.
Senior,5,"Very diverse, good education school. Profesores are nice and care about their students. You can get involved in many activities and clubs that will benefit your career once your done. Close to everything and offer variety of healthy food options."
Graduate Student,4,"Eastern Michigan University's campus is beautiful. It is the perfect mix of historical buildings and newer, modern buildings. It is easy to navigate and the perfect place to enjoy small class sizes and professors who love what they do. From general ed courses to my final major classes every instructor I had loved what they did and represented EMU well! The administration is sometimes harder to work with in terms of communication about university policy's, however, if you are a student with initiative this will not be a major roadblock, just something to keep in mind. I loved EMU so much that I am continuing with my graduate program there now as well!"
Freshman,4,"Eastern Michigan was very accommodating during its online sessions.  They were patient with students who were using the medium, and tried to make it as uncomplicated as possible."
Freshman,4,My professors were amazing during the transition to online classes when COVID hit. It was easy to email them questions and still learn during the tough time.
Junior,4,"I have taken several classes online.  Some good, some bad.   Some professors are very engaged with the students and others are not making it the class difficult."
Junior,4,My overall experience with EMU has been great.  The staff is very nice.  The atmosphere is inviting.  The campus has been making many updates.  The online structure has been beneficial.   I would like the professors to have higher ratings.
Alum,4,EMU was a great school to go to for education. Most of the professors were very helpful and well-prepared to teach their subjects. I would like EMU to take student reports on staff more seriously.
Sophomore,4,My online experience was ok for the most part. My teachers were available for any questions any student had and their directions were very clear.
Junior,4,"I took one class fully online my freshman year because it was not offered in any other format at the time. I had a good experience and liked being able to learn at my own pace and do my work individually. Also, with COVID, the professors did a pretty good job transitioning to being fully online."
Junior,4,"Eastern is an especially good school if you are looking for a small campus that is not overwhelming and you would like to live at home - it is a huge commuter school. As an education major, I have had a good experience at the school seeing as they are known for having a good education program."
Sophomore,4,"Eastern is a good place to experience diversity. They offer over 250+ clubs and organizations, always have events on campus and offer lots of resources."
Sophomore,4,"Personally, online classes went pretty smoothly. I think it depends on your professors. You do have to keep up your motivation to go to class and get the work done."
Junior,4,The housing/ residency person I talked to was fantastic and helped me get the kind of housing I need
Junior,4,"Eastern Michigan University is overall a great school. I have anxiety so I don't interact with many people but everything is accepting and friendly. They have plenty events and activities you can experience. A flaw would be the campus police. I heard many stories on the involvement of them in a negative way. I say if you don't have any need for them the school is great. Campus is huge yet also small. Everyone pretty much knows each other or knows of you as a person. They have plenty access to learning areas. Plenty areas to clear your mind. Geese are always on the water. Beware of them potentially being aggressive as well. The water and the trees are beautiful and great for clearing your mind and keeping a clear mind space. If you are looking  for diversity, the LGBTQ+ community is greatly valued. If you are black, like myself, it unfortunately is a fight for your rights on campus. Some students are fond of racism. If you stay around your people they'll uplift you greatly."
Senior,4,"My online experience at Eastern has been good. Professors that I've had for online courses have had a great understanding of Canvas, the site we use for online coursework. Grades are updated regularly, making it easy to keep track of how you're doing in the class. All the professors I've had have also made themselves easily accessible outside of the ""classroom"", whether that's with email conferencing or in person office hours."
Sophomore,4,"I took one planned online class at Eastern Michigan University, which was altogether thoroughly enjoyable. The professor was completely aware of how to function in an online format, and he was very direct with due dates and expectations for his class. Of course, I was also attending Eastern during the COVID-19 pandemic, and all of our classes were unexpectedly converted to an online format. Through this struggle, all of my professors were understanding and patient, and they always did their best to make sure we, as their students, had the resources we needed to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"Eastern Michigan University is a wonderfully diverse, extremely friendly and welcoming school for first year and returning students. There are a range of majors and minors available, and the research opportunities are aplenty. The honors program is very accomplished and involved, and definitely puts the effort in to make the honors college another home. Professors are very invested and passionate about their work, which is incredible to see, and even better to learn from. I would love to see some updates/renovations to living quarters, as well as some more colorful scenery. Also, I would like some updates to the ParkEMU structure and function, especially with on-campus resident parking."
Sophomore,4,The only time I had online classes was due to COVID but it was a hard experience because most of my professors didn't know what they were doing.
Junior,4,online classes are nice. The professors make it fun and are normally easy to contact. I like the online classes.
Sophomore,4,"My professors were very prepared for online learning this year, and they made if very straightforward and as simple as possible to finish up the semester while covering all of our needed material."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my classes at EMU overall. I am very happy with the connectedness of my major (Exercise Science) with the Orthotics and Prosthetics graduate program because I have been able to prepare for graduate school as early as my first year as an undergrad.
Sophomore,4,"I just completed my freshman year at Eastern Michigan University and I absolutely loved it there. I spent fall 2019 and half of winter 2020 on campus in Ypsilanti, Michigan and it was the best experience of my life. The atmosphere is very enjoyable if you are looking for a campus where there is a nicely sized community. A perk of attending EMU is the on campus resources and the plethora of clubs and activities to get involved with. I would highly recommend attending EMU to current high school graduates and high school juniors/seniors. Lastly, another pro to attending EMU is you are right down the road from Ann Arbor and roughly 20 minutes from U of M."
Sophomore,4,"Prior to the COVID-19 Pandemic I had not taken a course online through Eastern Michigan University; yet, when all of my courses went online in March of this year my professors did such an amazing job with the transition and making sure all of their students understood the materials and when assignments, tests and quizzes were due. I had many interactions with my professors and they were very flexible with office hours, etc."
Senior,4,"I loved my time at EMU! I have 1 more semester and I’m sad to see it all end so fast. Like others, I’ve had my ups and downs but emu is apart of me now and always will be. Wonderful memories were made for sure"
Niche User,4,Eastern Michigan University has a very diverse campus and the teacher to student ratio is excellent.
Alum,4,The exercise Science program is great. I made lifelong bonds with my teachers! That program specifically have been known to fight for you and your education. Would definitely go back
Sophomore,4,The school have many amazing professors whom are trying to make sure everyone succeeds. The campus always has an activity or group to do when you’re bored. The campus is also pretty. The students are also really helpful and friendly.
Freshman,4,"Eastern Michigan University isn't just a college to me. Eastern is going to be my future for the next four years. Although thats thought is scary, I am more than excited.I haven't experienced one bad thing at Eastern and I highly doubt I ever will."
Senior,4,"I like the campus as a whole there is a lot of opportunities for all types of people and their interests. I feel safe on this campus, and I am not afraid to walk home alone after my night class. Many of my professors are wonderful and make it exciting and interesting to come to class every week. I have to say I don't think we need to make the math and science classes so hard for Elementary majors. Specifically for those teachers who are not specializing in that subject.  As future teachers that is not our only subject we will teach and for some of the Special Education teachers we may not teach certain students any of that information. I think some of those professors need to be aware that we are not here just for one Earth science class."
Alum,4,"Eastern was actually a great school. To be honest, it was not my first choice of college but once I got there I realized how good of a school it was. Eastern was a very inclusive school for everyone and always tried to make sure their students felt comfortable. Along with that, professors were passionate about wha they taught and readily available for any of their students if they needed them. I loved my programs there for psychology, sociology, and leadership."
Niche User,4,"I liked the environment at EMU, as well as a lot of my professors and classes. However, I do wish some classes were more challenging and informative, which is why I'm opting for a more renowned university to finish my degree."
Freshman,4,Great class options and very easy to become involved on campus. Meal plan options/values aren't the best.
Senior,4,"Eastern Michigan University has been the type of college that wants to see any person of any walk of life succeed. Even with reputation and the things people say when they hear EMU, this college has given people, even myself, a new chance at life. It's given opportunities to people who didn't think life could bring anything more. Eastern strives to be a place where people can be theirselves and not be ashamed of starting new."
Junior,4,"The people are great and they have an excellent program for my major, Early Childhood and Elementary Education."
Freshman,4,"The campus is smaller than some others, which allows it to feel like a closer community but does not feel cramped. There is a variety of opportunities for success. In all honestly, the worst part is that as a commuter school, it feels too empty on weekends."
Sophomore,4,"Eastern Michigan has been kind to be so far. I am currently a second year transfer student, coming from a college where you had to be very self motivated to continue attending. Professors weren't helpful, students weren't kind, and the coursework was brutal. At Eastern, I have gained so much knowledge and insight into my education while also continuously being spoken to by friendly faces."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I've had a good experience at EMU. I've taken my course online and am planning to start taking courses on campus shortly. EMU accepted my credits from my CCAF Associate's Degree, various CLEPs, and have been incredibly accommodating toward appointments with the with the Academic Adviser over the phone. The advice to set up what classes I need for my degree program and when to take them from the Academic Adviser has been pretty sound. The Veteran Resource Center has also been helpful in answering my questions on setting up my GI Bill. The set up for the online courses is relatively easy to get a handle on and their website for students to add/drop courses and look over information is good. Overall, I haven't had any major issues."
Niche User,4,when i went on my visits to Eastern Michigan university i enjoyed my time. dorms was nice and everyone was professional. great environment to be around.
Junior,4,"I love the actual academics. I transferred for my junior year and got right in to my program classes! The transfer went smoothly, however, before transfer I was told my internship hours would count for my degree and they do not."
Junior,4,I love the campus. I’ve had a pretty great experience  sans the few poorly chosen professors. The classes have all been fantastic and I don’t feel like I’m wasting money on my requirements.
Freshman,4,"EMU is a very good campus when is comes to the people and the professors. Everyone there is so kind and are always there to help you. The dorms however, are good, but could have way better benefits and the food, needs to be more name brand food places."
Junior,4,I really enjoy Eastern Michigan! I am going for a sport management major and so far have loved all of the academics and all of my professors. I would recommend coming here if you want a college that is not too expensive! Also the campus is beautiful and everyone is super nice around campus as well!
Freshman,4,Some of the dorms on campus aren't that great by just the first semester alone but the academic and campus life is both fun and amazing with professors offering to help you whenever you need it!
Freshman,4,"Eastern is a really good school that I feel like best fits me as a person. Also, I believe it could be better if the food options were different  and it wasn't as hilly. Overall my experience in my first semester was pretty good and I had alot of fun."
Alum,4,"Overall I had a great experience! I loved my filler classes (walking, badminton, scuba diving, sailing, yoga, astronomy, etc.), they definitely helped my health and reduced stress! Campus is nice, besides the construction. Great diversity of student body. However, though EMU has one of the best Colleges of Business in the Nation, honestly most of my professors were not so great."
Freshman,4,"One of the best things about Eastern is their diversity on campus and the amount of resources that they offer you. They offer an on campus Medical clinic, counseling services, and academic resources to ensure you will have a successful college experience. The professors are extremely helpful and show that they care about their students academic success."
Senior,4,I thought my tour to Eastern was a great experience I learn infinite about each course I can take to reach my career goal.
Freshman,4,The teachers are really nice and helpful. The food selection in the commons is limited but there is a market on campus.
Senior,4,Eastern Michigan University is a good school overall. The campus is really diverse and everyone here nice for the most part. You can easily find someone to help you when it is needed.  The professors are pretty accessible and they even take the time out on the weekends to help you understand material that may be a little more difficult to understand.
Senior,4,"I'm currently a 5th year undergraduate student at EMU. The majority of the experiences I've had at Eastern are good. I've been pretty involved on campus, from living on campus, working in the library, working in Marshall offices and the computer lab, and as a Resident Advisor (RA) in the dorms. My major is Speech and Language Pathology with an Elementary Education endorsement. Both programs are amazing and the majority of the professors know what they're talking about. The thing I dislike most about campus is PARKING! It's expensive and if you don't get to campus super early or later in the day, good luck finding parking."
Sophomore,4,I really like the people and the environment. I've had many opportunities here at Eastern. I would recommend this school to many people.
Freshman,4,So far my experience at Eastern has been good. I live on campus so I get to experience a lot of different things. For the most part I have teachers who very much care about me succeeding . If I could change anything it would be their food options because they don't have the healthiest options and the healthy options they do have are very expensive.
Freshman,4,The campus is so well diverse especially when it comes to events. The events could be for one culture in specific and eastern students welcome instead a teaching experience for all
Freshman,4,I've been attending EMU for a couple of months now and I honestly think it's a great school to attend. There are a lot of fun activities that you can do here and clubs that you can join and have fun in. I think this school does a great job of preparing students for the future and the teachers are very helpful too.
Alum,4,"The Campus is nicely updated as well as many buildings. 
The culture is diverse and well educated.

The counseling graduate program is one of the best in the country, offering a clinical practicum right inside the classroom as well as many opportunities for internships outside of the classroom"
Niche User,4,I loved their small campus. It will be an easy transition for me coming from a smaller high school. I loved the emphasis they put on academics and it seems like a good fit for me.
Alum,4,"I loved my time at EMU. I was recruited to play softball there and one of the reasons I choose it was because I feel it love with the school. The campus was great, a lot of nice buildings, and places to live."
Junior,4,"The professors at Eastern Michigan University actually care about their students. The campus is small, but still large enough that you don't run into the same people every day. The students at EMU are friendly."
Sophomore,4,So far with it being my first semester here at EMU I am really enjoying myself. I am a sophomore and there are a lot of people and opportunities to help me succeed in my career field.
Freshman,4,Eastern Michigan University has a lot of resources and opportunities to get involved. The environment is clean and well kept and i always have something to do.
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love it here at EMU! Classes are nice, not too big. I've made some really amazing friends here too! The only thing that I can complain about is there's really nothing to do on campus. Me and my friends have to go off campus to do stuff and after awhile it gets boring because we've done it 1000 times."
Senior,2,"If you go in for writing, drama, art or some science classes then it's a pretty nice college. Aside from that, most classes will throw powerpoint presentations on you and barely teach you what you really need. The worst by far is technology and gaming. I went in for that and it was the most horrendous experience ever. The technology teachers will insult you and all the tech students will have yellow teeth and/or an antisocial personality. The dorms are terrible and the only good place to eat on campus is Smash Burger. 

If you really like personal art instruction I'd go in. Otherwise, just don't."
Alum,2,"I took a couple online course during my time at Eastern Michigan. One of the courses was a criminology course taken during the summer. This had one in class meetup so students got an overall idea of how the remainder of the class would play out. Another calls was a sociology course which was entirely online. Discussions and assignments and due at the completion of the next online class period. Lectures we prerecorded and followed in the order in which the syllabus went. 

Both courses had intensive reading for each unit so it was important to keep up. There was no opportunity for make up quizzes or exams nor extra credit."
Senior,2,"They claim to be a commuter campus but they have no classes. I never had this problem at OU. Parking permits are getting more expensive with still terrible parking. They clearly do not care about the students as they have decided mid semester to start offering classes every other year instead of every year, and didn't provide any transition time so now I have to fight with the science department so I don't have to wait an entire year doing nothing just for one class. Dorms have been so bad that people have returned home due to lack of seats on their toilets, uncleanly conditions, and worn out furniture."
Senior,2,Eastern Michigan is a University. Most of the Professors were more focused on collecting a paycheck and sprouting their personal biases than educating students. Campus Security is a joke as the campus is open for anyone in the neighborhood to walk through.
Sophomore,2,"My personal experience with Eastern Michigan has not been too pleasant. However, there is so much potential for this school to grow! Right now it seems as if every department of EMU (academic services, health/food, customer service, etc) is messy. Most of the phone calls I make to EMU for assistance, they usually result with no solution/no attempts to remedy the issue at hand. I feel that if Eastern would adopt a stricter training process, where it is explained who to ask when a issue occurs, there would be less problems. I for example, almost got a ""W"" grade because no one knew how to help me drop a class before the deadline. This particular problem, I had tried to fix months prior to the deadline. But no one could help me, so I had the grade for a short period until I was able to prove how hard I worked to ask for help. Other than the unorganized nature of this school, it is pretty great! There is a strong diversity, caring professors, and many activities to keep student life nice."
Freshman,2,"I am still a student at Eastern Michigan University. However, I do enjoy the diversity at EMU. I would like to change the food Eastern provides its students."
Sophomore,2,I'd like to see EMU stop giving out parking tickets to every single car almost. There isn't enough parking as it is.
Freshman,2,"I personally have had a bad experience at EMU. I have a really good job and that is about the only thing I like here. My roommate sucks, the hall I live in is not as good as they make it sound. I broke my leg in the first semester and they were no help at all. They told me that there was absolutely nothing they could do for me or provide me. My mom had to take off work and drive me back adn forth everyday. It was awful."
Freshman,2,I was sad to see the campus life is not all that great. The school allows segregation and there is no bond between the students. The school is also primarily a commuter school or people from around the area so on weekends the campus is dead.
Alum,2,The teachers like to act like big fish in a small pond. The career services is not helpful in career placement. They mostly just point you to indeed.com. The academics I didn't think prepared me for my career. They didn't encourage growth within classrooms.
Junior,2,I have been attending Eastern for the last three year and it a decent-ish school. A lot racial crimes and as a female I don't feel safe there at night a lone. There is night watch who help and walk people around which really helps. The online classes are great.
Junior,2,"Eastern Michigan University had a great academics program. To improve the university, the administration needs to put more money into materials to help students with academics, such as better computer labs, and better class rooms with working AC. Lastly, they could improve on student life, by putting on better events to bring students back on campus."
College Student,2,"Honestly, Eastern's football team is lacking in performance/success. We struggle to win, but we always put up a good fight!"
College Sophomore,2,A value of a degree is okay . now a days to in my opinion the degrees don't really matter in some workplaces it's really all about what you know and the type of experience you have In that particular field.
College Junior,2,"Since the population of our school is so diverse in age, there aren't too many people that attend our sports events in comparison to other schools. Eastern is a major commuter school, so after people leave campus from class that day they usually don't come back to attend the sporting events that are held. EMU is trying tirelessly to get more student participation, but with U of M so close and MSU not too far away, our crowd is rather small due to the logistics of our campus and student population. Majority of our athletic teams are phenomenal which saddens me that more people don't attend their events."
College Junior,2,The EMU football team is the biggest sport at the school but the team is not very good and therefore not a lot of people go to the games.
College Sophomore,2,"My first year I would get a few timely warnings from our police department and/or Ypsilanti's police telling us when a crime had occurred, what it was and if it happened on or off campus. They were occasional but nothing I was surprised by. This last year though was much different. There were many timely warnings and a lot of them were on campus in Green Lot 1 which is where all residents park and is a huge commuter lot as well. The worst part was the fact that people were doing attempted robberies, trying to shove people in trunks, actual armed robberies the day exams were over. Some guns people used were fake but many were real. 

I never walk across campus at night without my pocket knife. There was a night where two men appeared behind me out of no where and as they kept following me, I had to pull out my knife, open it, show them the blade and made it clear that I would not go down without a fight. Sure enough they disappeared into the distance. I don't trust women walking alone at night because of all the creeps out there. 

We do have a thing called SEEUS which are students who are hired by this organization to walk around in pairs and see if people want assistant walking back to their dorms/cars and try and keep a better eye out for crime happening."
College Sophomore,2,"The towers are the worst possible place to live in on campus when usually at other universities they are the best. Many dorms are out dated, cramped, and the air and heat do not work correctly. The prices are ridiculous but since college steals all of your money anyways, it's not surprising."
College Senior,2,"I would say that more students will participate in clubs that are not athletics more that the varsity sports at this university. The only time I have gone to a football game is for homecoming, and I left at half time. The football team is not very good and most of the time the stands are barley filled. if other teams are playing that day, such as one of the big ten teams, iI would rather watch them on tv over our football team. I do not know about other sports because I am usually working when they are playing."
College Freshman,2,"I have not had many professors that I liked. I dealt with them all accordingly, but they made classes much more of a hassle than they needed to be. Not many of them actually care about their students, because they didn't try to learn our names or try to talk with us. I've had quite a few professors that just show up, talk at us, and leave. On the other hand, I had a few professors that were easy to talk to and I enjoyed, but for my gen eds, it was mostly the opposite problem."
College Freshman,2,"I would not go out alone at night, or out alone off campus.  We get emails about all the crime alerts on campus and within a 5 mile radius of campus.  I get tales 1-2 emails a weak of robbery."
College Freshman,2,the education and the professors aren't the best
College Freshman,2,There are always armed robberies on campus.
College Freshman,2,The teachers force there views on you.
College Freshman,2,"the food on campus is nasty and does not settle well in my stomach. living on campus is not fun, there is nothing to do on the weekend's."
College Freshman,2,older professors don't care about your grades
College Freshman,2,"The sports teams kinda suck, but the rec center is a really nice to play sports. The bad sports teams make a good joke."
College Freshman,2,Housing sucks and the staff is very rude. Policies up the wazoo and way over priced for what you are getting. recommend staying off-campus.
College Freshman,2,Buildings are mostly run down. On campus housing is far more costly than it should be (for what you get).
College Junior,2,The football team has only won 7 games within the last 4 years.
College Sophomore,2,No one cares about sports on EMU's campus.
College Junior,2,"If there's one thing I do wish Eastern could be better at, is that there would be more student involvement for varsity athletics. Eastern's football team is horrible, no one hardly ever goes to the games. The basketball team is actually pretty good, but just like the football situation, no one ever attends the games. 

       The marketing team will try and do everything they can to bring students to the game, but for some reason no one ever shows interest in going. My only theory is that it's because the football and basketball stadiums are roughly a little under a mile off campus. The facilities are extremely nice. The football field has a brand new grey turf field (only one in the country) and an exceptional convocation center, where the basketball and volleyball teams play. Nevertheless the university offers free shuttling to and from the games, and students get into all games for free. Even still, the average attendance is somewhat pitiful, which then entails very little excitement for the teams. 

       Easter is extremely dominant in cross country, track and swimming, but the school doesn't put enough spotlight on these sports teams, so none of the student's ever realize it, or if they do, they don't care enough. I've grown accustom to the lack of enthusiasm for the varsity sports; however, since the University of Michigan is just 5 miles away, a lot of students focus on their athletics program instead, or just other interests in general. Just because the athletics program isn't exciting doesn't make Eastern any less boring. It might just be useful to know for anyone coming into the school, to not expect much from the athletics aspect. 

       The intramural and club sports are fun to participate in, I have participated in club baseball for two years, and played flag football during the fall every year. The activities are fun to participate in, and some may argue get more attention that the varsity sports."
College Freshman,2,The Snow health center is hard to get into and doctors are non accessible
College Freshman,2,our football team had a losing records.  and the coaches are picky in all sports but aren't at all good.
College Student,2,Pretty bad crime area but I can't really blame EMU for that at all. Ypsilanti is not a great area.
College Freshman,2,"None of the people in the offices are willing to help you do anything. They do some stupid ""Tuition Toss"" to give a way money to someone who probably doesn't even need it. This is my first semester here and probably my last.."
College Junior,2,"There isn't enough housing for the number of students Eastern has. It's really costly to apply for the housing, and then not be guaranteed to find what you're looking for. Also, it takes months before you are refunded if you cancel your application. Or, there's a possibility you won't be refunded at all. It's lacking in quality of the rooms (for some buildings) and the roommate selection process is not well-developed either. I recommend living on campus for your first year to get the experience, but after that, move off campus. You'll be better off if you find friends to share an apartment with than you would be on campus."
College Freshman,2,Make sure you get assistance so you're not paying/borrowing a PENNY more than you need to!
College Freshman,2,There are seemingly many options until you've had them all. There isn't much versatility in the selection of food.
College Freshman,2,"Signing up for housing is easy, but dorms are awful."
College Junior,2,"If the party is great, it get shutdown most of the time."
College Freshman,2,The financial aid office really should sit down freshmen students and explain what is what. None of us knew what was going on all year and it's a pain. I need to know exactly how much my education is costing me.
College Freshman,2,"The food in the Eateries and the Student Center is not good. Many of my friends have ended up either sick from it or finding bones or hair in there food. Healthier options should be provided. Personally, I would prefer to not have a meal plan and be able to make all my own food. It would be cheaper and healthier."
College Student,2,Our football team is awful. Did you see how many games we won last year? But out basketball tea is the sh*t so it is worth coming and seeing us win.
College Freshman,2,"Eastern is a great school for some people. For me, it was not the right choice. It gave me a chance to inexpensively take my general credits before transferring to a different school but the parking for commuters alone is a reason not to attend. The campus is not very diverse--not just in an ethnicity sense. I am not challenged here nor intrigued by the subjects I was excited to sign up for. French, Philosophy and Women's Studies are the only classes I have truly enjoyed here."
College Freshman,2,"I have had only about three teachers I've genuinely liked and benefited from after taking nine courses at Eastern. They were the teachers that taught effectively, had a comfortable classroom and pushed you to work hard. My other teachers were lazy, unchallenging or un-effective in their teaching. I have not felt truly challenged at this school."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of the time the food gives me a stomach ache. It's gross. There are a few things that I really like, but they're only offered on certain days at certain times. However, they still give me a stomach ache and leave me feeling like garbage."
College Student,2,"I commute so I don't really experience it, but I've heard that from other students that it sucks"
College Sophomore,2,Not much variety. Same old fast food restaurants as normal
College Sophomore,2,Not many options. I dont feel like they explain much about it and just let you do it by yourself
College Sophomore,2,Not much excitement going on. Mostly a word of mouth type deal. newcomers beware
College Sophomore,2,Same thing everyday. Nothing new
College Sophomore,2,Every day I am getting an email about someone that was attacked near Eastern Michigan University.
College Freshman,2,I would never want to live here off campus. too much crime.
College Junior,2,There is a lot of crime in the surrounding areas. I do not feel 100% safe walking around after dark.
College Junior,2,There is a substantial amount of clubs and other things students can be involved in. The athletics are not as popular as other universities I have attended (U of M and MSU). I do like the smaller campus which gives a more personal feel.
College Freshman,2,"I got very unlucky with my housing situation, being stuck with a roommate that I did not get along with, so I've spent a lot of time at home to avoid the situation and I haven't been able to experince the real housing experience."
College Freshman,2,"There appear to be a lot of options, but after awhile it gets really boring, especially if you have any specific dietary restrictions."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't very many things to do off of campus. There are a few resteraunts in walking distance, but other than that there's isn't much entertainment."
College Freshman,2,"I don't go to parties, but from what I heard, they're pretty lame. Everyone goes to Ann Arbor for parties."
Junior,1,"Prepare to write discussion posts and read a lot. Online work here is challenging to keep up with. Still, it beats being left for dead by authorities on campus."
Junior,1,"It does not matter how many hours you try to study. When you are repeatedly monitored with people's phones in your face, threatened with weapons real and pretend, gossiped about, sexually harassed, threatened with crotch kicks and devastating attacks, and generally bullied by tens of students and gossiped about by HUNDREDS of people, you will NEVER feel safe enough to concentrate or succeed here. A pro-life protest led to people getting attacked verbally and physically. If you report a crime committed against you to police, they threaten, mock, and victim-blame you, say it was not a crime, call you a liar, or just say they hope you are okay with other heartwarming but meaningless comforting words without an investigation. The university authorities will never investigate complaints of threats with weapons unless the victim is a white girl. Authorities are so corrupt here, and we have had several racist incidents of threats to Black people. EMU is not safe for pro-lifers, Blacks, etc."
Alum,1,"EMU did not prepare me for my career despite the $40,000 spent in tuition here and the four years. 
I majored in elementary education. We have to take the MTTC test (teach certification) I did not pass it by 3 points, despite studying hard. Several friends I attended the program with had to take the test several times or never passed.
EMU is supposed to be known for it's good teaching program. It's not. Don't go here for there.
They do not prepare you for the MTTC. Professors should be teaching with the content of MTTC in mind. The test is $130 each time you take it on top of your $40,000 tuition. I would never recommend this university to anyone."

Sophomore,1,"If you want to live on campus, or have a classic American college experience, this school is not for you. People here could not care less about athletics; student sections at events are absolutely bare. Living on campus is a nightmare. They will give you a lot of money to live here, but you will ultimately pay the price by living in outdated, senseless dorms and eating disgusting food, and having to deal with the campus workers that would rather see the university close than have to bag groceries at the markets. The school does not value the residents at all. All new construction on campus is geared towards commuters and faculty, not residents. The dorms have not been updated in years, and there are even abandoned dorms on campus because literally no one wants to live here. Honestly, people who go here have no pride in the school, and the staff doesn't either. Don't come here. It's worth going into debt to avoid this school."
Sophomore,1,"Please trust me when I say do not pick Eastern Michigan University. The professors could care less about the students and what they are teaching. The other students are rude, unwelcoming, and honestly just weird. I cannot tell you how many people just hang around the campus that do not even attend the University. The city itself is very lame, and dangerous. The campus is outdated and not very appealing. They do, however, have a lot of off campus options for food, but the dorm food is not the best."
Niche User,1,"EMU Staff supports threats, bullying, and harassment made by one student to another. Do not attend or send your children to this school! There is a reason for the decline in enrollment and so many incentives and scholarships. 

Jeffrey Kortman, Shalonda Casanova, and two Resident Advisors have chosen to lie and punish the victim along with the aggressor, simply because they did not want to take the time to complete a proper investigation. Even when told there are recordings of the events complained about, they still chose to ignore it. 

The worst thing you can feel as a parent from hundreds of miles away, is that you cannot protect your child and those put in the position to help, do nothing. STAY AWAY FROM EMU!!!"
Alum,1,"Please check the 4 year graduation rate at this place.  Its horrendous, the counselors are there to keep you in school as long as they can. They just want to milk as much money out of you as they can. It's the most unethical thing I've ever seen. I have numerous friends who have been stuck there for 7+ years. I would avoid EMU at all cost."
Senior,1,"Terrible sports, terrible people, the rec looks like something from the 80's, professors are very uninterested in instructing, poor services, I've been here four years and still don't want to graduate, the food doesn't have many options( gf, vegan, dairy free, etc.) MSU has these options though, biased, nonschool spirit whatsoever.... all EMU has is its ego."
College Junior,1,"It is a very bad part about Eastern Michigan. I remember coming home from a summer class one day at around 9 P.M after working from 7 A.M to 4 P.M and then going to class, which is a 30 minute drive from my house. On my way back from this class I saw a group of Frat guys drinking on top of a roof, who has time for that? aren't college students meant to be poor? how are they paying for their dues? how do they have time to drink on top of a roof at 9 P.M?"
College Freshman,1,They kinda lost to the Romans so they are super bad.
College Freshman,1,"I cannot name a single person I know that has gone to a football game at my school, let alone any other sport. I have met one person that was involved in a sport, and then the rest of the time, school spirit comes from wearing our colors and clothing from the bookstore and that's about it. Most of our money goes into athletics: the football field, the teams, etc, but sports are highly unpopular here."
College Freshman,1,they suck and have the worst rating
College Freshman,1,Too much emphasis is put on varsity athletics when they aren't even winning teams. Club teams get no support from the school and cannot use the same athletic facilities as the varsity athletes. The school cares way too much about varsity sports when they receive such small attendance ratings and most students hate the programs because of the unfair treatment of athletes compared to regular students.
College Freshman,1,Football Team Sucks but I'm trying to make the team.
College Freshman,1,Teams suck and the Rec Center is very run down.
College Junior,1,Eastern Michigan is poor at sports. Due to the fact we often loose students don't take the time to support our teams either. The school had to offer accentives to have people attend games such as free items and still doesn't get a big turn out.
College Freshman,1,I'm not staying in dorms for next semester. so many bugs and lack of airflow. It's the worst
College Senior,1,"It is ridiculous that you have to have a meal plan. It is a waste of money. There are hardly any healthy options or food that you can make yourself that isn't disgusting. Literally, the only good thing is that starbucks is covered by flex"
College Sophomore,1,Very scary off-housing apartments around campus. Shootings and robbery frequently
College Freshman,1,unless you get in your car and travel to ann arbor there is nothing but drunks and drug dealers in ypsi. i dont go out here.
College Junior,1,There are not that many places to dine off campus around here that even seem interesting to try.
College Freshman,1,Always had to park all the way in the back
Recent Alumnus,1,There have been multiple attacks around and near campus. There was even a suspected murder while I attended the university.
College Sophomore,1,It's not so good. It cost too much for us students to park and also for guests too.
College Senior,1,It's Michigan weather.  Not much else to say here.  The winter this year is terrible and is extending into March.  You really can't do anything outside because it's too cold.
College Freshman,1,"ughh, that's all I can say"
College Sophomore,1,This semester alone EMU has had the most university closings in history due to the snow blizzards.
College Sophomore,1,EMU is a well below average ranked university. EMU and Saginaw Valley state are probably the 2 lowest ranked public universities in the state of Michigan
College Sophomore,1,Its a commuter university so parking is horrible. You have to park a few miles off campus and take the school bus back to campus
College Sophomore,1,"Ypsilanti is such an awful city, and EMU's academic reputation is bad, and the school seems poorly ran"
College Sophomore,1,"Im a C student out of high school and I have people trying to copy off me during tests, lol. The school is convenient and close to metro Detroit, but it's academics are bad"
College Sophomore,1,"This school really lacks diversity. Besides a few international students or athletes that come from a different state. This university is 65% white, and 25% black and very little else. Extremely undiverse university"
College Sophomore,1,"My dad supposedly makes too much money and although he's not helping me at all because him and my mom are divorced, I received no grants or scholarships. I was just offered loans but I turned them down, I dont want to be in debt forever"
College Student,1,Its unsafe and what makes matters worse is that people don't take responsibility for themselves. Its best to just live on campus. There are a lot of places that trick you into houses or apartments for low cost but you get what you pay for... safety is part of that.
College Student,1,We are not very good at sports.
College Senior,1,The most dangerous areas of campus seem to be the dorms. The crime logger for the university has reports of sexual assaults occurring weekly. The immediate areas outside of campus are not safe either. There have been a couple of shootings and several assaults in the fall 2013 semester alone.
College Senior,1,they if u join are horrible to you 
College Senior,1,hate teachers the school is not good on updating us on safety concerns 
College Freshman,1,I haven't been out yet
College Junior,1,"Many of the affordable apartments around campus are not safe. I have lived in two apartment complexes off campus and have had three murders occur in those apartment complexes as I was living there. Any apartments that are nice arent in a close distance to campus and are way too expensive for a college student. I guess its worth paying extra to be safe, but still. Were college students that arent made of money."
College Sophomore,1,Many of my friends have to find parking it's terrible.  It can take them 30 minutes to find a park.  Parking tickets are about 100 a semester.  You should go campus early to find a park before your class start.
College Junior,1,Just underage drinking and marijuana use.
College Senior,1,"This is Michigan, so therefore expect Michigan weather.  A couple of days in the middle of September it was unbearably hot, and literally a couple of days later you needed to be in a hoodie and wearing some sort of layers.  Just remember, come prepared for everything in Michigan."
Recent Alumnus,1,Sometimes getting financial aide is difficult and if there are problems you can expect a long wait and lots of hassle before it is resolved.
College Freshman,1,"I have recieved a scholarship for four years but it is not a lot. The parent loan doesn't go through for some people so when they go to fix it, they give you less money and end up paying like $5,000 out of pocket."
College Sophomore,1,"All of the food is processed, so it is like eating Mcdonald's all day everyday."
College Senior,1,"I live close to campus so I walk because if I were to drive, I would have to walk the same distance as I would if I were to walk anyway."
College Sophomore,1,"It's a terrible school where most of the ""professors"" and staff are more worried what they're getting paid than what they are teaching.  Most show little to no concern about the welfare of the students."
College Sophomore,1,I personally do not like the campus dining. I think that every thing is overpriced sometimes food is cooked properly or sometimes the food isn't good. I try my best to avoid it.
College Junior,1,"hard to find a good parking space close to your classes, I had rack up numerous parking ticket while run late to classes"
College Freshman,1,"You can buy a commuter or resident tag, but spaces for commuters are very limited. Unless you get here by 8 am each day, there's virtually no spaces. You often see people driving around or waiting around in lots for people to come out and leave. You are ""recommended"" to park all the way in the back of campus, and it's not a fun walk. 

The easiest thing to do is not buy a tag at all, and pay $8 per day in the pay lots. It's much more expensive, but much less irritating."
College Junior,1,"It is a hassle. They send you through loops, and you won't get all the money you might need to cover costs. If you don't pay your tuition bill on time, you get hit with several different fees, making the cost of school even more expensive."
College Junior,1,"The only transportation that we have is the shuttle to the College of Business. It runs around campus, but it doesn't go into the city."
College Junior,1,Actually on campus parking is expensive.  I heard it was $150 per semester. Plus it is difficult to find a parking spot at 10 am.  It is possible to be looking for a spot for an hour.  My solution is to not pay the fee and park off campus and ride the shuttle.  It adds more commute time but I am always sure of a parking spot.
College Student,1,Eastern is a party school. There is always a party here or there but i'm not in that scene
College Freshman,1,The parking is really terrible. You need to be here 30-45 minutes before your class if you have a hope to find a spot.
College Senior,1,Parking sucks.  Not enough free parking spaces.  You have to hunt and they fill fast.
College Sophomore,1,"Hang tags are overpriced
Not enough parking
Parking spaces fill quickly

The only good lot is lot green 1. Always has spots available"
College Freshman,1,Honestly i dont like it. i went to a all black high school and eastern is hs with dorms. parties always get shutdown and food in ypsi period is not the great and downtown sucks. one thing i do love are the small class sizes. other than that i will be transferring

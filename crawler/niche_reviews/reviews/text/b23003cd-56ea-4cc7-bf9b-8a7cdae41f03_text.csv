Freshman,5,"I love the small class sizes, and that BTC is integrated with the local business community and can help me get a good local job after graduation."
Sophomore,5,The staff is extremely helpful and willing to take the time to assist you with your needs. Smaller classrooms means more one on one with your instructor. Free tutoring is also available to all students. It seems most students are on a mission for a career but are willing to reach out a hand to help others succeed as well.
Junior,5,"The staff is so helpful and encouraging. I had so many questions when I started my college experience 20 years after I graduated from high school.From  the counselors to the financial aid staff I have been so impressed with there knowledge and help. I have met many other classmates of all ages I never feel out of place. The diversity of ages, stages and experiences is a wonderful thing about BTC. My education that I have received so far has advanced my career. I-am continuing further in my education and the dean is so involved in the new programs I feel that this is why the school is so successful."
Freshman,5,I love it here. Small class sizes and amazing instructors. They seem to always want to care and want you yo succeed. Plus the pricing of the classes are super chepa compared to whatcom 10/10 will keep going here.
Freshman,5,This is a very good school with excellent programs! The professors are very good and helpful. My experience there so far is good. I wouldn't pick another technical school to go to. This one is a 15 minute drive from home. I highly recommend it to anyone thinking about attending.
Sophomore,5,The teachers here are extremely helpful and engaging. The only thing this school wants from you is to succeed.
Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience attending BTC. I particularly want to say that the Accessibility Resources Department is outstanding. I am so grateful that I've had the opportunity to attend Bellingham Technical College.
Sophomore,5,"I've been attending Bellingham Technical College for about two years now. I love it here - especially the science department, which is where I primarily take my classes. The majority of the professors I've learned from care greatly about their students' success and spend a great deal of effort on their course materials. The hands-on experience of the technical college comes through even in humanities classes and provides an excellent method of learning in science classes. I can't wait to begin my program (surgery technology) in this upcoming fall quarter."
Alum,5,Teachers really care that you know your stuff and make it fun. By the end you have friends for life in your cohort and are more than ready to jump into your field.

Niche User,5,Choosing to attend BTC was a decision that I will never regret doing. Being a student at BTC allowed me to become a Work Study Student where I work on campus as a grounds worker. We also have great faculty and staff that have helped me and guided me to become a more successful student. I am 100% positive that once I get my AA degree I will have a fruitful future.
Freshman,5,"Best experience I have had with professors and staff. They are all super friendly and so willing to help you. I really love the class sizes, too. The classes I've had so far have ranged from 12-28 students. This is the perfect size to really get to know the material and your classmates. Also, I think it is amazing that the school tries to cut the costs of textbooks as much as they can. They made my education much more affordable by doing so. "
College Sophomore,5,The classes I needed for both my first quarter and the upcoming fall quarter were all flexible and worked perfectly around my family and employment obligations. It has all been very hassle free. I do not need or have not needed to transfer credits.
College Sophomore,5,"The quality of the professors and the courses they teach are superb. I especially admire my Math 90 instructor who made math not only easy to understand, but understood my life experiences and offered to work with me. She was incredible and I'm ever so slightly saddened that I no longer need a math class that I can take from her."
College Sophomore,5,"My decision to go back to Bellingham Technical College was specifically to switch careers. Up to this point, I have a lot of confidence in my ability to ear the education I need to get a job in a field in which I have very limited experience. That is all I can speak to at this point in my education."
College Sophomore,5,"Spring 2016 was my first quarter at Bellingham Technical College. My classes were all prerequisites and the workload was enough to keep me engaged, but not overwhelming. My plan is to obtain certificates then progress to an associates degree in Administrative Assistant. Bellingham Technical College's facilities are perfect for students who don't have many resources. I found their library especially useful when I was waiting for the resources to cover internet access, a new laptop, and textbooks."
College Sophomore,5,"I often recommend Bellingham Technical College to my friends that are considering going back to school. The campus is beautiful, the schedules are flexible for those with families and employment responsibilities, and they have supported me at every step of the process."
College Junior,5,Taking online classes allowed me to complete my prerequisites while still working.
College Junior,5,Class sizes are small and the professors are able to give individual attention to the students.
College Sophomore,5,The online courses are very user-friendly. The instructors are also quick to responding to emails whenever an assignment is unclear. Some of the classes have been extremely helpful the real world too. I've been graded on cover letters and resumes.
College Sophomore,5,Each program has a high rate of job opportunities. The instructors also help students with employment post-grad.
College Sophomore,5,The career prospects are amazing. Each program allows students to work hands-on with their desired career. Each program offers externships so that they know what to expect when out in the real world.
College Junior,5,All of the instructors that I have met are always willing to help their students.  They answer questions and provide advice without doing the work for the students.  They also work to make assignments easier to understand while checking to make sure that assignments are indeed turned in.
College Junior,5,"I have not yet begun attendance at this school but I am registered for the upcoming quarter for a full time class-load.  I can't yet speak to the suggested topics, but I can say it has been a wonderful experience so far."

My only experience so far has been getting everything in order to being attendance, and everyone has been extremely helpful.  I think what makes BTC unique is that they go above and beyond to help their students every step of the way."
College Senior,5,"Local work forces meet with our school all the time to give feedback and inform us what they are looking for in employees today. Internships are always available and career fairs are always an option. The career center is helpful if your program is a bit more broad. Tutors can only help so much, hence why us students in the program rely on one another so much."
College Senior,5,"Once you get into your program, you have your own building you go to every day. You have your own space to work on projects during your free time and to collaborate with other students and teachers in your field. It is a small school and class sizes are small and that means lots of one on one time with your teachers and other staff. Students here rely on one another a lot to help problem solve while teachers are unavailable. Everyone in my program is like family to me and I would stay as long after class as I needed to in order to help anyone out. They would do the same for me and obviously the same for anyone else. The staff here will gladly help you make connections and get out into the work force."
College Junior,5,"Every department of Bellingham Technical College that I have had to deal with have been nothing but helpful and supportive. I feel like I have a team behind me making sure I succeed. If I need help, they are right there for me, all I have to do is ask. The instructors are helpful as well as understanding. I think this school is down to earth and they know each student has a life besides school and they support us through it all. I was new to this school, I starting spring quarter, There was only about a week maybe two before school started, the staff guided me through the beginning process and I was able to start even with my funding in place. At first I wasn't even sure exactly what I was going to school for but they advised me through the different options and I was able to decide and fill good about my decision. Here I am starting my fourth quarter at Bellingham Technical College. I know that I have a big group of BTC staff behind me."

The new building houses classrooms, student center, computer lab, library, café, and private meeting rooms for group projects.  There is a math lab and writing lab to help student refine their skills.  I-pads and scientific calculators are available to students at no cost.  Students can access scholarly, peer reviewed articles from the school's web page.  The campus is well maintained and landscaped"
College Junior,5,The class times that are offered have always fit my schedule.  I have never felt any inconvenience with trying to a class that works for me.  I have taken classes in the morning and evening.
Freshman,4,"The online classes were easy to navigate, the teachers are helpful and are willing to invest in helping you to understand the material and expectations."
Sophomore,4,"I haven't had too many negative experiences with BTC. I originally attended back in 2010 and enjoyed every minute of it. 
It's changed a lot now that I'm going back, but not necessarily in a negative way. Somehow everything works swimmingly and I've had some hiccups along the way, but everyone has been very accommodating and things have been falling into place. I'm very excited to attend the Dental Assisting program and am looking forward to getting my certification and going into the workforce. I am thankful Bellingham Technical College is here to help me and get me in the right direction."
Freshman,4,"The staff was very pleasant. They were informative, they helped me with all my questions and concerns. It needs to be bigger"
College Junior,4,All classes are spaced out very well making it easy to go to work
College Junior,4,My teachers are very helpful
College Junior,4,I am thankful for the help in the tutoring center. Couldn't of passed math without them

They were very helpful in showing how the program would correlate to jobs in the industry in my state and whether there were current job opportunities and demand for employment."
College Junior,4,"At BTC, all the staff and teacher's have been extremely helpful in the overall success of the students. As a new student, I was given great access to information and help to make sure I was able to get the services I needed from financial aid, class schedules and additional program offerings."

College Junior,4,The program I am attending is very much geared toward helping me obtain a job in my field.

College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are kept at a reasonable number. I feel comfortable asking questions because there's never too many people.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy that the school provides a real dental clinic for students to work with.
College Sophomore,4,I think each department that I have dealt with has been helpful with getting back into school.
College Junior,4,"It is not at all hard to start or enhance a career after or even during college.  Part time jobs and internships are available for many of the students at BTC, and the teachers here help students with being successful."
College Junior,4,I found it easy to choose which classes to take because I was given a list of the classes I needed and then could choose between different times to have that class.  The whole scheduling process seemed very easy to me.
College Junior,4,"At school, I have learned so much in the past few months.  I am often trying things that are new to me as well as getting more experience and knowledge regarding the tools and materials around me.  Some of the things that I do in the machining program surprise me, and my instructors help me all the way.  Also, the instructors are working to make the machine shop more efficient and organized the way a shop would be in the real world.  Overall, all these things make me confident that I will be successful after college."
College Junior,4,"Bellingham Technical College is a great school because while it is not perfect, the teachers and staff work to make the campus better for the students as well as helping students be successful."
College Senior,4,I have only had a few hybrid classes and they were straight forward and provided all the information needed to complete the course.
College Senior,4,"Small school, which means not that many teachers for your program. We have to make due with what we have. One out of my two teachers really sucks with prepping lectures and answering questions. Due to this, us students have to rely on one another a lot more. It makes our problem solving skills strengthen at least. The staff here is super helpful and we all have jobs waiting for us once we graduate thanks to the connections this school and staff have provided. They give us honest answers about the work force and it makes figuring out our paths a lot easier."
College Senior,4,"My program is very specific and we only have two teachers to rely on. Each teacher knows their field though, so if I am having trouble in one class, only one teacher can help answer those questions. The students in this program have to rely on one another a lot to trouble shoot problems and work together as a group when the teacher is unavailable. 

The workload keeps you busy and you really need time out of your life to be in the lectures and in the computer lab working on perfecting projects."
College Junior,4,The location is a little far to drive back and forth. But it save a lot of money if you carpool
College Senior,4,I like the flexible schedule!

Recent Alumnus,4,"The professors are really smart when it come to lecturing, the system is all setup to make understanding much easier to students."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My major is Radiology Technology, I am still working on my prerequisites right now but i hear there is a long waitlist to get into the program."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The school administration is supper nice, so is the instructors. They all share a common goal to help we the students achieve success."
College Junior,4,The teachers are very flexible on their schedules.  If you miss a day as long as you let them know a head of time they usually get all the work you missed.
College Junior,4,They help second year students with internships and always have their eyes open for any job openings available.
College Junior,4,Everyone here is willing to help you the best they can! The librarians are super nice and very helpful when you need their help.

College Junior,4,I n my program we prepare food for students and faculty right on campass
College Junior,4,I have learned a lot about the career I have chosen.
College Junior,4,I didn't understand it so much it they were all very helpful.
College Junior,4,Everyone works together to make sure u get what u need.
College Junior,4,I had no trouble transfering my credits. Some classes expire after 5 years so you have to retake them. For example most math and science classes.
College Senior,4,The program is well arranged. Gaining experience is important in any field and with this school you can have some by the time you are thru with the course.
College Senior,4,They have been very helpful
Recent Alumnus,4,Some unique things about my school is that the welding program has their sculptures set up around campus and that it is a smaller campus so it is a very close knit environment.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I am in the Accounting Program and the Administrative Assistant Program and I really like that there is a club for those programs where you can talk to peers and I also really like the fact that you get an adviser for each program. My advisers also sent me e-mails when they get internship or job notifications, which is very helpful."
Recent Alumnus,4,I really enjoy BTC and think it is a great alternative to WWU if a student wants to get their general classes over with before going to a University. It is also a great trade school.
College Junior,4,"BTC is great. Nice staff, great online and hybrid courses with good hours. I've always been able to get the classes I want. 

My only complaint is that the standards sometimes feel a little low. I've also attended Western Washington University and Washington State University and sometimes the standards just feel...like tech college standards. 

Staff in the administration was very helpful and followed up, even the Financial Aid department!"
Recent Alumnus,4,Financial aid is available and the counselors in these departments are good.
Recent Alumnus,4,They have lots of pre-requisite classes.
College Junior,4,Financial Aid was easy to obtain and the staff was very helpful in answering my questions. The only complaint I have was that the cost of tools was not made abundantly clear prior to my enrollment in the program. 
College Junior,4,"The program is broken up into quarters with each quartering emphasizing a different part of HVAC/R: heating, refrigeration, ice machines, electrical theory, etc. Most mornings begin with lecture specific to our current projects and transition to hands-on projects working on various equipment mid-morning into the afternoon. 
There are many different kinds of equipment we have the opportunity to work on and there is always something to do. 
Internships are available over the summer and job placement after graduation is very high."
College Junior,4,"The quality of the HVAC/R program is top-notch. The instructors have a wealth of industry experience and are very knowledgeable. They're very friendly, understanding, patient and try to be as flexible and accommodating as possible to individual student needs."
College Junior,4,"I have not had a chance to speak to anyone about this yet, as I just started my program last quarter."
College Junior,4,The tuition and financial aid process is well organized and I feel I am getting a good value of education for my money.
College Junior,4,"The student body at BTC is primarily made up of hard working kids in their 20's, training for work in the real world."
College Junior,4,"BTC is in the middle of a major renovation, replacing most of the old buildings. Because of this, there are many great work spaces and the labs for my area of study are all up to date with industry."
College Junior,4,"Being a first time student, I had no credits to transfer, however the staff has been very flexible so far with any issues brought to their attention."
College Junior,4,"It's a great hands-on learning environment, I cannot wait until the next quarter begins to see what I will be learning next."
College Junior,4,"Instrumentation seems to be a unique program offered at BTC, tailored to the oil refineries in the area. However, once earned, this degree can take my almost anywhere. "
Recent Alumnus,2,Problems after problems with their systems.
Recent Alumnus,2,My major at this school would be on-line.
College Junior,2,"I don't have any pure online classes, but my communications class is hybrid; that is, partly in class, partly online. We're expected to spend 2 hours a week on the class site, but that's grossly out of line with reality. You can spend about 20 minutes actually doing something productive on the site; after that you're just logging time. The actual UI and layout is good though."
College Senior,2,Counselors didn't know about any school but their own.
College Senior,2,The professors are great.  I do have to say the courses are not available when they are needed.  Not enough teachers to teach the courses everyone wants.  If you get into a class the course is usually fine.
College Senior,2,Courses are very good if you can get into one.  Courses are not given every quarter.  Some classes fill up too fast and there is no way to take a class you need.  Think there should be more classes.  Some classes are not given each quarter which messes up your entire schooling schedule.
College Junior,2,Online Vs Face to Face – Some of us absolutely need the face to face time and there are not enough of those classes available.
College Junior,2,"The business classes are few and far between. Need to have alot more classes in each quarter, especially face to face and summer. I think there was only one available this summer for me."
College Senior,1,No instructions on using the system.  Assumed students had already used the system.  Had lots of problems getting answers.
College Senior,1,Asked many questions and was told to google for my answers.
College Senior,1,They teach the same class over and over.  You have to turn in your tests so the next class won't be able to see it.
College Freshman,1,beginning of the school year an adviser gave me 4 options for classes and i picked 3 of them. now financial aid wil not pay for them because they are not part of my program which i was not aware of. advising is not willing to help with what they did and are making me pay for those classes with money i do not have.

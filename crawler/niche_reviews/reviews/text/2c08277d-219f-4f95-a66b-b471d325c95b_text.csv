Freshman,5,"i love there academics there football coaches were extravagant, I am a future football player for missouri southern and a future sack leader of all d2 schools."

This way  you are not just another face in the crowd."
Sophomore,5,MSSU is a beautiful campus with a homey small town feel. Southern is very student oriented and you can tell that the professors care about the students as a whole and not just their academics.
Sophomore,5,"I love MSSU because it gives you a good college life form living in the dorms to the activities that the be having on campus it’s always a way to get involved. Also, the school is very diverse and there are people from everywhere I met some of the best people that I know at this school and wouldn’t trade it for nothing."

Works Here,5,"WORST of all UNIVERSITY ever you can find in the whole country, PLEASE  PLEASE KEEP IN MIND  ALL   ARE   FAKE and nonsense  REVIEWS WRITTEN BY FAKE AND PAID PEOPLE.
IF you want to ruin your whole life and future as well then come to this university this is a very very racist university especially the Registrar s DEPARTMENT is the worst in the country, for  example, there is a lady Denice Brown who is a double-faced person , works there and acts like the President of the university she likes to help black people only and will act very rudely and very devilish with all other students especially if your a French person.

please do your self a favor and look for another university ."
Freshman,5,"The registrar office department and the international student's department was very helpful with me as I was an international student from a small city in India and needed some help to transfer some credits, so both the departments helped me a lot with solving all my problems."
Freshman,5,"I loved how everyone is so eager to help. If you have any questions you will always have somebody to go to. Going through the enrollment process, I had a lot of question as far as deadlines go, and my adviser was able to answer all of them. The student life on campus is amazing. You will meet tons of friends and people who have the same interest as you. Missouri Southern State University offers a great deal of support."
Freshman,5,I loved the friendly atmosphere. The professors were always willing to help and wanted you to succeed. I loved all of the traditions and clubs the college had to offer.
Sophomore,5,"Missouri Southern has a beautiful atmosphere. When I was touring the campus, my guide was the best guide I had ever had and I have visited a lot of colleges.

Sophomore,5,"Missouri Southern has done so much for me! The instructors care so much about me and my education. They work well with my schedule and are understanding. I work hard, but Missouri Southern brings out the best things in me, and encourages me to be better. The dorms are super affordable.

 I love this school and will treasure the rest of my time here on this BEAUTIFUL campus."

Niche User,5,"From what I have experienced, it's a great school in a nice small town. Professors try their best to help you out."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here, lots of variety of people as opposed to Missouri state.  Great education and teachers who you get close with and they really.  Really inexpensive and the rec center is fantastic.  There are always things to do about every week, Joplin is not all that hype but if you join some clubs and get involved you can have a lot of fun.  The fraternity's are not super expensive and do most of the same stuff you would see at other bigger school.  Parties depends on who your friends are.  Basic dorms suck, more expensive ones are a lot nicer but at that point it would be better to get some friends and find an inexpensive apartment closeby"
Junior,5,I think this school offers a great opportunity to advance in schooling. I am in the Education field and Special education and love it! They teach you all things understandably and all professors are flexible. I believe MSSU is where you can start your career.
Sophomore,5,Missouri Southern is a smaller 4-year college in small town. Classes are small and teachers provide a lot of one on one help that a student will need. This school gives you a numerous amount of help to get you to your degree. This university is very affordable.
Freshman,5,Well this is my first year. So im just trying to get acclimated.  Just work hard.  Study even harder. Have fun but remember  why you are there
Junior,5,"I love everything about this campus in Joplin, MO. The faculty and staff are friendly and always greet students with a smile. The campus is very diverse too. I love that there are so many clubs and organizations and if there isn't one for you then you can create one! I also really enjoy all of the activities that CAB presents throughout the semesters."
Niche User,5,I love Missouri Southern! The professors are awesome and they are so kind to help you if you need it. The activities on campus are fun and engaging and will help you as you go out into the world after graduation! Study abroad opportunities are available for any length of time really and you can get credit for classes too! Go lions!!
Freshman,5,I came from Hawaii to go to school at Missouri Southern. The small classes were really what drew me in to wanting to attend this school. It's nice to have some one on one time with your professors. I also love that the people are so friendly and helpful and point you in the right direction if you ever need it. I will be staying to finish my four years here!
Junior,5,It is a great university with small class sizes and professors that actually care about seeing you succeed. The Southern community is diverse and educating.
Senior,5,"Missouri Southern has always been a well known university in my area. Many individuals I know personally have graduated from or attended Missouri Southern State University. Last semester, I transferred to Missouri Southern and have experienced nothing less than excellence. All of my teachers are incredibly intelligent. They are more than willing to help me with any of my academic inquiries."
Freshman,5,"Missouri Southern State University is a great school to get started off with! It is a four year college, but I prefer to go to a bigger college for the next 3 years. MSSU is very clean and fun."
Freshman,5,Very good school overall. Teachers work with students to get the most out of the educational experience. A Student gets to have the experience of a large college but the feel of a small college.
Junior,5,"Missouri Southern State University is an excellent school to attend. I am a communication student at Southern and I have been offered countless opportunities. From studying abroad, and extra curricular activities to working in the Relations and Marketing office, I have gained so much experience in such a short amount of time!"
Niche User,5,The Faculty and Staff are friendly and promote a family atmosphere. Since they have smaller classes you get more personal attention.
Freshman,5,"Overall a beautiful campus with lots of activities, good classes with friendly professors, tons of programs to help you succeed, and a very good price."
College Senior,5,I think that the professors at this school know what their talking about. I never had a teacher that I thought was just teaching here for a pay check. They enjoy teaching and being at this school.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. There is always a professor somewhere on campus and someone to go to if there was ever a problem.
College Freshman,5,I love how small the class sizes are. The professors can get to know us and help us with any questions that we have. It is also very easy to make friends in classes since there are not a lot of people. The professors are very nice and are willing to help us.
College Freshman,5,"I love that my school is small enough to where the professors know you by name and are always friendly. They are willing to help you outside of class time, which is very important to me. I also love that MSSU has many student activities on campus to get involved in, which is where I met all of my friends this semester. It is also very close to where I went to high school. I love everything about Missouri Southern and would highly recommend it to any incoming freshman."
College Senior,5,"The athletics department brings in so many people! The programs are really good, I think the basketball team usually does the best and I think more people come out to see that."
College Junior,5,The professors that I have had know what they are teaching and do it at the level of the student and encourage us to go beyond the norm. Though there are some online professors who tend to test students on subjects that have not been covered in the lectures before the test. And they are not consistent with tests. One test will be open book and the next will be not. There needs to be more consistency.
College Junior,5,My degree has 100% placement in the field.
College Junior,5,"Outstanding, particularly along with the value."
College Junior,5,No known issues of any kind with crime
College Junior,5,"This is a tremendous program one of only 32 nationally recognized.  The school is small and well suited for adult learners, the professors are leaders in their fields and the school is continuously improving.  Tuition is beyond cheap, and in state rates are offered regionally and to military."
Freshman,4,I took classes online during the summer and it was my first time taking college classes the professors were very helpful and understanding.
Freshman,4,"MSSU uses the Blackboard website for academics online. It functions fairly well. However, the student portal that connects students to all their resources is poorly organized and confusing to navigate."
Freshman,4,"The community at MSSU is quite small, which I view as an advantage. Staff members are eager to offer extra support and form individual relationships with students. The campus isn't amazing, but it's enough."
Freshman,4,"I am currently going into Missouri Southern as a freshman, but have dealt with them in the past as a dual enrollment student. I have found that when you need the help, the professors are very helpful, and my advisor is AMAZING! She is very helpful and when I have a question about my financial aid, the department is very quick at responding. The professors that I have had in the past were great, but like all colleges, you do end up with some professors that are stricter than others so just be wary."
Freshman,4,I have taken classes online as a dual enrollment student and did not like them because I personally work better in a classroom setting.
Alum,4,Professors adapted curriculum to the online format when needed and were lenient in understanding the difficulties it brought upon students.
Alum,4,I enjoyed my professors and their involvement in my education and success. I felt valued in my courses and like my professors genuinely cared.
Junior,4,A smaller campus makes for smaller classes meaning more one on one classes. The overall atmosphere is people are just there for learning. Not very much to do or experience in the surrounding community.
Junior,4,I have enjoyed all my classes and my professors have all been very supportive. I also think they have a valuable teacher education program.
Sophomore,4,I found Missouri Southern to be a very interactive and great college experience. I think what draws me best to it and appeals to me the most is the small class sizes and the ability to be able to get to talk with your professors.
Sophomore,4,I love Missouri Southern and I have made so many good friends here. I only wish the college was a little bigger I feel like I know so many people I never get to meet new people. I also which
Sophomore,4,It's a great place if you want to be in a secluded area with just you and your friends and other people you might sometimes meet.
Niche User,4,"went for campus visit. community feel. not huge campus, safe and affordable. popular academics. nice staff and diversity. no bells and whistles but academic buildings were up to date which is the main important thing. recreation and wellness clinic on site is helpful."
Junior,4,"I like that MSSU is a small college. I get overwhelmed with really busy places, so I enjoy this small campus. I've met some great friends through classes and activities. MSSU provides great programs  and is strong academically. The food could improve. There needs to be more options in the Den and more variety of food every week in the cafeteria."
Niche User,4,One of my favorite things about Missouri Southern would be their facilities! They have an amazing new football facility.
Junior,4,"The department and area I am interning in is a very good department. Graduates from this department are daughters after all around the country. The teachers are very thorough in their teaching. If anyone has questions they answer it to the best of their ability, and if they don’t know, they find it or ask the student to look it up. They teach with as much hands on as they can, and show visual images for those things that cannot be hands on.  I would recommend the Respiratory Therapy department and field of study to anyone out there who is considering something but not sure what they want to do yet. It is the best kept secret in the medical field. If you are looking for a school that has a lot to offer yet is in a smaller community, Missouri Southern State University is the place for you!"
Senior,4,"It was hard to get know campus. The people in charge of living area are terrible. I felt as if they were there to make resident students' life worse. The campus itself, it is a beautiful place. Located in a small town however its big enough to avoid big traffic."
Senior,4,"This university has a very good teacher to student ratio. Professors are friendly, courses are taught fairly, and the campus is great!"
Freshman,4,"My first semester at Missouri Southern State University was a good one. I got the chance to meet and get close with my professors. Almost all of them reached out and tried to help me strive for greatness in every way. As long as I put in the effort, they reciprocated the same effort and that is a connection every college student needs. Although I have only been here for a short time, this time has been great and there is no reason why I would consider transferring anywhere else."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman that is currently attending Missouri Southern State University. So far this has been a great experience for me. I traveled over 561 miles to attend this university for the lowest rate tuition, the business program that is offered and to also become a potential player on the basketball team. At first I was a little nervous about my decision to attend a college far away from my family but, now I feel more at ease. The students, instructors and staff members are all amazing. Everyone is so friendly, respectful and helpful. The instructors  explain assignments well and tutors are available if needed in most subjects. Movie nights on the football field are the best and hanging out after classes or on the weekends with friends in the gaming room is fun. I enjoy working out at the gym that is on campus and practice with teammates in the rec center. I would recommend this university to all potential newcomers."
Freshman,4,Missouri Southern is a great place to meet students from a diverse number of backgrounds and viewpoints.  It's a very social campus teeming with academically invested people who actively strive to improve themselves and the world around them. Attending MSSU will allow you to grow yourself socially as a person while growing your intelligence by learning from passionate and knowledgeable professors who genuinely care about your education. The cost is amazing too!
Sophomore,4,"I personally enjoyed my semester at MSSU. The teachers were knowledgeable and friendly, the social work department is incredible, and they even have a food bank for students who may be struggling to pay for food. However, there is very limited options when it comes to clubs and extra-curricular activities on campus. I would love to see a wider array of clubs to join on campus."
Freshman,4,"I have been going here on and off due to not able to get the FAFSA until I can complete 12 credit hours myself. MSSU has been really great though, they like to get their students involved. I used to go to their movie nights that they provided, also got free snacks when you went to those.
Mssu is a fun school to attend."
Sophomore,4,Missouri Southern State is a good size school. I have been provided with nothing but help from everyone on campus. I feel very comfortable at MSSU.
Junior,4,I Started school here in 2009 to run track. The professors are nice and definitely cares about you future.
Alum,4,"I have recently graduated from Missouri Southern State University with my bachelors in health sciences. I have taken classes on campus as well as online, the classes are small so it is easy to ask questions. Most professors are great."
Sophomore,4,"I love Missouri Southern! All of the professors I’ve had are always more than willing to help you, and are kind. The student body is pretty friendly as well. There are a few things that need updated and worked on, but other than that, I love this university! This is not really a party school (I’m not complaining. I’m here to learn after all!) The sports are ok. It just all depends on which one you’re talking about. The location of this school is excellent! It’s just on the outskirts, and it’s not hard to get anywhere you need. Joplin is just the right size to start out in if you’re from a smaller town like me. There are fun activities almost every week for students to participate in, and sometimes they even show movies."
Freshman,4,"It is a little difficult to make friends here at first, but once you get a few it seems like your circle gets bigger and bigger. The professors I have had have all been very kind and good teachers, willing to help you learn and understand during class or afterwards."
Junior,4,Missouri Southern I think is a really good place for education. If you like a smaller type class system this place is for you. I play baseball here at MSSU also. The teachers are very nice and respectful. Especially with athletes. They are flexible on assignments and taking test whenever you are busy at a game. They are known for their education programs and nursing. They have an awesome business department too. The parking is kinda limited the first week of classes but as the year goes on it starts to empty. I enjoy MSSU a lot and I am happy I chose to travel down here from Kansas City. It is a very affordable college. I do recommend people to pursue academics or athletics here.
Niche User,4,"i live around campus and have many connections with the college. it’s a tiny school and a fairly small area, so not much night life or anything happening. very popular with local kids, and a very obvious choice after graduation. however parties are subpar and many students attend parties at nearby schools."
Alum,4,"I like that this university is always expanding the programs available. 

One thing I'd like to see changed is the parking. It would be great if they built a couple of parking garages and had more parking spaces available on the west side of campus."
Sophomore,4,The diversity is immense and most everyone seems very open minded. I am really enjoying my experience here and I would highly recommend this school to others.
Freshman,4,MSSU has a very active student body. There is always something happening around campus. There is a decent dining hall with plenty of options as well as a really nice gym that students have access to.
Junior,4,I like MSSU it has good one on one with professor relationship. The class size is small and all the professor are nice and helpful.
Freshman,4,I like my professors so far. The campus is really pretty and it will look beautiful in the fall once the leaves start changing. The rec center is also really nice and the band is really good. I am excited for the rest of this year!
Freshman,4,"Missouri Southern is a very inclusive school. When I say inclusive, I mean with the classes, my peers, and my professors. While in a lecture, I find that the professors are incredibly good with making sure that everybody understands the lesson. My peers were always very kind and understanding. They were willing to help me with anything I needed, whether it be homework, finding  a class, or preparing for a test."
Sophomore,4,This is my first year at Missouri Southern so I do not know what it is like but I cannot wait to find out.
Sophomore,4,"What I personally like about Missouri Southern State university is that it is not to big of a school, but not to small of a school!  the class room ratio is about 20:1.  Which shows that students will be able to communicate to their teachers on another level than if you went to a bigger school, you might not get."
Senior,4,"My experice at Missouri Southern is better then going to a large university. At Southern students get a one on one with professors. Southern offers students real experiece oppotunites to prepare them for their career path. In the communication deparentment students can host a news series, public relation students can build their network with PRSSA, and mass communication students can learn how to broadcast and record on cameras and radio stations. Missouri Southern is small, yet growing fast with students and studying opportunites."
Sophomore,4,"I love the size of this school. I grew up in a small town and enjoy building academic relationships with my college professors as I did in high school. The faculty at MSSU truly cares about their students' success, and the school is in a good location for networking to begin careers in close cities/towns. Good networking opportunities in Joplin! Also, a fantastic education for the price you pay."
Freshman,4,"You get what you pay for. It's a pretty small campus, but it has a wide variety of clubs and activities to choose from. The food isn't great. The academic programs seem successful, especially the criminal justice and health sciences departments."
Sophomore,4,An easy campus to navigate. Very good interaction with professors. Holds lots of fun events for college students. Well protected. Makes the community feel involved. Needs to work on the food in cafeteria.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy going to this university. The class sizes are small, the teachers know your name and don't mind going the extra mile with you to help you learn and understand."
Graduate Student,4,"Missouri Southern has a great online business program that works well for working adults. All ther professors are great and are happy to assist students in the learning process. Their career services department provides excellent tips and assistance in job searching, writing cover letters and building resumes.
I'm disappointed in the lack of online options for the master's in management program. The program was designed to be for working professional, but isn't set up that way.  The program mainly offers a lot of evening classes several of which begin at 5:30pm, which is not conducive for working professionals."
Sophomore,4,"I like the small class sizes, reasonable campus size, and peaceful community. It's not a hard party school,  which improves safety and experience. The best part are how many international students are on campus, allowing you to interact with different cultures daily."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Missouri Southern State University so far, albeit I have only been there a semester, has been extremely positive. First, I only knew two people at MSSU. Only knowing two people may seem frightening, especially for someone who is shy, but it is actually one of the best experiences about moving away from home. I believe this because it gives you a clean sheet and forces you out of your comfort zone.  Second, the staff is phenomenal. The professors, financial aid workers, registrar aids, and even the dining hall ladies are all very friendly which helps creates a homey environment. Lastly, and significantly, the campus feels safe. As a woman I would walk the campus alone, at night, and wearing headphones and not once did I feel threatened. After saying all of this, there is one drawback to MSSU. The lack of spirit towards clubs and sports. However, MSSU is still a remarkable university."
Sophomore,4,"I currently attend Missouri Southern State University and I love it there. Most of the professors are great, and the students are great as well. The campus is really nice too."
Freshman,4,"A lovely alternative to a large university but still gives you the pleasant experience of a four year college. The faculty is the sublime and care more about their students than I have ever seen. The Honors Program is the best thing to ever happen to me. The best part: the price for the quality. Overall, a great education at and incredibly reasonable price!"
Senior,4,"MSSU is a great school with small class sizes. The teachers are always willing to help you get the best of your education. There is a great number of majors from which h to choose, especially for this smaller school."
Freshman,4,The professors here are great! There are lots of events and student activities to attend and the staff is really helpful!
Junior,4,small college compare to others i've been too but i love the ration of professors to students.  I have mix about the different departments. for instince the CIS program at MSSU was not the best but the Biology program was amazing. Overall I had a blast there.
Freshman,4,"Missouri Southern is just the right size, not too big or too small. It is easy to get involved and meet people especially if you live in the dorms. MSSU has a great atmosphere."
Freshman,4,Great school! The campus is small; making it easy for you to get to know a majority of students on campus.  The class sizes are also very small allowing you to have a great connection with your professors.
College Freshman,4,The trio program is amazing. And the teachers are great.
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience with MSSU is great. I enjoy the atmosphere and students and professors. I am glad I made the decision to go here and look forward to what the next three years hold.
College Senior,4,"it good at the apartment and quads, but the other apartment are low key okay"
College Freshman,4,Amazing programs and so many to choose from.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of international students that I hang out with and there are so many from different countries.
College Freshman,4,No pressure and no violations on campus.
College Freshman,4,I have never thought of changing schools or moving at all. This is the only school I wanted and I do not regret it.
Freshman,2,"My experience overall was decent . I love the college scene was great but waking up for class was hard and getting use to living on your own . As time went on i got adjusted to it . Learning what to do and what not to do . Meeting new people was the problem for me because i don't talk as much but i found friends and opened up . School is what you make it and i can really see that now, You can make it hard or easy. It's going to be bumps in the road but you can overcome them."
College Sophomore,2,"I never hear about Greek life on our campus. This could also be because I live off campus with my parents, though."
College Senior,2,This campus has no fraternity or sorority housing. We have the dorms or off campus living. I think that if we did have houses a lot more people would join the fraternity's and sorority's.
Recent Alumnus,2,not much outside of white
College Sophomore,2,The teams are really bad. Men's basket ball is the only decent sport.
College Senior,2,"I would have to say that Joplin is very boring. There really isn't much to do here. The only good thing is that you stay out of trouble with nothing to do. They have a lot of parks. It is very clean here. Although it is a small town, the people are very prejudice. That is one of the main problem African Americans face while being in Joplin. Here in Joplin there aren't many places to shop. They do have a little strip mall that have the basics but I shop a lot online. It is very quiet here. Students get discounts on just about everything."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a midwest mentality to the restaurants here, buffet and large portions are favored over health and variety."
Recent Alumnus,2,There are not many social or cultural venues in Joplin.
College Freshman,2,"Campus crime is high here in my opinion. My wallet was stolen right out of my car in front of a building. It had $130 in it. The ""campus police,"" if that's what you want to call them, basically shrugged their shoulders and told me my car was ""just around the bend,"" of the camera, making me feel like they did not check at all. My empty wallet was dumped beside the dorms and they would not check the cameras for it making up some silly excuse that they ""wouldn't be able to tell if it was the same wallet."" I can't help but wonder just how many people here purposely dumped a wallet in the exact same place on the exact same day? Apparently a lot. I guess I should just be glad that I was a victim of theft and not stabbed in the parking lot; I'm sure whoever it was would have gotten away with that too."
College Freshman,2,Everywhere in this town costs way too much money whether you want a house or apartment. Barely any allow pets and from what I hear none of them are very well taken care of yet are hard to get approved to live there. And that is why I live an hour away and am forced to drive back and forth- the dorms and off-housing apartments are simply too expensive and not worth it.
College Sophomore,2,There are little-to-no options available for dining that is outside of the typical american chain establishment. The small handful of restaurants to dine at that have a better selection (though still limited in nature) are not located conveniently near the campus. I usually just eat at home.
College Sophomore,2,I haven't experienced any nightlife as of yet. This could be in part because I am an older student and my focus is on other areas in my life.
College Sophomore,2,One Pizza Hut - another small something. It's godawful. Not sure about dorms though.
College Senior,2,"Unless you like Taco Bell and McDonald's every night, there is not a lot to choose from. There are some interesting places, but it's mostly fast food, and places like Olive Garden. The only two places that are off the chain is this BBQ joint and a gourmet hot dog joint."
College Sophomore,2,no transportation provided and parking is terrible
College Sophomore,2,I live over a hour away from campus so I don't spend my nights in Joplin.
College Freshman,2,Missouri weather is not great but it seems like MSSU is a huge wind tunnel. It is always so windy which doesn't help on days that there is cold weather.
College Freshman,2,"I personally do not like the ""Greek Life"" due to the experiences that I have had.  Other than my experiences, I love what they are doing for their charities and for some of the students."
College Freshman,2,"The cafeteria is quite possibly the worst food I've ever eaten. I haven't been there in probably a month even though i have a meal plan because i can't stand it. The lion's den is actually pretty good but you only have a few options there. It's reasonably priced in the $5-6 range but i know a lot of people don't have the extra money to eat there once their dining dollars (an amount you get along with your meal plan, it depends on how many meals you get. For the 10 meal plan you get $200, for the 15 meal plan you get $175 and with the 23 meal plan you get $150) run out"
College Senior,2,"our schools internet is horrible. It is slow, laggy, and hardly ever works. They also recently changed it to have this password every time you want to use it and they announced they were going to change it again. "
College Senior,2,Most of our town includes fast food or major chain restaurants. It is mostly steakhouses and Mexican food as well. So good luck finding anything different. If it is different it won't last long in this town. 
College Senior,2,This year luckily was pretty smooth compared to my other years having to receive my financial aid. Every year it seems as if they lose my paperwork or it gets put on hold for so long I'm almost kicked out of school. I know many of my friends have had the same experiences and it seems to get worse every year.
College Senior,2,The food options are very slim and only available at certain times. If you are staying late on campus to study then you better bring food or got grab some then come back because there won't be any available after 4 o'clock unless you live in the dorms.
College Junior,2,"Most of the schools parking is a great distance from the doors of all the buildings posing a hazard to harsh weather conditions.  Also, it is very difficult to find parking during the main class times of day."
College Junior,2,"The facilities are okay. The academics make a lot of student angry because there are required online software you have to purchase that can usually be up to $110. And having to go online to do homework is the reason why some students fail. Not all students have availability to computers. But the other facilities are average. It's actually quite boring to be honest, but one might argue with my opinion."
College Junior,2,"The best thing of the facilities is the student gun. But a required few of $350 a year goes onto your student account whether you want to use the gym or not. The library is okay, because its pretty big, but it's very old. There is a coffee shop downstairs the library. When it comes to green space, there's not a ton of it for students to visit on. There is a big patch in front of Reynolds hall but that's about it."
College Senior,2,"The weather has pros and cons, as I am sure anywhere does. You truly get all of the seasons here, which isn't something you get most places. It's windy all of the time."
College Senior,2,Drugs and alcohol are inevitable anywhere you go. Although there have been some issues that I have heard of about alcohol use our campus sticks to their intentions of being a dry campus and restricting alcohol and drug involvement on the premises.
College Sophomore,2,"The only transportation that is provided at MSSU is the transportation that you provide for yourself.  Your options are:  your car, your bike, your feet.  Occasionally, I have seen an injured person being taken from building to building on a little car/golf-cart.  Unless accommodations are made for you... you're on your own."
College Sophomore,2,"Nearly all professors are old. While that may be great because they know their stuff, the gap between that generation and the information/technology generation can be less than conducive to a great learning environment."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus is ugly. Parking is terrible, considering the majority of students are commuters. I have no desire to come to campus other than for my classes, and I leave as soon as they are done."
College Freshman,2,"Parking around campus is not the best, but it's not terribly bad. There is one huge parking lot a the front of the campus. The bad thing about this is that some classes are far back, and the walk can be really difficult. I would recommend people get to school early because parking will fill up quickly. There are alternative parking spots, but these can be very inconvenient also. The rule on parkking at this campus is if you live on campus you cant bring your car on the main campus until after 3pm which is a big deal, and the campus police are very strict about this rule."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not a big deal around campus. At the beginging of each year the Greek groups are really out there, but as the year goes on they fade away. Some of my friends joined and they love it, and have made new connections. On Missouri Southern's campus it is not a big deal if you join or not."
College Senior,2,Okay Night Life – The night life is okay mostly bars only a few clubs none of which are great.
College Junior,2,Not So Much – Im from a big city and joplin is small and barely have anything to do. And when you do go out you see the same people over and over.
College Junior,2,"I barely eat on campus since i moved off but when i was on campus, the food was greasy and repetitive."
College Freshman,2,They're just to old new to be torn down and rebuilt.
College Freshman,2,Good variety. But the food isn't the best quality.
College Junior,2,"Either one has his/her own car, someone else drives him/her around, or one can take the city's Sunshine Lamp Trolly or a taxi. The campus does not provide any kind of transportation for students."
College Junior,2,"Expensive Apartments – The apartments are very expensive if you looking for ones close to the campus. Especially if you want a nice apartment, you will pay atleast five hundred to six hundred."
Graduate Student,1,"financial aid office is very racist and the housing is the worst housing in Missouri you can find, very rude students, came from Illinois go back will never come back ever."
Freshman,1,"Worst university ever the Registrar department is the worst people to deal with very rude and non-corporative people are there, avoid urself any trouble and problem and go to any other university u find."
Junior,1,"The education I earned was bogus. I didnt learn anything, rather just received a piece of paper that said I graduated. Unnecessary fees and charges will hit you in every direction. The campus is dated, the teachers are unfriendly, and the ""college experience"" is not there. PARKING SUCKS!!!  "
College Freshman,1,"They don't offer all fraternities and sororities . Which makes people not want to join . The Greek life they do have is not active whatsoever . They may do something every blue moon , but other than that I don't hear about Greek life ."
Recent Alumnus,1,"it took 8 months to get 9 petitions signed for me to return to MSSU, after so long of a wait i had to cancell all my plans and reconsider,,,"
College Sophomore,1,The RAs are extremely bad. They don't assist in the right areas.
College Sophomore,1,Nothing to do but maybe once a month
College Senior,1,"It seems like almost every year I get screwed. Either they're missing something and don't tell me, or they lose something, and they don't tell me. My second year here, I didn't get my financial aid until about 3 days before school started. Only because I didn't know they needed anything else from me. There was no notice, and when I called it went straight to voice mail. E-mailing didn't work, I called no less than 15 times in one day and never got a hold of anyone. They're much easier to deal with in person though, the workers and financial aid people all seem to be pretty unhappy to be there."
College Senior,1,"In the main dorms, the rooms are smaller than a studio apartment. It wasn't until we bunked the beds that we even really had room to move around. That at somewhere in the vicinity of $2800 a semester. No control over the air conditioner, they won't even turn the air on unless it's 75 degrees for 7 days straight. And it has to be 7 days, or it all starts over again. The ""apartments"" are slightly better, housing 4 students with a little bit more control over the heating/cooling. They are a little more spacious as well. The furnishings in both are absolutely god-awful. The beds are lumpy and small, the desks were falling apart, and the couch and chairs in the apartments were uncomfortable as all get out. Definitely not worth the money when there are places in town that are cheaper and higher quality."
College Senior,1,"There is nothing remarkable about MOSO other than the fact that it's based in one of the worst college towns I've ever seen. This was a town that just so happened to end up with a college in it. The bars are kind of interesting, but many are 21 and up, so nothing for most college freshman. There's nothing fun to do unless you already know someone there."
College Senior,1,"The horror stories I could tell you. This is why my room mates and I always kept food on hand, so we wouldn't have to go to the cafeteria. Ever since I moved out of the dorms, I have been much happier as I no longer have to eat the cafeteria's dry and tasteless food. Although the sugar cookies and peanut butter cookies were pretty good."
College Sophomore,1,small town nothing to do
College Freshman,1,The winter sucks. It's so cold walking to class you just want to stay in bed.
College Senior,1,"I live in the dorms, and parking there is usually pretty crowded.  The parking is not equally distributed between the dorms, so you might end up parking quite a distance from your dorm.

Parking on campus is usually a nightmare.  The parking lots are always full, so you have to get there at least 30 minutes before class and you'll probably end up pretty far from your building.  If you end up parking at the football field, then you have to cross a street where people aren't usually paying attention and it can be quite dangerous even at the cross walk."
College Senior,1,"There are very few RAs who actually do their job.  I've had roommates who brought alcohol and marijuana into our room or had guests of the opposite gender over, but our RA did nothing until I went to campus security.  I've been threatened by two different roommates and been forced to move.  The second time I had to move at midnight during the second week of school.  Both of those individuals still live in the dorms and had no action taken against them.  Your best option is to get a single room, which costs the most amount of money."
College Senior,1,"I was told my school was completely paid for, but was contacted a week before my first semester and told I owed around $5,000.  I've been in the financial aid office at the start of every semester attempting to get my financial aid figured out, but my aid hasn't changed other than the normal increase in student loans.  When I first came here, the midwest exchange program that allowed me to pay instate tuition was a scholarship, so I lost the ability to apply for other scholarships from the school.  They've since changed it, but most of the scholarships are no longer applicable since I'm not an entering freshman.  It's a horrible experience."
College Junior,1,"The campus police go out every single day and check cars. If you're parked in the wrong spot, you'll get a ticket, every single time!"
College Senior,1,"I live in Blaine and the place really isn't very nice. The bathrooms are gross, the internet (wireless, no RJ-45 jacks) is awful, the rooms are medium size but need remodeled."
College Senior,1,"Campus is extremely strict in their policies. There are fines for a host of things from drugs, to alcohol, to cohabitation, we even have a fine for missing dorm meetings. All of their policies eventually lead to losing housing and sometimes expulsion, usually on the 3rd or 4th offense."
College Junior,1,Campus is mostly white and split into race. You keep to your kind and go to class.

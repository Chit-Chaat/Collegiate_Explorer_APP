Freshman,5,"My experience at eastern has been lovely. I have been able to have so much fun even with covid-19 restrictions. I have been able to make friends and even get a lot of work done as well. Due to covid-19, I have the room to myself which is lovely because I now don't have people to distract me in my room. I can get work done and that's a lovely thing. The only issue with me is I  haven't been able to find a job but that's not important right now. I have also been able to make good connections with faculty and that's always a good thing. All the staff here is friendly and always enjoy their jobs. I haven't met one that hasn't liked what they do in life. The student life here is excellent as well. A lot of the students here are dedicated t getting their goals done and isn't here just for fun . one big issue I have is the food is disgusting and I don't think I have ever enjoyed it. Everyone here has school pride which builds a good community. My experience has been a 10 out of 10 experience"
Freshman,5,My online experience has been lovely but I only had 1 online class which it isn't enough to go off on.
Sophomore,5,"This university provides a wide open canvas of opportunity to each and every student it contains each semester. With endless amounts of resources and positive instruction, the atmosphere at this school seems to possess an enlightening energy. As a student, I feel engaged and involved in conversation in my classes, and the campus is easily accessible throughout with facilities of all sorts to allow on campus students like myself to enjoy the stay."
Sophomore,5,"As the transition from in person to online classes was difficult for everyone, my teachers did a good job making themselves available if anyone needed extra help. They tried and succeeded to make it easy to understand and learn, just like they did on campus."
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID-19 we had to take online courses to finish the year, that being said Eastern did there absolute best to teach online. Whether it be posting powerpoint or lectures, or live zoom or Webex classes. I still learned what I needed to learn in an efficient manner, through online notes and tests and quizzes. Eastern made it easy and comprehensive."
Sophomore,5,"I am about to be a sophomore at Eastern, I had a good first year experience. Eastern is a very organized and professional college, since it is small there is more student and professor communication which is nice. Professors are kind and understanding and all adults are willing to help you which is beneficial. Eastern is a diverse community that is very supportive."
Freshman,5,"Love it! Especially campus. The dorms are huge and the buildings are wonderful. The food is normal food but very good for college food. There’s not a big party atmosphere which is good, but there are some if you’re looking for a night out. Eastern is definitely the place to be when choosing a home for the next 4 years!"
Freshman,5,"The support and resources that they offer are outstanding. From the women's center, to CAPS, MAC lab and more I have found that Eastern offers a lot of resources that I haven't seen at previous schools. My transition to Eastern was seamless and I am grateful for everyone I have met including the amazing staff on campus."
Freshman,5,During COVID 19 my professors were excellent with informing the students about the transition and how it would effect the classes.
Senior,5,"I loved the environment and the atmosphere. Everyone here wants to see you succeed and is more than willing to help. The campus environment is great, there are always events going on!"
Senior,5,"Lots of discussions weekly. I prefer when the professors record the lectures, it makes it easier for me to review material and go at my own pace."
Sophomore,5,"I love my school because the classes are academically challenging while the professors have been (for the most part) very accommodating. In addition, the campus is small so classes are easy to find and get to."
Niche User,5,"Enjoyed the campus and athletics. Although there is one café, there is other options around campus and it's small enough to be perfect for me."
Junior,5,"So far it’s been a good experience, I went here 11 years ago but had to withdraw for personal reasons, when I reapplies they were helpful and understanding"
Sophomore,5,"The professors are great! The math department especially is very concerned about student success and is incredibly invested in supporting students. The Honors Program is a really great program, the research opportunities that Eastern normally offers undergraduates are even more accessible for students in the Honors Program, and the thesis project completed by Honors students gives them a huge leg up when applying to graduate school or jobs after graduation."
Freshman,5,Overall I like Eastern. Connecticut State University. There are always activities. going on and there is always something to do.  Eastern to me feels. very safe and it feels like home.
Sophomore,5,It has been a wonderful experience learning and living on this campus. The professors and faculty are great and the events that they host are fun and entertaining for students as well as faculty. The learning facility are complex and simple to utilize.
Niche User,5,"My daughter is a freshman class of 2023!!! I give 5 stars because this college was one of her first choices, has the major she wants to pursue and she feels comfortable on the campus. Hopefully by the time she graduates it will still be 5 stars."
Senior,5,"If you put in the effort, you will succeed. If you don't put in the effort, you won't. This goes for any college... Eastern has EXCELLENT resources for a public university. The tuition is affordable, it is a beautiful campus, students are friendly, parties are fun, and the professors/staff is great. Not to mention that on campus living is fantastic... You get your own room by your sophomore year, and you're paying much less than some place like UConn, where the class sizes are bigger, you don't get your own room, and it is NOT a hands on learning experience. I am from out of state, did not know 1 single person here, and coming to Eastern was the best idea I have ever made!"
Sophomore,5,"My daughter chose Eastern because it was close to home, she was comfortable with the campus and she was able to play volleyball for the college.  She is starting her second year and is looking forward to more course specific classes."
Sophomore,5,"I liked how beautiful the campus looked it allowed me to feel safe and feel at home. The environment felt good everyone seemed active,busy, and with a plan/mission. Also, I liked the fact that Eastern’s classes are small which means you’ll receive extra help. One thing I hope they change in the following years, that there should be programs and professional help on how to pay off school without getting in debt."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern CT State University is truly on the up-and-up; so much is changing and moving in a positive direction! The completion of construction on three academic buildings and the complete rebuild of an upperclassman dorm is beautifying the campus as well as offering incredible, state of the art learning environments for students!"
Sophomore,5,"While being in eastern for about a year, the experience has been amazing. The staff, faculty, and professors have provided so much for students and this is something not a-lot of colleges focus on.  The work given has been fair and there are many activities to help you academically. I have been my best overall and it is because of the schools way of acknowledging student performance and studies."
Freshman,5,"Eastern Connecticut State University is a small campus with small class sizes. Eastern has nice dorms,  traditional dorms do get very hot though. When it comes to food it is not bad, they could be better though with the options. When it comes to partying, you just need to know someone because the parties are opened to every. I've had some not so great professors, maybe 3 good ones, but my friends love their professors."
Alum,5,I had a great experience at Eastern. I lived in the dorms freshman year and met so many great people. I participated in many activities and really enjoyed my classes. I was a Psych major and the Psychology department was great the professors were so helpful and nice!
Freshman,5,"It's a quiet campus if that's what you're looking for and good tutoring. Diversity wise, you most likely won't see someone that looks like you if you are a minority that often. The clubs they have are really cool and student run if you want to get involved."
Junior,5,The professor we're amazing. They respected their students. It was less of lectures and more of communication between peers and professor
Alum,5,This school has a highly acclaimed education program. I was astounded by the wonderful professors that I took courses with! They made the classes very engaging and fun to learn.
Junior,5,ECSU is a great school if you are looking to attend a small university where professors and advisors are able to give you more attention. The opportunities are endless !
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful and very eco-friendly. The students here are very friendly and welcoming to every new and incoming student. The professors are very nice and smart, as well as accomadating to any question or concern student may have. I'm so happy I chose Eastern and wouldn't want to experience college anywhere else!"
Senior,5,"As a current student of ECSU, I love the atmosphere and the people. The campus itself isn't large, and it gives students the feeling that they're really interacting and being noticed by everyone. It feels like home to me, and that's why I love going back every year."
Sophomore,5,"I am delighted with the prospect of continuing my education at Eastern Connecticut State University in the fall of 2018. I met with Dr. Belles, the head of the music department and left after my interview with a very positive experience. Dr. Hwang, the head of the piano department, made me feel warmly welcomed and expressed her delight of teaching me in the fall. Additionally,  the university has a brand new fine arts building as well as campus grounds that look immaculate.   This university has obviously received much federal funding to for construction and repairs and now looks like a new campus.                                                      
       As for improvements, I would like this educational institution to offer a bachelor of music degree as well as a music education degree.  Its staff is definitely equal to the tasks."
Sophomore,5,My experience so far has been good. The staff is helpful in guiding me toward where I need to be. The big campus is overwhelming compared to my other school but I have gotten a lot of help finding my way around. I would recommend Eastern to anyone because I believe it will be a great teaching school for me to finish my degree. I participated in orientation and I believe it was a helpful experience and I will be using all my knowledge throughout my years at Eastern. I got the opportunity to meet different students and get their outlook on Eastern from being there. It was a good opportunity for upcoming students and I can't wait to continue my journey.
Alum,5,The community at Eastern is unlike that of any other school around here. There's a lot of people who have your back and are willing to help make sure you're successful.
Sophomore,5,"Love to stay on campus, always fun events going on! I have great relationships with most of my professors and the classes are super interesting. Eastern is my home away from home."
Sophomore,5,"Eastern Connecticut State University has a comfortably sized campus, not too big not too small. As an art student, I was especially happy with their new Fine Arts building which includes plenty of natural lighting and modern architectural designs."
Senior,5,Eastern is a great university! Small class sizes allow for the students to form one on one relationships with their professors!
Freshman,5,"My experience with Eastern Connecticut State University Community has been a very welcoming and helpful.  The school is a very open diverse community, with lots of activities and clubs to participate in. Faculty members here actually do care about your success. They want to see you succeed, they help you stay on task and meet deadlines as well."
Freshman,5,I love eastern! I am a freshman here and I have had the best experience with everything from housing to professors.
Sophomore,5,"Great campus and amazing staff. The students and staff here are excellent and very accepting of all races, genders, sexualities, and walks of life."
Freshman,5,The group off financial iad it’s really good and help to with anything.  Give you options and making the students comfortable.
Freshman,5,"The lay out of the campus and updates made to the facilities, dorms allow easy access to classes, food hall and bookstore. Selecting classes was extremely easy, the classes, professors are engaging and allow a real positive atmosphere for learning. I am fortunate enough to live in a suite, which provides much more room and the ability to mingle with many other students throughout that dorm. There are a variety of sports, club sports and clubs to join. There are grocery stores, dining and retail stores relatively close. I enjoyed my first semester and look forward to the upcoming semesters."
Alum,5,Eastern provided me with many opportunities to serve the community and gain practical leadership experience in diverse setting.
Sophomore,5,I wish that there was better parking for commuters. But it is nice that they offer commuter events where we are able to network with one another.
Works Here,5,"Eastern is a very beautiful campus. It has many majors that are available to students. Many of the professors are amazing, they want to make sure that you pass and enjoy college."
Niche User,5,"I started going to Eastern almost 10 years ago, but then dropped out. I have recently started the process of going back to school to finish my degree. Everyone has been helpful and supportive of my decision to go back to school. They even made an exception to accept me back- my gpa was very low, but I met with someone who said I seemed to really be motivated this time around. They accepted me on the basis that I receive B grades or better in the first classes I registered for, which I did. Eastern has a decent amount of classes that can fit around a working schedule, and also some online classes. It would be nice if they offered more online classes- I would like to do as much online as I can."
Sophomore,5,"As a student, especially as an out-of-stater, I can truly say my experience at Eastern has been nothing but pleasant. In just my first year, I have had the privilege of being a tour guide for the Admissions office, I have also been a student orientation counselor during this summer and I will become a writing tutor this upcoming fall as well as a student worker for the president of the university. Overall this is a great university with a ton of opportunities and if there's one that a student finds missing, there is always room to create it."
Junior,5,I am about to be a senior at Eastern and I absolutely love it!! My professors have been really helpful and given me opportunities to do research with them. I'm involved in some other clubs and intramurals too and that's how I've met all my roommates!
Sophomore,5,I love this school. One of the best decisions of my life that I have made was to go to this school. I have made friends that I believe the friendships will last a lifetime while receiving a good education. There are many social events available for students to go to and most are fun including pancake night every week.
Freshman,5,ECSU is a school that is not only one of the best liberal art schools in the northeastern part of the U.S but it is also a school that gives you a chance to get your education. I have been here for a year and I also did a program called STEP/CAP. Since I had an amazing summer experience I'm not only very comfortable to be here but I have obtained many resource/network skills from attending this school.
Senior,5,"Eastern is dedicated to making you succeed. They truly invest in the students who attend. If you have questions please feel free to ask because the professor truly understand why they are there ""the success of the student""."
Freshman,5,I love eastern best choice I ever made! It has great campus life. The classes are the perfect size and I love the small town feel. The food is decent and I truly enjoy all the clubs and activities.
Freshman,5,I love the school that I am attending my freshman fall semester of the year of 2016. The liberal art curriculum is helping me to become the well rounded teacher I want to be. The classes that range from sociology to chemistry are interesting and the professors are always around and helpful.
Senior,5,"I feel that Eastern Connecticut State University staff is always available to help students in the economics department.  Everyone I have worked with in the ECO department is always willing to assist me with any trouble I am having. On the other hand, it seems very hard to get ahold of staff members in the business department and they do not seem very welcoming when I do talk to them."
College Senior,5,It is a very safe campus
College Senior,5,Eastern Ct is a great liberal arts school . It has amazing professors and a wide range of cousre selections
Recent Alumnus,5,"I am not a party person, but I know that there are parties popping up everywhere. I mean, it is college."
Recent Alumnus,5,People are just dancing and twerking around with red cups.
Recent Alumnus,5,The teachers are very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,5,It is very diverse here.
Junior,4,Overall I love the school. I’m happy I chose to go here. The involvement on campus spectacular the people that you meet are great the relationships you make are interesting and useful. The dorms get better as you become an upperclassman and there’s a variety of places to live off campus. We are not too far from UConn so we also have great access to the campus as well. The campus is very close knit. I would love to see them add more on campus parking for the upperclassman. I would love for there to be more budgeting for clubs of people of color. I would love for there to be more internships on campus.
Sophomore,4,"My Freshman year at Eastern was great. As a black woman going to a predominantly white university, I was nervous and felt alone in the beginning, but everyone I met was so nice. Eventually I was able to find some friends, and most of them were on my track team. The education and the professor are great, they make it easy to learn and they'll help you any way they can so you could succeed.  There also a lot of clubs and events that school hosts, I went to most of the school themed events and I'm apart of three clubs."
Alum,4,I loved my experience at ECSU. I met so many incredible people and teachers. My music theory experience was pretty bad due to the teacher but other than that the music program is wonderful. I did feel that the psychology program was a bit close minded when it came to creating a research project involving music but that is why I changed my major to only music.
Alum,4,"I truly enjoyed my time at Eastern Connecticut State University. I majored in Sociology and that department was phenomenal. The professors have become the best resources for me even after graduation. I enjoyed the campus life and the dorms were really nice. I lived in the Suite style dorms all four years, and it was a little difficult adjusting to living with that many people. I always wished there was more diversity on campus. I would recommend this university to prospective students."
Sophomore,4,"Eastern was my last choice school, but I'm so glad i chose it. It was the best option for me. Eastern is a no BS university for a great price. The best thing about it is the value."
Sophomore,4,I believe the class content is great. I like the majority of my classes when I am there.  The campus overall is small so it is easy to get around.
Junior,4,Eastern is great if you are looking for a small campus. Not much to do on the weekends but it is easy to make friends in classes.
Junior,4,"The professors and classes are great, and the campus is beautiful. Student involvement could be better, but overall a great school where I have learned a lot."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the amount of effort put into making the school a community that shares and engages in different cultures as well as the profound high expectation in education.
Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of ways to get involved on campus, including networking opportunities, sports, clubs, campus events, and more. The professors are also incredibly supportive, and I'm sure any student could find a professor they'd love to work with."
Sophomore,4,"I am confident I made the right choice in choosing to attend this university. I had a positive experience living on campus in a small traditional dorm, and I had amazing resident assistants (who are other students) supporting me throughout the year. I like the small classroom sizes with professors that learn your name and are passionate about their field. The faculty has a friendly demeanor and take the time to help you solve any issues. Early in the fall semester there is a club fair that showcases the many opportunities students have to get involved with campus and cover a variety of interests.
The surrounding area is decent but there is not much to do other than eat out. The campus holds activities on weekends but they are small and it is more just to meet up with friends. The activities held during the school week are pretty fun and I recommend going to them if you have the time."
Junior,4,"love the small campus, which leads to a smaller class size  which leads to professors knowing your name and wanting you to succeed."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman in the Honors College, as well as, a member of the Division III Track and Field team at Eastern Connecticut State University. I enjoy the small class sizes as it helps me to connect with my professors and peers."
Freshman,4,"The teachers are pretty great and supportive, although you can tell some would rather be elsewhere, I have made great connections with many of the teachers I have had so far.  Courses are challenging, but simple, although I can't speak for most of the classes since I am still in my first year.  I have been given enough work but not more than I can handle.  The students here are amazing, you have people from all over the state, country and even globe.  There is a place for everyone to fit in, which all the clubs offered have helped me meet many friends.  Dorms are decent, the RAs are very nice and polite, but I have had my fair share of randomly selected roommates, I wouldn't ever do the random selection again as I have had to switch once and may need to switch again in the last two months of the semester, but that is my only real complant!"
Sophomore,4,"Good academics, professors know what they're talking about. Good parties if you know where to go, it's also so close to UCONN. Surrounding area doesn't have much to do but Eastern is good with allowing your car on campus."
Freshman,4,Eastern Connecticut State University is a great school. I love the social life and it is a very diverse school. I have had great experiences in the school. The school is different and the people are so sweet. The teachers are great all around and so are the students. It is a great school that everyone should attend.
Junior,4,"I would recommend this university. The application process was simple. The professors are kind, professional and will work with you. The students are kind. The campus is clean and something is always going on to help better then students."
Freshman,4,"I toured Eastern this past summer and thought the campus was great! I loved the dorm set up and different options. The learning center and library have great resources to check out. It is a smaller school so you have to be ok with not having the huge student life options of a big university, but Uconn is right down the road. I didnt try the food, but we walked through the cafe and everything was tidy and clean, plenty of options at each meal. The campus was the perfect size to be able to get to class in time. The campus is also beautiful, filled with nice landscaping and picturest CT country. I am excited to start my educational journey with Eastern CT State University."
Junior,4,Eastern is not too and there are events fairly often. When there aren't events it can be pretty boring but the Ra's try to make up for it. Overall though I would totally recommend it to people looking for a smaller place to go rather than something overwhelming like UCONN.
Junior,4,"I am an international student at Eastern, I transferred from Three Rivers Community College to ECSU to finish and get my bachelor degree in Business Management and Administration. ECSU does a great job welcoming international student, showing the campus around, teaching us everything from safety to academics topics. Life at ECSU is enjoyable, professor do an excellent job at teaching, although I do find older professors better at teaching the subject than younger ones. Campus is fairly big, and it does offer everything a student needs, starting from the sports centre, to the houses/dorms. Food is good as well and affordable!
One negative aspects about this college it the amount of money an international student has to pay, which is not even close to what a U.S. citizen pays. However, overall Eastern Connecticut State University is a great college and I would recommend it to other students."
Sophomore,4,I love my classes at Eastern! Sometimes it was hard to find parking at the library and the commuter lot was far away from where my classes where held.  I'm an Art Major and I wished the studios would be open longer for student use.
Freshman,4,I love how beautiful the campus is.  I would like to see better dining options and food choices. I love how many new buildings there are. Massachusetts and Rhode Island residents are eligible for regional rates which makes an education at Eastern Connecticut State University very affordable.
Freshman,4,"Eastern Connecticut State University is a very good school and I would rank it among the top 10 schools in Connecticut.This school is well sound in academics, sports, campus life and all other college activities. It is a very affordable and offers very good scholarships to students in order to meet their needs. I really like everything about this school and I highly recommend it to all individuals who wish to further their education and are in their college search process. You will really love it."
Junior,4,I currently play on the Men's soccer team at Eastern and consider that a great experience.  My housing for this year is off campus and is a short walk from classes.
Freshman,4,"My overall experience at ECSU has been good. I enjoy the classes and even though my dorm is one of the furthest on the campus, it is a smaller hall and I its been easier to get to know the other students living there."
Sophomore,4,"Eastern has a beautiful campus with great opportunity for all students. The freshmen dorms are the best in the state.  The only negative to the school is you don't really want to go off campus, not the best area and not alot to do."
Freshman,4,"This school seems to actually care about its students. The facilities are great and the services available are fantastic. This is a place where I feel supported and able to succeed. The class size is perfect so I can learn and make a connection with professors. There is always something to do, from the abundance of student organizations to the large number of campus events. People here are friendly, it's like a community so it's easy for this place to become a second home. Eastern is small so that you feel at home, but still big enough to get the college experience and expand your view of the world."
Freshman,4,"As a commuter student at Eastern, my experience has been a little different than those who live on campus, but I enjoy my time on campus. The professors are wonderful and I feel welcome."
Senior,4,"I have attended Eastern CT for my junior and senior years.  When I left the university in 2006, I was one credit away from my BS in Accounting.  When I came back, I was unaware of the new program (LAC) and I ended up having to take 3 classes to graduate.  When you pay that money out of your own pocket and you were only expecting to take 1 class, it hurts!  Be sure to check the requirements for coming back to the university to make sure you understand what you are looking at for classes and graduation requirements."
Sophomore,4,I really love this school. I get individual help from professors and the ability to get to know them. Because of this I have been asked to conduct research with some of them! I feel I’m in a challenging program that pushes me to be the best I can be.
Alum,4,"I transferred into ECSU taking more than average amount of credits and finished in 3 semesters. Got my bachelors of science in Business Information Systems. The career fairs are very great and Eastern is known around Connecticut so if you do well, you will most likely get an interview at any company in CT. I got many interviews after graduation at big companies and ended up doing contract positions in New York. I am now back in CT with a full time.

I've studied at UCONN also and it felt like courses at ECSU were easier to get an A in. This doesn't mean you learn less, more so that the professors are more forgiving. They will teach you if you want to learn and the resources are there too. The best part is the class size is exponentially smaller so you get more 1 on 1 time with professors and classes feels like a big group instead of many strangers."
Freshman,4,My experience being a first year student at Eastern has been great. There is always something to do which was soothing for me because I was homesick the first few weeks here. There is a writing center and math lab that help if you are struggling in your courses. I believe everyone here wants to see you succeed.
Freshman,4,Eastern is a decently sized school that makes you feel like you're home. They always have activities to do to stay busy and plenty of clubs. The classroom sizes are small and the one on one interaction with the teacher makes you feel like you can achieve anything.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the classes and professors. However, the food is very rough. The Professors are all generally nice. They are understanding of a college students busy schedule and they give you all the supplies you need to succeed. This includes study guides, detailed notes, and extra help. The food is the only negative about this college. There is only one dining hall and the food is constantly cold and under seasoned. There is a student café in the student center but you must pay to eat there, so it gets very expensive."
Junior,4,"Eastern is a very diverse school and an easy campus to navigate. Professors are very personable, easy to approach and very committed to helping you succeed. As well, as there are a number of different ways to get involved on campus whether it's joining a sports team or choosing from a variety of clubs. If Eastern doesn't provide a certain club you're allowed to start your own as well. It is very easy to meet new people at this university."
Junior,4,It is great place to go. constituently updating facilities and always working with students to improve the campus and make it work for all that are involved.
Sophomore,4,"I like the enviorment, it feels safe calm welcoming like coming home. It is very diverse and it is embraced all around campus through different activities clubs organizations and events."
Junior,4,"ECSU is a great school and the teachers are willing to help you as long as you want to put the work in. They do a great job doing being involved in the community. I would like to see another dining hall or perhaps another dining area. Also, there are not many places to study that have good lighting besides the library. My favorite class was psychology because the teacher was engaging and I did very well because I put the work in. I also would improve the dorms conditions because it does get very hot without having air condition."
Freshman,4,Eastern was in fact a great institution for me to experience my freshman year at! The dorms were always kept clean and the staff were incredible! The student life was exceptional and offered lots of club and activities! There was a lot of school spirit/pride and among the students and professors and that was something sweet to be part of.
Sophomore,4,"For what Eastern Connecticut lacks in size and grandiosity, it makes up for in its close knit community, passionate professors, and culture."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I really enjoyed being part of the ECSU community.  The academics are rigorous without being unmanageable.  I love the campus because it is on the smaller side and after a while you would see familiar faces from your classes or dorms, etc.  I have joined the women's lacrosse team and found that the camaraderie is wonderful and it helped me to meet new people.  The new dorms are beautiful!  I was very happy with my suite set up, had a beautiful view of the campus and really liked all of the new buildings and upgraded technology as well as the state of the art amenities that were offered to students!  Overall rating A"
Freshman,4,Eastern is a welcoming community that accepts everyone no matter who or where you are from. The professors know who you are and want to help you succeed here.
Senior,4,"This university has offered me access to such incredible knowledge and resources. I grew up in a small town and chose a small college to attend as well, but my confidence in my field has grown exponentially and I owe it all to this small campus. My professors guide and educate with passion and encourage growth in each and every student in our program. I am currently a senior in the Social Work program, one of 50 that were selected from a pool of 150 candidates, and having a community of future and current practitioners to learn from and collaborate with has been a remarkable experience and has helped me grow so much. Thank you for an incredible experience Eastern!"
Freshman,4,"I have finished my first semester here. There are many required first year classes that are not related to your major, but some of them are interesting and help you adjust to the school. I have had some professors who have been amazing, but others who have a lot they could do to become better teachers. There is not very much to do in the surrounding area without a car or are willing to walk."
Sophomore,4,Eastern Connecticut State University is overall a great school. They host a lot of events on campus so there is always something to do! The campus is the perfect size.
Freshman,4,"Small class sizes, maximum of 40 students, makes learning really personal. Professors are willing to help if you ask. You have the opportunity to meet many people through classes, clubs and other activities. Relatively small campus, you can walk everywhere you need."
Sophomore,4,Living on campus at Eastern so far has been an amazing experience that I don't want to end. I love how close my friends are and my roommates. I also enjoy the activities held around campus and living here makes it a lot easier to attend them. So far the only thing I have to complain about Eastern is the food at Hurley. It cost as much a five star restaurant would but is the quality of a fast food restaurant. I think the quality and variety of the school should be better considering for those who live on campus without a kitchen it is the only place to eat without having to pay for each meal individually.
Sophomore,4,"I like how involved the school is, the professors, and the students. I do not like how the school gives you a run around when you are looking for help or information."
College Sophomore,4,There are many job opportunities.  I have gotten two jobs on campus. I think the students here are here because their parents told them they had to go. Most of the kids here are here to make friends and to party.
College Senior,4,It was rather easy to apply to Eastern State
College Senior,4,I have no information on clubs or spots due to the fact I work during the day
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's a good school, not too big but not too small"
Recent Alumnus,4,I love my school because it has a continuing education program for people who have families and work full time. The night classes are close to my home and are convenient. Without them i don't know how i would of finished on time.
College Sophomore,4,The professors and classes are pretty good and easy to understand and the professors do a really good job at telling students their office hours.
College Sophomore,4,I feel as though the housing that I had for my freshman year was really good and allowed the people in the hall to really get know each other because of the common rooms and space that was in the hall.
College Sophomore,4,"My favorite experiences at my school has been meeting new people, and also the kind of classes that are available there."
College Sophomore,4,"I have heard great career prospects from graduating at this school, some of them coming from the sports management and communications part. I am going for communications to get into sports broadcasting or sports journalism. The career services website and the service itself on campus is pretty helpful when it comes down to helping the students on the campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic facilities at the university are pretty good. The weight room is excellent and everyone is welcome to come in and use the weight room. Our schools varsity teams have performed really well in the last couple of years, contending for conference championships annually. The intramurals there are fun and really competitive to play in. There is some school spirit, but it depends on who you are around during the school day and year."
College Senior,4,I have had a wonderful experience at Eastern. I have made a lot of friends that I will be with for my whole life. I have grown tremendously as an individual since I have come here. The small classes have really helped me excel in my academics allowing me to get the best grades of my academic career. I wish there was a better program regarding my major as i find it difficult and frustrating during registration to find classes of interest with professors i can 1. understand and 2. deal with in class.
College Senior,4,"I have had very positive experiences with all of my on-campus living arrangements. The only dorm i had a problem with was Low rise. I think we are charged way to much money for the amenities we are provided. Other than that the dorms, even for freshman, are awesome."
Graduate Student,2,"Attended two years after transferring from a community college and this school is a terrible choice if you have a life outside of school. 

I don't mean a social life, I mean if you have any professional, family, or medical obligations. The office hours for financial and academic departments are very limited (8am-4pm, M-F).

The online classes defeat their own purpose by requiring you to sit in during webcam meetings when the point of an online class is so you can make it work around your schedule.

Some, not all, just some professors show an extreme disconnect from what they think they're teaching and what the class is learning/tested on. They often teach multiple core classes too, so you'll be struggling multiple times throughout your time here.

I'd avoid this school at all costs and recommend that anybody considering this school to reconsider if they have kids, work, etc. This school does not accommodate for a busy person's life at all."
Freshman,2,There is not much to do on campus or in the surrounding area. The events are usually very small and there is only one dining hall that serves average food. The students are very quiet and most go home on weekends. The classes and professors are good though. The campus is small so it does not take long to get to class. The dorms are of average quality with some being much nicer than others.
Freshman,2,The problem with this school is EVERYONE goes home on the weekends. The campus is absolutely dead and it's very hard when you are out of state and are stuck on an empty campus. Some nice people but unfortunately lots of people know each other from high school making it hard to get to know others. The school does offer fun events during the week and it's a nice campus. Would only recommend if you're from this area.
Freshman,2,"I hate this school so much. The school is literally in the middle of NO WHERE. The only thing that's ""close"" is UCONN Storrs campus. The shuttles that the school provides to Walmart and the East Brooke Mall is WAY too small. Often times students will stand or sit on the floor.  AND OH MY LORD DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE PROFESSORS. I ended up dropping my general chemistry class because the professor could NOT speak english. I understand that many professors have accents but this chemistry professor couldn't even understand US. How do you expect for student to learn from a professor that can't even answer students questions? What makes me even more furious is that the advisors wouldn't let me switch to a different professor. It's a shame that my money has been wasted on professors that do not understand their own students. If you're a planning on being a health major I STRONGLY recommend that you look at other University's before attending this school."
College Sophomore,2,"I had a friend who was sexually assaulted. She and a few of her friends talked to the police, as well as other girls who had an issue with this boy. Nothing happened to him. It is very frustrating when nothing happens to these horrible people who sexually harass people."
College Sophomore,2,"Our university doesn't have Greek life, mainly because of the partying and drug use leading to the arrests of some students in the last several years coming back from off campus parties."
College Freshman,2,We do not have any sororities or fraternities on our campus.
College Freshman,2,No one really knows when events are.  There is not a sense of school spirit and support.
College Freshman,2,"Mostly off campus, campus is pretty dead almost every weekend."
College Junior,2,"Overall, I do not really enjoy my school. I've made good friends and I have learned many things while attending however, If i was able to do it all over again, I don't think i would chose the school Im at now, only because in my experience, when i needed help with guidance regarding my major and choice of classes when I would meet with my advisors or other professors I felt as if they were just telling me anything to get me out of their hair. I don't really feel like I was being helped the way I should have been and now I'm faced the challenge of having to take winter and summer sessions because I was misguided into taking the wrong courses each semester. Aside from that problem, I would choose a different school because the field that I am interested in pursuing has a more helpful system at other colleges. I hope to be in the medical field and I know friends that are at undergraduate schools learning the field they want to work in. As with I, I have been taking unnecessary courses that will not benefit me when i get my degree and move further on with my education."
College Sophomore,2,"The weekends are completely dead for the most part, so parties are usually on Thursdays. You can't get in unless you know someone there or bring a ton of girls. I never got into any parties, and they always get busted"
College Senior,2,Sometimes it is really hard to get scholarships because it was at first only merit based. Now they have changed it to also include financial need.
College Sophomore,2,"There's some fun things to do like go to the record shop and those types of things. The locals hate us due to people who party. They live in a college town, but people also need to learn how to be respectful."
College Freshman,2,The area the school is located in has high crime rate and many issues that  I could never see myself living there after I graduate.
College Sophomore,2,Eastern is pretty strict. You have to learn how to work around the system.
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene is hard to come by. Eastern is a dry campus so you are forced to walk the dangerous streets to get to a house party that will eventually be broken up. Eastern is now starting to punish kids who are caught at house parties even though you are not on campus. Eastern has overstepped their authority,"
College Freshman,2,"Campus police have strict policies on partying both on and off campus so the ""party scene"" is very small."
College Freshman,2,A lot of stores near by but would recumbent to drive
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly I hated living on campus my freshman year, I had the oldest hall on campus, it was hot and my RA's and hall director weren't very friendly. I was like I was constantly being judge and administration is called over any little thing. It's almost like they don't want you to have any fun. Eastern PD has now linked with Willimantic PD so campus rules apply to off campus housing and anywhere in the town. They don't know what they are doing."
College Freshman,2,I still have no idea where the financial aid is. I might not even be able to afford the school.
College Freshman,2,I really wouldn't go there.. I lived in burr so i didn't go much and it was still too much.
Recent Alumnus,2,Most drivers hated their job. And complained 99% of the time.
College Sophomore,2,"There are no attractions other than the theater, which no one goes to and the bars. It is popular among college students but there is not much to do off of campus."
College Sophomore,2,Its like any school. It isn't a dry campus like advertised. Just make sure you mature and know what you're doing before making decisions.
College Sophomore,2,Eastern is a majority a white school there is very little to no diversity on our campus.
College Freshman,2,I hear people talking about doing drugs
College Freshman,2,Public transportion in willi is limited. This is because its not a major city. There are some buses but they don't really go to far out of the windham region. If your really wanted to get anywhere you need a car.
College Freshman,2,To get around a car is the easiest transportation but freshmen aren't allowed cars on campus.
College Sophomore,2,Willimantic is not a great area to live off campus.
College Freshman,2,The computers at school are alright. In order to do homework a laptop is needed. Network can be slow and online resources constantly are crashing. Wifi isn't accessible in the room in any of the dorms on campus that I have seen. I use my own printer because it is easier for my to send my homework to my printer from my laptop instead of the printer in the lobby.
College Freshman,2,"It is not a great town to live in because it is known for a lot of drugs and when students go out at night they see weird people walking the streets who look like they have drugs on them. These people are also out in the day, walking around with carts and digging through garbage. It is not a good atmosphere."
College Freshman,2,"Willimantic does not seem very nice nor is it appealing. I would not venture off campus, especially alone in this area."
College Junior,2,I have a low tolerance for the cold and there definitely is a lot more cold days than warm on campus
College Junior,2,The Greek life on campus is very low key and unpopular as far as I know. There are Greek parties that get thrown on or near campus but there not regular occurrences.
College Freshman,2,"I live in a ""traditional"" dorm, my room is TINY, I have had numerous spider bites, and the bathroom is always dirty."
College Junior,2,Other than the shuttle students need to have their own car to get around outside of campus. 
College Junior,2,"The department I go to school for, does a poor job of scheduling classes that are easy to attend. Often classes I need to take are held at the same time or at complete oposite times of the day."
College Freshman,2,It's new england weather is unpredictable and crazy but most students are from new england and are used to it.  
College Freshman,2,Computer labs are always avalible but only some of the labs are efficient.  The library computers are good and the academic building computers are pretty good too.  The computer labs in the residence halls suck and literally none of them work.  Bring a laptop with an ethernet cable because in your residence halls theres no wifi.  Your laptop will be the most efficient computer source you have.
College Freshman,2,"Alot of upperclassmen choose to live off-campus and this could be fun because they don't have to abide by the strict policies of eastern but living in the streets outside of campus isn't always safe.  Also the houses are really beat down old victorian houses.  As an upperclassmen it's still worth it to alot of people, when i'm an upperclassmen I plan on living off campus just cause eastern's housing is so strict."
College Freshman,2,You need to get your car approved to park at eastern.  If your a freshmen then you can't park inless you have a really good reason.  For the kids who park and live on campus you essentially just leave your car in the garage until you need it.  Commuters have alot more trouble finding parking but its not impossible.  Commuters also need to get a parking pass and park in the garages too.
College Freshman,2,I'm doing well with academics and my major.  I am not doing much with it yet but it is not a problem. 
College Freshman,2,People do drugs but you can definitely have fun without drugs. 
College Freshman,2,Many people complain about hurley but I enjoy it.  I make the best of it
College Junior,2,With all the construction going on there is not much visitor parking and the 2 parking garages are on the same side of the university and is about .75 of a mile away from the furthest building. The Campus Police love to give tickets and in the morning the first parking garage is full by 9.
College Junior,2,There are plenty of restaurants in the area but some of them require a car to get to. Main street has plenty of diners and cafes to relax in with decent prices. If you want a real sit down dinner the closest one is just over a mile away.
College Junior,2,there are only privately owned apartments off campus
College Senior,2,"There are known problems in each dorm, mostly involving drugs and drinking, but outside of the general threats to call campus police, nothing is really done. There's also a pub directly down the street from campus, where students are known to go, but the college turns a blind eye so long as everyone is of age, even though its a supposed dry campus. Personally, I've known people that have come in extremely drunk/high (Once a brawl broke out that caused a few people to be put in the hospital, damage to the building, and a lengthy police report) and if they were caught were given a one-strike warning if the police or emergency services had to be called. After that, you face losing housing and expulsion from school. Most of the drinking is done secretly off campus though, so this is rarely used."
College Senior,2,"As a transfer student, I was sent my first semester to stay in a suite farthest off campus at the bottom of the hill. It was a long walk every day to class, but there was a shuttle available at times. The building was also an old school, and often had fire alarm issues, leakages, and twice our plumbing backed up.  not all the dorms are like this though. While the residence halls surrounding the dining hall are older, there are newer halls further down campus (closer to the class rooms on the green), but these are more expensive, however they don't require you to have a meal plan unlike the dorms surrounding the dining hall. Overall, the freshman have it worse; they mostly are assigned to Mead in doubles, occasionally triples, and besides the strict freshman rules, its also one of the oldest halls. After freshman year though, its much easier as you can opt for a more spacious apartment on your own or with friends, so long as you have enough priority points and decent grades."
College Freshman,2,"In comparison to most cities, Willimantic is lacking. It's a smaller city with boutiques to browse through and a great deal of restaurants to try. However, it becomes tedious after awhile. It lacks charm and variety, and even the mall is incredibly limited and does not offer much."
College Freshman,2,"One bar, no frats, sports houses will have a party every two weeks"
College Junior,2,It is very difficult to get into the education program. A lot of preparation goes into it.
College Sophomore,2,Guys are jerks unless you know them. Girls are stuckup
College Sophomore,2,The workers in the aid office do not seem to care about your situation until they realize they aren't going to get their money if they don't help you.
College Sophomore,2,"There are lots of drugs in college, deal with it. At least there aren't a ton of hard drugs anymore."
College Sophomore,2,"If you don't act sloppy and you don't live in freshman housing, you won't get in trouble."
College Sophomore,2,"Rough, Rough, Rough – Coming from a middle class household I expected to receive much more financial aid than was given to me.  Applying as an out-of-state student also means that I have to pay more to attend here.  It was easy to fill out the applications, but confusing to understand the amount that was received.  Even though it is the state and not the school responsible for this disappointment, there should be a better way to figure out how much financial aid a person would receive. I know I will be in debt for many years after I graduate."
College Junior,2,I Wouldn't Know – You get warnings and getting in trouble affects how you get into housing. But I've never had to deal with getting caught so I wouldn't know. Just be smart if you're doing something you know you'll get in trouble for.
College Junior,2,"They Screw You Over. You'll get some nice scholarships Freshman year and maybe sophomore to reel you in. After that, they screw you over. Getting in touch is sometimes pretty hard too."
College Sophomore,2,"ECSU has a great campus and an incredibly friendly array of faculty and staff, however; I've never felt so lonely in my life. Eastern is known as a 'suitcase school' because everyone leaves on the weekends. This is either because there is nothing to do... or perhaps there is nothing to do BECAUSE people always leave. Don't go there unless you have friends there or at UCONN which is 5 minutes down the road (the only savior of the weekends)."
Niche User,1,"I tried to post the review a couple of times but they were deleted by ECSU! I was no longer here but I would like to share a little bit about my terrible experience as an Asian Student here. There is truth Asian need to know before you attending ECSU, some White people were open discrimination against Asian. I was been opening told “Ching Chong” by a couple of white peers when I was walking though the student activity center. In a couple of my classes, Some Caucasian professors treat me differently from Whites (one of the asshole even gave me a ‘really special treat’), because I was the only Asian, they were not afraid if I report them to school. I do meet some great professors here, but you are going to meet a couple of great professors in every colleges, but not too many you would find. My advice to perspective Asian student: try your best to get in UCONN, you will have a much better freshmen experience."
Sophomore,1,"Horrible university, impossible to get a hold of administration who can actually answer your questions, they just send you in circles. I had to leave the university for medical treatment out of state mid-February of my spring semester, just says past the deadline to withdrawal and they made me pay for the whole semester tuition. They were easily contacted to inform me of how much I owed but no one could direct me to a person I could speak with about my medical leave."
Junior,1,"Too small and closed minded. I prefer a larger campus near a metro area where I can become employed. Also I am not black and I am not a rich white, so I don't want to be mistreated. (attractive smart thing white woman)"
Freshman,1,"As an incoming freshman I was misled quite frequently by ECSU. To start off my year I moved on campus and was placed with people not even within the survey I filled out. Once I moved out of that room I moved into another dorm and the room mates treated me horribly. Trying to talk to anyone there about the issues got me no where. 

Trying to handle anything financially at the university was a struggle on the student behalf. The customer service in the Bursar was horrible. I had to get my parents involved almost every single time. It made it very frustrating.

The educational part of the university was also a horrible experience. I was in the Health Sciences program and I couldn't understand what they were saying most of the time. The online program Launch Pad I had nothing but issues the whole semester. The professor I had would not work with me on those issues at all. I practically had to teach the course to myself because the professor had no idea what they were teaching."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have any Greek Life. I didn't know this when I applied. I would love to have sororities on campus to make more friends that way.
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life does not exist on this campus.
College Senior,1,We don't have Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life.  I can not have anything to say because there is none.
College Senior,1,"Eastern has given me nothing but problems. Since the beginning of freshman year, they have continued to take money from me and screw me over, constantly holding loans and account holds over my head. I am now a senior, graduating in 2016, and I cannot wait to leave this school. The faculty members are the only part of this college that I actually like. The dining services suck and there's only one dining hall on campus. When I've tried to communicate with people of authority at Eastern, I'm always given the cold shoulder and someone else (who I didn't address) messages me back with no help what-so-ever. The classes are limited and don't reach beyond the basics in most majors. Eastern is not a college I would recommend attending, choose Southern or Western as a state school instead. Goodbye Eastern, I will NOT miss you."
College Sophomore,1,"The dining hall had horrible options and the food was very unsettling after eating it. I felt sick immediately. Student center food was better, but still not something you'd want to eat everyday."
College Freshman,1,There was one place to party for students 18 and over but the club got shut down so there isn't really anywhere to party unless your 21 and over.
College Sophomore,1,"I can say from experience, the nicest place on campus is Elsa Nunez's office. It's clearly where all of our tuition money is being spent."
College Sophomore,1,Professors are practically fighting your efforts to learn your major.
College Sophomore,1,"Teachers are so foreign it's like they're speaking their native language. You can hardly understand them, they can't understand you, they aren't that knowledgeable."
College Sophomore,1,"Other than mens soccer and mens basketball, which are still d3, the sports teams here are terrible and not worth going to see."
College Sophomore,1,The town is nicknamed Heroin Town. Need I say more?
College Sophomore,1,"Unless you have a car, don't expect to be dining off-campus."
College Sophomore,1,"We got snow INSIDE our dorm room after the first snow storm. The window was locked and shut the whole time and yet we had snow in our room. We called maintenance and put in a work order to have it fixed over 3 weeks ago and it still hasn't been fixed, and I know about 7 other people with this same problem."
College Sophomore,1,"I get that it's a state university so there isn't a lot of left-over money to offer students, but at a below-average state university that has the nerves to charge in-state residential students $20k+ a year, and blows a decent amount on redoing the already fine Webb Lawn and Elsa Nunez's palatial (to say the least) office (mini-mansion), you would think they could spend a little less on the uneccessary stuff, and more on things that directly impact the students here, like better food, knowledgeable teachers, decent housing, and maybe a little financial aid once in a while."
College Sophomore,1,"Small space with a lot of gross people, usually gets broken up quick and a lotttttttt of thirsty people."
College Sophomore,1,"Professors are terrible, strong accents so you can't understand them, don't know the material, and their grading is alien. Hardly available for any worth-while help, outsourced from god knows what countries, and below sub-par."
College Sophomore,1,"Jobs go to the kind of kids you hate, the suck-ups, the obnoxious ones that probably did something unethical to get the position, and then text all day and do their jobs below-average. If you actually deserve a job and work hard, don't bother applying because you won't have a chance at getting one."
College Sophomore,1,"You're more likely to get 911 to respond if you yell ""party"" than ""fire"" or ""rape"" to be honest. Welcome to Willimantic."
College Sophomore,1,"Considering the school accepts more on-campus students than they can actually provide housing too, consider it a high possibility that you might need off-campus housing at some point. And when you do, they won't help you find any, you'll be in a bad neighborhood where you can't go outside at night, and are still at risk during the day."
College Sophomore,1,"Health Services hours are pretty inconvenient. They aren't even open on the weekend, when most people actually have time to seek health-related assistance, and the shuttle to Walmart only runs Monday through Thursday nights so you can't even get somewhere to get your own medicine if you get sick."
College Sophomore,1,"Ignoring the fact that it's called ""Hurl""ey Hall, aside from a bitter salad bar, there are no truly healthy options, even the cooked vegetables are either doused in oil/butter or just not cooked enough to be edible. All of the food is gross."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have greek life. My school does not allow us to have sororities or fraternities.
College Sophomore,1,"I have gone to financial aid multiple times in an attempt to get more information regarding my financial options and resources. Each time I have been met with difficulty or simply no answer. I have been talked to in a condescending manner and disregarded by financial aid advisors and the student workers I have come across are close to clueless about the on-goings of their department. My loans were not explained to me well, nor were they distributed on time. Cancelling them is an ordeal, as well. I am still trying to figure out where the Foundation scholarships are hiding and how to get more information about them."
College Junior,1,Greek life is non-existent. I kind of wish we had something because it doesn't really feel like a college without it.
College Junior,1,You have to go to UConn to find the parties and you can only get in by invite or by being/bringing a girl. The cops around here really hate the party scene plus no one wants to walk alone at night here.
Recent Alumnus,1,The financial aid office is horrible.
Recent Alumnus,1,Pretty non-existent from what I know. And considering it is a liberal arts college...that makes sense.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Five. Five theatre history classes. On the same exact subject. Not enough training in the front of house technology that the ""real"" theatres are using today. I tried using some of the ""training"" I received while at ECSU during my first professional gig, and had to re-train myself back to my high school training in order to do the minimal requirements for the job! Figures...almost 100K....and can't use the education."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The program I was involved in, Theatre, was the worst. I took a grand total of FIVE theatre history classes...all of which were the EXACT same material, EXACT same book...I could've used my time so much better with other courses, but noooo....these were required courses for the major-all five of them! Ridiculous."
College Sophomore,1,No greek life at eastern.
College Sophomore,1,We are in one of the worst towns with all the stores are fronts for drugs and halfway houses in front of some of the dorms.
College Sophomore,1,Everyone drinks on the weekends or they go home. No one is here and sober. its sucks.
College Sophomore,1,They promote small cliques of students that go from class to class together. its just like high school!
College Sophomore,1,We do not have any Greek life on  my college campus.
College Sophomore,1,You have to be in such specific classes in order to receive financial aid from this school which i think is completely unfair. I applied and did not get one dollar of financial aid because of how much money my parents make when in reality there not even paying for it i am.
College Freshman,1,Walking around campus in the winter is tough
College Sophomore,1,We do not have greek life or fraternity and sororities at Eastern which is a plus I think.
College Freshman,1,There are no student discounts for college students and there isn't a wide variety of options. There are the same few restaurants available that we are able to drive to. It is the same stuff every other week and the cost adds up because i don't have any money to spend and when i do my meal is over $20.
College Sophomore,1,This is a deal breaker. Its sorry to say but Eatern is in the running for worst nightlife at a college. First you have to hear about the party. Noone ever tell you where it is. They are kept secret. And ifnyou do hear about it you have to know someone to lives there. And even if you do they deliberately go get the person to comfirm. They people who own houses off campus are not friendly and will only let you in if you bring girls for them.  The houses are all small and there is tok many people stuffed in one room all the time. Lots of people perfer to go to the bar that is next to campus. But you need an ID. There is no transportation to bring you anywhere and if you choose to go out it won't be safe since there are people who have been approached by non students off campus. If you are looking for a great nightlife atmosphere this is not the place.
College Junior,1,"The financial aid office should not be run by students. They can barely help, and it takes weeks to solve problems."
College Freshman,1,This school is so strict on campus.  If you live in a freshmen res hall expect to see cops every weekend in your building.  If you get caught with alcohol on campus and your underage you get a 136 dollar ticket from cops and have to go through eastern judical bullshit.  Its bullshit its college theres no need for cop involvment it's so strict.  Also cops break up almost every off campus party on the weekend its just a matter of time until they get there.  Some cops are really cool and understanding theyre not out to get you there just trying to make it safe but most are assholes.
College Junior,1,"The surrounding town is a dump. Students have to be careful when out late at night. There have been reports of cars broken into, cell phones stolen from students holding them, etc."
Recent Alumnus,1,"don't ask how many times I've gotten sick going to Hurley. The student center is okay though. As is Shafer's cafe thing. But other than that, there aren't many options for on-campus dining."
Recent Alumnus,1,again....nothing was taught to help me in the field
Recent Alumnus,1,horrible! I tried to start a career based on my degree and what I learned in school....and FAILED miserably as they weren't teaching what was needed in the field. Who needs FIVE different theatre history classes? #really?
College Junior,1,"The nightlife is horrible. Unless you are 21 or older, there is no place to go. The town is not safe, so going to house parties is dangerous."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no greek life, instead there are school clubs that substitute for the official thing."
College Freshman,1,They dont give parking passes to freshmen.  I ended up getting multiple parking tickets
College Junior,1,"It is freezing for most of year. If you don't like cold weather, don't come to Eastern. It will be sweltering hot for about the first two weeks of class. Then the temperature drops into the 30's and steadily gets lower and lower throughout the year. It was even cold during finals week of my Freshman year."
College Freshman,1,"Food is awful. no late night food. if youre up late studying, make sure you take a break and eat before 7 o'clock"
College Senior,1,The nightlife in William sucks. There are way better bars out of town.
College Freshman,1,Willimantic is a very bad area.  It is well known for it's homeless and drugs.  I would not recommend walking around there.  Staying on campus is definitely a better idea!
College Sophomore,1,Hurley is brutal but you can buy stuff from the student center thats pretty good quality but it takes forever.
College Junior,1,Parking is an absolute nightmare. There are 2 lots for South Campus parking and 7 or 8 dorms that are full of students who need parking spaces. There is a good chance you will be parking on the street where cars get side swiped and broken into quite often. There are two parking garages on North Campus but they are no where near the academic buildings and are a good 15 minute hike to South Campus. Parking is completely horrible. And Freshmen are not allowed cars on campus.
College Freshman,1,The Food here is terrible! The food hall that comes with the meal plans serves the same 4 things everyday. You have to resort to the Student center which is good but unless you wanna spend all your student money on it in the first month you have to eat the crappy Hurley Food. The staff is friendly but even they will not eat this food. I over heard one of them saying their sons food is so much better than this stuff. If your food gets referred to as STUFF that's when you know its bad.

Freshman,5,"i love the “smaller. smarter.” experience. professors and faculty do not treat you like a majority, but instead take the time to get to know not only your name but who you are."
Junior,5,They have a great system set up for online  courses especially with the professors recording their lectures so you can listen over and over.
Freshman,5,"I have yet to take any classes online through Texas wesleyan, However, I did have to take my orientation online and it was a very simple and enjoyable process. I met my financial aid counselor and my academic advisor, who informed me that I would have to take some classes online my first year."
Sophomore,5,They did everything they could to make sure we had the best online learning experience we would possibly have due to Covid-19.
Sophomore,5,"Texas Wesleyan is a wonderful university. The classes are very small along with the campus compared to other typically large college classes and campuses, this helps a lot because it's easy to navigate through to where you need to be. The staff is very helpful, kind and patient as well. I have never felt judged, only encouraged. If I ever need help my academic adviser is always willing to help me and I am rarely left stranded. There are friendly faces everywhere!"
Junior,5,"I love how personal and home like it is. It feels like everyone knows everyone and with a motto of ""Smaller smarter"" you really get the feeling of knowing your professor and your class mates. I'd like to see the food improve in the dining hall but they are making big stride to provide more dining options outside of the hall. Class size is small and allows for a comfortable learning environment, overall I have no complaints about my school!"
Junior,5,"Courses were very good, lots of interaction and some required out of class engagement with whatever subject was on hand. All profs. were great about communication and helping students who needed assistance. A lot of discussion boards and responding to classmates on these boards, which helped engagement."
Freshman,5,"I did not take any online classes before but since coronavirus became a ""thing"", all my classes switched to virtual. I think I everything was easier than what I expected. However, I need to pay for laboratory even though I did not do anything in the lab during this pandemic."
Freshman,5,I did great job at school. I got A this semester. I was accepted for summer research. I hope I can get more scholarship because I am deserved. Everything there is perfect. I am really good at sciences and Math but I am confused with Eng. I think I chose  the right university to pursue college education.
Freshman,5,I felt welcome from the first moment I was interested in Texas Wesleyan University. They have amazing staff members and they work so well with their students. I just finished up my first semester and they made it as stress free as possible for me.
Freshman,5,"After this Pandemic occurred, Wesleyan and their professors have kept us, as students, well informed on what they were talking about and their decision continuing for future. They have a great lay out of their website and have kept the professors well aware of how it works."
Junior,5,Texas Wesleyan is a small private university. The classrooms are small therefore you get to know your professors and classmates.
Niche User,5,"I am currently a student of north side high school. But I did take classes at Texas Wesleyan. The campus was beautiful, the academics where amazing and it would have got me ready for the college life style. Once i graduate I am going to be playing football at the program and I am really happy that I am going to be playing. The diversity is amazing  the professors are amazing I just loved it here the food is amazing and the cooks cook the food good and i really love it here"
Freshman,5,"I have loved my experience at Texas Wesleyan so far. The location is amazing. All the upperclassmen are really nice and are happy to explain events happening on campus or just to give directions to a building. The staff is very kind and are willing to answer questions no matter what. Texas Wesleyan's open door policy also helps to if students have a question to ask professors after class. The Academic Success Center offers tutoring and study sessions as well as workshops to help students with their classes and build life skills that they need. 

I am happy to be a part of the Texas Wesleyan Community"
Graduate Student,5,Professionally active professors in health care. Support staff very professional and proficient. Very expensive with few scholarship opportunities. Very good option for military students paying with VA educational benefits.
Senior,5,At texas wesleyan i learn alot i learn that all you have to do is ask the teacher for help and they will put everything to side to help you. I also learn that if you do your work there no wat you could fail any class. Not only that at texas wesleyan i found some of my life time friends here. texas wesleyan man me the young man i am today. the love from texas wesleyan is great didnt get this kind of love at any other school Txwes is a home and i will let everyone and the worl to choose texas wesleyan over and college and the state or world
Alum,5,"I have very fond memories of my experiences at Texas Wesleyan. The campus, the coursework, and the student activities were wonderful."
Junior,5,"Texas Wesleyan Professors are all amazing, they will put in the work to help you succeed academically and prepare students for the ""real worlds"". It is apparent that the professors want you to succeed as long as you put in the work and reach out to them. Other students are fantastic, it is easy to start a conversation with anyone and make a connection."
Sophomore,5,I like the small classes and small campus. Larger campuses can feel overwhelming. The professors are very knowledgable and passionate when giving lectures.
Freshman,5,"I will be a freshman this fall at Texas Wesleyan University this fall, the environment there is great and a safe place to further my education, the counselors and aids are very helpful and you can tell that they want to see you succeed ."
Freshman,5,I will be an incoming freshman in August. I have had a great experience during several orientations they have had. Everyone is so nice and care about helping to ensure you succeed!
Junior,5,This university does a great job with the professor and student connection. The classes are just right with how many students are in each classroom and the professor is all about making their students succeed.
Junior,5,transferring here was a great decision. I couldn't imagine having gone to any other institution. The admission process was smooth and they offer a lot of help with the process. I would recommend that anyone willing to live in this area consider this institution.
Junior,5,My experience at Texas Wesleyan University has been great. I have been blessed with great professors and everyone on campus is kind and helpful. I am truly thankful that I chose to attend this school.
Freshman,5,I made the right decision to go to Texas Wesleyan because I have been welcomed with open arms and I am able to find all the resources that I need. I have made many new friends that guide me to be more involved in my community.
Freshman,5,"Wesleyan is a hidden gem. Particularly, the English and Psychology department. The professors are wonderful. They all love what they do and are very clearly dedicated to their job. They are also all very well informed and knowledgeable in their field of study. Wesleyan is a small school, so there is a lot more one on one time with professors in comparison to other universities."
Junior,5,I really like that the class sizes are fairly small. This feels like a community because all the teachers and students are very friendly.
Freshman,5,All the professors are dedicated to each individual student and their success. They are willing to work with you as long as you communicate with them. By far my favorite place to be. Students are kind and make you feel accepted
Freshman,5,"I had a great first semester at Texas Wesleyan, it is always hard to transition from high school into college but with the help of the professors/ other students it made things easier. I like the fact that Texas Welsleyan is a small school because you really get to interact more with the professor, such as raising your hand whenever you don’t understand a certain topic. In addition to this you have more of an opportunity of visiting your professor during office hours."
Niche User,5,"I like the environment of Wesleyan. It has a very unique experience and it's different than other universities. It's much smaller, but more focused. The classes are smaller, so we can talk with the professors more."
Sophomore,5,Texas Wesleyan is a small private university that promotes cultural diversity and offers smaller classes for a more individualized approach to teaching. It is a very respected university and focuses on its students needs.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love Texas Wesleyan! As a freshman they have made my first semester the best. Everyone is so helpful and the atmosphere is the best. I love the smaller school with smaller classes especially coming from a small town. The first time I went to tour Texas Wesleyan they made me feel right at home which is one reason it was my first choice. I am looking forward to the next 4 years here.
Senior,5,I have only been at Wesleyan for a year so far but I love it. It’s a small school and the teachers are really nice and work with you for any problem you may have. It’s a small school so everything gets done right away. If I need to send an email to a professor they will write back immediately. Overall I’ve had a great experience there so far and I am happy with my decision to attend this school.
Freshman,5,"The school over all for academics is great, however the food sucks. There is no favor and somtines bugs. However its dorm life."
Senior,5,I love this school! When I was young I got diagnosed the an auditory processing disability and thanks to the small classes it’s easy to focus on my school work. The professors are always there to help and give advice.
Sophomore,5,"I moved schools from Oklahoma Wesleyan, I thought I wanted to quit soccer forever because I lost the passion for it, but when I transferred to TXWES everything changed for me! This is only my second semester, but the people make me feel at ease, and we get along so well!! The athletes on campus make it warming for me since I suffer from anxiety and hard depression, I couldn't be more thankful for such understanding professors and coaches to work with me in anything I do. Texas Wesleyan truly showed me what it was like to love something I once longed for, these are my people and I can talk to any faculty about my problem and they would listen and try to help me out! I could not be more grateful. The school has a disadvantage and it is the area around the school, it is not very safe but there are security guards and police always around or nearby just in case!"
Junior,5,"Love how small the classes are and how engaged the teachers really are. You have just an abundance of resources around you, not only the faculty but other students and it is just a great place to learn."
Sophomore,5,I love Texas Wesleyan because it's not too big and it's not too small. This university is just the right size. I am able to get to a one on one level with my professors. Even the best schools have issues and no one is perfect but when there is an issue the faculty and staff do their best to ensure we as students can get the best they can provide. I love this school. I'm only a sophomore and I'm already getting hands on experience in the AT program. Talking and working with so many new people not only in my profession but in others that I would potentially be working with. Everything about this school has been perfect and I am glad I did not go anywhere else.
Junior,5,"Texas Wesleyan is an outstanding private University! Smaller. Smarter. The classes are small which I believe hold up to no more than 40 students per class. That which is an advantage, and not only because you get to communicate with your Professor consistently but also because Wesleyan is awesome! They have a variety of clubs and organizations that help and assist students involve themselves in activities and internships!  Our staff members involve themselves as much as possible in order for students to find their right major. We are a big family , regardless of how small we are. Also, I will never get tired of saying this... Everyone is nice. Texas Wesleyan is a diverse, fun and successful University. We have late night activities, for example, bonfires, cookouts, ""Naked but Real"", (students come out to share there art pieces including poems, songs etc.) sand volleyball, free shirts, free meals on occasions and tea! I can go on and on but my words are limited!"
Freshman,5,I love the campus although it's not gigantic it's wide and open and clean. The student body is small but like family. A family where everyone is friendly to one another and you never feel out of place. Parking is free which great for me as a commuter. The only thing I would change is on campus food options maybe a wider range of food choices.
Senior,5,Smaller is smarter is the slogan at Texas Wesleyan and I feel it's easier to communicate with professors which allows for a better experience.
College Junior,5,"Our campus has a system where students can call and be escorted to their vehicles. There is also an alert system for students to be able to receive notifications for anything, from weather notifications to active shooter alerts."
College Junior,5,"I feel very positive about the career prospects upon completing my bachelor's. There is an internship class that is applied to the profession degree programs and a pre-professional program that exposes students to the many steps and aspects for getting into the field of their choice. the pre-professional program assists with applications to professional schools such  as law and medical schools, practice LSAT and MCAT, and exposure to the profession's community. The professors are very involved in the process with the students within the program and those not participating."
College Junior,5,"When I started, I wanted to drop out mid semester, I changed my mind with the effort and support my professors gave me without them knowing. I felt out of place being a veteran, a non-traditional student, and having little to no veterans support on campus. I decided to start a veterans organization to prevent other veterans from feeling what I felt. The school has been very supportive and engaged with our efforts to reach this community on our campus. The school's moto is ""smaller, smarter"" and this is perfect for veterans. Many vets have a fear or nervousness of large groups but Texas Wesleyan caters directly to those that suffer from this due to PTSD. The school and my professors have helped me continue my success after my service in the Marine Corps. I am blessed to be at Texas Wesleyan University."
College Freshman,5,"I am truly excited and love being a Texas Wesleyan Ram, the thing i love most is the ability to know and have relationships with my professors and other staff on a one-on-one basis. I enjoy having roughly 20 kids in a class because My professor will know my name, and i can receive the help I need while i try to continue a degree in music education. From the minute I applied at Wesleyan, i knew i belonged. The students are so wonderfully friendly, and my overall experience is wonderful thus far. Texas Wesleyan offers such a wonderful independent program for me, to complete my degree as an individual and works around my schedule and needs. I am blessed to be part of such a wonderful University and cannot wait to see what the future holds in store."
College Freshman,5,"The professors and administrators all go above and beyond while helping us reach our degrees, there are so many opportunities to work for our degree field while still in school through the connections of the staff. The alumni network is so expansive, that we are given wonderful opportunities from our first day on campus. The quality of the career services center is wonderfully run and has incorporated so many ways for the students to get involved with work relating to our studies in the local communities."
College Freshman,5,"Texas Wesleyan has been a part of my life since I was born, my parents, and many other family members have graduated from there and I have family that has worked at Texas Wesleyan for many years. I have been on campus more times than i can possibly count over the years, and was glad to be given the opportunity to continue my education here. The one thing different about Wesleyan than the other schools I was accepted to, and one of the main reasons I chose Wesleyan was because of their ability to improve all aspects of the life for the students. Wesleyan is constantly updating, renovating and transforming all parts of the campus from the dorms, the sub, to new fitness areas and a new football stadium. Wesleyan has always offered one of the strongest athletic departments for a private school- They inspired the football team of the 1941-1942 school year to enlist together the day after the tragedy of  pearl harbor, after winning the co-championship title. Texas Wesleyan University has coached its students the power of responsibility, integrity and the determination to succeed. After 75 years the Texas Wesleyan varsity football team made national news for being reinstated and had a record of over 200 students try out, we have olympic champions going to RIO 2016 for Table tennis, and many more championship and award winning titles through all of our sports programs such as baseball, softball. golf and tennis. As a student at Texas Wesleyan University, I can say with confidence that our school, though small, has such support for our athletic department and all other clubs/activities on campus. I am glad to be a  Texas Wesleyan Ram and I cannot imagine what we new championship titles that we will hold in the future!"
College Sophomore,5,I love smaller classrooms and being able to have a relationship with your professor. the people here are great.
College Junior,5,Texas Wesleyan University  what I need for my Business Degree
College Sophomore,5,"There is a very good security system at this school. With the university being in a not so well part of town, the security guards make it feel a lot safer."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors here make this university what it is. They are helpful, and they care about each and every student they have. The fact that this university is a lot smaller than most, makes it feel like a family. While walking around campus, you can smile and wave at anyone, and they will do the same to you. You share classes with at least one or two people. Everyone knows everyone, and it makes things a lot more fun and a lot less stressful on new students! If I could, I would stay at Texas Wesleyan forever. The atmosphere is very welcoming, and there is not one person who will turn you away if you need help!"
College Freshman,5,They're always riding around very helpful and kind
College Freshman,5,They are so nice and encouraging I love them already they're amazing
College Freshman,5,Love the nice people they really care and are helpful as well as encouraging
College Freshman,5,I've never had a problem with anything on the campus and the security is friendly and helpful.
College Junior,5,"Great school to apply too, any questions I had were answered and I was always helped when I needed it!!"
College Freshman,5,I love this school and everything about it. It is constantly advancing. The classes are small and all of my professors know my name.
College Junior,5,Just be yourself the professor are there to help you be successful .
College Junior,5,Ive never seen anyone being inappropriate in any way. I go to class 4 days a week!
College Junior,5,Although you may not always agree on something. Everyone is VERY helpful at all times!
Junior,4,"Texas Wesleyan University is a small and smarter focused university, where the main goal is to have smaller classes, such that students have more access and time with professors, which is always the case. The professors are fully willing to help you achieve high grades, and the university has an academic success center to further emphasize this goal. The sports organization is more so inclined to American nationals. 

         While the cafeterias sure do provide several meal plan options, vegans might have a problem with their everyday needs, since meal plan options are relatively overpriced. Dormitory communities are not excellent, though they are improving over time. Dormitories themselves are relatively old, but not a problem, though maintenance is relatively average to poor. If one can afford prices to live on campus, it directly depends on what one requires."
Sophomore,4,Professors have done a great job to enhance our virtual learning experience. We use many platforms for our science classes and labs. All my classes are online because I could not live my home-country due to the covid-19 crisis and need to receive my classes online.
Sophomore,4,It is a diverse college with prepared faculty and staff. I will like them to change the way the cashier's office attend students and is willing to help them.
Freshman,4,The faculty staff was very helpful and kind they really seem to care since my mother is a signal parent  . Also I am very excited to start football. I have to thank the coaches for doing there best to give me information on certain parts to help me get situated with my dorm.
Freshman,4,professors are very organized and very friendly. never a moment where i am/was confused or lost. everything is also very easy to access and complete.
Junior,4,"I love how small it is and the amount of scholarships available.

I wish that the coursework was harder and that it better prepared me for the business world."
Freshman,4,"I love how the college isn't large to where it is overwhelming, and the classes make it to where you are able to interact with your professor more."
Sophomore,4,"I like that its small, with only about 3,000 students. It being small makes it easier for you to connect to your professor and do better in your classes. It's a nice and aesthetically pleasing small campus. I like how you really feel cared about here, the faculty and staff makes this known. The free tutoring is one of my favorite resources."
Sophomore,4,"My online experience with Texas Wesleyan wasn't bad considering the fact that it was forced, due to the ongoing pandemic of Covid-19. Professors learned quickly how to adapt to online learning and they put their all into it although it was a much different scene and the majority of them preferred face-to-face interaction with their students. They were very helpful if students did not understand something and they were very understanding when it came to overdue work or situations where students were not able to attend class due to the current situation. I took my courses face-to-face in the fall of 2019 and in the first half of the semester in spring 2020. After spring break 2020, we were forced to return to learning virtually."
Junior,4,"My sister graduated from here a few years ago and I'm transferring. I start in the spring and plan to graduate in 2022! Even though I haven't started classes yet everyone has been very helpful and welcoming, it makes me look forward to actually becoming a Txwes Ram and finishing my education!"
Sophomore,4,"At first I was not crazy about how medium size the campus is, however, that is one of my favorite things about this university, as well as the professors that they have here. All of my professors that I have been extremely helpful and they truly care and will work with you and get to know your name. The other things that I love about it here is the credibility and the resources that it has. The only thing I would change is the amount of money that they do ask for and the amount that they cost for tuition and housing."
Sophomore,4,"Texas Wesleyan is a fine campus with good stock of teachers. The campus itself lacks diversity and opportunity for students of color, other than sports. No fraternities, no clubs that allow the student of color to truly have a voice. Outside of diversity issues, the campus as a whole is pretty boring."
Senior,4,"Love the small classes and the professors.  They are very personal and willing to answer any questions.  Additionally, I have really enjoyed the majority of the classes  I have taken, including Film Aesthetics, Comic Books and Crime, Cats Codons and Chromosomes, and other fun titles."
Senior,4,"Class sizes are small and that is amazing. I would like better communication with financial aid, and for updates to scholarships to follow a student if the amount is raised."
Freshman,4,"Like any private university, the price is gonna hit hard, But the main return you get from this university is experience and connections. The academics are very good here, the diversity really sticks out, you have people from all around the world who goto Texas Wesleyan, Countries you've heard of and maybe a few you will hear about. It is a beautiful campus with trees and an old-time college vibe to it. the local area isn't the greatest being in the south side of Fort Worth, but you are only a few minutes away from downtown. You can bet you won't go alone either as the student life here is one of the main selling points of this university in my opinion."
Senior,4,"I love the school, but I especially love my professors. Student/professor relationships are Texas Wesleyan's biggest strength; their accessibility to their students sets Texas Wesleyan apart from other private four-year universities who might be bigger and have more resources. That being said, there is definitely some room for improvement, especially regarding campus safety and resource (donor money) allocation."
Freshman,4,"The small classes and community really makes the students feel like a family. It is also very beneficial in academics, where professors can have one on one time with students to help, and they really want to help you."
Junior,4,Texas Wesleyan is a small school with a small size classroom. This allows for personal attention and ensuring that the learning process reaches every student and that there money is not being wasted.
Graduate Student,4,I feel the classes are top-notch as well as the professors. There is an on site counseling center that students can attend and a great training ground for upcoming therapist. Tons of training and volunteer opportunities. I am in my first year of graduate school for Marriage and Family Therapy as well as a military veteran. This school was the best choice for me!
Freshman,4,"I loved that Wesleyan was in the DFW area -- I was able to find a good job when I got out without any problems. The professors expect a lot, but they are there to help anytime you have a question. Many of them are great with job leads and practical advice. The upper administration/President needs some work because they were combining majors that had nothing to do with each other. Rumors about some of the really great professors leaving are concerning. The President, Provost, and others in the administration don't seem to care that they are hurting students overall chances at good jobs by taking away contemporary programs. Otherwise, I think Wesleyan is an untapped resource for many people. You get out of it what you put into it -- if you work hard and forge professional relationships, you will do well and reap the financial benefits. Wesleyan has a great reputation in the business community."
Alum,4,"Texas Wesleyan University offers lots of opportunities for students to succeed if they are ready to work hard. There are many scholarships available and good resources to connect future graduates to the DFW job market. A majority of the professors are approachable and desire for their students to achieve. However, I would not recommend this school for mediocre students who tend to blow off class because the tuition is way to expensive to be screwing around."
Freshman,4,"Being in small classes is awesome because you can actually get to know your professors and get the help you need, but being on a small campus can be hard when you have breaks and there is not much to do."
Junior,4,I enjoy the smaller smarter idea at Texas Wesleyan. It has definitely helped further my education and made me focus more on my education.
Senior,4,"My experience at Texas Wesleyan University has been great the last two years as a transfer student-athlete. The education I am receiving is exceptional and playing baseball has been a plus to my experience here. I love the smaller class sizes, being a hands-on learner the class size has helped me retain the material a lot better than huge lectures. I would like to see the tuition and fees decrease because I am planning to graduate this (fall 18), and prices have jumped up."
Freshman,4,I like that the classes are smaller than a conventional college class size making it easier to get one on one time with the professor when you are struggling with a problem.
Niche User,4,The living environment and the school spirit that everyone has is really great. Also the teachers a really good at what they do and they care about their students.
Sophomore,4,"The buildings are outdated and the neighborhood is not the nicest, but the staff is very helpful and the professors are wonderful."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy attending Texas Wesleyan University because it has a small community environment. I have made many friends and encourage others to attend smaller universities.
Niche User,4,"I went for my first semester in college before transferring out. I liked it a lot and it was a good experience. For a private school, it wasn't too costly. It's located in Fort Worth and that is a beautiful city. Overall I thought it was a good school."
College Junior,4,At this school students get to really see what graduate school could be like. In the chemistry department is students get to do research for the profesor of our choice as a senior requirement where we do experiments ourselves to find an answer to a proposed question. It's something that a lot of schools don't have or where the research job is washing the plates and dishes for the actual researcher.
College Junior,4,I think the profesors in my course plan are great. They know what they are doing and can help me on my path of career choice. They make themselves available for students who need help with course work.
College Junior,4,I like Texas Wesleyan because I get the help I need that I feel I wouldn't get anywhere else.
College Junior,4,"The class sized are small, which I love. All of my professors are great except for one who was new last year. She did come around during the end of the year and it was a learning process for all of us. My criminal justice teacher is the best. The best thing about the school being small is that your professors are able to really work one on one if you don't understand something."
College Junior,4,This is my junior year at Texas Wesleyan and I have never had a problem with security. This includes daytime and nighttime. Some days I do see more of a police presence. I don't know if something happened or is they are assisting security for some reason. That makes me wonder if they are open with us about everything going on.
College Junior,4,"I really love going to Texas Wesleyan University. It's definitely not the type of school for everyone. Being that it's a small campus you really get a personal feel here, which is what I like about it. It's not in the best neighborhood but there is adequate security to make you feel safe when walking around the campus. The teacher I've had seem to care and really help when we need it. The one negative about the school is the financial aid office. They don't seem to want to help."
College Freshman,4,"Texas Wesleyan has been very open to diversity among the staff and students, we have many from various countries worldwide with many faiths and backgrounds. The school is very accepting of all who attend and their beliefs."
College Freshman,4,"As a woman on campus, I feel especially safe knowing that Wesleyan takes pride in the safety of the students against all sorts of violence and sexual violence. I feel protected by security and have been blessed to not have any accidents thus far, and pray that the safety for students on campus will only progress till there is no crime."
College Freshman,4,"As a commuter student to Texas Wesleyan, I have often wondered how life was while living on campus, through orientation and registration I was able to see the wonderful amenities and good conditions that the co-ed dorms were in at Weselyan. I live merely 20 minutes from campus,so I did not feel the requirement to live on campus when home was so close- but the perks of Wesleyan's dorms are  very nice. I enjoyed seeing how the campus security is constantly protecting the students, they are renovating the living areas, and the ease to get to classes from the dorms. I was very impressed by the dorms at wesleyan and if needed I feel that Wesleyan offers a homey, comfortable living arrangements for all college students."
College Freshman,4,"Texas Wesleyan's Greek life through fraternities and sororities have been major parts of campus life, these associations have provided safe, fun and helpful chances for companionship and community involvement for Fort Worth. Texas Wesleyan as a private university holds pride in their different activities such as greek life. The applications are tediously reviewed, and the various greek life fraternities and sororities incorporate many aspects through choosing new candidates: community service, leadership, pride as well as respect and responsibility. Students of greek life are given the opportunity to make life long friendships, contribute to rebuilding the communities which surround us and allow them to be a life long member of great associations built on respect and leadership. While greek life is open to all to apply, only the best will be accepted. Greek life pushes you to be the very best person you can be at Texas Wesleyan University."
Recent Alumnus,4,What I loved most about my university was the fact that the professors were always so helpful and easy to get in contact with. The classes were small enough to gain that one on one interaction needed at times with the professors for extra help.
College Junior,4,The athletics at our school are very competitive and they win mostly all of their games. It would be nice if they sports department would make them be more involved in their classroom work like they are with the sport.
College Sophomore,4,Student involvement is awesome but the facilities could be updated
College Junior,4,Actually Texas Wesleyan just announced that they are going to start up the football program in 2017
College Sophomore,4,"I don't house on campus, but they are nice."
College Sophomore,4,I don't know much about the greek life here.
College Sophomore,4,There is more school spirit than most schools!
College Freshman,4,I've only looked on on the facilities and don't attend events very often
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of alumni and they are very involved with the campus. It is a very good school for networking.
College Freshman,4,My professors were very hands on and active in the class. There are no dumb questions anything can and will be answered. Also tutoring is extremely great. The tutors want you to understand and get the full jist of the material and not just turn it in for a grade.
College Freshman,4,I did not live on campus but the friends that i did meet at the campus said it was great and a fun experience.
College Freshman,4,"They have good athletes there, they are dedicated and passionate about the sport they play."
College Freshman,4,"I love this school because it is small, yet it is very diverse. I would not choose this school again because of how expensive it is. However now that I am here, I don't want to leave it, and that's why I'm applying for this scholarship!"
College Junior,4,"I love the small campus and class sizes, the involvement of the faculty, and the proximity to downtown Fort Worth.

I have heard great things about the programs offered, and I can personally attest to the high quality of the Music Department and the Education Department.

I find the school quite expensive, but in line with similar private universities.

I have, however, had several problems with the Financial Aid office."
College Senior,4,I don't live on campus.
College Freshman,4,it is appropriate for the student/faculty size.
College Freshman,4,Just wish there were more funds available.
College Freshman,4,Love the small classes and one on one relationship with professors.
College Junior,4,They don't have tons of places.. but the places have variety. Plus each week there is a free meal on campus!
College Junior,4,We have A LOT of of social events on campus. I study a lot so I wouldn't be able to tell you about parties.
College Junior,4,"They have great academic scholarships that you receive every year you're there wether its the 2, 4, or 5. Just maintain your GPA. Its super easy you are automatically entered when you apply for the school and all you have to do is accept the award online."
Senior,2,"The teachers are wonderful! The students are also great, but the financial aid sucks. It is terrible having to panic and come up with money you don’t have every semester. The tuition went up twice in the past two years. They pay almost everything for athletes that can fail classes, countlessly. It’s ridiculous for students who actually make A’s who have to take out loans on top of loans just so their classes don’t get dropped."
College Junior,2,There is just not a lot of options here. I tried the sorority but there seemed to be a lot of drama and I didn't want to be a part of that.
College Sophomore,2,I do not have time to do any athletics
College Senior,2,Its really hard getting the financial aid I need.
College Junior,2,Not many people have parties because of the things that have happened in the past two years. Personally it would be good to have some parties that involve everyone not just athletes or greek life
College Junior,2,I would NEVER even consider living here.
College Senior,2,"You really don't see it much. they're pretty tight on keeping an eye out for drugs, and if you're caught then you are screwed."
College Senior,2,"Basically, unless you have your own car or a really good friend, you're SOL."
College Freshman,2,The food provided in the café is not good.  However the food is edible. students prefer to dine off of campus but that is costly so we deal with the food provided which has no variety at all.
College Sophomore,2,not enough places to park alot of students have to park in neighborhoods which can be bad.
College Sophomore,2,it wouldnt be so bad if the first year some of the professors were unprofessional.
College Sophomore,2,"I can eat on campus because I commute, but at the sub they sell things like chicken sandwiches and pizza. "
College Sophomore,2,I really have no idea.
College Sophomore,2," Most of the buildings are average, however some of them do feel like they're about to fall apart while walking up the stairs. I do not live on campus, but it seems like almost every Thursday there's a cookout. Other activities I am not aware of."
College Sophomore,2,"The closest place is subway. Other than that you have to drive at least 10 minutes to find nothing, but fast food restaurants."
College Sophomore,2,Theres not alot of sports kind of disappointed theres no football.
College Sophomore,2,"Eh, nightlife at TWU is okay but only if you're 21. If not then you're not going to have very much fun. The 18-and-older clubs are about 45 minutes away so it's never worth the drive. House parties don't happen since there aren't any frat houses around. I'm not that big of a nightlife person anymore being that I am 24 but for some of the new students if that's why they want to go to school then Texas Wesleyan is not the place for them."
College Junior,2,"Texas Wesleyan  has been around for decades, and the neighborhood has changed in so many ways. Since, the University is now located in what  some may call a ""poverty"" area the number of restaurants are to a minimum. The closets dining area is the Subway that's is across the street next door to our lovely bookstore. But who wants to eat sandwiches everyday."
College Freshman,2,"Texas Wesleyan University does not have many restaurants near the campus due to the poor area it is in. There are very few fast food restaurants and their located at least 7 minutes away from the campus. The nearest fast food place to eat would be Subway, which is within walking distance of the campus. It is probably the most popular place to eat, but besides that there are very few options."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't very many options to choose from on campus. They only two places are at Dora's cafeteria and The Grille Works. Dora's does not provide much food with quality. There the usual pizza, and salads to eat from provided all day. Sometimes they'll serve stir fry or sandwiches, but it's nothing at all to brag about. If you choose to eat at The Grille Works, you get to choose from pizzas, burgers to salads, but it most of the time it always takes forever to receive your food. Either way, both places on campus are not always pleasing."
Freshman,1,I never took my classes online so I don't actually know how online would actually be like. Also this is my first time as a freshmen so my classes start soon .
Junior,1,"The online program was fine, I only did this due to covid 19 issues. So I think they just passed everyone as long as you showed effort."
Junior,1,"They purposely put me in classes I didn't need,  I was never assigned an advisor . So I would see a different one and they would say I dont know why So and so put you in this class, of well just drop it and we will fix it next semester. Then I was just tile im not ready to graduate, I'm still a year out cause off all the classes they messed up and charged me for with no refund or credit... nothing. Im back in advising now and they just let me know they do not offer all the classes I need for my degree, they want me to pay another school for classes I need also... this is seriously a mess, I came in with my associates degree, was supposed to finish my bachelor's in 2 years and here we are more time and money wasted. I'm going to look into complaining to the board of education, none of this is right... definitely be cautious with this school. They are purposely taking advantage of students."
Freshman,1,"Support for students wonderful but if trying to get Finan Aid & payments made, receive NO assistance. Told by Financial Aid they work in phone calls tween students coming in - live 5 hrs away, so cant drop in. Left msg last Thurs & this afternoon & no response.  Called Financial Aid this a.m & told to contact Cashier's office. Left msg, emailed, & no response. Recvd call last Tues night were having system issues & could pay this week-they are having issues, won't return calls/msgs  & today receive deregistration notification! Beyond Frustrated!!!!!"
College Junior,1,"I haven't been to any parties on campus , but I hear they have them at off campus houses ."
College Junior,1,Not any good options to eat .
College Sophomore,1,never heard of them at our campus
College Sophomore,1,"I don't live on campus, but I've heard students talking about it being average."
College Sophomore,1,I wish I would have known my major earlier. I am a year behind because I took a bunch of classes that I don't need.
College Sophomore,1,"I tried to ride the bus here to save on gas, but it was too complicated. I would have to wake up two hours earlier just to make it to class on time."
College Sophomore,1,"My first year at Texas Wesleyan, I hated the parking. I would have to get here super early just find a spot close to my classes. Now my classes are more towards the outside of the campus and it's not as far of a walk if I park at the farthest parking lot."
College Sophomore,1,For as many students we have that live off campus we need more parking because it is just a nightmare. Some students have to park in the dorms parking because parking is very limited on campus.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid here is horrible. Some of the times they have no idea what they are talking about and do not have answers for you on what you need to know. If you are going to work in financial aid be able to inform the students and not look lost.
College Junior,1,"To my knowledge, Subway is the only off campus dining nearby.  There are no student discounts there.  The cost is reasonable in general.  There definitely needs to be more of a variety of restuarants in the are."
College Freshman,1,"The area that Texas Wesleyan is located in is very poor. At times, I am scared to walk anywhere by myself. There are always people outside walking around that just send off a bad vibe. I recommend walking with a friend if you go anywhere off campus together."
College Junior,1,there is really not anything to do but school work this is not a party school
College Sophomore,1,"Financial Aid is not hard to get, but the office is not the nicest. They are very strict and rude. I feel that they should be more helpful to the students."
College Sophomore,1,"The Public Transportation around Wesleyan is awful. And it is
very scary since you are usually riding with homeless people. They 
need to upgrade and have a transportation system just for college students."
College Junior,1,"There is no transportation, because the campus is so small."
College Junior,1,"Harsh Punishments – The RA's (room attendants) force can be pretty strict about underage drinking and smoking in the rooms. First-time offenders get a warning, and second- and third-time offenders are in danger of losing their housing. It's pretty serious if you get caught, so my best advice is to do everything discreetly and not to be obnoxious about it. If you're going to drink then drink, but don't start advertising keg parties in your room. You will get busted! Also any scholarship you had is out the door with you."

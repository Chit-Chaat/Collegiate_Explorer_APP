Alum,5,"I did not take online classes at Lakeland, they do however offer several majors online for those wanting to attend fully online."
Sophomore,5,I'm currently a sophomore here at Lakeland University. I've had nothing but great experiences here with faculty and students. Lakeland is a super tight knit community and I'm blessed to be here.
Freshman,5,What I like about Lakeland is the location of the campus. The school is like out on a open road so like your stuck on campus. Now your forced to stay on campus & occupy yourself with thing on campus. This is came to my liking because now do not have to worry about kid getting in trouble or hurt off of campus
Freshman,5,"I am a current student at LU, and I am very proud to say that I am a Muskie! LU provides a small campus which ensures that you get to see and be around familiar faces, which creates a family-like environment. Additionally, professors truly care about the success of their students and make themselves extremely available for additional meetings or help with course work.
The new campus center is beautiful; it is a wonderful place to study or meet with friends! 
Additionally, the buildings are very close to each other, making the walks in the cold very bearable. 
 Go Muskies!"
Niche User,5,I liked everything about  Lakeland when I toured there twice. I especially liked the small class sizes and student to teacher ratio is small so students can get plenty of one on one attention.
Freshman,5,Lakeland University is a very welcoming community. All the students on campus are very open. The staff and faculty are all dedicated and are invested in the students and do whatever they can to help the students. Lakeland is usually a peaceful setting. The campus tends to stay quiet but gets loud during the usual class times. The class sizes are small compared to other universities. This makes it easier for the professor and the students.
Niche User,5,"For me, it was a great experience because I visited since the soccer coach wanted me to and I felt so welcomed and the campus is absolutely gorgeous! If you like smaller campuses, I believe Lakeland University is a great fit as I am one of those people. There are about 700-800 students so it’s nice and home like and it doesn’t have a super rural feel but enough to feel like a home away from home!"
Sophomore,5,Lakeland University as a whole is very family oriented. Staff is always willing to help and guide students in any way needed.
Senior,5,"Overall this university is a great experience. It is a small campus where everyone knows each other. The professors want you to succeed, and will always find ways to help you. There are tons of opportunities to join athletics or the various clubs and organizations"
Freshman,5,Lakeland University resemble a home. Everyone is nice to everyone and everyone knows everyone. The sports team support all the other sport teams and go to the games to cheer each other on. The food types were kind of the same a lot of times but besides that it was pretty good and they had different kinds of ice cream!
Freshman,5,This college is beautiful and even though this is a small campus it makes it feel even more like home. The events held  here are also very fun for all students.
Sophomore,5,Lakeland University provides working adults a chance of higher education without impeding the daily responsibilities  or commitments through Lakeland's intuitive BlendEd courses.
Niche User,5,"I am attending Lakeland as a non-traditional student via their Blend-Ed program. The online live classes work very well with my schedule, job, and family."
Junior,5,Lakeland University is an amazing school designed for those who work during the day. Evening classes are available to start at 6pm so everyday life doesn't get in the way of your education.  The staff and professors are quick to answering questions and keep class interesting.
Junior,5,"The staffs are so friendly and they make me feel they care for me and are there for my success.  Not once did I feel like I did not belong.  Whatever I did not understand or am unsure about, my questions were always answered.  I love the atmosphere at Lakeland and I love the way I was being treated."
Junior,5,I like Lakeland because of the online classes that are offered. I'm going into computer science and right now I work a full-time job. I can watch the recorded classes that take place during the week and watch them on the weekends.
Junior,5,I was able to transfer all my credits from my Associates degree from 15 years ago.  Everyone is friendly and eager to help you succeed.  Instructors care about their students.
Senior,5,"I like how they offer evening, night and weekend and blend ed classes.  All instructors have been very knowlegable and respond quickly to questions. Academic advisors answer questions to get you on the right path.  My credits transferred from other colleges fairly easy."
Junior,5,"I am a commuter to Lakeland University, and love all of my accounting and business professors. They are very helpful with my classes, and strive to see their students succeed. In addition, the career placement center has been extremely helpful in helping me lock up my first internship. There are many resources to take advantage of at Lakeland University, and using those resources will help any student succeed."
Freshman,5,I love Lakeland. I call it my home because it feels like one. Everyone on campus cares about your individual success in your future goals. People are so friendly and there are a ton of great opportunities.
Senior,5,Lakeland College challenges me to look at all aspects of a situation.  They provide a total look at my degree and allows me to investigate possibilities.
Sophomore,5,"Definitely chose the perfect school to go to. My major, business administration, has some excellent professors that are really looking to help you for your future. Everything that is done at this school is to create students that are truly prepared for the future career and life in general. The athletics at this school are very good for a Division III program as well."
Sophomore,5,"Lakeland College is a home away from home. Everyone on campus is a member of the Lakeland family, is understanding, and is friendly. No one feels excluded and there are events for everyone. The staff understands that college is difficult and stressful but manage to do everything in their power to ensure that students are comfortable and healthy. I visited the campus and knew instantly that this would be my new home."
Sophomore,5,"The small campus is really what made my experience so great. Everyone knows everyone. Everybody is friends. It's such a close campus, and everyone is extremely nice!"
Junior,5,Lakeland University is an amazing place to spend my four years of my undergrad. I am glad that I chose this small and personal school to further my education.
Freshman,5,Overall my experience here at Lakeland has been nothing but positive. I am on the Women's Basketball team and we have had a winning season and I play to continue with academics and athletics over the next three years.
Junior,5,The Blend Ed technology really caters to adult students. All of my associates degree credits were accepted and the transition has been great. I really recommend this college.
Graduate Student,5,"Attending two classes there per semester, I find it easy to get around and beautiful grounds. I don't spend much time on campus but what I do see, I like"
Niche User,5,"Lakeland University in Wisconsin offers day, night, weekend, online, and study abroad programs. Go Muskies!"
College Freshman,5,everybody shows support and they go crazy over it
College Sophomore,5,"Class sizes are small, so that makes it easy for the professor to communicate with you and work more one on one with you instead of just standing in the front of the class and not helping the students out because there is so many of them. The classes that are offered are great. You have a lot to choose from and the professors seem to want to teach that subject every time."
College Sophomore,5,The professors and staff have great connections with people that have been through Lakeland or just know about it. This way it is easier for students to get internships which leads to the hiring of them as soon as they graduate. The staff is a huge help to the students to find them the best place for them to inter and help them grow.
College Sophomore,5,The safety on campus is the best. You feel so safe on campus because the security personnel are always on call and are always looking to help people. The campus is probably the safest campus in the United States. It makes a difference because you can relax as a student and a parent knowing that you are part of a safe school.
College Sophomore,5,"Lakeland is a very family-oriented school which in turn helps cope with the overall stresses of college. The professors and staff members are all extremely friendly, and the prices are reasonable as well, given the quality of education students receive here."
College Senior,5,Love lakeland because of blend-ed
College Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus, wonderful people, a very personable and kind staff. Best experience would probably be the fire during orientation, and meeting my fellow students.

If I could do things over, I would definitely do so again."
College Sophomore,5,Greeks are a big percent of the student population at the campus and are very involved in other clubs and organizations.
College Sophomore,5,"Lakeland is a very secure place, there is very low crime in the area and the campus community is very tight so very little goes wrong on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Because Lakeland is a private college, there are a lot of scholarships that were developed by community members and alumni.  I was an average high school student but still received over $12,000 per year in scholarships."
College Sophomore,5,I am an accounting major.  Lakeland College is one of the few colleges in the country that has a Forensic Accounting concentration available at the undergraduate level.  Lakeland hosts a Forensic competition in the Spring and one of the department heads is very active in the forensic accounting profession.
College Sophomore,5,Lakeland College is just the right size!  The classes are not too big and the professors know their students.  The workload is manageable.
College Freshman,5,BlendEd programs offering students the option to attend class or do online work. This is one of the reason I decided to go to this college.
College Freshman,5,Very great. Could not be happier with a college thus far.
College Freshman,5,"I love the Appleton, Fox Cities area. It is safe, secure, and clean. I always feel at home and safe in town."
College Freshman,5,Applying for admissions was excellent. The staff made it very easy to apply and answered questions promptly. I was very impressed with turn around time and how helpful admissions was. Applying for college has never been easier for me as this is my third one. It has been a great experience so far!
College Junior,5,Advisors are readily available and are great communicators that are quick to respond to student needs.
College Junior,5,I enjoy having the option to go to class or complete weekly work online at home in my spare time.
College Junior,5,Classes are taught by teachers that have several years of experience in their fields.
College Junior,5,"Good variety of professional degrees offered, wide course range."
College Junior,5,"Great learning atmosphere, teachers are professionals in their fields."
College Junior,5,Computer lab is easily accessible.
College Sophomore,5,About 10% of school is international students.
College Junior,5,"I love being in the non-profit program at my school.

I truly have a passion for wanting to open my own organization and help others. 

We are to do two internships, and I think that is great in order to prepare for the real world!"
College Junior,5,I finished my undergrad at Lakeland and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The process to apply and wait for my acceptance into the MBA program was fast and quite easy. No hard headaches.
College Junior,5,Free printing here has absolutely came in handy multiple times! Just watch out for the labs filling up really fast especially since some dorms don't have computer labs.
College Sophomore,5,"We have about 5 computer labs on campus, for being such a small campus that's a lot and each lab has a fair amount of computers in there."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone on campus is friendly, and it's easy to meet people and make friends."
College Senior,5,Professors are helpful and get feed back to the students very fast.
College Freshman,5,"There are many different type of races at LC mostly white then we have our blacks, asian just to name a few. we all have different views on our poltical beliefs. Religion since LC is a Christan College you have to take a Regligion class but they do not try and convert you to a Christen.Sexual Orientation is 50/50 which is a good thing."
College Freshman,5,I never seen anyone useing drungs at Lakleand. Its not really talked about there. Drinking what is more a normal activity .
Alum,4,Overall I liked attending Lakeland University.  The campus was beautiful and my only reasoning for leaving was it became too unaffordable
Sophomore,4,"For my second semester of online schooling, every student and professor was thrown into a culture shock. None of us really knew how the rest of the semester would go, but we all managed to get to the end of it. My personal experience wasn't fantastic. My GPA did drop because of personal reasons and because of teachers not being 100% transparent with what is happening. Besides that, I did get through the rest of the semester successfully and I'm currently enrolled in my second year."
Junior,4,Online classes are very easy. Not a lot work needs to be put in. I wish they were harder but it’s better than nothing
Sophomore,4,So far Lakeland has been good to me. The small campus setting is perfect and student body is like a tight knit community. Many opportunities to build yourself up as a person.
Junior,4,Kellot program is wonderful with the most wonderful professors I could have possibly met. Great school!
Freshman,4,I love Lakeland because it has a perfect learning environment.  The class sizes are small so the teachers know you and can help you out more one on one. Since Lakeland is s smaller school there are more friendly people and you see many friendly faces.  The facilities are also very nice and clean especially the new updated campus center.
Sophomore,4,I love the community. The student to teacher ratio makes the experience better. The campus is beautiful. Overall friendly faculty and students.
Senior,4,Overall it is a pretty good small private school that is very helpful. They have so many connections and opportunities for you to expand.
Freshman,4,"LAKELAND IS A GREAT COLLEGE, WISH THEY HAD MORE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR CURRENT STUDENTS, BUT OVERALL GREAT STAFF, GREAT COMMUNICATION AND GREAT CLASSES IN THEIR ABROAD PROGRAM."
Senior,4,Lakeland is a diverse campus focused on the student. Instructors do easy they can to help the student understand the material. I've never met a better group of people than I have at Lakeland.
Sophomore,4,"Very flexible for adult students. Open, great instructors and classes. Cannot complain about how attentive they are to students and their questions."
Freshman,4,Lakeland feels like a family away from home and provides a very welcoming atmosphere. I can be involved in a lot of different activities and feel supported in every endeavor I undergo at this university.
Sophomore,4,"The school and facilities are extremely nice. Campus has a nice family feeling, and professors are very willing to help. The only downfall is how high tuition is."
Freshman,4,I love the small atmosphere and how welcoming everyone is! The professors are always here to talk one on one and meet with you around your schedule.
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Lakeland has been an adventure and a half. The teachers and faculty are always willing to lend an ear and a hand when you find the right people and pursue the help you know you need.
The opportunities through and at Lakeland are many and I love to explore what's available to me as there seem to be more options popping up every day. But, again, you need to seek them out. The faculty will be willing to present you with what kind of opportunities are available to you, but you have to be the one to pursue them and find out which one is right for you.
You also need to keep an eye on is your finances. They won’t pursue you, you need to pursue them periodically in person to see if anything is amiss. Technology is temperamental in ways they might not even be aware of. 
Another thing I love is their willingness to just talk with you as a person. If you are just looking for a person to talk to and chat with, then they are more than willing if they have the time."
Freshman,4,Lakeland College is now Lakeland University. The campus is small but you are guaranteed to find a group of friends within the first few weeks. The community is very inviting and there are great opportunities for everyone.
Freshman,4,Great school great professors i feel comfortable  They could use a lot of help with your financial aid they need to get kiosks and have assistance with them and they could really use the freshman dorms really need help bad there’s no air conditioning in the need of facelift beautiful campus
Junior,4,What I found impressive about this college is that the administration goes above and beyond helping their students. They are very responsive when a student needs help and have resources available to us when we ask. The professors are understanding about schedules and the online courses they offer are flexible.
Niche User,4,"Lakeland is a wonderful ""come as you are"" university. Amongst the hundreds of students at their Sheboygan campus, you'll find people of all backgrounds and cultures. They're student body constantly seeks ways to make the school's on-campus activities more captivating while even still earning credit towards convocations. The professors and faculty are always willing to help with students who don't always succeed in their first attempts, whether it's academically or emotionally."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy attending Lakeland. I think it is great that here we are like one community. I like that everyone here know everyone, although this is not always a good thing. Word travels fast here, good and bad. All together though it is a great place. The campus is beautiful and the professors are always willing to help no matter what the situation is. I really love it here."
Senior,4,"Lakeland College, now known as Lakeland University, is a diverse campus. During my studies here I have made friends from different countries such as Korea, China, Japan, Malawi, Kenya, Russia, Germany, and many more. 
Athletics at Lakeland are very popular. Many students attend athletic events either because they like the sport, made a friend that's on the team, or just to get the ""American"" experience in sports. For those going to play sports at Lakeland, there are no sports scholarships, but there are academic scholarships scale available. 
Another benefit Lakeland has is for adults wanting to go back to school. They have blend Ed classes that allow you to take the class online and in the classroom (if you want). It's a nice, easy way to work full time, take care if your kids, and still go to school.
I believe Lakeland would be a better college if the prices were more affordable. The tuition is too high and you find yourself in debt."
Freshman,4,I appreciate the ease with which I can take classes as a working mom.  They offer convenient times and the college planning representative is fantastic.
College Freshman,4,really care about other success
College Junior,4,i dont live on campus
College Junior,4,"i dont live in the area, i would not know these answers...."
College Junior,4,i attend school out of state online so i have never been to campus
College Junior,4,so far the teachers have all been very nice and helpful
College Sophomore,4,"The Freshman dorms could use some upgrades, but other than that the dorms are some of the best that I have seen. It's close to everything and they have all you need in them plus free laundry which is very nice to have."
College Sophomore,4,Professors help you whenever you need it and work with you throughout the semester and even after. The staff is very friendly and helpful as well
College Freshman,4,Teachers are nice and want to see me do my best.
College Freshman,4,rooms are nice. heating provided. lots of space.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of activities available on campus.
College Junior,4,My experience has been pretty good so far. I enjoy learning and I think the school is helpful.
College Junior,4,"The on-campus security is pretty strict when it comes to the things that matter. Underage drinking, drug use, and disturbing the other residents is something that is not tolerated."
College Junior,4,"The best parties from my experience are the school-sponsored events. These events like frat parties and international festivals provided a great look into a different social environment, while at the same time not being too overwhelming. The on-campus security is there to make sure that the parties don't get too out of hand and everyone in attendance is usually very friendly and willing to meet new people."
College Junior,4,"The food options at Lakeland are surprisingly diverse in terms of what's available. There is the standard cafeteria food which serves all three meals of the day, but there is also the Muskie Mart, which also has the grill for more food options. The muskie mart sells snacks like Cheetos and Rice Krispies, but the grill serves freshly made food ranging from Hamburgers, french fries, and even veggie burgers! As a vegetarian I can vouch that their veggie burgers are pretty tasty and well-made. Going to the grill for a veggie burger was one of my favorite things to do."
College Junior,4,"From my experience, living on campus is a phenomenal experience. Living on campus is a great way to get to know your fellow students as well as providing a great study atmosphere. The cost of living on campus is more expensive than making a commute everyday to class, but the authentic college experience is well worth it. Not only is it convenient to make it to make classes on time, but it also allows you to receive the help you need with learning the course material. With things like on-campus libraries, tutoring programs, and the ability to meet consistently with other classmates in order to study together makes living on campus one of the best things about attending college."
College Sophomore,4,We are a D3 school but alot of the coaches try to make it seem higher.
College Sophomore,4,If you have the opportunity to make it off campus. The food is great and there is variety but obviously not like a big city
College Freshman,4,There's a lot...compared to my home town.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are typical dorms.  There is an option for on campus apartments, which is great.  The lottery award for these accommodations is fair in that it takes into account grades and how many credits have been earned."
College Sophomore,4,"Many of the students at Lakeland College are Varsity Athletes.  Although Lakeland College is a Division III school, they are able to attract good athletes for many different sports."
College Freshman,4,Great place. Facilities are clean and nice with areas to study and easy to get around with people around to assist when needed.
College Freshman,4,I am not involved in the athletic area of the schooling process.
College Freshman,4,There is a great deal of variety in the area as the location of the school center is in down town area with fast food chains and restaurants.
College Freshman,4,I have not had a chance to research this thus far.
College Freshman,4,There is a variety of academic programs offered. There has even been a recent addition to the Business Administration program for a Minor in Human Resources which is excellent.
College Freshman,4,"My workload has been a little overwhelming at time due to that fact that I work full time, volunteer, and have a variety of family obligation I must attend as my family is very large. Homework takes a little more time than what I am used to but information is distributed well an I know what needs to be done and when it needs to be done."
College Freshman,4,I have not had the opportunity to visit the main campus but in the Appleton and Neenah areas it is well diversified.
College Senior,4,"I do not have any concerns about finding a job in my field and many people are slated to retire withing the next several years, leaving behind many job openings. 

If I had to do it all over again, I would choose a different major, one that does not make you take THREE exams which you have to pay for, just to be able to teach."
College Senior,4,It's great but I wish the Milwaukee Campus would offer Secondary Education as a major.  Too late for me now though.
College Senior,4,"It has been a great experience thus far. However, I now have concerns since my advisor is no longer with Lakeland. I fear that the person handling this now does not know what is involved with setting up student teaching, etc. I am happy that this school offers evening classes. I do wish they would bring back Saturday classes and offer more choices."
College Senior,4,people are friendly and accepting
College Senior,4,workload is average with helpful professors
College Junior,4,"Campus is in the downtown area, security and local police are present."
College Junior,4,Several options in the area.
College Junior,4,"Average neighborhood, school is in a business area of town."
College Sophomore,4,Love the professors in the program.
College Junior,4,Its pretty easy and things are done pretty quickly
College Junior,4,I am happy with my program. I am hoping to still find a career in the Information Technology field. 
Alum,2,"First let me tell you, make sure you're signed up for the degree you think you are signing up for. I got my bachelor degree in computer science and it wasn't until graduation I found mine was a bachelor of arts degree and not a bachelor of science. 
Second, I wouldn't take any of their online only courses. Thought I had just a bad teacher but when it happened a second time I decided not to do that again. 
Third, they're graduates aren't viewed any higher than any other school. I think I would have been better off going to a U of W school because a lot of people haven't heard of Lakeland. Also they aren't teaching any of the latest technology. 
So here I sit, starting my new career as an OTR truck driver with a $30k student loan bill and a computer science degree that's doing nothing for me."

Graduate Student,2,"Administration has spectacular disregard for the students, particularly in the graduate programs. Registrar forgot that Spring break is a thing and didn't account for it in Spring 2020 semester. President resigned and they didn't tell the student body. Class requirement policies quietly changed by program director after semester started and the students were not notified directly. Accreditation which was supposed to be forthcoming two years ago has not even been applied for. The school appears to experiencing some kind of financial or retention problems. Counseling program is 1/3 the size it was a few years ago and shrinking. Madison campus closing and the classes will rent space at the local community college. School is hiring for an electronic games coach while they can't hire and retain adequate academic faculty."
College Freshman,2,There are hardly any available scholarships.
College Senior,2,"It's safe and all, but I wanted more fun at school."
College Sophomore,2,Lakeland is in a rural location so it is a long drive to get to off-campus dining options.  They consist mostly of fast food.
College Sophomore,2,Lakeland College encourages all students to live on campus.  The area surrounding Lakeland is very rural and there is not a good selection of off campus housing available.
College Sophomore,2,We're far from everything so it's not really a choice
College Sophomore,2,Pretty cold and a lot of snow.
College Sophomore,2,Pretty unattractive as a school.
College Junior,2,"Lakeland does offer scholarships and such.

Yet it seems they are always taking away financial aid, last minute.

or messing up a students account last minute. 

Most of the time people have to drop out of school because enough time to pay isn't given."
College Junior,2,"Security is usually there to do things like bust parties, or harrass students they feel may be negative to the campus.

Doesn't seem like they do anything positive really.They dont help make me feel safe.

They make me feel targeted most of the time. 

And I dont like that they walk around with guns!

I feel they abuse their power!"
College Junior,2,"We have a cafeteria with food that is occasionally good, the scrambled eggs for breakfast aren't great. there is also a little grocery store with a grill attached next to the cafeteria for students to get meals at."
College Sophomore,2,The school is pretty far away from the city and its kind of hard to get to places unless you have car or you know someone with a car.
College Senior,2,Internet is sometimes slow and the computers and printer in campus center always seem to have issues which almost always never get resolved in a timely fashion.
College Senior,2,My campus is a smaller private college. While I enjoy the close relationship I have with my professors the have a problem the the price. Most everything for a single non-traditional student is challenging to afford.
College Sophomore,2,There are scholarships for the students but there are not that many only the basics.
College Sophomore,2,"It is free to park at school, but having your own car can be pricey still. The nearby cities are at a minimum of 15 minutes away and gas isn't cheap. We do have a free shuttle bus, but that isn't always guaranteed to be available."
College Sophomore,2,we really on have one which is the shuttle unless u get a ride from a friend
College Sophomore,2,"I chose the grade C because everything is at least 15 minutes away from campus.  There is a cafeteria and snack stand on campus too.  The off-campus options are wide spread but once again, at least 15 minutes away so gas and time are an issue.  The quality and service are good, as is the price.  The distance is the only drawback."
College Senior,1,"If you are going to continue your study at the main campus in Wisconsin, then there is a good amount of scholarship. But that's pretty much it."
College Senior,1,No one cares and only the school government people go to see how sports are doing. Nothing special in the Japan campus.
College Sophomore,1,Lakeland College is in a rural community and the off campus scene is non-existent.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life to speak of on the Lakeland Campus.
College Sophomore,1,Schools pretty lazy and doesn't really care.
College Sophomore,1,Everything is far from school.
College Sophomore,1,Not national Greeks. People are just annoying in it.
College Junior,1,"If you live off campus you can not use the campus shuttle.

EVERYONE pays for the shuttle regardless of if they use it or not.

the drivers can be rude.

They aren't on time

They are LAZY, and schedule as few people as possible"
College Junior,1,"The shopping around Lakeland is pretty poor. If you are a shopping and enjoy   retail stores of many types, you will not find to many around here. Lakeland has a few stores close to the campus but each store has a short drive to it."
College Junior,1,"Very unhappy about my experience. Half the teachers were great, other half not to friendly. Grading scale which effected my grade very much for the worse, lied about referral fee, and very limited courses (for online adult program). I am glad I left this school."
College Senior,1,"Snows Too Much – In the winter, the snow is horrible. It is nice because we get alot of snow days due to the inability for people that commute to get to school. The parking is hard when it snows though and it gets boring because you cannot go anywhere."

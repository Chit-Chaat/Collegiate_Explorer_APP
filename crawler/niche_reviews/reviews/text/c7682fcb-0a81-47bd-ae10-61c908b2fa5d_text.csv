Junior,5,"I love Stevenson University- the campus is small, filled with diversity. Due to it being a private college, there is more one-on-one time available to students. The faculty truly works to help students in every way possible and want students to succeed. The students are very nice and friends are easy to make."
Freshman,5,When I went to Stevenson to play against there football team I like the way the campus is built. Also the University is diverse which is also a plus in the books for anyone who wants to come here.
Freshman,5,"They were very welcoming when i took a tour there. The staff is all so incredible and they truly want to go the extra mile to help you better understand and succeed. The campus is truly lovely. It's in a well populated area however, they did a fantastic job of making it feel safe and secluded"
Freshman,5,"Stevenson University is a cozy college with a small class that is just right for me. Safety is everywhere for your security. Student life is okay, I love anime club, but most people probably would think it's average. Housing is above average based on other colleges I toured."
Freshman,5,Amazing university with a beautiful campus and friendly people. The campus has so much to offer for students which allow them to prepare for their careers once out of college.
Junior,5,"I really liked how the class size was small so I was able to talk to my professors and make a connection with them. I also love how spirited Stevenson is. There are so many clubs to join, there is a club for everyone ay Stevenson. All of the professors, faculty, and students are very nice and welcoming."
Freshman,5,"Stevenson is a great school to attend, especially if you are looking to go into the medical field. I am currently a freshman nursing student and the facility and class sizes are perfect if you don't like being in a class of 200 students. The professors actually remember you and they are always there to help."
Freshman,5,"I like Stevenson University for many reasons.
1. The campus is beautiful and clean
2. The class sizes are small, making it easier to get 1-on-1 time/feedback from your professors.
3. The professors I have had for my first semester so far were very nice
4. For your first year, you get a success coach that guides you and assists you in getting comfortable and do periodic checkups
5. Even though it is considered a PWI, there is still a diverse student body with plenty of clubs specifically for minorities.
All in all, If you can afford the price tag, I would absolutely recommend someone to go to Stevenson."

They fed us during trip a lot. It was very good. The dorms looked like a nice size. The teachers seem like they really want their students to succeed. They are very engaged with their students. They help in every way to see them do good after college.
Freshman,5,"The campus as a whole is quite beautiful and is constantly being worked on to maintain this appearance, and the academics offer a limited honors program that has just been started up. They offer a lot of financial assistance to halve the tuition if you have the grades for it. The food isn't always great, but sometimes they have really good things to offer in the cafeteria."
Freshman,5,"The school is great and I really love the campus, it's clean and it has clean dorm rooms that are really cozy and remind me of home, you should really attend Stevenson because I'm having an amazing experience."

Freshman,5,"Friendly small campus, located near lots of retail, good sports teams, small class size, excellent dorms, easy to get around"
Freshman,5,"While visiting Stevenson university I felt the love and connection between each student, as if it's a big faily. The teachers care for their students and their well being, making sure everyone is on the right track and no one fails. I also admire the campus scenery, it's very beautiful and peaceful. Also at Stevenson the counselors would personally text me to see If I was okay , so in general I feel the bond at Stevenson and feel the love between everyone. I also enjoy the courses , academics and their pre professional programs."
Niche User,5,"I'm an accepted student for Fall, 2019.  I'm very excited from all I've seen at this point.  The staff has been very available to answer of my questions.  I also have enjoyed the Facebook page to talk to accepted students like myself."

Freshman,5,"Steveson University is a really good school. The location is nice they have a little small food area that you and your friends can go to. The school size is nice and small. The school only has 4,000 people and the class sizes are really good. The professors at Steveson really help you out a lot. There always available for office hours and they always have the right connections to get you the perfect internships. The campus size is a medium area it's not too big and not too small."
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a freshman at Stevenson University, but do not feel limited by my class. I feel like everyone else, and I have equal opportunity to succeed in and out of the classroom. So far, each of my professors is logical in the way they teach, and deal with students."
Niche User,5,"I will say Stevenson has a beautiful campus and is very diverse. If you're looking for a school with sports and school spirit, then this is definitely the school for you. great food and living experience. great location probably where you want to be in the state of Maryland."
Freshman,5,I love everything about this school. I play soccer and I love the coach and team and environment. Academics is outstanding. I love how the classes are small. The campus is also beautiful.
Sophomore,5,Stevenson University is located on a well kept and green campus. Teachers are kind and want their students to succeed after college.
Niche User,5,"I am a prospective student and I think Stevenson is like a little community, as soon as I step foot on campus I felt welcomed. I love the fact that they are building because that means there's so much more to come that will not only benefit students but the community as well. If you are a student worried about the party scene, there are some parties but not many but that's just how most D3 schools are. Just remember you are there for academics not partying."
Sophomore,5,It's a great school.  The criminal justice program is really good academics wise and to help with internships and getting jobs after school too.  It's isn't too far from Baltimore or DC either which is nice for this major.  The residence halls are really nice and comfortable.  There are plenty of clubs and organizations to join.  You get out what you put into Stevenson University.
Sophomore,5,"The community at Stevenson University is welcoming and inviting to all students. Everyone on campus faculty and students alike are kind, openminded, and accepting. There are many helpful resources for all classes to ensure your success and various events are often held to promote community on campus."
Niche User,5,"I loved that it was small so the class sizes would be smaller, giving more one on one time with students. I also liked how modern and new the campus was, it was clean. The dorms were very nice as well, I hate to be in a small dirty place, but the dorms were the opposite. Their athletic facilities were also top notch, I could see myself working out in there everyday."
Sophomore,5,"Stevenson Univeristy has been such a great experience so far. The school overall has provided saftey, activities, and an open environement."
Junior,5,"Thus far, I am really enjoying my time at Stevenson University and feel that it is providing me with that knowledge and information that I need to prepare me for the workforce."
Sophomore,5,"I like the small classes and the career involvements. I wish there were more food options to choose from, though."
Sophomore,5,It is a great school with very small classes and great professors.  It is a very friendly school with something always to do.  At the bottom of the campus is a shopping mall with tons of restaurants and fast food too.  Love the school.
Freshman,5,I will be a freshman fall of 2018. I have truly fallen in love with this school and I’m not even a student yet ! The focus on career is nothing I could find in any other school which is truly what drew me to it. The campus is really beautiful and everyone is like a little family which I personally find really important. If you are considering going I truly recommend it !!
Graduate Student,5,"So far all of the faculty and staff I have dealt with have been helpful and pleasant. The advisors are top notch and there when you need them. This was the only school that had the program I was looking for available as an online masters program, and it’s affordable."
Freshman,5,"Stevenson has the best atmosphere , students , and staff. Everyone is so  welcoming . Whenever you need something everyone and anyone is always there to help you!!"
Freshman,5,"Deciding to go to Stevenson was one of the best decisions I made. Everyone is super friendly and they make you feel like you belong. It feels like home away from home. The faculty really cares about their students and work hard to make sure we succeed. There is always something to do on campus, so I never get bored. The residence halls are also very nice  Being able to control the temperature in our room so nice when it gets hot out."
Senior,5,The only thing that I would change is standard across most college campus' is the food.  The cafeteria is beautiful... the meal plan is great.  But the meals aren't tasty.  However we do have flex points in which we can use in local restaurants but sometimes the student schedule is a conflict.
Sophomore,5,"Sometimes I hear people complain that there's not much to do around here, but they aren't trying hard enough. DC is about an hour away, the inner harbour and towson are both about 25/30 minutes which both have so much to do. My friends and I always go out in Baltimore and Towson. The bars are really fun and you get to meet people from lots of different schools from around here."
Freshman,5,"I love the college it's a nice& friendly community. The dorms are nice and clean, the maintenance workers do a good job cleaning the hallways. They have shuttles to get you from both campuses. I love that we have a little shopping center. And we can go off campus for our flex dollars. We have events every week which is a good thing. I feel very safe in my community."
Junior,5,"I love the small classroom sizes, I feel my professors really get to know me. They provide a lot of resources that help you succeed in whatever areas you may be struggling in. They are very hard on academic integrity which is a plus. The campus sites are amazing! The new bridge they just built is pretty cool. Allows students to take a 12 min walk between campuses. Its really nice in the summer time to take a walk with a group of friends and just observe the scenery!"
Senior,5,"This university was conveniently located close to home. Little travel time meant more time studying. The professors are friendly and genuinely seem like the care about the students. If you put in the effort, they will give you all the attention you need. Only downside to SU, the wifi. They just need better service and this will make the university much more accessible to students."
Senior,5,Stevenson University is a great school. All the staff and professor works with you. You can build good friendships. I wouldn't change nothing about Stevenson University.
Freshman,5,"Love Stevenson University!  I am a commuter and we are welcome to any events on campus.  I live ten minutes from campus in an apartment with my sister.  The professors are pretty good, although there are a few tougher ones I have had so far.  Campus is wonderful, with three pretty close locations near each other.  Lots of various majors to choose from. There are pretty small class sizes, which is beneficial if you want to have a relationship with your professor."
Freshman,5,Stevenson University is by far my favorite school out of all the ones I toured. The teachers are so helpful with answering your questions and the students on campus are welcoming and overall they just have a really friendly staff. So far my experience living on campus had been great! They're so many different groups and activities to join and no one is turned away. The class room size is usually no more then 20 kids so you get to have a close relationship with your teacher and fellow class mates. The teachers are really helpful during their office hours. And they're always in their offices when they say they will be. I would recommend Stevenson to anyone going to college! They have such a wide variety of majors for you to pick from and the counselors are very helpful when giving you advice on your major.
Junior,5,Great school with a great accounting program. The accounting program offers yearly accounting fairs for students to meet with 50-100 accounting firms looking for interns.
Freshman,5,"My first semester at Stevenson University has met my expectations. The University is known for its professional, career-oriented majors, academics, and professors. All professors are more than qualified to teach their given subjects and the faculty work tirelessly to ensure that the students are preparing for their career after college - starting in the first semester of the freshman year! I am confident that the education that I will receive at Stevenson University will be the best for me and prepare me greatly for my intended career."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Stevenson University so far has honestly been one of the greatest experiences in my life. This school was the next chapter in my life and I am glad that I chose this school. This school is really career focused from day one as well as knows when one needs a break and to just have some fun. The environment is for man different types of people, races, and personalities and there is a place for everyone here."
Sophomore,5,"I love that this is a small/medium size school. This is my sophomore year here, and I love it. Academics are great, there isn't one student that is not on their grind to make it in the career force. Advisors are there for students needs, and actually assist with career and study decisions for students. Diversity is good on campus, reps are always looking for more ways to make sure everyone is comfortable here. Good campus area to be in. Dorms are nice too!"
Niche User,5,When I visited the campus it was such an amazing experience. everyone seemed so nice and interested in what you want to do.
Freshman,5,Absolutely love the environment that the staff and students create. I know each professor personally and they honestly care for me and my grades. Some offer support meetings where they talk to me about upcoming projects and proof read my drafts in order to make sure I am following the criteria of the assignment. They also have response recording where they explain your grade on an essay or project so that you understand exactly what you got. The college even offers free tutoring. 
Freshman,5,"Stevenson is an excellent school. There are good undergraduate programs, kind people, and awesome athletic teams. There are also a lot of extracurricular activities to participate in so there's no excuse for being bored."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I really enjoy Stevenson overall. There are plenty of student activities, a lot of friendly people, and the professors are awesome. I would recommend this school to anyone."
College Freshman,5,There is great value in a degree from this school especially if majoring in nursing or education. Both programs allow you to meet prospective employers while still in college and find internship and volunteer opportunities.
College Freshman,5,The numbers for crime and personal safety issues (such as rape) are very low and in the rare instance that a problem does arise on campus there are measurements in place for students.
College Freshman,5,The housing is very nice as it is fairly new. The buildings are very clean and are definitely worth the value.
Sophomore,4,"I like the campus and the people there, the small class sizes and personal relationships within the departments are why I chose to go here. The professors are all very friendly and welcoming, and other students are also friendly."
Sophomore,4,"I took some classes online because of the pandemic. The professors are very hit or miss, most have a good handle on the technology but a few have no idea what they're doing."
Alum,4,I did online classes because of COVID19 and the professors were quick to adapt. Most of them were very flexible with the work.
Alum,4,I spent 4 years at Stevenson and I personally had a good experience. Part of any college experience is getting involved and finding your niche. Stevenson is small and you will find a handful of the same students in different positions. I also know Stevenson has had problems addressing racism on campus and really implementing diversity and inclusion.
Alum,4,"I came out really prepared for the workforce in my field compared to others in similar schools, the social life isn’t as active as other schools but it’s worth having a smaller school if you value knowing your classmates and your professors."
Alum,4,I personally didn’t have to take any online classes but from what I’ve heard from others it was nice to have that option for some classes.
Junior,4,"I took online classes during covid-19, while most professors were outstanding, I did have some issues with one professor not allowing me to turn an exam in (the problem was then fixed immediately when I brought it to the attention of higher-ups). Professors during this time were always available through email and very accommodating and relaxed while still enforcing deadlines and learning as much as possible. Keeping communication during online classes is essential."
Freshman,4,"Stevenson University has different courses you are required take if you are a incoming freshman or transfer student. For example, the University provides alcohol, sexual violence and drugs courses to help you understand more about them."
Junior,4,At Stevenson I have enjoyed my time there and the community that is heavily diverse. Before I committed to Stevenson I wanted to withdraw because I thought I would be attending a white prep school but everyone there is friendly and they show love to all races. I love this school and grateful I'm involved and can help in the community.
Sophomore,4,"Stevenson University, while overpriced, is a great private college.  I enjoy the smaller student to teacher ratio and the many clubs and opportunities to get involved on campus.  Due to the smaller size of the college you get to know pretty much everyone very quickly, meaning your almost guaranteed to have a friend in every class!"
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman here. The campus live is great, the food is great and the administration/professors are also great and helpful. The dorms are comfy and reminds me of home. It is very spacey as well as the bathroom. NOW money. This school is very expensive and that is why I have to transfer and I am a FRESHMAN. The scholarships do cover most of the bill but I was still left with an 11,000 bill that needed to be paid and I have three scholarships! this is only the campus fee must I remind you, so that means whatever your scholarship cannot cover you must pay that same amount every semester. That means im paying 11,000 every semester. So therefore, I have to transfer because that is a lot of money unless you just have money like that. But please take advantage of these scholarships especially my TRANSFERS there is a scholarship that pays FULL TUTION so please take advantage of that.  I hope this review helps!"
Sophomore,4,Stevenson University offers a lot of opportunities for incoming students to really get involved with the school and find out what it is they want to pursue throughout their college career. The staff really do seem to want to help those who have questions and are great resources for those looking to learn more about the school or major they're enrolled in. I would say the price of the university is very steep for what is given back to the students in terms of an education.
Sophomore,4,"Small school but large community. Professors are very open in the classroom and to work with students who are challenged.  Great scenery, open transportation."
Niche User,4,"This university offers a wide variety of majors to follow. For example, the computer science track branches out into commercial or federal applications."
Junior,4,"Stevenson University is a great institution and provides students with a lot of resources and opportunities that allow them to excel. People on campus, whether it is another student or staff, are always willing to help each other. The campus has a great atmosphere. Since it is a smaller school you will always recognize people when walking to class. The housing is great since the dorms are suite style and each suite has its own bathroom. The only thing that I would change about Stevenson is the meal plans and food selection. The meal plan is overpriced for what you get and the quality of food. The hours of operation of the dining options are strange and sometimes inconvenient if you have late classes."
Freshman,4,"Everyone seems to get along at Stevenson. Life is pretty easy here, but this place is super dry. It's extremely career oriented, so most people either absolutely love or hate this place. Bring a hobby here, because there is nothing to really do here. Overall, it's pretty easy to make things work here, no major problems I want to make note of."
Niche User,4,"I attended Stevenson 2012-2013. Although I did not complete my education there, Stevenson was a great school. I enjoyed the campus and the staff. The small class sizes allowed for you to develop more personal relationships with your professors so they could better help you throughout the semester. I liked the dual campus option. Living on the Owings Mills campus but being able to attend classes on both the Owings Mills campus or the Green Spring campus allowed for a more intimate campus style. Buildings were fairly close together and easily accessible. The only down fall to me was the on campus food options. Jazzmans was a nice touch but you grow tired of Pandini's or the Cafe. The dorms were nice. I had the luxury of moving into one of the on campus apartments after dealing with a difficult roommate situation which was even better. Overall, If I could have, I would have finished my education at Stevenson. It's a great school."
Sophomore,4,Stevenson is a close knit community that is very friendly. professors care about their students and are willing to help to make sure that students succeed. Student life is diverse and the local community is safe and has lots to do. The school has a high reputation for stellar academics across all majors
Sophomore,4,"Stevenson’s campus is gorgeous, and well kept and maintained. All the buildings look brand new, even if they aren’t. The dorms are gorgeous, spacious, and clean. I love everything about this school, except for the social aspect. There are almost no parties, and people are very reluctant to get involved on campus. There is a very low level of school spirit, and sport games are barely attended. This school would be perfect if people got involved, and wanted to have fun."
Niche User,4,I have had a great experience at Stevenson University. It is a very beautiful campus with very friendly students and staff. The provide the students with the best education to prepare them for the future. The food there is also amazing.
Freshman,4,Stevenson is a rather small school where it is easy to get to know people. The class offerings are good and the dorms are excellent. The campus is laid out nicely and it is close to lots of resturants and coffee shops.
Sophomore,4,"A few things that I like about Stevenson University are the dorms and buildings. They are all cozy and home like, most of the time there are two people to a room unless someone lives in an apartment which is on the campus and allows you to have your own room, a full bathroom, and a kitchen. Also, the academics here are amazing; most of the professors, tutors, and student link helpers are willing to help a student to the fullest in order for them to do well. Now, a few things that I would want to change here at Stevenson would be the campus and student life. Some students are at almost every event hosted here but many people tend to stay to their own friends instead of trying to make more friends. So, then this makes the student life decrease because people stay in more and refuse to communicate and explore new things. Overall, Stevenson is a beautiful campus and is a great school for academics."
Freshman,4,"I'm currently attending Stevenson University; I am a freshman business administration major. From an academic standpoint, this is an excellent school with superb staff. I have yet to run  into any problems with professors. It's easier to engage with staff, due to the small size of the school."
Graduate Student,4,Im an online student. Very different from traditional class. Its a good balance between work and school. But have to schedule yourself accordingly.
Freshman,4,"very nice well kept school, but parking is horrible. the buildings are very nice and well maintained. shuttle services take you to the two different academic campuses"
Sophomore,4,"The academics are great, as a sophomore I ave not had a bad professor. I love the facilities as they are all new and up to date with great resources. They give great scholarships but it is expensive."
Sophomore,4,I love the small close-knit community atmosphere of Stevenson and the on-campus facilities are great. A lot of new is coming to the university in a short amount of time but they keeping to the small environment which can sometimes feel too small. I would love to see the school try and expand a little to add sorority and fraternity houses so those groups feel more connected like on a larger campus.
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Stevenson University so far has been a good one. Although I have my moments of doubt and thoughts about not making it to graduation, I still find a little hope. My professors have been so amazing, and I am forever grateful that they are so passionate about helping their students. They have done everything in their power to help me be as successful as possible. The positive energy around campus honestly is one of the main reasons I have made it through my past four semesters. Not only the professors but the staff as well. I have had many staff members help me when I’ve needed it the most. From the doctors in the wellness center, to those working in ResLife. My community wants nothing but the best for me and my future."
Alum,4,"I loved the intimate atmosphere created by all of the professors. The small class sizes, as well as the willingness of the professors to mentor you and teach you, really added to a quality education. I did not like the multiple campuses however, as this made my experience more strenuous due to the commute and divide compared to elsewhere."
Sophomore,4,"Stevenson University feels like a home away from home. The environment is very friendly, the professors and deans are amazing, and there's always something new to do."
Senior,4,"Great faculty, very willing to help with career goals and plans for graduate school. Small school. WAY too expensive. The BIGGEST setback to this university. I wish I could have received more financial aid."
Sophomore,4,The things I like about Stevenson the most is the diversity of people on this campus. There are many opportunities to meet new people with the amazing and numerous different clubs and organizations we have at Stevenson. One thing I would like to see become better is the cafeteria (Rockland) food.
Junior,4,"I like that Stevenson University is a quiet suburban community location that offers students many amenities such as Dining and entertainment and social and community run events. The campus is also accessible for  commuter students and offers  The most new up-to-date equipment and school supplies for academic courses.
I think they can improve on the tuition it’s too expensive and offer more assistance to students for scholarships and work-study opportunities to pay for tuition instead of getting loans."
Sophomore,4,I have attended Stevenson University for two years now and the hashtag #SUishome is very true. Everyone who attends Stevenson is so open-mined and willing to try anything. I love the atmosphere when I am on campus it is so positive and welcoming. I have a close relationships with a lot of people on campus. The professor's here at Stevenson are so personable and always there if you need help which I appreciate. Every student who attends Stevenson whether it be a commuter or a resident everyone is familiar with everyone. I like the small feel on campus which is why I chose to go to this school because I feel like you would not get a similar experience if i had went to a bigger school.
Junior,4,Going here you do not expect a party scene so looking for one is going to be hard. I personally like that the campus is calm at most times and there are activities almost everyday if you really want to feel involved. The sports are getting better every year and the campus is making new improvements all the time.
Freshman,4,My experience with Stevenson has been outstanding. The faculty is always available and willing to help. The small classes allow for one on one contact with professors. The colleges focus on career makes me feel confident that I will be employed upon completion of my education.
Freshman,4,Stevenson is a small school and therefore they do not make you feel like you are just another number or student lost in the shuffle. Each instructor gives you the attention that you deserve. They make you feel that your education and succeeding is important to them too.
Freshman,4,"I loved the friendly atmosphere. As soon as I stepped on campus, I felt right at home, and was treated like an old friend by the current students. Admissions were helpful and friendly throughout my application process, and the various services such as the Wellness Center's free counseling and the Academic Link's free tutoring continue to make sure I have a great experience at Stevenson."
Freshman,4,"I love the size of the classroom and the dedication from the teachers. When I have a concern in class, I am able to address the professor and they are able to help me without any problems. Also, the professors are able to remember your name and face, you are not s number here at Stevenson. The focus on academics are amazing and the events on campus are always fun!"
Sophomore,4,"i love the academics at stevenson university. they have great opportunities with in the nursing program i am taking. all around it is a great diverse school, but the only down fall is the tuition continues to increase."
Freshman,4,This is a wonderful institution that strives on interdependence. The academics are most important despite the level of sports recognition that the school has. There is a priority and kindness that can be experienced by each individual who attends this university. There is a collectivist approach to makin sure topics are understood without judgement. There is no shame in tutors whether a student is doing well in a subject or not. Professor are accepting and encouraging to ensure student success. The university has many diverse clubs and organizations that thrive to instill a sense of community no matter where people are from or their circumstances.
Freshman,4,I liked the small community here at Stevenson. The class sizes are 20 students. The professors are very helpful as well. We have free tutoring here if you need help. The programs with athletics are very competitive as well.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the universities atmosphere. All the staff and students are very welcoming! I just wish they would serve better food and have more activities on campus. The professors are also very helpful, they work with you very well."
Freshman,4,"My experience with this school so far was amazing, I felt like I was welcomed when I went to visit the campus before my decision was made."
Junior,4,"I like how the classes are such small sizes so you really do receive a connection with your professors. If I could change one thing, I would change the scheduling process and the courses provided. Scheduling is a headache, and there are not that many general elective courses available. For example, I would like to take a PE course or another general elective, but it is not offered even though it is technically an area that Stevenson offers."
Freshman,4,"I visited Stevenson University the summer after my sophomore year and from then on out I knew that was the school I wanted to attend. From the cleanliness, to the great programs, to the suite-style dorms, to the food, everything about Stevenson was right for me. The only downfall is the price."
Niche User,4,I loved the home like feel of Stevenson. Has great courses and programs available. Stevenson has both of the majors so I don't have to chose just one I can after both of them.
Sophomore,4,"I love the community of Stevenson! You have to get involved to get the full experience. Just sitting in your room and staying to yourself won't get you much of a college experience. The food could be better but it is improving. A lot of good benefits like free student parking, monthly printing money, no community showers, small class sizes, etc. Definitely a place to consider. Professor in my major, psychology, seem like they truly care about your education and success. (Can't speak for other professors though) We are becoming more diverse. Football and basketball games aren't too fun but they give you something to do."
Freshman,4,"Stevenson University is a diverse campus booming with student life and fun activities. The professors are intelligent and well versed, and the students are welcoming. At a glance the campuses can seem bland but each has hidden wonders. The class sizes are relatively small and most of the professors are laid back. Not much of a party scene on campus. Academics and sports are the main focus of this school."
Freshman,4,"I would like to change the way classes are presented. When it comes to taking lower classes, we should still be able to at least take a class that is connected to our major and not so much just a random class that we do not need. This becomes frustrating when it comes to trying to figure out the credits for the future plans. This happened to me and it was very stressful to figure everything out and now I need to double my credits a semester and take summer and winter classes to be able to graduate in my 4 years."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I think Stevenson is a pretty good University. Like high school, you have some good and bad professors. The accounting program is challenging and the sports are awesome. Football is their main focus here at.  There is a lot today on and off campus. There are lots on campus to get involved in. I would have to say that we have one of the best as far as dorms are concerned. The food isn't bad, just gets a little repetitive after a few months. Stevenson is really diverse. It is also conveniently located near a lot of night life and local stores."
Recent Alumnus,4,The athletics at Stevenson University are awesome. The varsity sports teams do well for the most part and there is plenty of fan support and school spirit.
College Freshman,4,The professors are very knowledgeable in the material they teach and the courses are constructed in a way that allows each student to get an equal opportunity. There is a decent number of courses offered for a smaller school and the class sizes are great.
College Freshman,4,The campus plans many events which are very fun however the weekends on campus are very boring and many people go home. The professors are very helpful and are willing to work to help you and there are many resources for students on campus.
College Junior,4,I would attend again the students are friendly and the classes create a challenge
College Sophomore,4,Stevenson stresses the fact that education is more important than sports but the athletic facilities at Stevenson are among the best I have seen. The school along with its benefactors pour money into its sports programs regularly.
College Sophomore,4,"Personally I did not connect with many students at the University until my second semester. Several people knew me as the friendly football player who was friends with everyone but I considered many of them acquaintances. It wasn't until my second semester at Stevenson that I felt connected with the school. I guess I had to get used to the swing of college. Once I did, I enjoyed my time at Stevenson University and cannot wait to return for my Sophomore year."
College Sophomore,4,They have a lot of different events to offer to each major
College Sophomore,4,The only thing I absolutely HATE is the unfair A-room/B-room situation.
College Senior,4,The career success coaches are phenomenal!!
Sophomore,2,"Honestly, I know many people who are happy here but it definitely isn't the place for everyone.  The academics here are great but the social scene isn't very engaging.  You have to have connections to find the parties...it gets pretty boring here unless you find a group of friends you really connect with."
College Freshman,2,If you're looking for a school with good Greek life SU is not the school for you. Although there are a few small sororities on campus they are very lowkey and treated as clubs.
College Sophomore,2,My experience with courses and professors at this school okay. Being a transfer student coming into the spring semester you don't really have a good choice when getting into the classes you need. I disliked all of my professors expect for one. Some of the English 152 professor DO NOT have a accurate grading system. It like they look at your essay and pick out of a hat of letter of what grade to give you that week. The class styles are pretty nice. The class sizes are no more than 15-20 on average depending on what class your taking.
College Sophomore,2,This school dedicates AT LEAST 80% of it's income to athletics as if we're a D1 school and we're not. It's very saddening. We have horrible food and mentally challenged working during the semesters to evade tax pay but they hide the mentally challenged during any event or Open House. It's disgusting.
College Senior,2,We don't have much Greek life.
College Freshman,2,School is alright. I am not satisfied. I feel like most of the courses I am taking are a joke. I feel like I will get/ have not gotten anything out of the courses I am taking/took. Food here is awful. Area is unsafe and boring.
College Freshman,2,"Campus events are rare and somewhat boring. Sometimes the food is good, but usually its bad. Apart from the school itself, the students here are very unfriendly and the atmosphere is unwelcoming."
College Freshman,2,I really do not hear about any Greek life on the campus.
College Freshman,2,"Personally, I do not like Stevenson. I feel like I am attending a daycare. There are so many unnecessary rules that do not allow any of the students to grow into responsible adults. Also, the classes are very mediocre. All around I just feel like this school is a joke and not worth the ridiculous amount of money I pay to go here."
College Freshman,2,This is a commuter school.
College Sophomore,2,There are only two sororities on campus that I know of and I think they are mostly together for a sense of community. They don't really throw any parties or things of that nature.
College Sophomore,2,"I use my GI Bill to pay for my education, and it took almost 3 months (almost the whole semester...) for it to go through properly."
College Senior,2,The food do not look fresh even salad and the people are mean sometimes.
College Sophomore,2,"Very little greek life. No Fraternities, and we only have one sorority."
College Sophomore,2,"There are nightlife activities off campus, but you need transportation to get there. If you do not have a car, its very hard to get around."
College Sophomore,2,"We only have one sorority on campus, and no fraternities. I think greek life would really enhance our school."
College Sophomore,2,There is no nightlife around the school.
College Sophomore,2,"It's always windy here, no matter what time of year or what the weather is supposed to be. It makes cold days colder and warm days too cool."
College Sophomore,2,Dead most of the time
College Junior,2,I would like to see more sororities and fraternities on campus. I would like there to be special housing for them. I would also like to see more events.
College Freshman,2,They aren't really present much on campus! I saw them once on club day! 
College Freshman,2,"They give some aid but I randomly ended up have to pay 200 extra dollars for an unknown reason, they give you scholarships and aid but not too much! "
College Sophomore,2,"The only teams we hear about on campus are football and icehockey because they are the newest sports teams on campus and lacrosse because they won states. Other that that, I don't even know when the other sports teams play because the school doesn't broadcast them. If you aren't going to inform students about the sports team, what is the point of having them?"
College Sophomore,2,"For the price of tuition, scholarships are not good. The only people that receive a good amount of scholarship money are the people who play on a sports team and I believe that isn't fair especially since the only winning team is lacrosse. The school neglects to realize that I come from a family where more than one of my siblings have college loans to pay off so I have less money and therefore would benefit from extra scholarship money. I make the grades and still receive little money. Scholarship money doesn't increase, but tuition sure does. It is not reasonable in my opinion. This is part of the reason why the transfer rate at the school is so high. People just can't afford to go here."
College Junior,2,"Weather does not really effect the campus, unless due to snow, in that case all the food places are only open for five hours."
College Freshman,2,Maryland weather will be Maryland weather. It's all over the place all the time and differs from year to year. One winter it might be really warm and the next winter it might be snowing 24/7.
College Junior,2,"Slots are very limited because the campuses are small, and slots are also very narrow and hard to maneuver. You probably want a car though the school is boring on campus."
College Senior,2,"People on campus are terrible at parking and often take up multiple spaces. The spaces closest to the school are very thin and make getting in or out of your car rather difficult. I am always on the Greenspring campus, which is small, so even when you park in the back, it isn't a far walk."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on campus is okay. I do not have a car, but my friend's who do have cars had trouble finding parking spaces every day except during the weekends. Weekend parking was a lot easier because many students leave campus during the weekends."
College Sophomore,2,There are I believe two social sororities and no frats yet but I've heard one is in the works.
College Freshman,2,"The process was easy, but I didn't get anywhere near as much financial aid as I would have liked. I still have a lot in loans."
College Junior,2,The local atmosphere at Stevenson is not always pleasant. Many students run from class straight to their dorms and back. There is not much interaction between school and work. Most students are just counting down the days until graduation.
College Freshman,2,"There are at least two places to use the computer on both campuses with more than enough available computers.
You get $15 worth of printing.
There are two networks to connect to, but there slow if you do not use an Ethernet cord."
College Sophomore,2,"There are some frat parties and greek life, but it's not an extremely large group of people. They do some other activities as well all over campus that can be interesting and fun."
College Sophomore,2,"you only need a car if you always want to go somewhere, no permit costs and ticketing and costs only when permit isn't shown in vehicle window"
College Junior,2,There is no night life most people are studing or in their rooms
College Junior,2,ticketing and fines are given too often and it is difficult to find a parking spot.
College Freshman,2,"There are a couple sororities. I believe the school is in the process of creating a fraternity. I am not into Greek life and I commute, so this does not affect me so much."
College Freshman,2,"The parking spaces at Greenspring are TINY, but you can usually get a spot if you get there a little early. I always avoid this by taking the shuttle."
College Freshman,2,The guys at this school are either from city schools or all-guy private schools. Most of the guys here come with a girlfriend or are scared to talk to girls other than the ones they knew before they came. The lacrosse guys are hot but keep to themselves.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather changes a lot in Maryland all together. And most of the time the Greenspring campus is affected by the weather like rain on any treacherous storm, which means that classes will be affected"
College Junior,2,"They are always loosing forms, and they do not like to provide grant financial aid."
College Freshman,2,They're not as strict because I haven''t had a personal experience and haven't heard anything but they just make sure everything is in control and nothing really occurs major at that at my school
College Freshman,2,"Im not really sure how much apartments are off campus, I live on campus. However, I do know a lot of upperclassmen who have gotten like four people together and live in apartments together and they are like 5-10 minutes away from campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,Parties and clubs are not very accessible if you don't have transportation so they should offer more of these events on campus.
College Senior,2,"Academically Strict, Socially Lenient. Stevenson University has high standards for its graduates. In a way, this makes sense as graduates will ultimately go on to represent the university whether intentionally or not. The schools mission statement can be summed up in one word: professionalism. I gave Stevenson a grade of a C because despite holding high academic and professional standards (""professionalism"", by the way, is incorporated into every class grade; usually between 2% and 10% of your course grade), students are allowed to drink in dorms, ""party"", tailgate, and many events such as art/theater openings serve alcohol (if you are of age, of course). In a way, you can do what you want outside of the classroom as long as it is legal, yet, inside the classroom you are expected, I mean really expected, to act in an honest, attentive, and respectful manner. You are also expected to do some sort of community service, but it is not required. Stevenson U. used to be an all-women's Catholic school and a lot of that legacy is still apart of the school today."
College Sophomore,2,Close to None – The Greek life at Stevenson is very slim we barely have any Greek life at Stevenson.
College Junior,2,"Started Off Good. . .Was Disappointed Later on – When I started off in the Fall of 2009, I had a more positive opinion of Stevenson. The professors are really personable and do their best to try to assist students in their learning. The students are pretty friendly although some were nuisances (as with everywhere you go). The biology program is pretty tough. It's great that tutoring is free, so help is always available. If their isn't a tutor available for that course, they'll make sure to find one for you. 

I think the vision of the school has changed over the few years. I do not like that they've lowered the GPA to get into the school. I think they did that for the student athletes. I think Stevenson is so focused on creating a name for themselves that they are slipping when it comes to focusing on the students. One thing that I really do not like is that tuition keeps going up. It is too darn expensive!! 

The same students get the campus jobs. Which is ridiculous and unfair. Had I forseen the path that Stevenson was going to take, I would have opted for another school.

If you like small classrooms,  personable professor and you have deep pockets, Stevenson might be the school for you."
College Junior,2,"Not Much Going on – Stevenson has two campus locations, one in owings mills (mostly for the business majors) and the greenspring (mostly for science/art majors). The location in Owings Mills have a few restaurants/eateries but that's as far as the fun goes. You'd have to travel (about 20-25mins) to get to the city/Inner Harbor, where it's more lively. Greenspring is a dead zone. It's in a woodsy, wealthy area with really poor reception. There is a mall just a few minutes from the Owings Mills campus but it's in a reconstruction phase so alot of the stores have been closed. One positive about Stevenson is that it's really personable. Everyone is pretty friendly."
College Junior,2,Finding off-campus housing is completely up to you. There are not any Stevenson-affiliated apartment complexes offering deals specified to students.
College Freshman,2,"I wouldn't choose my school because it is very expensive and not worth it because there is no night life. The school is very strict here and it's basically boring. The surrounding city is too risky so many people don't drive out there. A lot of people don't live on campus just for the reason it's boring and nothing to do. I hate it honestly and this is why i'm considering on transferring. A lot of people that go here play sports, work, or go home every weekend which is like a commuter school. On the weekends the parking lot is empty. The clubs here aren't that interesting and they don't have many intramural sports which is disappointing."
College Sophomore,2,Residence Are Taking Over – Students who live on campus take up mist of the parking. They park in the areas that are clearly for commuters and staff. As a commuter it would be better to just catch the campus metro shuttle or walk.
College Sophomore,2,"Dry Campus – The campus is dry, meaning no alcohol is technically allowed on campus regardless of age. Nightlife/clubs are pretty much only in Baltimore City (30 minutes away). Otherwise getting a ride to Towson or whatever is better."
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid process wasn't to bad. I did receive some from the school but I consider myself to still have a high balance every semester. There are no tips that I can give but I'll be happy to receive some.
College Freshman,2,"Not a Big Party School – Stevenson is not a party school, but there is still parties going on campus, you just need to make friends with the people who do throw them. Majority of the school goes to neighboring schools or to parties off campus. Most of the clubs are in Baltimore and I would suggest not taking the bus to the city."
College Freshman,2,"As Stevenson works forward to gain more students, they seems to be accepting everyone. This brings not only many people of different race and religion here, but with many different GPAs.  There has been quite some controversy surrounding the diverse academic population and I see major changes in the acceptance rate to come.  There are many complaints about inner city trouble makers and sooner or later the university will need to reevaluate their decision making process."
College Junior,2,"Living Off Campus – Since I live off campus, I don't get to see first-hand life after hours.  I do have friends, however, and they have said campus life is strict."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking has gotten worse over the years. Now everyone drives themselves to school, and with the building of the two new dorms, it took out half of the freshman parking. So now people are going to be scrambling for parking, and parking where they shouldn't be."
College Student,2,Lots of Leniency – The security on the campus are retired older men. They don't really keep up as much as younger security guards would. This causes some conflicts when there are problems on campus. The outside guest can come whenever the student wants them too. I believe if the security was a lot younger then there wouldn't be as much problems with off campus visitors.
College Freshman,2,Open Houses is when the dining is AMAZING but on a regular basis it's GROSS. Cinnamon mixed in with brownies?... Seriously?... NASTY!
College Sophomore,1,"We don't exactly have Greek life at Stevenson. Instead of real fraternities and sororities, we have Greek clubs that barely have any members."
College Freshman,1,The only greek life on campus is a single sorority and a math fraternity. The only reason I know the frat exists is because of a poster I saw on the wall of a hallway. The sorority is terrible and the girls in it even worse. Its $400 to join and basically its $400 to buy friends who can wear clothes with the same symbol on their shirt as you.
College Freshman,1,"We have one sorority and that's it. No one really likes them because they are snobby and don't really associate with anyone, but themselves. They also do not have a house, it is mostly just a few events here and there."
College Sophomore,1,Terrible nightlife. Nothing close. Only in the city. Don't even bother if you're underage.
College Sophomore,1,Dead nothing exciting except homecoming ever happens on campus
College Sophomore,1,The network acts slow at times because of other people trying to use the wifi
College Junior,1,"I have never heard Stevenson advertise any type of off-campus housing opportunities. In the near future, I would really like to see that happen. A lot of students that I have spoken with would really like to take advantage of the possibility of living off campus, but it is either not offered or well advertised."
College Sophomore,1,Some school activites but not very huge ones. Nights can be boring. There aren't alot of places close to the school.
College Freshman,1,"I hate Stevenson University, there is nothing to do."
College Freshman,1,"I think there are only one or two sororities and fraternities, and they don't even have their own dorms."
College Freshman,1,"No Car, No Fun – There is virtually no nightlife on campus. Most parties in the dorms or off-campus get busted, so all there really is to do us go to the clubs. SU does not allow party buses ect, to pick students up from school and take them to the club, so if you dont have access to a car, you are screwed. There are parties at neighboring schools, but again of you dont have a car you most likely cant go."
College Sophomore,1,"Can They Even Tell – Alcohol is still a drug and the teacher do nothing when a students comes in and say they had a hangover right before class. Some teachers act like students when t comes to drugs use...to the point where some say ""as long as it's natural it's okay."""
College Sophomore,1,Waste of Time and Money – Too much money has gone into giving sports players scholarships they don't deserve. More money has gone into athletics than has gone into more library books and better computer areas.
College Sophomore,1,"The Cost of Items Are to Expensive – Certain item prices should be reduced, so that they are reasonable prices for every student and faulty. ALL food and drinks that are not on available on the meal plan, should be at a lowered for others who may not be able to afford them."
College Freshman,1,"Since Stevenson started construction with building new dorm buildings, there is no where for the students to park. Especially students who live in Susquehanna Hall. We are basically right in front of the construction and the parking spaces are few to none and we have to park all the on the other side of the campus and walk, at night mostly, to our rooms."
College Freshman,1,"Long Walk/Drive – You either have to walk a long way down the hill or take the shuttle to the other campus so if it's bad weather, you're screwed."
College Senior,1,"The academic life at Stevenson is great. The teachers are wonderful and really want you to do well. The downside is there is no fun to be had. It's all work work, and if you don't live on campus .. be prepared to be bored out of your mind."
College Senior,1,There is absolutely no fun nightlife going on at this school. No one has parties and there is nothing to do if you are under age.
College Senior,1,There is limited off-campus housing for students.
College Sophomore,1,"Stevenson is a very small private University made up of no more than 5,000 kids and 95% which live in state. Our security guards play favorites towards the White Boys and aren't tolerant towards Blacks or Gays. I'm white by the way. The faculty and staff are for the most part accepting. The campus is pretty divided between racial groups and sexual orientation. Although the school is private the majority of the students and the area practice Juadism."

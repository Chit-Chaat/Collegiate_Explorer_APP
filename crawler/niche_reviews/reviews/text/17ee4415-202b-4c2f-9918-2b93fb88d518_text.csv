Sophomore,5,Amazing staff and environment. With great well kept buildings and supportive professors. They are helpful to someone of any age that is looking to further their education.
Sophomore,5,I am still attending Labette Community College. I have had no complaints. They’re very helpful and quick to solve any problems that come in the way of the main goal of continuing  your education. Health Science teachers are amazing.
Freshman,5,"Labette Community College offers a wide range of majors and classes to take. The professors take the time to teach the lesson in a way students can understand. Absorbing information the professors teach is easy with the learning styles each one uses. All of my professors either have videos, lectures, hands on activities or have an article or text to read. The prices are not bad at all and many scholarships are offered for students."
Sophomore,5,"Labette Community College is a diverse canpus, and overall it has a great learning and social atmosphere!"

Freshman,5,"I like a smaller school because I feel that I don't get lost in the crowd.  Smaller classes offer more time for the instructor to spend with each student.  Labette is close by, and easy to get around campus. There are four of us friends going together and the support will be welcomed.  I have had friends who went to school here who highly reccomend it."
Junior,5,The facilities are great. The classrooms are very well put together and the teachers are wonderful. There is a good number of classes offered and the graduation rate is good.
Niche User,5,I loved the faculty and the facility! We had great food! Our schedules we're very flexible! I had a great support system!!
Sophomore,5,"I have all the help and resources I need for my classes. I have tutoring and the student success center has help me with grants every semester, laptop rental, textbook scholarship and more. My professors all have had real world experience and know how to convey this to the students. This is also the cheapest college I've see at $102 a credit hour. I will graduated this spring."
Freshman,5,"Amazing programs, excellent administration, and they offer many different programs to help students succeed."
Freshman,5,Love it! Everyone is always willing to help. If you have questions the answers are always available. Have the Cherokee center near Pittsburg helps me because the is closer to home.
Sophomore,5,I loved attending Labette Community College. The staff is always extremely helpful. Labette is also very affordable. They offer small class sizes and excellent professors. I was never disappointed!
College Junior,5,Labette is such a great school to get your basics out of the way and to even take classes you would at a 4-year you can take here for a lot cheaper and more one on one with your teacher. This school has amazing teachers and faculty that will help you with anything and everything.
College Junior,5,"Recognition for my academic achievement countywide, statewide, and nationally."
College Senior,5,It has been great and I love it my class is my family for the next year which makes it very interesting but fun...
College Senior,5,"I am a Physical Therapist Assistant Major and the classes have been what I expected along with the workload.  We have 3 clinicals and got to put in a choice of 3 locations for each and she tried to get us in the facility we wanted but it did not happen like that for everyone.  The facility is amazing and was redone for us to have class in, but there is not windows in the main class room which makes it a little tight and dark feeling at times, but the room is huge which helps."
College Junior,5,"Community Attachments – It's great that LCC is so involved throughout the community with businesses and has programs available for job training and community involvement.  I work for the local hospital and the hospitals employees get their tuition paid for, while LCC provides their students with training at the hospital so their students know what to expect after they graduate."
College Freshman,5,I LOVE LCC – I love my college. LCC does so much to insure we get a good education. The falculty knows what its like to be a struggling college student and they do the best they can to help.
Graduate Student,4,"Labette is a place you can easily call home. It is located in a small town with a big heart. I always feel welcomed and safe. I never feel like I cannot ask for help or that I might be shamed for being me. Their slogan truly says it all, ""All about YOU."""
College Junior,4,I really like the whole atmosphere at LCC!
Recent Alumnus,4,I love my online courses
Recent Alumnus,4,The staff member in charge of this service is great.
College Junior,4,The computer availability is great. There are enough devices for everyone.
College Junior,4,There are a large amount of resources available on campus.
College Junior,4,My major is in athletic training and its what I'd hoped it would be. The classes that I take all correlate with each other in helping with my major. So my schedule is pretty good because its everything that I'm interested in and want to learn and its not too difficult for me.
College Junior,4,The tuition and financial aod process offered at LCC is a hassle but worth it in the end. The expenses aren't easy but the help they give is very useful. The only issue there would be is the pricing of the books but I'm sure that's an issue everywhere
College Junior,4,I think that eventhough I have high fees--there is a new million dollar building for us to learn in.
College Junior,4,I love it. They have top on the line equipment for us to work on. Everything is related to my major.
College Junior,4,I love it..I was able to do all of my pre-requisites online and I start the nursing program in the fall.
College Senior,4,"Our professors are willing to help students at anytime when needed. The small classrooms help with the personal relationships between the students and professors. Many professors will go above and beyond to help a struggling student. I personally like all of the professors that I have had at Labette. Some of them have harder workloads than others, but that is to be expected with the different subjects they teach."
College Senior,4,"The teachers that I have are great and help you with what ever you need.  The campus is small which makes it nice and easy to find your classes.  I am in the Physical Therapist Assistant Program and transfered here after I got accepted so not sure about everything around campus, but so far I really enjoy it.  They are more than willing to let us be in the lab to study and get our skills checks (homework done).  If we have a question get told to feel free to email, call, or stop in the office with an appointment preferably(but during open lab if they are not busy they will come in and answer questions that we have).  In my program it is intense and we have a test in each class each week, but it is manageable and anyone that gets in to the program gets a heads up on what to expect.  But overall it has been enjoyable so far and I hope to enjoy the rest of the year with my class...."
College Senior,4,"No Network Problems – There are several computer labs available for student use at my college. The internet connection has always been fast and reliable. Printing is also always available, but only in black and white, which is disappointing when you have pictures or visual aids to print out for a class."
College Junior,4,I want to become a nurse and plan to finish my practical nursing degree next semester and I have learned that 100% of all nursing graduates from LCC have found jobs working in the nursing feild. The faculty is very motivated to see students do well and are more then happy to be references to those they have taught.
College Junior,4,EASY ONLINE CLASSES – I have taken a few online classes and I have found that the professors who conduct them are just as involved as they would be if on campus. There are simply and direct weekly assignmetns posted that allow us alot of time to finish them.
College Junior,4,I have been attending LCC for about two years now and the financial aid offices are wonderful! The ladies who work in that department have always been very helpful. I have been there many times for questions about my own financial aid and they always have great information for me and they always have time to talk if i have more questions. I dont ever feel rushed and I always get the answers to the questions I ask.
College Freshman,4,"Much Love – I have always had trouble in the ""school"" category. At LCC they've made that Parr of my life easier, and I hate that I can only go for two years. They try their best to make sure we get the most out of our education. Hopefully I can find a university with a level of care as great as LCCs."
College Junior,4,Most all of the faculty and other workers recognize me and speak to me.  I am not treated like a number but like a person.  Some even remember (there is alot of students) my name! It is great place to go to school!
Recent Alumnus,2,"Professors at labette do not challenge students like they should. Most lack common teaching skills. Most  professors are ""by the book"" and do not teach the way I feel is necessary."
Recent Alumnus,1,Do not have access to top resources
College Junior,1,This is the worst financial aid department I've ever had to deal with. They make you jump through so many hoops & make the aid process extremely difficult!

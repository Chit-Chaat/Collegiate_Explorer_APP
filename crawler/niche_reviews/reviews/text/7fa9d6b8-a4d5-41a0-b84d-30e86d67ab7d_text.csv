Senior,5,"Choosing Regent University's online programs was one of the best decisions I've ever made! Initially, I was afraid that being an online student would make me feel disconnected to the school's student life and opportunities. However, Regent has made the experience refreshing, and I have made new friends along the way."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently enrolled in only one online class, but my other classes do have online access to Blackboard.  I used Blackboard at TCC and am familiar with it.  The online class is very well structured and all assignments are very well laid out and deadlines for submission of assignments is explained up front, so there is no confusion.  I prefer to attend class, but will occasionally take an online course."
Sophomore,5,"This is my first semester at Regent University.  I transferred to Regent from Tidewater Community College.  It was an easy transition and everyone there has been very helpful during this transition process.  Student services kept in touch with me and financial aid helped me work out how to pay for college.  The  Professors here, that I have encountered so far, are very helpful and understanding.  I would definitely recommend Regent University to anyone who wants to get a quality education at a Christian college."
Senior,5,Excellent school and the teachers are very good. Helps students in any way that they can and goes above and beyond what they do.
Senior,5,Professors are quick in helping students and understanding when life interferes with school.  Professors are quick to respond and guide students in classes.
Freshman,5,"I just completed my first semester at Regent University. Choosing this college was the best choice I could have made. As a working parent starting college in my forties, the faculty are amazingly supportive of course/life balance."

Junior,5,"My online experience has been great, the professors are very knowledgeable about the courses, they are available when ever you need them.  They interact with the student on a regular bases."
Junior,5,My experience at Regent University has been the best.  Since the first day I enrolled my experience has been nothing but the best.  The staff is so helpful and patient.
Freshman,5,"What I appreciate most about Regent University is that it started out as a graduate school. This fact gives me the confidence that the school knows what they are doing and that I am getting a good education. I also love how while Regent has excellent academics it also has a strong focus on God. This is something that is extremely important to me. It is nice to go to a school where I can be open about my beliefs and also learn more about them. The other fantastic thing about Regent University is the campus. Regent is a small private school, despite this fact it does not feel cramped or like most small schools. Regent has a beautiful spacious campus. The campus has enough people so that there is always someone new to meet, but it also has a hometown feel to it; you'll see a couple of people you know while walking to class. Overall my time at Regent was terrific, especially if you're looking for the best of both worlds."
Junior,5,I haven't experienced online classes yet . but I do have some online classes that I am suppose to take in the fall semester of 2020. so by then I will be able to know for sure if the online classes give me a good experience or not .
Sophomore,5,"It has been so convenient for me to learn online with Regent University, and they provide a very flexible program with 3 different sessions throughout the semester I can choose from"
Sophomore,5,"Christian Based leadership is definitely important to me, and Regent University has that. The professors are always available whenever they can, and some will even respond at night, with the understanding that not all of us have a normal sleep schedule. Their stricter than public college academic standings provides motivation for students to achieve their best."
Freshman,5,Morgan explained the whole admissions process completely and simply. Approval for admission was fast and easy to follow. Great experience so far!
Freshman,5,Easy to follow and detailed. Approval process was smooth. Online technology is great. Website needs to have access to school online clubs
Graduate Student,5,Regent University is number one for the intersection of faith and reason. Every course grounds your faith and enhances reason.
Graduate Student,5,I completed my bachelor's degree and I am currently working on a master's degree in journalism at Regent University online. The technology and internet capabilities are awesome.

Alum,5,Blackboard was fantastic and enable quite a bit of interaction between students and with professors.
Alum,5,I attended Regent only online. The classes were great and I learned a ton. The professors were engaged and responsive. I enjoyed that it is a Christian University without being overbearing on religion.
Senior,5,there’s a few things I like about Regent University. One of them being that when I walk around the campus I feel enormously safe - even at night time. I have also thus far enjoyed my professors and all of the lessons they have taught me (in and out of the classroom). To top it off it is just a completely beautiful campus to walk around in!
Senior,5,I am so happy I transferred to Regent! I am a Regent Royal now and proud to be a Christian Leader and change the World!!!! I wish I would have started at Regent University.  I've been happy ever since I transferred here. God bless you.
Junior,5,I like accessibility the staff make themselves. During my first semester at Regent I had to turn in assignment but was quite unsure if I was doing it properly. In the middle of night I emailed my teacher and he replied and properly walked me through the steps of the assignment.
Junior,5,I wouldn't change a thing! The academics are challenging and the staff are great and really want to do everything in their power to help you succeed!
Junior,5,"I am an online student. I love the student inclusion activities: Wednesday worship services, Chapel on Thursday nights, videos and Cell Groups to join. The Professors are kind and are geniune in their expression towards each student."
Freshman,5,"I love the environment and atmosphere that this Prestigious University emits. The staff and faculty are very welcoming as well as also empathetic. Even the finical aid advisors are also welcoming and empathetic, which is quite rare to see at Private universities  I am part of the Men’s Soccer team here at Regent University and I have never felt closer to people that I've recently just met ever in my life. The wholesomeness and inclusivity feeling this University gives off is simply unprecedented in my opinion. It has made me enjoy the college experience:)"
Sophomore,5,"I love regent university, the community is great and so are the people that go here. there is nothing I would change"
Freshman,5,"The professors really care, the classes are excellent and the support and library resources are top-notch. I am really pleased and think Regent's is an excellent choice for a university."

They always go above and beyond to ensure your experience with Regent University is great.

Sophomore,5,Encouraging and inspiring with a spiritual atmosphere. The school strive for academic performance from the students while giving full attentive support as you go each step of your college courses. The fact that it is a Christian college is just an added bonus for any student whether you are online on campus. The staff is very helpful as well and they are prompt with responses when needed.
Graduate Student,5,"Regent University has been so conscientious and supportive as I entered the enrollment process, they blew away my expectations. They are very proactive to call me, make sure I get all questions answered, guide me through their online portal.  Really 1st class service all the way. I have not started online classes as yet. But my impression is it will be great."
Junior,5,"I love going to regent, all of the professors are super sweet and willing to work with you in order to help you succeed. Some classes can be tough, but the professors are there to help you and it is clear that they care about your wellbeing rather than just teaching for the paycheck"
Senior,5,"Professors are professional, knowledgeable and helpful. Everyone is supportive and wants you to succeed."
Freshman,5,My experience with Regent University has life changing.  The Christian based studies have brought  me closer to God. The way Regent incorporate the Bible with course studies is phenomenal.  You not knly learning the Word of God but applying it to your chosen career and life. After receiving my Batchelor degree here I want to proceed with my Masters. My goal is to obtain my PhD before I turn fifty.
Senior,5,"The teaching staff has a slew of experience that most other colleges and universities do not. This school is not staffed with career academics, but professionals who chose to give back."
Sophomore,5,I love Regent! I feel at home on campus and all of the other students are so friendly. Whenever you walk to class you're pretty much guaranteed to see someone you know on the way. The professors are fantastic and super kind and helpful.
Junior,5,They accepted me quickly I was delighted by that. They had an excellent program that I really wanted to be involved in I was so happy when I finally found out I got I.  I was able to do what I wanted with my future with their help and in a timely fashion. As an adult student I felt welcomed and very proud of my accomplishment in big part to them
Sophomore,5,Regent University offers an excellent academic program in Psychology.  I have been at Regent the past two years and have learned so much in the study of the mind as well as behavioral patterns in different ethnicities and cultures.  Very enlightening and so much fun experience other backgrounds and learn from the professors and other students.
Graduate Student,5,"I have just recently applied to Regent University. That being said, I don't have years of experience with them. However, I would like it to be noted that Regent does an excellent job of communicating as well as being helpful in the process of applying and signing up for classes."
Graduate Student,5,"It is a wonderful university with a research focus.  For both my undergraduate and master's degrees I attended a liberal arts university.  However, I am attending Regent for my doctoral degree.  The focus on research is evident throughout all assignments.  Also, many of the professors have graduated from Ivy League institutions which makes the educational experience robust. It is also a faith-based institution which makes it a great place for those who wish to grow spiritually.  It weaves faith together with reason which gives it an unparalleled focus on ethics.  The staff is extremely helpful and the campus is beautiful.  I have been treated with the utmost respect."
Senior,5,Regent University changed my life. All my professors are very knowledgeable and passionate about teaching. Prepare to do the work because it is rigorous. Everyone here is so caring including the Business Office. I am impressed with the quality of education I have received from this institution.
Graduate Student,5,I am in the application process and the representative is very attentive and professional in her approach.  She knows a lot about Regent University's programs and application process.  I am impressed by Regent's mission and statement of Christian faith.
Junior,5,"I love Regent University! The courses they offer are very interesting and some of the work is very enjoyable. Most of the teachers are very helpful and easy to work with. This school is also faith-based. Because of this, the school has helped me grow in my faith. Overall, it is a wonderful experience!"
Freshman,5,It is a beautiful campus and the people are soooooo wonderful and inclusive!! The tour that I was a part of showed me how I needed to become a part of regents family immediately to better my education. Not many people know about this school but people really should. It is absolutely fantastic here and I would advise any person I encounter to attend.
Junior,5,Regent University is an outstanding institution. I love being surrounded by other Christians as well as getting a quality education. Before transferring to Regent University I really wanted an opportunity to excel and challenge myself spiritually and to have the opportunity to get involved in their Army ROTC program in hopes of commissioning  as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Army. The teachers are friendly and I can tell that they empower students to push pass their comfort zones. The campus is gorgeous and clean. Please please please consider Regent University!
Junior,5,Located conveniently off I-64 in Virginia Beach this university is one of the best in the country.  It's not only a beautiful campus but also one that has the students best at the forefront of all classes.  All the instructors are highly educated.  Most of them have earned doctorate level degrees.  They continually challenge each student to perform above their expectations.
Freshman,5,"I have been amazed by the Christian community and quality of academics at Regent. The professors are incredible leaders and inspire me daily, and the curriculum has pushed me to think for myself."
Senior,5,I attend Regent University remotely; taking online classes. I have been able to receive the quality education expected from a top university at my convenience.  The instructors are well versed in their subjects and willing to assist when needed. The courses are challenging and push students to perform above their current limitations.
Graduate Student,5,"I've been in graduate school online for about a month now and I have nothing but positive reviews.  The application process was tedious, but the admissions department made it very easy for me to understand and complete each step.  As an online student, I was nervous about feeling disconnected, but I was assigned an advising team and counselor right away."
Niche User,5,It is a small and comforting college where everyone is accepted with open arms and brought forths the  highest qwuality education. The college really does put its focus and attention on the students and helping them to succeeed.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love attending this school!!! The teachers are great and the classes are challenging yet fulfilling.
Freshman,5,"I have been at Regent University for only one semester so far, and it has been the best experience of my life. It took no longer than a few weeks to make new friends. The staff, professors, and students are genuine and all willing to help as much as they can. The campus is not big, giving it a more homely sense to it. Campus police are always patrolling the area, making it one of the safest campuses in the U.S."
Niche User,5,They are very responsive to my requests and are willing to do anything to help out an upcoming college student.
Niche User,5,"I have enjoyed the admissions process with Regent University. They have been very helpful, respectful and friendly. This school was recommended to me by a good friend and I am happy that I looked into them. I have not been disappointed."
Graduate Student,5,The region is so beautiful. I am disappointed with the strength of spiritual opportunities in this region. The school is great. The school buildings look like castles.
Sophomore,5,"Regent University is the probably the best Christian University in the United States. The entire faculty is there for almost any and everything! This school cares about your success in and out of school. Whether you are online or on campus, it feels like a huge family!"
Senior,5,"Regent let me transfer 90 hours from other schools towards my degree! With all the transfer credits and their success path, I am able to finish my degree in one year. Also, they have one of the most affordable tuition rates in the nation!"
Sophomore,5,"What I love most about this school is how understanding the professors and staff of the school are. This year started off pretty rough for me, I had a lot of personal losses and went to my first funeral, so you can imagine how hard that can be. During that dark time, my professors not only prayed for me, but they were patient with me in completing my coursework. The main office had the best intentions for me in making sure that I succeeded. I am so thankful to be attending a great school like this."
Junior,5,"I am an online student and have had a great experience with the program, I plan on staying to work on my masters. The professors and the faculty are great and make you feel accepted and important even if you are not on campus."
Alum,5,"As an alumni with my Masters in Counseling, my learning experience was fantastic.  Beautiful campus with very professional staff.  I am an adult learner, age 58 at graduation in 2017.  Would recommend Regent to anyone who is serious about getting a quality education in a Christian atmosphere."
Senior,4,"My academic experience at Regent University has been well-rounded, and has equipped me with the foundational tools needed to become a real-world leader in today's workforce. The professors were [mostly] helpful, and I developed a deeper understanding of Christian life and its positive effects throughout today's society. The school continues to increase its offered degree programs, which has prompted me to consider graduate school. 

It would be great to see more diversity in the school's leadership and in its dynamic marketing."
Freshman,4,"I have only had one class online, but so far it is very easy to understand and I can still communicate with the teacher if I need to. Most of my work is online as it is, even with my in-person classes, so that online aspect is not difficult to acclimate to."
Freshman,4,"So far I find Regent to be an incredibly welcoming and nurturing place. The religious environment is welcoming and not overwhelming. The student body is very diverse, with all different backgrounds and political views. There are students from all over the country, and everyone gets along very well."
Sophomore,4,"Due the pandemic, all students were forced off campus and we had to continue the remainder of the semester online. Although I was not very pleased with the sudden move off campus and going back home, I was pleased with the online classes. I had never taken online classes before, but I will admit that I did not mind the rapid transition. Most of my professors showed grace and mercy through this weird and hectic time and changed due dates for major assignments, altered the syllabus and the grades and such. My professors sent countless emails and made sure to stay in touch and assist with whatever we needed and were open to our comments, questions, and concerns. I liked taking on classes more because I could go back and review and watch the recordings some professors would upload the blackboard website. This was a definite plus but I will also admit there was a lot more work online than there was in the actual class. Regardless, I passed my classes and stayed on top of my assignments."
Freshman,4,"I never took any online classes, but I have heard from my friends who have. They have said that the teachers are knowledgeable and available if they ever needed additional help. The classes were well organized and productive."
Junior,4,"I like that regent university so far has helped so much , by being a new student I have felt very welcome to the school and can't wait to attend in the upcoming months. They have always called me and checked to make sure I felt welcome and the advising office is very good at keeping up with its students and knowing what to help with. I've never had a problem so far with the advising office."
Senior,4,"I like online learning, and i have enjoyed all the classes I have taken online so far. But i give it only four stars are the best way i learn is in person, not through a screen. But because of life I am not able to take ALL on campus classes."
Sophomore,4,"Regent is an amazing school. The professors I engaged with were top of the line, expected high functioning students and still took time to engage with their students. I found no discrepancies between Christianity set forth in scripture and the doctrines held by the faculty and staff in my program. My program was a hybrid (online/on-campus), which turned out to be the perfect fit for me. The professors are involved in the student's lives, in the classroom and outside."
Junior,4,I liked Regent University for it Christian Ethics as it relates to studying how the founding fathers wrote the Constitution and Bill of Rights. With the inalienable rights given to American citizens by birth and those who are Americanized.
Niche User,4,Regent has a gorgeous campus and I have heard many many good things about their academic programs and staff. I look forward to attending the college this coming year
Sophomore,4,Regent has been a great college experience so far. I feel as though my academic writing has improved greatly.
Graduate Student,4,"The professors care a great deal about their students. They largely did an excellent job of conveying course material and doing so in line with the school's mission. 

Students mostly know each other since it's a small school and there is a very tight-knit community. 

I greatly enjoyed my degree classes. Professor William Reddinger is an outsanding lecturer and assigned fascinating readings for our classes. He teaches government the way it ought to be taught."
Senior,4,"I have had nothing but positive experiences from Regent University. I am in my senior year working on completing my undergrad degree in business. The online platform has been amazing! The professors have all been amazing and helpful through anything I have experienced. Although a bit on the pricier side, Regent offers many degree programs that include a Christian prospective."
Graduate Student,4,"Christ-centered education.
Christian professors.
Christian leadership.
Excellent School of Business and Leadership"
Freshman,4,I am an online student from another state. So far everything has gone smooth except for trying to get assistant in the writing lab. That has been a little challenging.
Alum,4,"Amazing experience with both on-campus living, as well as course delivery (both online and on-campus courses). Professors were fantastic and incredibly respectable."
Freshman,4,"The process was easy for admissions. The site for online is easy to maneuver. However, once you are enrolled help is a bit harder to get when attempting to contact them."
Sophomore,4,"Nice campus, roommates, and staff. Could do better for safety in the dorms, but other than that I am satisfied"
Junior,4,"I have a love/hate relationship with my school. I love the close-knit community and the affordability. They offer many online programs. They effectively integrate faith with academics. However, over the past year or so they have added an influx of new students and are not adept at keeping staff organized and consistent enough to help all the students who need attention or direction. I also find their theology a bit too unorthodox for my taste."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great school, although I think that some of the communication could be better. There is a lot of time between phone calls, emails or other such methods of communication that are infrequent, and the professors generally take a while to answer."
Graduate Student,4,"The university is very well kept and the scenery is beautiful. The staff is always very helpful and welcoming. I will say that the application process, interviewing process, and scheduling process for this university is a little bit all over the place. My admissions counselor is wonderful but it seems to be a bit hectic when trying to figure out the next steps in your process."
Alum,4,The small class structures create personalized learning experiences & generate opportunities for professional mentorship from faculty.
Graduate Student,4,"This school is amazing. The teachers are wonderful, it is centrally located to many things and is close to the beach, and the campus is beautiful. There are lots of on campus activities and the students and staff are very nice and helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I am a distance learner and attending Regent U. online has been a great experience. The professors are always available to assist, the classes are incorporated with faith-based learning, which was a defining factor in deciding to attend. Having spiritual support from my advisors, professors, and peers, I always felt the sense of community with my online classes. I am happy with my decision!!!"
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and not too large for walking. I have lived some on campus, but for now I am a distance learning student. The experience varies from professor to professor, and you really are only as involved as you want to be."
Sophomore,4,"To be honest, Regent is good for taking your first step into college. It offers good classes, transferable credit, and very, very good dorms, better dorms than any college I have been to. However, I really wouldn't recommend staying here. They're too strict and too hung up on their morals and religious beliefs. You will not get the full college experience here because there is no party scene, none, and the people here are rats, so keep to yourself. If you come here, get gen eds and some really good credit on your major, and then transfer. If not you will have to do at least six bible classes before graduating; they're required."
Graduate Student,4,"As a graduate student, I find the faculty the main reason to study and remain as a student there. The professora are expert in their fields and are well publihed in their specific subject natter."
Sophomore,4,"Regent University is a great place to become grounded in God’s word. The professors and staff are very nice and help you as much as they can. The campus and the apartments are kept up to par by a really nice maintenance team.  This school was were good over all. While the diversity is very low, they do have great assets that draw people to the school."
Junior,4,What a gift this place has been! The teachers genuinely care about you and desire your success. The staff wants to see you succeed and everyone wants to help prepare you to change the world.
Graduate Student,4,Regent University exhibits a true Christ-like environment.  Everyone from the admissions staff to the financial aid office show that they truly care about you and your well-being as you press toward achieving your education goals.
Sophomore,4,"I am an on-line student, so many of the questions are non-applicable. The on line courses are great, and the professors are very knowledgeable."
Freshman,4,"Great teachers, they will work with you. Classes are a little challenging though.  I enjoy the online program.  Financial aid is a little shakey. They give you the run around and get your hopes up. Their advisory the department is the best.  My advisor is a great help to me. Just so I can talk set my appointments at 7pm cause I get home from work after five. All in all it is a great school."
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far at Regent University has been great. The campus is very beautiful, especially in the fall and spring. Majority of the students there are friendly. The professors at Regent University take their jobs very seriously and they make sure that they provide the best education for students."
Senior,4,"I absolutely loved Regent University, especially when I first enrolled. The students are genuine and want to pour into your life. There are lots of opportunities to get involved to make your experience  full. The school is what you make it, and since it is growing, there are many things you can do to customize your experience."
Senior,4,"I've actually had a really pleasant time at this University. The staff is very helpful, and my classmates are easy to get along with. The professors really do put a lot of effort to make sure that they want their students to pass!"
Niche User,4,The admissions team is very good.  They kept in contact with me through out the process  by email and phone.
Freshman,4,It is a safe and beautiful college full of good Christian values. The greatest part of this college is its teachers. Their teachings are somewhat subpar and their is a desperate need for more activity outside of schools. 
College Senior,4,There is a wide variety of clubs and organizations here to go along with the fraternities and sororities.
College Senior,4,There is a great variety of intramural sports as well as sports clubs.
College Junior,4,I feel welcomed during my phone conversations with the workers at RU.
College Junior,4,I'm not really involved with sports so this doesn't matter to me.
College Senior,4,I have encountered many great professors in my time at Regent University.
College Senior,4,"I'm sure there are issues I'm unaware of, but I feel safe on campus."
College Senior,4,Regent only provides intramural sports.
College Senior,4,Regent University is a great school that cares about the success of the students.
College Senior,4,"I haven't used the career center, however, we do get a weekly newsletter."
College Senior,4,The only Greek that I am aware of is honors clubs.
College Senior,4,Athletics are a part of the school's culture.
College Senior,4,I have been a student at Regent for almost a year. I have enjoyed the experience thus far. I really enjoy the collaborative sessions.
College Freshman,4,"Regent Commons has a full kitchen, living room, bedroom, and bathroom."
Recent Alumnus,4,I am excited for the opportunities that my time at Regent will open up for me.
Recent Alumnus,4,I'm glad to have enrolled at Regent University. Every time I had a question or issue they are ready to help.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Campus security at Regent is top notch.  They have 24 hour security vehicles on campus roads, on foot security guards on

the campus as well as in the dorms round the clock, they have emergency stations with blue lights all over campus in case of

an emergency someone could get help, and also through the internet they inform students of impending weather related

incidents and cancellations to keep the students safe."
Recent Alumnus,4,"They have a career center on campus that will aide students in finding employment, making resumes, and having mock

interviews to prepare a student to what to expect and not be nervous."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I lived on campus for 2 years and had a very positive experience.  I had the same roommate and the second year we were

able to chose the room we wanted.  The rooms are spacious and have a full working kitchen, a full bath and bed and desk, kitchen table and sofa.  The closets are big enough for the amount of people residing and there is plenty of cupboard

space in the kitchen.  The furniture was sturdy yet contemporary, and we had mandatory inspections once a month for

cleanliness."
College Senior,4,"The professors are proficient at their fields. The majority of them make an effort for the service of the student body. I have been presented with conservative economics, but also liberal economics. Student work regularly includes integration of Biblical Scriptures into coursework for the purpose of deepening our faith in Christ, and apply their lessons to contemporary issues. The mission of Regent University is essentially service in the world, and this university offers a traditional liberal arts education with study of the Biblical Scriptures as the cornerstone of undergraduate programs. I have learned much during my study here, and I feel that I am becoming equipped for graduate study."
College Junior,4,Regent University is an accredited school. If one earns a degree from this university it will be valuable. This university also offers great career opportunities. Many of the students who graduated from Regent are now staff members.
College Junior,4,During my first semester at Regent University I stayed inside the dorms. I shared a dorm with three other girls and there was more than enough space. The only thing I did not like about the dorms is that my roommates were very messy and that was an issue being that I am a clean person.
College Junior,4,The Greek students at Regent University are very active in the community.
College Junior,4,Regent University is a great school. The faculty and students are very friendly. The overall environment is absolutely amazing.
Sophomore,2,"My experience at Regent University was very stressful as well as the environment. This is a religious university so the campus is very small and not everyone is who they claim to be. Speaking with academic advisors was hectic and stressful as well. Every time I spoke with an academic advisor I would be told something drastically different about my class schedule or financial situation than the last. Neither staff or advisors were very helpful whenever I had an issue I needed resolved. Nonetheless, I have met some very lovely students who showed me patience, kindness, grace and the true meaning of Christianity. I do not recommend going to Regent unless you want to be at a school that focuses predominantly on Christian studies. I learned a lot in my biblical study classes (because they were required) and it was very enlightening and requires critical thinking. I am grateful for the experience because I believe it made me the strong person I am today."
Niche User,2,"The campus is gorgeous and security is top-notch. the professors, however, are not always so good. one professor, I had refused to help me when I was struggling and told me I had to figure things out for myself."
Recent Alumnus,2,This is not a athletic type school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"community is great, the school is not"
College Sophomore,2,There is no Greek life...
College Freshman,2,We don't have greek life
College Freshman,2,"Theres a lot of homeschooler kids that go here, and its a Christian dry campus... enough said. There isn't a party scene except for the party at the O thats pretty fun"
College Student,2,"I have been here three years and I have to be honest it hasn't been my favorite place. I wish I would have gone somewhere else. If you want people constantly up in your business this school is for you, if you want a ring by spring this school is for you, if you want a campus that has nothing fun to do other then intramural sports, this campus is for you."
College Student,2,"Regent does a good job at keeping the cost down, however there financial aid process is awful. You constantly have to call to get any answers. I honestly think that you could train an animal to do their jobs yet they routinely screw it up. They need to get more competent people that know how to answer the phone, and answer basic questions in a timely manner."
College Student,2,"The Ordinary is basically a running joke on campus. It is expensive and is not anything close to what a college should have. There is no meal plan so most of us get food and make it in the dorm. The food at the Ordinary is okay, but it is definitely not worth the price."
College Senior,2,"My specific major isn't a fully created program yet, so all of the classes are taken from other majors such as the government department, history department, English department, and Spanish department."
Recent Alumnus,2,Honestly all we have is intramurals and only Football gets the most hype. We are definitely not focused on sports here.
College Junior,2,It's bad because the weather is unpredictable. School usually close if the weather is extremely bad
College Junior,2,"Just your general fast food places and chain restaurants.  No cafés, no coffee houses, no mom and pop restaurants."
College Junior,2,"The room I got probably hadn't been decently cleaned since they built it.  Also, there is no community, dead quiet all the time, rather expensive and gloomy, and bleak."
College Junior,2,The rules apply to whom and when the school wants to enforce them and can be bent depending on who you know.
College Freshman,2,There are no varsity sports.
College Sophomore,2,I don't drive so idk.
College Sophomore,2,I don't particularly like the city.
College Sophomore,2,We really don't have many athletics because it's to small and not funded.
College Junior,2,The weather here is completely random. One Friday it was 70 and I was wearing shorts and a T-Shirt. By Saturday evening it was below 30 and I had my winter coat on! And it rains a lot.
College Freshman,2,"White, homeschooled or christian private school education.  Dudes: Overwhelmingly white, handful are hipster christian toolbags, rest are corny as hell, you'd have to see it to fully comprehend it.  Girls:  Pretty much all white, virgins, all about tying the knot before they leave school.  Oh, did I mention everyone here is white?"
College Freshman,2,"Okay so there's no meal plan here, you're guaranteed a kitchen in your room with housing so they expect you to do all the cooking yourselves.  I'm split on this, sometimes I wish I had the option of a meal plan so I could eat my fill more often.  Still, the money saved is worth it.  Doesn't matter anyway, because there is not a dining hall on campus.  Just a little cafe type place called the Ordinary, they actually have a decent variety.  Problem is it's expensive, and not really worth the money anyways."
College Freshman,2,"Other than this crazy old stoner who lives on campus in this big house, there's not much outstandingly different about this school.  I mean, aside from the obvious fact that it's a christian school that bangs out ultra conservative drones like there's no tomorrow.  The word ""Regent"" is defined as: a person appointed to administer a country because the monarch is a minor or is absent or incapacitated.  Wait does that mean they think their students are incapacitated?  In most cases they'd be right."
College Senior,2,Not much to do as far as clubs.  More bar options
College Senior,2,Many different places to eat
College Senior,2,"My classes are online, so weather doesn't matter"
College Senior,2,"All my classes have been online, so I'm not sure."
College Junior,2,"Not much selection for price and food tastes fake - i.e. American cheese, instant potatoes, etc.  No dining after 5, so hard for kids who have classes until then.  Limited fresh fruits and vegetables."
College Junior,2,It changes all the time! I don't understand. We've had 70 degree days in January and then really cold ones in September. Odd weather.
College Junior,2,"I have gotten one scholarship from Regent which is a need based scholarship but no other scholarships stack that well and for a poor kid, parents income don't reflect that they can't give me more money, I need more than that. It frustrating to have to struggle for money each semester and not know if I can even attend the next semester."
College Sophomore,2,"The computer labs have a lot of real basic options, but they are slower than old dial-up.  They don't process information quickly, and unless you get a special clearance code, you cannot burn dvds for class or save information long term.  Wi-Fi on-campus is only slightly better, but the Starbucks down the street is more reliable and speedier."
College Sophomore,2,"The shuttle has odd hours, is rarely on time and only works around campus except on Fridays when it visits Walmart.  It does have the option for special appointments, but I think that costs."
College Junior,2,"Regent University has no athletic teams at this point.  This is the result of being only a graduate level school initially, however, now that they are establishing an undergraduate school as well, I believe that intercollegiate and intramural sports should be part of this transition."
College Sophomore,2,"Regent University is located in Virginia Beach, VA, so I'm sure there are bars/clubs nearby; however, i have yet to meet a single student interested in that sort of thing. There are lots of fun things to do at Regent, but clubbing isn't one of them. The school does not allow drugs, alcohol, or smoking, but thats a good thing. The Sober NIghtlife at Regent is super fun and doesn't destroy your body or your life."
College Freshman,2,depends on what kind of nightlife you want. good clean fun here and no drinking or crazy late nights that keep anyone next door up
College Junior,2,"Getting Around – Transportation options are limited to students with a car or bike. There is hardly any bus service. For an international student, it is best to stay on campus and depend on the international support group with bus service to get off campus."
College Junior,2,"One Spot – One spot, limited options. Cultural days are good."
College Junior,2,"Nothing to Write Home About – Average, slightly out of date computers. The ones in the COMM lab are better than others, but it's best to have your own."
College Junior,2,"Have to Travel for Anything Interesting – In the immediate area around campus, there's very little to do. There are a few good restaurants but even that requires a short drive. There is a dining hall open for dinner in the Student Center. The worthwhile areas are in Norfolk and the oceanfront. Norfolk has the trendier restaurants and bars, oceanfront is a little more kitchsy but obviously great if you're wanting to go to the beach. Both of these locations are approx. 20 minute drives."
Junior,1,I don’t have any thing to say they say it for me. Online instructors are awful. They won’t help you or return your phone calls. Sorry excuse for college.
Junior,1,Horrible college they don’t want to help or work with you. They won’t answer emails or call you. Your just on your own cause they don’t care if you succeed or not. I would not recommend this college to my worst enemy.
Works Here,1,"In real world terrible reputation for low level education. The food on campus is less than dog food. I experienced racism from staff, especially in enrollment from a manager named Heidi Cece. Bad people, bad education."
Niche User,1,"do not take classes online! it is not worth the stress. there is not a whole lot of ""team spirit"".  again, don't take classes online."
Graduate Student,1,"3rd tier education/experience for 1st tier cost. Don't waste your time/money. Doesn't prepare you for the real world, doesn't provider really any tangible job prospect. Frankly, school's reputation outside of Christian circles counts as a MASSIVE minus on your resume. You'll walk away with massive loan debt and spend the rest of your life trying to figure out how to pay them off."
Graduate Student,1,"I am highly unsatisfied with this college and the psychology department here. If you are looking for a roller coaster ride of information and emotions, Regent is the school for you. If you are looking to be mistreated, misinformed, and misguided, Regent is the school for you. If you are looking to get an easy degree with little to now knowledge gained, Regent is the school for you."
Freshman,1,"Bible pounders. Regent claims to welcome all denominations. But if you don’t adhere exactly to their practices and beliefs you are shunned by other students. I am catholic from the north. No one was nice to me since I got here , oexcept the professors. I came in as freshman living in dorm aug 20. I moved out before thanksgiving."
College Senior,1,We do not have Greek Life.
College Junior,1,The housing is not suitedfor studying purposes or recreation.
College Junior,1,there is no greek life in my school for students
College Junior,1,There is no athletics available for students that livee on campus.
College Student,1,"The orientation is typical of what you think it would be for a conservative Christian school. Lame games, and other boring activities will have transfer students wondering if they made the biggest mistake of their lives."
College Student,1,"No frats or sororities. The only Greek life we have is a service fraternity, which is literally the biggest joke on campus."
College Student,1,"No existent. Our ""gym"" is a quad that they decided to put some workout machines in and weights. #onlyregent"
College Student,1,"There is no party scene what so ever. It is a strict Christian school that does not allow drinking or smoking on campus. This dramatically decreases the party scene. The biggest ""party scene"" is Party at the O, which is basically Christian ""dancing"" in the Ordinary, or the cafeteria. Pretty much a joke."
College Sophomore,1,There is no such thing as Greek life at this university. We have tried to get some but its impossible.
College Sophomore,1,"I am thankful that there aren't really any parties. I guess if you want a party, go off campus or find the right people. I appreciate that students respect school and are able to have a good time without alcohol and crazy actions."
College Junior,1,"The times for the shuttle are worthless, you'd do better walking or driving your own vehicle because it's usually late, non-existent, and irregular.  The times are never when any of the classes are scheduled, so it is rather pointless."
College Junior,1,Greek life is almost non-existent unless you are in a military based fraternity.
College Freshman,1,"I tried to apply, but got denied because of previous loan"

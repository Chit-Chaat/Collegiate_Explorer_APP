Freshman,5,Everyone is so nice and helpful. The professors are willing to help and listen. Such a peaceful campus and I actually enjoy living on campus.
Freshman,5,"Great school! The other students and staff are all very friendly and always more than willing to help. No one ever feels left, it feels like a large family."
Freshman,5,"I did not take any classes online, however a few of my friends did, and they all said the classes worked well. Not only were the professors still willing to help out, they said it sometimes the online classes worked better than the in person classes (due to scheduling)."
Junior,5,"I attend the Springfield Campus as a Nursing student.  I transferred from Missouri State University after my Sophomore year.  I have since met lifelong friends, made amazing steps towards my academic goals, and have become more spiritually inclined because of Southwest Baptist University."
Niche User,5,I love this college. There are amazing people at SBU. They make sure you have what you need and they are friendly. The campus isn't that big and you can find your way around easily.
Senior,5,"Southwest Baptist University, is a great college there sports and every student gets to be apart of soemthing"
Niche User,5,"I will be attending Southwest Baptist University in the Fall of 2020, and the campus looks amazing and absolutely love it."
Freshman,5,This University has a lot of caring and helpful people on the campus. They also have very good students and nice amazing staff!
Freshman,5,I feel more at home there and that the teachers really care about their students. They will go out of there way to help you with anything you need.
Junior,5,Southwest Baptist University is a great school that creates an amazing Christian filled environment for its students. The professors are very helpful and are always there whenever you need them. The student body is absolutely amazing! There are many events put on to encourage fun while also building community.
Sophomore,5,I have had an awesome experience so far! I love everything about the school. I wouldn’t recommend changing anything.
Sophomore,5,"Southwest Baptist University offers a good, Christian environment where students are encouraged to work hard and give their very best in their studies."
Alum,5,I thought overall it seems like a good university. The professors for the most part are truly caring and get involved to make sure to help you succeed spiritually and physically in the world around you. I wish there were more options for some majors but they are in the workings of expanding classes! I was Criminal Justice/Psychology double major and those professors were really into what the students wanted and needed to help flourish in their fields!
Niche User,5,"The professors are all extremely kind and get to know their students. The community environment is very good and since it is a smaller university, it is easy to get involved and know your professor personally. Everyone is devoted to helping you learn and expand your faith."
Senior,5,"SBU's people is the best thing about the college. If you want to go to school where your advisor will bring you food when you are sick, the staff will go get dinner with you, and the departments will help prepare you for internships, SBU is the school for you. As a tip though, bring rain boots. :)"
Junior,5,"My experience at SBU has been amazing. The community is absolutely outstanding with some of the most kind and compassionate people I have ever met. The town invests in the students and loves having them there. The Professors are all experts in their field and rather than just testing students actually teach students and make sure they are equipping them for the future.
Overall SBU is a great place and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a college."
Freshman,5,i was blown away by this amazing school!! the student who gave me a tour was so nice! i also got to meet a teacher in the nursing program who was also so nice!
Niche User,5,"I am currently a senior in high school, but I have visited SBU a few times. The atmosphere is wonderful! Everyone is so friendly and is always willing to help in whatever way they can."
Sophomore,5,"The professors are always willing to answer questions and help explain something further. The class sizes are smaller, so the professors are able to better help the students. There are always activities to do and everyone is very inviting. I could not image going to a different college."
Alum,5,I attended the College of Nursing and Health Sciences that is in conjunction with Southwest Baptist University. I felt the education was well organized and what I needed to pass my boards and become the nurse I am today.
Graduate Student,5,"I am currently in the physical therapy program at SBU and I love it! The classes are small enough where I feel like I matter as a student, my professors care for us both inside and outside of the classroom. The campus is beautiful, the student life is awesome. No negative words to say about it!"
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed my first year of college here. I met alot of new people that will be my friends for the rest of my life. I've learned so much in my first year and can't wait to see what comes of the next few years.
Freshman,5,Ssouthwest Baptist University is a great Christian college in a relatively small town.  There is a great community on campus and the teachers really try to invest in your life as a student.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this college. It feels like home, i fell so comfortable with the people. My professors actually care about me and how I am doing in school. The  dorm life is great, I have RA's and RD's that care about me and all the other students."
Junior,5,I love everything about Southwest Baptist University. You walk on campus and automatically feel at home. The faculty is always helpful. I love the sports teams and the camaraderie within the different dorms. The different events and competitions really make it feel like a family.
Niche User,5,"I never expected to feel comfortable being in a small town since I came from a rather large school in Kansas City, MO. I loved the atmosphere and everyone I spoke to was so full of God and they showed it. The eagerness to help each incoming student find the right place was overwhelming. The counselors helped me to receive a lot of financial opportunities and I could really feel god pushing me in the direction of SBU."
Sophomore,5,No matter what your field of study is this college has a great variety to offer. They are very friendly and willing to help you get started and help you get thru your classes.
College Freshman,5,I love living in the dorm I'm in.
College Freshman,5,"The campus feels very safe. I have never been worried about walking alone, even in the dark. The campus security is visible and present."
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus! Being an extreme introvert, the thought of living in a building with so many other females was terrifying, but my RA is so helpful and kind, as are the other girls in my hall."
College Freshman,5,I believe our campus is one of the safest campuses in the nation. I have never felt unsafe or at risk of being assaulted. Our administration is very conscientious of the safety of our campus. Our campus security is always patrolling campus and is just a phone call away when someone needs help. Southwest Baptist University offers counseling to those affected by varying degrees of traumatic events.
College Freshman,5,"I have enjoyed nearly every class I have taken at Southwest Baptist University (SBU). A few of the gen ed classes were not my favorite, but all of y professors have been very kind and knowledgeable. The classes are small enough for students to have a relationship with the professors. The smaller classes also help students to learn better. SBU offers many different courses for students, pertaining to their interests."
College Senior,5,The courses are informative and the level of work fits the classes and specifics for each career choice. The professors are agreeable and try to make the class work for everyone. The students are diverse but relatively understanding. The only complaint that could be offered is that there is really no options for sports or other out of school activities.
College Senior,5,"The career paths are excellent and while the choices are not broad, it helps anyone get a start in a Christ-centered education."
College Student,5,"All of my professors knew me individually and were very helpful if I ever needed anything. You could tell that they cared about what they were teaching and I learned a lot. My largest class had about 20-30 people in it, and my smallest class had seven. I got to know my peers and teachers really well and made a lot of friends."
College Student,5,"I've only been at SBU one semester, but I loved it. My teachers were so informative and helpful and I learned so much and got to live in the best community. I love my school!"
College Sophomore,5,"The staff is amazing, the classes aren't too awful, and the atmosphere is peaceful and reverent. There are plenty of on and off campus activities to keep you busy in addition to the homework load. The food at Mellers is actually pretty good and the dorm rooms are old, but nice."
College Student,5,"I have heard of SO many students getting jobs right after graduating from SBU. For English, there are companies/schools that actually call SBU to see if there are any English majors graduating soon!"
College Student,5,"I have loved almost all of my professors. They're usually very approachable, and they're so easy to ask questions to. I think the professors' main mindset is to help the students succeed...And that's really awesome. The class sizes are usually around 20-30students...The Biology classes I think are the biggest, around 50 or 60 each."
College Student,5,"The security At SBU is very good. Almost all the time, you can see the security vans/trucks patrolling campus. It's a pretty quiet campus, so usually parking tickets are the biggest deal. Curfew is strict for the dorm life, and there's fairly strict visitation allotments, so take from that what you will. All in all, a good security system here."
College Freshman,5,The offer a wide variety of courses and all the professors love their area of teaching and love to help us learn.
College Freshman,5,"They have security patrol vehicles patrolling at all times, and have held meetings about sexual abuse and the ways to avoid those situations, and the services they provide to help those who have been affected by sexual abuse."
College Freshman,5,"I haven't had any problems, nor have any of my friends."
College Sophomore,5,The workload is a little heavy but the teachers are always really helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"Accounting is a very difficult program, but you will start getting job offers your Junior year and will be able to sit for your CPA before you graduate."
College Sophomore,5,"As an accounting major, starting your freshman year you are meeting people from companies you might want to work for, learning how to interview, and taking trips to different accounting firms. They really help out with finding an internship."
College Sophomore,5,"For Accounting, the program has certain requirements. It is best to come in with college credit already done."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is very nice and friendly and the dorms are spacious and clean. The teachers are always willing to help and care about the students.
College Sophomore,5,Friendly people and admin around campus
College Sophomore,5,This campus does not have any problems. We do have security but the campus is safe.
College Sophomore,5,It's easy. As long as you meet the requirements for the major you won't have a problem getting in. We have lots of people available to help
College Sophomore,5,I love my program. Everyone is so nice and helpful
College Sophomore,5,Everyone goes to the games!
College Sophomore,5,"I chose SBU because of their outstanding accounting department. The professors really care, and make sure you're prepared for life after graduation. I plan to be a Certified Public Accountant upon graduation, and have no doubts that I will be well prepared for entering the accounting field. "
College Sophomore,5,SBU is great about placing you in internships related to your major - especially the accounting department. 
College Sophomore,5,"There is a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol, and it is strictly enforced."
College Freshman,5,My workload was not nearly as much as I thought it would be surprisingly. I enjoy having time to myself.
College Sophomore,5,"The teachers are, in most cases, extremely caring. The programs and classes are top notch in my opinion."
College Sophomore,5,"Everything about the academics here are wonderful. The classes are small, the professors care about your grades and will help you any way they can, the professors will always answer questions you have, and the professors grade very fair. It's everything someone would need in a college classroom!"
College Sophomore,5,The programs at SBU are wonderful because the can work with you one on one and help you better understand the concept
Freshman,4,So I do better learning hands on... But the professors are willing to work with me to help get me through.
Sophomore,4,"I am not a fan of online classes, but in the case of COVID, we had no choice. I am an in-class learner, but my professors made sure I did ok with my online schoolwork."
Sophomore,4,"SBU was my top choice when applying to colleges. All of the professors I have had genuinely care, especially those in my major. The campus is small and the buildings are near one another. There are plenty of classes and majors for everybody. The food isn't the greatest, and Bolivar can be a little scary at night, but it is a small town and I always feel safe."
Junior,4,Personally I liked that it is a Christ oriented school. I feel that even though it is partnered with a catholic hospital it still holds true to the Baptist faith.
Junior,4,"I strongly advise this school for women and girls; I've never had any problems with harassment or feeling unsafe on campus, and they have a very serious attitude towards these kinds of harassment! There's much less of the drinking and drug-related problems you find on other campuses, even if that means people use their energy to be a little... odd sometimes."
Alum,4,"Transferred in, felt right away how hard everyone worked to include me. The campus is a great size,  not too far to get to class.  Enjoyed the variety in the cafeteria,  but it closes too early for college,  as working with sports teams sometimes ended up missing dinner deadline. Professors friendly and willing to work with you if you show effort."
Freshman,4,"Southwest Baptist University is a fine school so far. I really enjoy the size and the personal connections you can make with teachers, especially in the business school. I would like to see the overall operations of SBU to be more organized. It can feel at times like once you get there, people in charge don't care as much about helping you since you have already enrolled if that makes sense."
Freshman,4,What I really like about Southwest Baptist University is that class sizes are relatively small; having smaller classes enables the professors to get to know each individual student better and their needs. The faculty and staff are very amiable. The student life is also very diverse and overall pleasant.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at SBU. It has a very homey feel, with small classroom sizes. The teachers are friendly and everyone knows everyone! The downfall is it is in a very small town and there is not much to do or places to get part time work. I made some of the best friends I have ever had at this school, though because we weren't distracted by the busyness of a city and had to make our own fun possible!"
Freshman,4,Fun atmosphere and welcoming people. Importance placed on academics and how they treat diversity was amazing.
Sophomore,4,"Firstly, this university is solid when it comes to providing a Christ-centered education. The professors and staff here are Christ followers whose interest in your life extends beyond the classroom. They will talk with you, pray with you, and laugh with you.  There are however, many downsides to this college. For instance, the financial aid department is incredibly flawed. The campus living, while adequate in terms of living conditions, is both overpriced and designed to screw you over. The requirements to live off campus are just a money-trap for the university. Not only that, but living in the dorms traps you into buying a full meal plan for the university, which essentially is garbage. This is also overpriced  ($7 per meal). These dorms also come with rules and regulations. You are not allowed to bring members of the opposite sex onto the hall EVER except for specified times (once on Friday and once on Saturday), and as a freshman you have to sign a curfew sheet EVERY NIGHT. "
College Freshman,4,This college has exceeded my expectations so far and I couldn't have chose a better place to go.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe and secure on campus and know that there are people I can go to if need be.
College Freshman,4,The people are so amazing and accommodating to whatever needs you have.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very supportive of the sports teams on campus.
College Freshman,4,Everyone here is so great and helpful. I couldn't have asked for a better school.
College Junior,4,They are a little out of date but it's still worth kr
College Junior,4,It's small but the classes prepare you for the real working world. If you want a Christ centered education this is definitely it.
College Freshman,4,"I love the professors I work with within my Exercise Science degree. They are always available to talk to, and I know they want to see me succeed."
College Freshman,4,"The physical therapy program is extremely known around the US, therefore, earning a degree in that field from SBU is extremely valuable!"
College Freshman,4,"Our safety and security do what they can to help prevent any sexual assault, and the rules at my school include that the opposite sex is not allowed in the others dorm room, so I think that is a big factor in the low percentages of sexual assault"
College Freshman,4,"There are some sports such as cross country for the men and women who excel at competition and there are some who don't compete as well such as the football team. We compete in one of the, if not the, toughest conference at the division 2 level, the MIAA."
College Freshman,4,It is great how it is a Christ-centered atmosphere and the professors really go by that in the classroom. The ratio of students to professors is 12:1 which is phenomenal because they actually get to know the students and are able to interact well.
College Sophomore,4,Safety and security are always being extra careful.
College Sophomore,4,They keep up with alumni.
College Freshman,4,everything about the sports and activities are pretty good here.
College Freshman,4,it's a great place and I would tell everyone about the school.
College Freshman,4,Degrees from my school are highly respected and career fields are available.
College Freshman,4,All of the professors are helpful and kind. The class size is very manageable and that makes it easy to seek assistance.
College Freshman,4,"It's quite challenging, but if you are willing to work hard and communicate with your professors you can succeed. The professors have worked very congenially with me when any problems arose. I have relished my time at Southwest Baptist University and I am looking forward to continuing my academic career there."
College Freshman,4,Everything works out for campus housing most people get what they want
College Freshman,4,I don't know anything about it
College Freshman,4,"I don't get involved with the sports because I have no time, but people say theyre good"
College Freshman,4,Southwest Baptist University (SBU) is great about helping students find a career after graduation. Students are able to intern with some off the top businesses in the nation. Many SBU graduates continue into a career with notable companies.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy living on campus. My roommate and I get along great and my dorm is close-knit. Each hall has events throughout the semester to help everyone get to know each other. Most of the dorm rooms are located close to campus within 10 minutes walking distance.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very supportive of our sports teams. We have great facilities for our athletes and they help improve their performance. Nearly everyone on campus has school spirit and loves cheering on our Bearcats!
College Freshman,4,"I love Southwest Baptist University (SBU)! Welcome Week was a great experience that helped me get involved with the school and meet new people. Everyone at SBU is kind and caring. The professors are great and they care about their students on a personal level. The school is a little over an hour from my home, so it is far enough away to give me independence, but close enough to home for me to visit often. If I had to choose a college again, I believe that I would choose SBU."
College Senior,4,"I think that there could be more lights around the school, but otherwise it is pretty good with the measures it has in place. It could also consider an active shooter scenario and prepare teachers and students in the event that something like that may happen."
College Senior,4,"I think that the school is great, the staff are friendly, the courses are appropriate for each level of schooling, and the enviroment is Christ-centered."
College Junior,4,Everyone is great to meet
College Junior,4,Tennis is the best team
College Student,4,I haven't heard of any drug problems.
College Student,4,"Some of the gen eds and graduation requirements are ridiculous, such as Fit and Well, but everything else is great."
College Student,4,"There have been a few mishaps on campus, but security has always been there quickly and I feel very safe on campus. It's lighted well at night and you can always see security driving around."
College Student,4,There are always people looking for interns at campus.
College Freshman,4,I love my school. It is a Christ-Centered environment that pushes me to do my best.
College Sophomore,4,They are really helpful and are willing to set up meetings to explain different scholarships and loans.
College Student,4,"A lot of students here say that Meller's is....Not good. But actually, the food is great! They have SO many options! They always have pizza, a salad bar, like a dozen ice cream flavors, and something yummy the chef makes everyday--it's always different. AND, they have a toaster that looks like a rotisserie. Come on. That's epic right there."
College Freshman,4,It all works very well.
College Freshman,4,Very clean and nice. The rooms are actually nicely sized.
College Freshman,4,"They have very specific rules about the consumption of alcohol as well as drugs. Dorm rules are strict. Consequenses for breaking the rules usually start with fines, but can be as extreme as being kicked out of the school."
College Sophomore,4,I actually have no clue since I do not live off campus.
College Sophomore,4,I really did have a great experience with all of these. There are a lot of jobs offered in town.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are great. I have had a lot of help from them.
College Freshman,4,"Music and Theology are probably the best majors. English majors, however, have the best chance of finding a job after completing a Bachelor's degree."
College Freshman,4,"The guys and girls are generally easy to get along with, modest, and down-to-earth."
College Freshman,4,The people here are awesome. Everything you need is also right where you need it.
College Sophomore,4,"Safety and security officers are constantly driving around, but they mostly just issue parking tickets. Probably due to the fact that there isn't a lot of illegal activity going on around campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I live off campus, so I'm not sure that I'm the most qualified to answer this question but it seems pretty safe to me."
College Sophomore,4,"There is always some kind of activity going on for students, usually involving free food which is great."
Niche User,2,"I spent a semester here and ill be honest, it wasn't my best experience. the faculty and staff are really sweet but the type of students that usually come through this school is far from diverse. as long as you are a closed-minded Christian, you're going to have a hard time finding your place on this campus. the town itself also makes you feel very closed in. unless you're getting a crazy good amount of sports scholarships from this school, do yourself a favour and do not go here."
Niche User,2,When you no longer go here and owe them money and you get in a tight spot and try to contact them about it they are rude and then right before you go to collections they finally get back to you and act completely clueless. Then told me for not wanting to live in mold and roaches that I made a poor choice buying a house. So you are supposed to live in a dump have no kids and barely have any groceries and give all you have to them. Terrible communication from them and they just don't care in helping when you have a tight two or three months. For a Christian School they suck on the Christian way and spirit.
Freshman,2,"Southwest Baptist University is very religious and great community for any student who is a firm believer. The students are always involved in the community around the campus. The sport teams are always working with the community, schools, churches, or stores. The school gives off a polite feel. The teachers are all great people and will you help achieve success in their class."
Freshman,2,"There is hardly anything to do, no Greek life and not enough clubs. My freshman year was awful because there wasn't enough to do and when I would tell someone I was homesick the staff or dorm residents wouldn't even reassure me on anything. Terrible."
Senior,2,"Southwest Baptist University is a perfect school for someone who likes to be surrounded with people that have the same belief as them. If you want support in your walk with Christ this is the school for you. Although, if you stray from the typical Christian you will be ridiculed and looked down upon because you are different. I would like to see the diversity in the SBU community greatly change to more open minded and wider ethnicity. The university is located in a small town and some people may like this but you have to drive 45 min for a decent night out."
College Freshman,2,"All the buildings were built in the 60's at the latest. No insulation, it's either always hot or always cold. The air doesn't work very well. No one knows anyone that lives even right next door to them."
College Freshman,2,"My parents took out a ginormous loan, while I was only able to take out minimal. I didn't get much scholarship money either. So I have a huge debt that both my parents and I will have to pay if I stay here much longer."
College Sophomore,2,There are some fast-food places and a couple sit down diners but that is about it.
College Sophomore,2,Nothing to do around here
College Sophomore,2,"SBU has a strict policy when it comes to allowing students to live off-campus. You must have 90 credit hours, be 21 years old, or married. You can appeal to live off campus, but the appeals process can be a pain if you don't do it properly. "
College Junior,2,"The town of Bolivar is pretty boring. There isn't much to do here. There are some pretty shady neighborhoods here too. But Springfield isn't far away so if you're looking for something to do, that's a good option to consider."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is average not great, but not often bad. However I feel the meal plans are somewhat expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"While the campus has an exceptional Safety & Security program, the on-campus Health Services are sub-par. I went to the on-campus nurse with an extremely sore throat (thinking I had strep throat), and had to wait for an hour and a half, leave to ensure I didn't miss class, and then come back after class, where I waited another hour. After that, I was told that I did not have strep throat. That evening, I visited the CMH Walk-In Clinic and tested positive for strep throat. I will not be using SBU's Health Services for the duration of my educational experience (even though it is free, I still paid for my ""negative"" strep test!)."
College Sophomore,2,"The rules are very clear on drugs and alcohol at SBU.  If you get caught using them, then you get kicked out.  There is a lot of breaking these rules though.  My freshman year, two people got kicked out for using marijuana, but this was only on campus.  There are a lot of parties within the town of Bolivar that are hosted by the student athletes."
College Freshman,2,There are certain requirements you must meet before you can live off campus. There are plenty if apartments available it just depends on how much you want to pay and where you want to live.
College Sophomore,2,"Bolivar a small, rural town, mostly devoid of excitement or interesting attractions."
College Sophomore,2,"The facilities are great. They look nice and are well taken care of. The attendance at games is lacking, there are way too many empty seats. The teams are also not the best but they do try their best."
College Sophomore,2,SBU is in a small town in the middle of Missouri. Cars are the only practical transportation option.
College Sophomore,2,Our dinning commons is called Mellers. All students joke about having Melleriah because the food at our school causes several students to have stomach pain and sickness. The food can be good but most of the time it is less than desirable.
College Senior,1,We have no programs down in Mountain View.
College Sophomore,1,The menus repeat themselves and do not offer a lot of variety. It is expensive for the options given and it is not the best quality. The best thing I have are the flex dollars and that is because I can buy coffee.
College Sophomore,1,You go to a very Baptist college you can assume beliefs are going to be one way.
College Sophomore,1,I have a girlfriend back home because everyone here is ugly
College Sophomore,1,We do not have this
College Sophomore,1,The food at SBU is widely regarded to be rather low-quality and quite expensive.
College Freshman,1,"Unless you're friends with most of the athletes, mainly baseball and football players, and are an upperclassman, there is basically nothing going on in Bolivar. If you have those connections it can be fun, but very rarely. If you do something, the entire school will know soon enough because of its small size. It's worse than high school."
College Freshman,1,"people are not to invloved with sports, i was a little disapointed with our football crowd, grant it we are not that good."
College Freshman,1,The Sports Program Needs to Be Fixed – Southwest Baptist athletics are not one of the better things at our school. Athletes are recruited to a school they might never choose otherwise and don't seem to want to be here or with the people here. Often athletes lose their scholarships and have to leave because of the expense of our school.

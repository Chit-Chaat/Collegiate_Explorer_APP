Junior,5,"I'm a current student studying in the new Bachelors Electrical Engineering program. I decided to enroll for the cheap price and excellent major since it's also ABET accredited. I didn't expect a fancy college when I enrolled. I just wanted a good degree at a good price, and BFIT supplies that. The teacher's are just as knowledgeable as you'd expect from any college. For the price, I recommend this college."
Freshman,5,The community within BFIT are very helpful. Do not be afraid to ask for help all the staff are there to help you what ever they can not matter how small the task is. As long you ask for help you shall receive help.
Alum,5,"Great school, but it was very difficult; so many people dropped out after the first few months.  But, if you’re having difficulties or get stuck in any of your subjects there are people there to help you. I learned a lot! The only con I had was that there are not many women in the program, but sadly that’s common in the engineering field. I was able to get a great job, great pay and now I’m headed to grad school funded by my job’s higher education enrichment program. 

My advice is to go for it and DO NOT give up, it’s worth it! Use the resources at the school, they want you to succeed."
Freshman,5,Teaching staff is there to help you 100% of the time. Class schedules are flexible.  The surrounding area is nice. Plenty of places for lunch. Student life personnel are always around ready to help.
Alum,5,"It's a fine and quiet school placed in the backdrop of Back Bay in Boston. Sure it's not as prestigious as the other schools, but this place compensates that with a working staff that will help you every step of the way. "
College Senior,5,My goal is to pursue PH.D. Degree
College Senior,5,I finished my study at this college and I applied at Umass Boston and I got accepted. But I did pay any amount when I apply in bfit.
College Senior,5,The before I was taking this major at bfit I had no idea how to create android application and any other programming language but after I take my major I learned so many new things from my professor and I really appreciate that.
College Senior,5,I just recently graduate from college with an Associate degree in computer science and my professor helped me a lot whenever I needed.
College Senior,5,"Small School but Complete. It's almost like Fenway Park, the school squeezes as much as they can in the little space that they have to work with.  There isn't a gym, but there's an outdoor basketball court where you can play freely on.  There's plenty of places to sit/read/study in between classes, either in the library, computer labs, outdoor patio seating, nearby restaurants, and more.  There's a big auditorium that is used for talent shows, and various events throughout the year. The library is small but untapped, most people usually go to use the computers there or sit solo with their laptops.  There's a small student center with a tv and pool tables + ping pong tables.  There's also free popcorn day usually once a week also.  Career center is really helpful with school transfers, resume advice, career advice, job hunting help, and more.  And the admissions office is an open door of helpfulness that's readily available.  Along with a academic support center that's headed by the actual faculty that are teaching the classes, and it's free.  It's a small school but it's pretty complete."
College Freshman,5,"Every students in my school are hard working-class people and all have a full time job to provide for there families. They come to school, get the work done, socialize with other class mates and move on about there days.."
Freshman,4,I like the environment as they push students to prepare for a career in their field. The workload is good and I am learning a lot about my major in Computer Technology.
Freshman,4,"Benjamin Franklin Institute is a small school of Engineering and technical skills. The Academic staff is very helpful and encouraging. The school invests in minorities who comes from poor backgrounds. ""No one gets left behind"" is their motto. The school provides all the tools and support necessary for the students to feel accepted and apart of a community. The school was built on a module of fairness and equality by Benjamin Franklin. The school is not very big, but it is organized and its staff are well trained and informed. The professors hold accomplishments of PhD and MD's in their field of expertise. In the technical areas, most teachers have 10+ years of experience in their field of expertise. The school equipment is kept up to date and in good condition. The bathrooms are clean and trash is disposed of accordingly. It is a peaceful and subtle area to learn."
Junior,4,"I am a student at BFIT and it is a great school for Automotive. In terms of affordable and great program, I would rank them number 1 in Massachusetts"
College Senior,4,"Classes are alright but they are tough. Schedules depend on workload, personal lives, performance, etc. it can vary from student to student."
College Senior,4,"Class sizes are small, which allows more one on one time with professors if needed."
College Senior,4,"I felt welcome when I applied, and everyone knows each other because of the small school environment."
College Senior,4,There are really no issues I can come up with. It is a fast paced year with lots of work.
College Senior,4,"It is a challenging school all around, however it is rewarding to know that you worked hard to do your best. You really need to stay on top of things to do well, otherwise you'll fall behind quickly. Hard work and dedication are required, just like any other college."
College Senior,4,I transferred from bfit to Umass Boston and they gave me around 59 out of 70 credit but I can not apply for scholarships and I really need to pay for tution.
College Senior,4,Class is always full with students. Professors are so much friendly
College Senior,4,Three minutes far away from train station.
College Senior,4,the career center helps you a lot. they give you places that need work and places that will pay you more for your service
College Senior,4,there are many opportunities dealing with my major. the work is alot but there is alot of things when dealing with cars. most of my major is hands on and im a hands on kind of person.
College Senior,4,my school always has events to get the student involved. i would choose my school again because of the teachers. the teachers get to know you and don't judge your character
College Senior,4,Career Services are always hosting events to help the students
College Senior,4,The professors are close with the students

College Freshman,4,"Very Good – My experience has been good. I love the flexibility of the class schedules, I am able to work and provide for myself and going to school at the same time. I know that many of my credits will be able to transferred to my next school..."
College Senior,4,"Tuition is the lowest in the city of Boston, but still expensive. Definately worth paying though."
College Senior,2,the school does not offer any online courses
Niche User,1,The school is horrible itself. The college could care less about the students and more about the money they're making. The administration is extremely selfish and they could care less about any questions you have it's almost too notch scam artists
College Senior,1,There is no Post graduate at this school. They specialize in rushing you out the door with an associates degree. They may also do a Bachelor's degree in few sciences-- one of which being Health Information Technology.

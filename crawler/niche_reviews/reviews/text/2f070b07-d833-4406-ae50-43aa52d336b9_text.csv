Freshman,5,I feel fully supported as I prepare to begin online classes. This is a new program that I am excited to be a part of.
Freshman,5,I'm excited to start classes here!  I have several colleagues who have had very positive experiences pursuing a life of ministry through the education offered by LPU.
Sophomore,5,coming to life pacific  has taught me to have faith and believe in god as our creator and father. the students and staff are very kind and always welcoming. they aren't afraid to express themselves and help others in need.
Sophomore,5,going online although it was a hard transition the professors were always very graceful and understanding of circumstances.
Freshman,5,"I have felt so welcomed by the university , the professors truly care about you. The diversity on campus and how nice everyone is has been refreshing amongst all other campus. It stands out among all other Christian University’s."
Sophomore,5,"I like studying at Life Pacific College (now University) for several reasons. It has a great community of students, faculty and staff who create a friendly and caring environment. It is a relatively small school, so you get to know everybody quickly enough. There are several option for Bleachers degree, I chose Human development and psychology course. I feel academically challenged and I can notice my personal growth. I like most of my professors, they are fun,  well educated and qualified.
Campus food is not on the restaurant level, sometimes it is a good idea to go out to eat, but over all I like what I eat on campus. There is also a coffee shop on campus that sells very nice coffee.
Life Pacific has a small but beautiful campus in a good location. It is the most affordable christian university in CA, and I feel very lucky to study here."
Freshman,5,Loved the Christian atmosphere and all of the kind people! The people and administration were very welcoming and kind. It was very easy to talk to the administration and they were always very helpful.
Niche User,5,"Amazing experience. From planning the trip to California, to coming back. The students and teachers were amazing. I felt at peace. Everyone involved with admissions were and are amazingly kind, even through email and text! This college felt like home."
Freshman,5,"I love my teachers and the students in my major (Worship Arts and Media) Our program chair, Steven, is awesome! He really connects with the students and is so encouraging. He even plays Mario Cart with us!"
Senior,5,"Life Pacific has great professors, smaller classrooms, and excellent teaching! Most of the work load is actually relevant to the subject you’re studying and there are a lot of great resources to make sure you’re doing well. One thing I’d change is the pace of the courses. Though it’s intended to challenge you, it can be a bit fast."
Freshman,5,"Life Pacific is a great school to give a biblical understanding to all students regardless of the major chosen. Life Pacific specializes in ministry degrees, and the small campus creates a strong community."
Freshman,5,"I recently finished my first semester at LPC and honestly it has probably been the best time of my life. Everyone, from the professor to the students are the friendliest people youll evermeet and have a passion for serving God and helping other grow."
Junior,5,My first semester was very hard. This college really challenged my faith in a good way and I am glad they did. Something I would like to see changed is more sports!
Sophomore,5,"It is my first year here and I am enjoying the community and class atmosphere. All the professors here are great, truly genuine, and extremely intelligent. They lead exemplary lives of the Christian faith, are encouraging, and gracious. The student body while small, is welcoming and empowering as well. The academic discipline and personal growth you receive at this college is exceptional."
Freshman,5,"I really have liked attending Life Pacific College. I am currently in the Biblical Studies program and all the classes that I have attended are top tier. From the first day of class, all of my professors were intentional about how I was doing, both personally and academically. Since I started less than half a year ago, my life has been radically transformed."
Junior,5,It's incredible time over here! Faculty and staff is super duper accessible and the truly care about your holistic growth.
College Freshman,5,I have yet to see or hear heads or tails of any.
College Freshman,5,It is easy to pay for housing and the housing process is simple because everyone has great camaraderie in addition to always being above and beyond helpful.
College Freshman,5,I'm in the human development and psychology program with a concentration and counseling and this degree. I intend on pursuing a masters after I graduate and this is the best major to prepare me for that.
College Freshman,5,I'm fairly new but the process to get into the housing has been very smooth. The housing is also a wonderful deal! I'm coming from another state and I don't think I'd be able to afford living elsewhere.
College Freshman,5,I'm fairly new but everything leading up to me going to this school has been wonderful. It hasn't been easy but every person staff member has been committed to excellence.
College Freshman,5,"Its a great school, the time I've been there it was amazing. The classes where great. The teachers tought well, and so understanding."
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe and secure on my campus
College Freshman,5,The professors are accommodating and responsive
College Freshman,5,My experience at my school has been the best.
College Freshman,5,"I feel extremely safe on campus. I don't ever have to worry about being assaulted or stolen from because everyone is nice and Christian, and if someone did do that they would probably be expelled."
College Freshman,5,"My college is the best. The students are all nice and encouraging, as well as the professors and staff. The classes are all interesting and I am learning a lot. We pray or do worship in the beginning of class which is the coolest thing ever. The professors actually care about us and pray for us. I love my school."
College Senior,5,Professors are top notch and class sizes are generally small. Getting into the classes that you need is becoming easier because they are adding more.
College Sophomore,5,"We are usually top in line for internships and job placements. The amount of experience we gain through our services and projects puts us up for success! I've already done an internship when I was a freshmen, and our campus gets called frequently looking for students to fulfill their positions."
College Sophomore,5,"Our quality of professors is excellent! They all have expertise in their topics. Our class size is small and conducive for individual growth. The courses offered is tailored to our degree, we don't offer classes that don't pertain to our degrees."
College Sophomore,5,"We have dorms our first year that are absolutely amazing! They come with flat screen TV's and our own bathroom to share with a roommate. For the second years and later we live in the apartments that have a living room, kitchen, dining room, three bedrooms, 1 full bath and 1 half bath. These feel like our own homes. We love them."
College Sophomore,5,"I have an incredible opportunity to be on the east coast campus of this college. Here we are challenged not only academically, but spiritually! I get to put into practice what I learn in the classroom when we are on outreach in our community or serving in a local church. The degree we are gaining is well designed and detailed, and the experience we are gaining is unlike any college around. Each semester we go on missions trips, the one in the fall is domestic. I've been to New York City and Los Angeles. We also go on a spring trip, and I've been to Nicaragua and plan on going to Kenya this year. I have the support of all my professors, administrators, and peers. This school is like no other!"
College Junior,5,I love my experience at LPC!
College Junior,5,It has been a great experience so far!
College Freshman,5,"My over all experience with this college so far has been wonderful! My favorite experiences have been hanging out with friends until late at night and having deep theological conversations with teachers, that is one of the things that make my school unique. The teachers and the community. The teachers really care about their students and make an effort to know what is going on in their lives. The community of the college is so connected and supportive, everyone is encouraging each other to do their best and to strive to be better. I would definitely pick this school if I could have chosen again, because this school is the best fit for me at this point in my life. I can grow and not only live here, but thrive in the classes I am taking."
College Senior,5,It is a Bible College
College Senior,5,"The teachers are great, the curriculum is applicable."
College Senior,5,The major in Strategic Leadership is helpful full of Biblical and personal application
College Freshman,5,Unity as one student body due to devotion in Christ.
College Freshman,5,Atmosphere is loving. Academics is prestigious and excellent.
College Freshman,5,They always keep the students accountable with decisions they may make.
College Sophomore,5,"The drug situation at LIFE PACIFIC is very limited to none. There is almost no pressure to use drugs. Yes, there are people who use drugs but unless one knows that person one would not know about there being drugs on campus."
College Junior,5,"Greek life doesn't rule us- we rule it! Honestly, there may not be a college that doesn't slip the ""Greek Life"" completely. There's always an adventure to find or/& chill areas to hang with friends, but the party scene definitely isn't all up in everybody's grizzy. There's Greek Life but a different kind. LPC is epic all on it's own! What's the point of going through life without remembering half of it??"
College Junior,5,Life has a great drug free campus! Clean and safe!
College Freshman,5,Our school is in a quiet neighborhood with good food choices and small commute access to all that is in the area.
College Freshman,5,"The men and women at our school are incredible. Not only are they attractive, the people here are of the best quality. Their levels of character and kindness and openness are so refreshing."
College Junior,5,"The dorms are located close to everything, as it is a small campus.  Everyone knows each other and acts almost as if part of a huge family.  You won't get lost, and if you wake up late for class, you can still get there within a few minutes."
College Sophomore,5,"I always feel safe on campus, unless I am outside at some odd hour of the night. There are always friendly security guards walking around, making me feel safe and protected."
College Sophomore,5,I would highly recommend living on campus due to the incredible sense of community on campus. Living on campus has helped me to build lifelong friendships!
College Freshman,5,"Because we are a Foursquare denomination college, and Foursquare is a relatively small denomination, there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with internships in a church, our academic offices, and other fields relating to the college."
College Freshman,5,The majors at Life Pacific College are equipping young leaders to be steward of the body of Christ in what ever field they choose to go into.
College Sophomore,5,"The academics of this campus is great. Each student is receiving a strong biblical foundation that will remain with us for the rest of our lives. Personally, my life has been heavily impacted by the knowledge I receive from each of my professors."
College Sophomore,5,We have a small campus but we are all very close and loving towards each other.
Recent Alumnus,5,Most people spend their time in the Hick Center which is where the hang out area is for students. Mostly freshmen hang out in there until the early hours of the morning.
Recent Alumnus,5,There is a great community feel on campus. This is because it is a small campus and everyone is familiar with each other. The athletic center is suffering and does not have much going. The gym floor is new but the weight room is in need of repairs and new equipment.
Recent Alumnus,5,The food is not the best quality and it is very difficult to eat healthy if that is something the person wishes to do. Those wanting to eat healthy will not have very many options and will find themselves eating the same things every day.
Recent Alumnus,5,The wireless network is not very reliable. I do not know the reason for this but sometimes it crashes. the computers are just fine but most people have their own. You can bring your own printer but there is one in the library that will print anything you need for 10 cents per sheet.
Recent Alumnus,5,The teachers are world-class and devoted to helping us learn. They do not force us to believe anything but help us learn to think for ourselves. There is a high value on living in community with one-another. No other school promotes unity amongst the students as much as Life Pacific College.
College Junior,5,The Cafe food is always a good price and if you are a commuter you never have to worry about having to get food anywhere else at the same price. Usually your best bet is to get food on campus and knowing that you are going to get a good healthy meal.
College Junior,5,Our campus is very small and so you never have trouble finding parking or ever having to worry if it is too far from the campus or not. It is always a good distance from anywhere that you need to go to on location.
Freshman,4,"It was great, they had a great learning environment there and lots of friendly people who love God. Some people didn’t like the cafe food, but I always felt that it was good. The professors really care about the students as well and are very helpful."
Freshman,4,I loved how small the campus was and that the teachers are able to invest in each individual student.
Sophomore,4,I love the energy at this school! Everyone is so nice and very helpful. I enjoy the small campus because it allows me to build better connections with others. The classes offered here are awesome and the professors really know their stuff! Overall this school is amazing!
Freshman,4,As a freshman I love the closeness that we have as a community. More often or not people are really nice to everyone they meet
Junior,4,"Really love this school, the faculty is amazing, the class sizes are small and more intimate. You get the opportunity to develop important relationships with professors and the homework load is very heavy. They set you up for success and really care about their students understanding the material. The only thing that is lacking is a stronger community on campus, but other then that this  has transformed my life because of the interaction I get with brilliant scholars."
Freshman,4,"I love my college mostly because of the classes I am taking, and the professor that I get to learn from. My first semester was tough because I came in with presuppositions about what I should be learning and in what amount of time, but I have learned that it takes time to get into your major and even the more upper division classes. I am now learning more contextual things and being able to use the tools my basic classes gave me to excel in my new classes."
College Freshman,4,All our sports are well supported even the professors are supportive.
College Freshman,4,There are many options for careers after graduating
College Freshman,4,I love living on campus
College Freshman,4,"The classes that they do offer are amazing. The class sizes are small and personal, and the professors are empowering and approachable. They don't have a very big range of classes however, because of the small amount of majors."
College Freshman,4,"You will get a job as a pastor, leader, or worship leader, but these may not pay well enough to be your only job."
College Senior,4,"There is a security guard who walks the campus at night. Yes, the campus is small enough for one security guard. Generally, I feel safe outside at night."
College Senior,4,There are many opportunities to get connected and get involved.
College Senior,4,There is a community being built in the dorms at Life Pacific College. It is especially strong on the freshmen/new student floors. It is a nice place to live. Every floor has a microwave and drinking fountain.
College Senior,4,"Life Pacific College is a small school and I love it because of that. For the most part, you know the people you are going to school with. The education experience is great and the knowledge that you acquire is valuable. The level of work is difficult, but it prepares you well for the future. I may or may not apply again if I had a choice. The education and the standard that you are held to are great and I enjoy it. However, the faculty, staff, and students are working on being more of a community and including everyone. The effort is being put forth, but there are still many students that feel disconnected and feel as if they are on the outside."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are relatively nice, there are bunk beds and desks and a closet, with plenty of storage room. The campus life is usually welcoming and it is very convenient to have all of your classes so close to your room."
College Freshman,4,Our school just reintroduced basketball and volleyball and the student support is great! Our teams are very talented and the school spirit is growing a lot.
College Freshman,4,"There are security guards that come and check the buildings every night, and the campus is very tucked away in its own little world. It gives a very secure feel to the campus."
College Freshman,4,Teachers really care about the students and  take time to make sure each student knows the material.
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of networking available on the campus!
College Freshman,4,It is a small school so you get to meet everyone. Everyone gets along in the school including the professors. The courses are challenging but they are worthwhile. It teaches time management and definitely prepares us for a career after graduation.
College Junior,4,I see my degree as valuable toward a future vocation.
College Sophomore,4,The campus is very safe but there has been a recent increase in thefts.
College Sophomore,4,Courses are academically challenging. Community is what you make of it. Dining is good.
College Sophomore,4,You can wake up 2 minutes before class starts and still make it to class on time. The dorms stay as clean as you keep them.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are passionate about students learning and succeeding. The classes are academically stretching, but if you put the effort in you get so much out of them."
College Freshman,4,"I have only had one problem, which was resolved quickly."
College Freshman,4,"Because of being a Christian school, there are certain views that are not accepted by any students (at least, not openly). The racial and ethnic diversity, as well as acceptance of some different views within Christianity is good. Whatever the beliefs and background of a person, they are loved, but not always accepted into the community because of certain standards that we are held to."
College Freshman,4,"The honor code is in place because students at my school have said that they adhere to certain belief and it keeps them on track. It is not very strict, but basically makes things between you and God."
College Senior,4,I am not a part of the on campus
College Sophomore,4,"Many students are considered hipsters. The guys and girls here are great, but they can be pretty immature at times. If you are just talking alone to a member of the opposite sex, many people will automatically jump to the conclusion that you like each other and are either dating or are going to. Other than that they are all great."
College Sophomore,4,"The school has a very strict covenant about certain things such as drugs and alcohol. You can get away with things, but that is if no one knows. The school does not want anyone drinking or doing drugs. They are pretty strict with this, but take everything case by case."
College Sophomore,4,"The library is not very big, but it is a fantastic place to do homework. It is just a fun atmosphere. On campus we have a gym and a workout room. The gym is only open certain hours of the day so that is a downside, but the workout room is open from seven in the morning to two in the morning. The natural beauty of campus is great with plenty of trees and grass to just relax in. There are many different activities that happen on campus. One of my favorite is intramural sports. Most of the time there are a bunch of students there to watch the sports happen and it really creates a community atmosphere in the school. The hangout here is called the Loop and it is pretty nice. There are plenty of couches and outlets (key for college students). There is also a pool table and a coffee shop. Overall it is a very nice and very comfortable campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall the school is wonderful. The professors are fantastic and really do care about the students. They remember your name and they do not just think of you as a number. The uniqueness of this school is how small yet mighty we are. There are not very many students, but we get our name out there and there will be more students coming in next year. I would definitely choose to come to this school if I did it all over again. It is worth being away from home because I learn so much, not just in school but life as well."
College Sophomore,4,"Housing is very great on campus at Life Pacific College. We live in quads with up to eight people. For first year students, their quads have a sponsor and they help integrate students into campus life. The RA's are great and maintain clean floors and friendliness. One emphasis that ResLife has is to have family/quad time once a week. It can be anything that you want, but it is a great break from the regular routine of life and school. ResLife here at Life Pacific College is great!"
College Freshman,4,"Well the campus is not very big, so there is a lot of ride sharing (carpooling). Besides that, we have the bus stop at walking distance and the shopping centers are not very far."
College Sophomore,4,There are many busses that come right to our school making it easy to get places. You can even take the bus to the metro link that is about 9 miles from life pacific campus!
College Junior,4,"The opportunities never cease to amaze me since this is a relatively unknown foursquare college. I received an opportunity last year to be a Professor's TA, along with a handful of other students. At a larger scale university, these opportunities run more scarce- even more competitive wise. Our community is pretty incredible since we all try to integrate every student on our campus into our our own culture of inclusion. It must help that our professors, staff, and faculty truly do try to engage the students in dialogue and actually do care about our well-being in a tangible and motivating manner. It really is an incredible college!"
College Freshman,4,I live in southern Cali my whole life and love it!
College Sophomore,4,"Some of the students that attend Life have a past of drug and alcohol abuse, but as I've said, that is their past. We abide by a strict ""covenant"" that demotes the use of drugs while attending Life Pacific. Sad to say that a few students have a difficulty abiding by that covenant and have been asked to leave as a result, but because we have a great support system at Life Pacific, the coping of this life style change is a little more bare able."
College Sophomore,4,"The guys and girls at Life Pacific are very encouraging; in athletics, academics, spirituality, and in accountability!
There is a little joke about our school; a fake slogan if you will: ""go to Life, get a wife"", and while guys and girls often make that slogan a reality, the people at our school are genuine; and while we do have very attractive students, what is more attractive about them is their compassion, community, and intentionality. Don't get me wrong, people are flawed and everyone is different, but we come together to better each other's flaws and differences."
College Freshman,4,The college is located in beautiful San Dimas. Any City that is in Southern California for the most part has great sunny weather!
College Freshman,4,The facilities are very well kept. There are students workers who work maintenance and do a very good job at maintaining the campus clean and safe.
College Sophomore,4,If you break a covenant or law then you will get punished or kicked out. There are covenant breakers but it is not as bad as most universities. Life students tend to mostly follow the rules.
College Sophomore,4,These are great usually available and ready to print. The internet works the majority of the time.
College Freshman,4,Our dorms are fantastic! They are less than thirty years old and have been maintained very well. I feel comfortable living here.
College Sophomore,4,"San Dimas is a small, quiet town with quite a few interesting areas nearby.  It has some strict traffic enforcement by roaming police, but for the most part is crime-free.  It is close to Los Angeles (~1 hour) which contains all sorts of attractions, activities, cultural events, shopping, and sports/recreation.  Even better is that it is close to Disneyland (~35 min away)."
College Freshman,4,"The administrative staff at LPC are a huge blessing to our school; they make students getting what they want and need out of their time here a high priority. Be it getting an internship or a scholarship, getting into the right courses that will keep them on track, even creating relationship and a lasting bond with the students they see as high priority. Our application process is the same as any other college, but our staff is completely and wholly intentional."
College Freshman,4,"We have a tight nit community at LPC. Yes there are the occasional thefts here and there, but none by the students. There is also a hospital right down the street, so if there is ever an injury or illness that fall upon our student body, we have that resource at our connivence and disposal."
College Sophomore,4,"The men and women of Life Pacific College are exceptional leaders and lovers. Men will open the door for ladies and show treat them like princesses. Respect is given to both the men and women from each other. There are diverse styles among both genders. All the students express themselves freely and are not scared to be who they truly are. More than half of the people, both men and women, play an instrument or sing. Music is of high interest and we have some extremely talented people here on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Within a 2 mile radius, Life Pacific is surrounded by many off campus dining options. A local late night hot spot is a very affordable 24 hour Denny's which student are able to do homework due to their free wifi, receive discounts on all meals and drinks, and enjoy good tasting food. Other spots to enjoy would be, many fast food restaurants (McDonalds, Burger King, Jack In The Box, Taco Bell, Little Caesar's, etc) or sit down restaurants like Chipole, Casa Del Ray, Chili's, In-N-Out, etc)"
College Sophomore,4,The Financial Aid Coordinator on campus strive for students to receive as much money as they can for school. She is the one whom suggested this website to apply for scholarships.
College Junior,4,"Because we are a Bible College , we do not usually like to promote any night life. All 21 and over events are not permitted. But we do have socials on and off Campus that are really great where there are dance parties and game nights."
College Junior,4,None apparent. It is a Christian college and it is rarely happening if at all.
College Junior,4,There is much acceptance and much diversity though the majority is caucasian.
College Junior,4,One thing that sets this school apart is the small population. It brings a unity within the school. Everyone knows one another and is able to fit in.
College Junior,4,"Exciting If You Have Transportation – I'd say that the area and neighborhood is not that exciting. However, if you can find transportation, there are a lot of fun places nearby. Disneyland, hiking trails, raging waters, shopping malls, movie theaters, and the beach, are all within half an hour to an hour of driving distance. That really is not much driving if you live in SoCal."
College Junior,4,"Southern California weather takes a jab at all four seasons. That is what you will receive in this area. During summer it is hot but not too hot. It is perfect for hitting the beaches or going to Disneyland (both of which are nearby). It is pretty cold during the winter but nothing compared to states up north. It rarely snows though it may rain a lot. Big Bear is nearby so you can hit the slopes with your friends on winter break. Overall, I'd say it is great."
College Sophomore,4,"We have multiple choices. We have front line, and short order grill. We also have deli bar, salad bar, and cereal bar."
College Sophomore,4,People Are Unique! The people at LPC are great with a sense of humor to match! You'll find someone you never knew you would have had so much in common with!
College Freshman,2,There is no health center or referred center on campus whatsoever. The safety of the school is excellent with our night security guards and 24/7 staff. I have never felt unsafe on LPC's campus.
College Junior,2,"We have no transportation for students.  If students have a car, they can use it whenever, and they can lone it out, but a majority of the students have to find rides to everything."
College Sophomore,2,"Life Pacific College is full of people with different backgrounds and circumstances. No matter where you come from, who you are, or where you're coming from you will be welcomed at Life Pacific. It is diverse racially, economically, and politically. Although we are a Bible college are beliefs also vary from believing in pre-destination versus free will, etc. Due to the diversity here at Life Pacific College one will get a glimpse of what heaven may look like just by spending some time on campus."
College Sophomore,2,We do not have a nurse or anything on campus but we have a hospital near by.
College Senior,2,"Sober Community – on campus there are various games and sports as well as people gathering for movies and kick backs. off campus there are maybe a few places to go dancing, but you'd have to drive at least 40 minutes, into the city, to hit any real clubs."
Niche User,1,"My experience at Life was mostly enjoyable due to the people I met and professors I had the opportunity to meet. However, I would not allow students to assume a glorious dream of doing ministry at a foursquare church. Those positions are reserved for relatives and those that fit the specific mold."
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene at all. This positively affects the students' experience.
College Junior,1,"Not a real health center, not available all the time, all the advice is to go see a doctor"
College Sophomore,1,"Being a Christian campus devoted to building up leaders in ministry the campus is very strict.  No girls are allowed on guys floors in the dorms and vice versa.  No drug, alcohol, or gambling is permitted for any students on or off campus.  Not allowed to hangout with members of the opposite sex after midnight in the commons.  Not allowed to climb trees.  No loud behavior after 11 in the dorms.  No barefoot walking on campus and a dress code emphasizing modest.  These are not necessarily bad, but are strict."

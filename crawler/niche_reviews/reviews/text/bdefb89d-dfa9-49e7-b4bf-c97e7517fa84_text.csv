Sophomore,5,I loved going to MCC. I loved my teachers and I made friends that I will have for the rest of my life. I got to play basketball and soccer and that was some of the most fun I have had playing sports.
Freshman,5,This school is located in the perfect place. It is so convenient being in the middle of town. MCC offers many great opportunities to lead and serve as a young Christian.
Freshman,5,"When I first heard of Manhattan Christian College I didn't think much of it other than another college. As I looked into it on their website I saw some interest. Their baseball coach contacted me and eventually signed me there to play which is awesome. It's been my dream ever since I was a kid. Although when I made my first trip to Kansas, it was to the college, seven hours away from home. I was almost sure I wanted to go there,  but when I got there everything and everyone was awesome!!! I loved it, how welcomed I felt and just the atmosphere of the college and the town was amazing in itself. Five star all the way!"
College Sophomore,5,Manhattan Christian College is a very safe place to go to school. The administration does a good job in protecting our students and giving us the environment we deserve.
College Sophomore,5,Manhattan Christian College just broke ground on the school's first ever athletic facility. We've been competitive for years - winning 10 national championships and it's exciting that we are finally investing in our athletic program beyond our coaches efforts.
College Junior,5,"Athletics at MCC are awesome. Yes we are always in need of a few more bodies to come out and play on the Women's Soccer team or Basketball team, but it always ends up okay! I play both and the coaches are so involved in not only your sports life, but personal life as well. Grades come first and they make sure of that. For MCC if it is a home game or an away game that is in a reasonable driving distance almost everyone comes out to support our athletes! My freshman year the girls and the guys soccer team alone with the volleyball team made it to Nationals and got to travel to Kissimee, Florida! It was one of the best, and hottest experiences! Not only was it awesome, but that wasn't the first time any of the teams had made it to nationals! Now, I don't have all the statistics, but I know that guys have been there at least 19 times straight!"
College Junior,5,"I absolutely love MCC! It's a small college, but KSU is right across the street and offers a duel degree program and advisers work well with each student to figure out the best path for their life. Also, it is expensive especially if you're paying for college by yourself, so the adviser help with finding grants, loans, and other types of scholarships! 

MCC has many extracurricular activities to choose from as well. So not only to I get to study what I love, I also get to be involved in the sport that I love, along with clubs that best for my personality. 

 

Just one example of why I love MCC: we are a Christian College so I have that right to study what I believe as well as non-religion classes, but that also means that when one studen is in trouble or is going through a rough time the community at MCC goes out of their way to be there for that person. My freshmen year, a guy had lost his grandmother and the student government bought him a plane ticket to make it back for the funeral. He didn't have the money and with how far away he lived no one could come get him. As a student government member now I will never forget how much that small act meant to him! And that's why I love MCC."
College Freshman,5,The professors here at Manhattan Christian College are the best
College Sophomore,5,The workload is very workable while still providing a very stable education.
College Sophomore,5,People get kicked out if they use drugs at all.
College Junior,5,"They have always helped me as much as they possibly can, and it's helped my stress level lower a ton! Some of the online billing is confusing, but overall that department does a very nice job."
College Junior,5,"There are tons of options surrounding the campus and they're all low-price. Many of them a fast because they are fast food restaurants, so there's not too much of a wait."
College Freshman,5,"Manhattan Christian College is a private Christian school. They have many policies to abide by such as, no drinking alcohol, no doing drugs, no smoking or use of tobacco, and no cheating. We sign an integrity contract agreeing to these things and more. I love having these rules enforced, it helps to keep me from doing the wrong things."
College Freshman,5,There is very good dining at a good cost on off campus dining.
College Freshman,5,No one on my campus does drugs that I am aware of.
College Freshman,5,To get this grade you would have to work very hard and really take time with your homework.
College Freshman,5,Manhattan Christian College's campus life is a great experience. There is a strong community there and always fun activities. It is a great place to meet new people and spend a few years while studying for a degree.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe in this environment. The dorms are locked at night and their is very little crime. Everything on campus is very close and very secure.
College Sophomore,5,I've never felt unsafe on campus. It's well lit and the guys on campus are more than willing to walk a girl anywhere if she feels unsafe.
College Sophomore,5,Night Time – Living on campus night life is great! There's always something going on with the dorms.
Sophomore,4,I love Manhattan Christian College and the professors are amazing and invested in you! The community there is amazing and every one is nice and is personable with you. There are many opportunities at Manhattan Christian college also. There are music teams you can be on as well as student life planning and teams like traditions. There are a lot of things to get involved in also throughout K-State too because they are right across the street!
Freshman,4,"Manhattan Christian College is a great place to go for your ministry degree. It is also a small environment that you can get close to the people around you. This is the kind of school that you would go to, deeper your faith and deeper friendship"
Sophomore,4,"MCC is a small school of about 300 students. Because of the small numbers it has a family like atmosphere. The professors are amazing and really care about each student. The men's dorms are very old and need to be updated. The food isn't great, but it is still an amazing school."
Freshman,4,So far its been everything I hoped for.  Cant wait to see exactly what this first year has in store for me.
College Sophomore,4,Our professors do a good job of working with students. Our average class sizes are around 16-1 and each professor knows who their students are.
College Sophomore,4,MCC provides students with opportunities to apply for internships all over the united states. There are graduate programs set up with a variety of churches and organizations in which someone can earn their masters while gaining full-time job experience.
College Sophomore,4,The residence halls on campus do their job. They allow our resident students a place to lay their heads at night and feel safe.
College Sophomore,4,"I believe that Manhattan Christian College provides me with the opportunities, both athletically and academically, to get where I need to in life."
College Junior,4,"So a little bit about the girls dorm, Kenoyer, is better than dorms I think! It's set up more like an apartment and has 3 floors with 3 doors on each. You walk in the door and there is a living room that has 5 more doors, one of those doors is for a bathroom that includes 2 showers, 2 sinks, 2 toilets, and the other 4 doors are bedrooms. We call this set up suites. Each suite also has an RA and in the lobby of our dorm is an apartment for the dorm parents. It is a great facility and I'm staying in it again for my 3rd year so I can be an RA!"
College Freshman,4,Here at Manhattan Christian College students have a good chance of going into ministry
College Freshman,4,"The school is small which I like and there are a good amount of opportunities to make friends. Also, the professors are awesome."
College Sophomore,4,I love my close nit college and close nit relationships 
College Sophomore,4,The relationships at this school are very close and tight nit 
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the women here are very attractive and intelligent. They want the man to pursue the relationship, so flirting is unspokenly kept to a minimum."
College Sophomore,4,I'm currently interning in the Business Office as part of my scholarship requirements. They're giving me big projects that are beneficial to the school as a whole.
College Sophomore,4,Manhattan is a very pretty city.
College Sophomore,4,Our teams are pretty good.
College Junior,4,I do enjoy living off-campus. The only complaint I have is the parking for classes is not very good and often have to walk a far distance.  
College Freshman,4,"I had little trouble going through the financial aid process. Once I did my part, MCC took care of the rest and I was very pleased with the results."
College Junior,4,"I would say our campus is fairly safe. It's kind of scary at times because people walk through our parking lots after going to the bars, but nothing to be worried about."
College Freshman,2,"I do not know that MCC actually has campus police. There are not many measures taken to ensure safety, though I do not feel that any of the students or faculty are threatening. The only safety threat I see is non-students who come to campus, sometimes on heavy drugs. MCC is also located right next to Aggieville, a place in downtown Manhattan where many of the KSU students go to get drunk on weekends. We sometimes have drunk people walk through campus because of this, and there is little security other than what the faculty can provide."
College Sophomore,2,"For the first year, it's phenomenal if you take the time to apply but after your first year, it goes downhill and the college is not too great with offering many scholarships and they're not good with anything financially to be honest."
College Sophomore,2,"Since it is a private college, there isn't many sports available and the ones we do have, have a low attendance since the team performance is never spectacular."
College Freshman,2,Slightly Diverse – There isn't much diversity but there are a few different races supported. Everyone there is Christian so it is nice to be around people with the same mindset.
Alum,1,"Very expensive, even with scholarships, loans, and federal aid. There are a select few professors that are qualified and effective professors. Many classes are so easy to the point of learning nothing, or meaninglessly complex for the sake of being complex and not for the sake of learning. Sexism, racism, and queeraphobia thrives in every part of MCC. Students can be kicked out for getting pregnant outside of marriage, the curfew and off-campus alcohol restrictions are ridiculous for adults paying to go to school. Sexual assault or harassment of any kind will not be taken seriously. 2 years of a full meal plan are required with little to no options for vegetarian/vegan diets.  Money is poured into sports programs to bring in students that do not fit into their Christian lifestyle and end up leaving or being forced to leave, after paying tuition. I am thankful only for a select few professors and friends that I met, but my education was mediocre, expensive, and harmful."
Niche User,1,"If you're looking for employment here, you better be an extrovert! Got an interview and was treated like a child. What does what was your favorite Christmas gift as a child and what is your dream car have to do with employment? All other questions were the same. Afterward, you're shoved out the back door with a the parking lot is that-a-way. Well those of us that are last will be first in heaven. Right?"
College Sophomore,1,At Manhattan Christian College there is no greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"MCC is mostly full of Christians but there are a few who come to the school for easier classes or just sports. We don't have many races, it's mostly populated with Caucasians but everyone is extremely accepting.  You can definitely get in a heated conversation over politics with some people at the school, they are mostly republicans."
College Sophomore,1,"No Greek Life. I would love to have a Greek life, but I don't know if there are enough students."

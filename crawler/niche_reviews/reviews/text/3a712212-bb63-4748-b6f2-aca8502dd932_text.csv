Alum,5,"Winona State University (WSU) is situated in a charming town that is engulfed by sweeping bluffs and the renowned Mississippi River. The university achieves inclusivity by hosting many university and outreach events such as STEM Fall Festival, Game Night, and COSEC Corner to name a few. Students will find the staff at WSU midwest personable as well as supportive. WSU is a place that feels like home with people that feel like family."
Alum,5,"WSU professors make learning accessible to everyone. As they are both accommodating and available for additional help, you are able to personalize your learning experience unlike other big universities. In fact, you will find most students attend office hours even just to chat with their professors! Another strength of WSU is the unique research opportunities offered to STEM majors. With great technologies both on and off campus, students get the hands-on experience other university students would not see until graduate school."
Sophomore,5,"Winona State is the best school ever! It has great education, resources, professors, opportunities and all! Highly recommend attending here if you are looking for fun experience and a good college."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I give Winona a 5 star rating because they are doing the best they can due to the circumstances. As much as I personally do not prefer online classes I know they are doing the best they can to make sure I still receive the best education possible and they wanna see all students succeed."
Freshman,5,"I really liked the professors, I would like to see changes in the cafeteria such as a fruit bar and or more cold veggies, just more snack healthy options"
Sophomore,5,I am currently a sophomore going to be a junior in the fall and even though i am just finishing my prerequisite for my major winona has provided me with tons of information and has brought me great connection with friends and faculty of the school. The small town feel allows me to know my neighbor and the small classes allows me to get to know my professors on a personal level that i wouldn't be able to in a bigger lecture room
Freshman,5,The university is overwhelmingly beautiful and the professors strive to make the school inviting and welcoming towards all students.
Alum,5,"I loved Winona State University's beautiful campus! I also loved that there were no streets going through campus. The campus is in a great location in town, nesstled between downtown and a beautiful lake with a paved walking path around it. The stunning rolling hill bluffs around the city are a sight to see when the leaves change in fall! Don't forget to visit Garvin Heights when you first roll in town town and enjoy a breath taking overlook of Winona, the river, and the surrounding hills!"
Niche User,5,I love it here.  The education buildings are brand new.  The teachers are amazing and work so hard to help improve students.  The dorms are nice and the location is amazing for outdoor climbing and the trails are really fun.
Sophomore,5,"The class sizes are great, as well as the professors. The student body is pleasant. The clubs are great. The town and surrounding area are very college-friendly."
Sophomore,5,Winona's surrounding community is extremely inviting. The town loves having the college there and welcomes the students back with open arms in the fall. The bluffs and the lake located a couple miles from campus are beautiful and make for fun adventures all throughout the year. The campus is pretty small with all buildings being within walking distance. I love Winona and can't wait to get back in the fall.
Freshman,5,"WSU is extremely welcoming and they go out of their way to make you feel at home. They make the transition easy and provide resources for all types of issues. The access services are amazing as well, they will work with you to accommodate to your needs."

Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy going to school here at Winona State University, not just because the campus is beautiful, a good sized school, but because of how much it feels like a community. You get to know your peers really well because of the smaller class sizes. All the professors have been extremely helpful. Winona in general is just a great town and there is so much to do outdoors, including hiking Garvin Heights and Sugar Loaf, as well as go paddle boarding, kayaking, canoeing, ice skating on Lake Winona."
Alum,5,Winona State University has provided me with a lot of useful skills to help me pursue my career in Psychology and Therapy. The Professors are great and they do genuinely care about their students success.
Niche User,5,I will be attending Winona state next year and everything I have seen/heard about it has been awesome.
Freshman,5,"It's a perfect size school, not too big, not too small, so It feels like a big community. The class sizes are good. There are a lot of resources on campus that will help me succeed such as the library, writing center, and tutoring seccions. Moreover, when you need a break from school, there is a lot to do around town."
Freshman,5,The staff is so well connected to the students and they care about our success. The environment at Winona State makes me feel at home when home is so far away.
Senior,5,I am taking courses through Winona State off campus at an elementary school. I have had wonderful experiences with my professors and academics within my major. I do not have experience with any on-campus activity.
Sophomore,5,"Winona State University has a beautiful campus that is close together within Winona. The professors are quite enthusiastic about education there. The science and engineering department is especially excellent, as it provides the students with great learning opportunities."
Junior,5,"The HERS (Health Education and Rehabilitative Services) department at Winona State is focused on learning and the students' success. Not only do the professors teach the material, but they relate it directly to our future occupations and are compassionate at what they do."
Freshman,5,"I love the small town feel and how beautiful the campus is. I found life long friends, and I enjoy my classes. I have not experienced a bad professor yet! They are all super approachable and easy to get along with."
Senior,5,The professors seem to care about the students and their success. The area is great and provides a lot of outdoor activities.
Freshman,5,"It is one of the most beautiful campuses that I have ever seen. Especially in the fall, it is so pretty. They are also so many places to do homework that cater to everyone, quiet and louder places. The professors are reasonable and really want you to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"As an international student,I remember being anxious about the thought of facing culture shock and not being able to fully immerse myself in the western culture.But WSU's friendly and welcoming environment made me feel welcomed and not far away from home.My WSU experience has been tremendous even if it has been less than two years.It’s given me the chance to connect and get to know a lot of people from different backgrounds that I can say will last a lifetime.It’s also challenged me in ways which allowed me to let go and grow and become a stronger individual.For that I'm really grateful and pleased of my decision.The things that I would want change is WSU should have more travel study opportunities and access to facilities and services which are more affordable which could later be one of the factors that hinder students from completing their education at WSU."
Junior,5,"I am very pleased with my experience at Winona State University thus far. Being a medium sized school, I am very pleased to have had the opportunities to really get to know my professors on a first name basis. I feel that my education is really applicable to my future goals and that I will be very prepared for my future career."
Freshman,5,"I love Winona State! It is the perfect size for me, an outgoing girl that doesn’t like to get lost in a huge crowd. I would like to see the professors getting more involved with on campus events."
Alum,5,"I attended  the Winona State University Rochester campus for the RN to BSN program.  Academic program was excellent, close to home, affordable, great location, Instructors were great. I did not live on campus nor really eat on campus."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Winona State University. The people here are superb and the professors are awesome. There are also so many things to do around Winona, things like hiking, kayaking, biking, etc. Not to mention how beautiful the city gets in the fall with all of the changing leaves. My only complaint is the parking at school, there is literally no place to park."
Niche User,5,"My daughter is interested in the teaching field.  The new Education Village to open at Winona State University sometime in 2019 looks fabulous.  The campus has so much to offer in general.  We love that WSU is not too large, but large enough to have lots to do on campus & in the town of Winona itself.  The forested bluffs are absolutely breathtaking in the fall.  The female to male ratio at WSU is roughly about 61.4 to 38.6% which we also like.  Everyone seems quite friendly on campus & in town, in general.  The college's administration is willing to answer any & all questions that people might have about attending WSU.  We loved the college, & we are definitely considering it as a top contender for her college education!"
Niche User,5,"I loved the homey feel when I came to campus.  The campus is great.  I absolutely loved my dorm room - spacious, modern furnishings, secure building & fun activities.  Lots of fun activities to do on campus."
Niche User,5,"I took a tour recently.  It is a beautiful area and is a great school for academics, clubs, dorms, food, and workout facilities.  I have toured a lot of schools recently and this by far has been my favorite!  It has so many newer and up-to-date buildings/dorms on campus.  I love it.  I can't wait to be a student here!"
Senior,5,"Winona State University has been one of the best decisions I have made in my life. While the city of Winona itself has breathtaking nature surroundings all four seasons, there is much more that makes it a wonderful place to go to school. The campus is a very comfortable size that makes it easy to get to classes in a very manageable amount of time and the amount of students on campus feels just right - not too small but not too big, just right where you see people enough to get to know them well while also always having the opportunity to meet new people. The education I have received has been phenomenal  in the Education program provided, my teachers overall have been up-to-date and passionate, and my advisors have always gone above and beyond to help me succeed. Finally, the community around is amazing with endless opportunities to get involved on and off campus, to find people with common interests as well as clubs where people can try new things."
Freshman,5,"It is a very beautiful campus, with friendly people attending. The courses are rigorous and interesting and I feel that I am preparing for real life beyond college."
Works Here,5,"Winona State University is a gem in the southeast Minnesota. The quality of engaged professors, the calmness of the town, and the beauty of the place (the mighty Mississippi, the overlooking bluffs and the lakes) are simply breathtaking. College of Business where I primarily work is an absolutely amazing college, both academically as well as in terms of programs. College of Business is a distinct college for innovative engaged teaching and learning with an engagement brand, which is captured by its tagline of #CreateYourMore."
Alum,5,"Small, compact university campus. Nice facilities and good faculty. Lots of student organizations and clubs to join. New fitness facility built within the past 5 years."
Sophomore,5,"I liked the small campus at Winona, everyone is very friendly and there is a lot to do. It is also a very beautiful area. I hope definately recommend Winona state University to others."
Alum,5,I fell in love with this school as soon as I started my tour. The campus is small which is what I was looking for and it felt like home. You really got to know the people in your classes and I have met some of my best friends here. The professors here really want you to succeed and are always willing to help.
Freshman,5,"Winona state is a wonderful university. The school's atmosphere is warm and welcoming. When I first began attending Winona state university, I must admit that I was scared, being in a new country with no support system, it was quite hard and difficult at first, but as time went on I was able to call this place my second home. The people that work here and the students that attend Winona state university is part of the reason why this campus is worth attending."
Senior,5,"Great University, very helpful and friendly atmosphere. 

The staff and professors are accommodating and caring, and this campus is very unique in that everything is very close and in walking distance. It's easy to live in this area and go to school here without a car, and the atmosphere of the town and campus is inviting.

I would also highly recommend this school if you are interested in a Green campus, Winona State works very hard to provide an environmentally friendly campus."
College Junior,5,"I believe that Winona State University has wonderful Campus Security! They are awesome at making everyone feel safe and protected. They are easily accessible too, which is a definite plus! I believe that, overall, Winona State University does a great job!"
College Junior,5,"It is wonderful. Winona State University is extremely helpful and they sure do know there stuff! Overall, I am very pleased!"
College Junior,5,Winona State University -- Rochester has been just fabulous! I was just recently accepted and already am in love with the school and all it has to offer. I love that I am able to be considered a University student but not have to go to the main Winona State University Campus. I love this counselors and professors. Everyone has been just wonderful!
College Junior,5,They help so much on getting jobs and helping the students be successful.
College Junior,5,The varsity sports and the intramural sports are a lot of fun and a lot of people are involved in them!
College Junior,5,I love Winona State University! They have amazing professors and work hard to help you achieve your dreams!
College Sophomore,5,Professors are very enthusiastic and involved. There are a variety of options for classes and the class sizes are small and authentic.
College Sophomore,5,I play volleyball on the team at my school. I love it.
College Sophomore,5,I love where I am at. It is my home away from home.
College Sophomore,5,"It's a wonderful town with a loving community, bad things usually never happen."
College Freshman,5,We are ranked number 19 as one of the most safest schools in the nation
College Freshman,5,Everyone is super friendly on and off campus! The small school environment makes you feel like you have a home away from home!
College Freshman,5,I always knew i would go to collage and now that I'm here and studying what i want to its better then i could of imagined.
College Senior,5,"I really enjoyed my time at Winona State. I would not have taken it back for anything! I have made life-long friends and connections that will follow me for the rest of my life. I worked really hard within my major, and I already have people contacting me for jobs for when I graduate! I would have done this again no questions asked!"
College Freshman,5,"Winona State has been amazing so far. Small town, not too far away from home. So far I have made pretty great friends. Getting around campus is pretty easy because its a small campus and it comes in handy. I love it here and I think I made a great choice to come here. Also the nursing program here is one of the best which is great because that is my major."
College Freshman,5,"The school designates a whole week to get new coming freshman used to life on a college campus. I really enjoy the activities, and respect the amount of time and effort they put in to make an easy transition for us. The campus is extremely beautiful, and near multiple parks in the city. I love how the campus staff and students promote the support of local businesses,it shows they care about the town and acknowledge we are a big part in the town's economy. Overall my favorite part about WSU is the scenery. It is at the bottom of the Mississippi river valley so you have bluffs on both sides, and it is nothing more than gorgeous."
College Sophomore,5,"With sophomore year right around the corner, I can not wait to get back to Winona State University! My overall experience so far has been a positive one. In my opinion, it is the perfect college because there is lots to do such as hiking the bluffs, hanging out at a cafe, or going to a sporting event, but it is still in a small enough city where I feel safe. Winona's academic programs also push students to do their best. If I could do it all over, I would definitely pick Winona State all over again."
Freshman,4,I love it here! Everyone is very helpful and patient! I have not had a problem at all. The campus is beautiful and a perfect size!
Freshman,4,Professors are very helpful and quick at responding to emails. Technological difficulties are  dealt with well.
Freshman,4,"I am really enjoying my time there (not right now though). The professors are ready and able to help, the views of the bluffs is gorgeous in the fall, and they have an abundance of out doorsy things to do at any time of year."
Graduate Student,4,"Thus far my experience has been positive. The communication from my program director, financial aid office and enrollment office has been stellar."
Senior,4,"I have experienced great things here at Winona state. Coming from a city about triple this size, it sometimes is hard to find things to do here. I was never into the whole party seen, so having close friends to hangout with a lot was a must. The food isn’t too bad. The campus is so beautiful and well taken care of. Overall, great atmosphere. Join a club, get involved!! It will make your experience at college SO much better. There are so many athletic clubs, religion groups, art clubs. I personally like Chi Alpha. Go to sports games, be outside. Winona is a beautiful place. The professors for the most part are really chill and understanding."
Freshman,4,I like how everyone here is very friendly and there are lots of ways to get involved whether its through clubs or athletics there is something for everyone.
Freshman,4,The campus is what made me so interested in this university. I am also a very big fan with how safe the campus is because I don't want to be afraid when walking around.
Junior,4,"The professors are on top of it and are willing to work with the students in every way. The classes are meaningful and teach the students many things. The Winona support staff is also very helpful and answers students' questions in academic, financial, and other affairs."
Freshman,4,the transition from high school to college was fairly easy because of the faculty and volunteer students that were here to help all incoming freshman succeed and help them fully understand what was expected of them
Sophomore,4,"While I love WSU, there's a lot that needs to be fixed within the community. The minute you get off-campus there are no lights, nothing keeping you from getting taken or hurt. While all three of the campus housing centers are relatively careful, security can only do so much off campus, and the police only come in the event of a call. 

On Main campus there are so many resources available! But not on West or East, you have to come onto main if you want anything done, which I get! Main has all the classrooms, and therefore there will be more resources available because there are more people that stay on Main."
Freshman,4,The campus and surrounding area are both very pretty. The campus is what you would picture for a stereotypical college campus with lots of green space.
Niche User,4,The campus and cafeteria was wonderful. Love seeing the diversity and welcoming environment Winona gives off.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Winona. My first year in college has been great so far. I was offered a course that allowed me to move in early, go camping, rock climbing and meet new people. I have made quite a bit of friends and just signed for my first house. I am looking at getting a job and there are so many options available to look at. I am doing good in my classes and like living on my own, but I do miss my family. Overall my college experiences has been better than what I though it would be."
Sophomore,4,Great city to live in and a great campus.  There are tons of outdoor activities in the area and on-campus events all the time. The only complaint about Winona State University I have regards the food-poisoning I got from eating in the cafeteria in the fall.
Freshman,4,"Winona State is a great college if you make it a great college. You would have to go out and find stuff to do, it doesn't just fall into your lap. In saying that, they have an opportunity for every type of person there to make it great."
Freshman,4,"I like the community and all the ways you can get involved. Winona State isn't a huge campus, but it has enough for everyone to get involved in something. I enjoy the classrooms, the technology, the services that are available on campus (health services, mental health, tech services). This campus really wants the best for it's students, and you can tell this by the professors. Every professor I've had is passionate about what they're teaching making you excited to learn. I enjoy the labs that are available on campus. They are big and have a lot of resources in them to help you learn. One thing I wish Winona would add is more well know restaurants and stores down town. If they added more it would cause more students to go to WSU and this would improve not only Winona State, but the community as well. Students now have to go to Rochester or LaCrosse to go to a mall or big known restaurants taking money away from the city of Winona."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus with a super welcoming environment! Love the Chi Alpha campus ministry! They make the whole place so much better! Some of the professors are not very good at teaching. They know the material very well, but expect the students to know everything."
Freshman,4,"Attending Winona State University has been an amazing experience for me. In my first year here, I have learned so much about myself through the help and support of staff and other students here. It's a great place to pursue an education."
Niche User,4,"So far, it's great.  I don't attend there yet but it's been a positive experience every time I have gone so far."
Freshman,4,"I love WSU, the views are so pretty and the people are very friendly. The food needs to be improved as there isn't a lot of flavor to them.  Overall the dormitories are very well kept and are a very safe environment for students.  Its a very homey feeling while living on campus my first year, and I'll be living on campus again my sophomore year."
Freshman,4,I'm just a freshman but I enjoy the school so far. The town doesn't have a lot but the school is very nice. The staff seems to care. The dorms I live in are really nice as well.
Freshman,4,"I haven't gone to the college yet but everything that I have heard from other students and have read, it seems like an amazing place to further my education. I was recently accepted and can't wait to get to go there and pursue my degree."
Niche User,4,"When I went to Winona State I was a Freshmen in High school, it was about a 1 hour and 45-minute drive which was not too bad. When we got there I fell in love, it was big it had room to do whatever you want. When we first got there we had to wait for our tour guide she was very nice, she was a sophomore there I believe. After we waited a little bit we began our tour, we went into some dorm rooms to see what it was like and seen their athletic departments and much more. Overall I loved Winona State, and I am thinking about applying to go there."
Freshman,4,Winona is a very safe and including campus. They offer so many opportunities and resources for students to be successful. The food isn’t very good for the price students pay. Housing and halls are decent and have many accommodations for students. Winona is a great campus and has amazing academics.
Sophomore,4,Winona State University is a relatively small campus in which it is very easy to meet new people and establish new friend groups. You don't have to be sporty or outgoing to enjoy the wide variety of activities that the campus puts on.
Junior,4,"Winona State is an excellent school with good education and nursing programs. The Winona area is very beautiful. If you enjoy outdoor experiences, Winona is a great option for you."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere Winona State brings to a college students life. The school is situated in between the Minnesota and Wisconsin border along the Mississippi River with scenic bluffs and lakes all around. The nature and scenery is what originally drew me towards the school, and the summer and falls at Winona do not disappoint. The academics at Winona are also prestigious as well as comfortable with smaller class sizes than a large university. One thing I would change about Winona State would be the food options available. Students often dine off campus because of the lack of chains in the food court, which are instead utilized by off brand, cheaper options. It would bring in more money to the school by getting these popular chain restaurants."
Freshman,4,"I am a current 1st year student here at Winona State University.  First, let me say that the education I am receiving is better than I had expected.  Love the professors and the opportunities the University provides me.  

Yes, the dorm food is actually good.  I know that sound nefarious but compare to Wisconsin and Illinois Universities, The food is good.  

No for the bad.  I was told by the university that joining the Lourdes Freshman Experience was going to be amazing.  It is not.  In fact the dorm is run with an iron fist and if you decide to live there you will be like most and leave the dorm by the second semester.   I am still here but I will honestly say that it is quite lonely .  most rooms have been vacated and with the security roaming the halls for even the smallest noise after 11pm, i am sure there are better experiences elsewhere in campus.  Do not be sold this bill of good and therefor I cannot say my living experience has been positive.  Stay away for Lourdes!"
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman and I absolutely love Winona! I don't really have any complaints at the moment. The size of the school for me was perfect, the location is beautiful! Some people are worried there isn't much to do with the next big town being about a half hour a way but honestly there's a ton! I think the tuition and fees are fair amounts as well compared to other colleges."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Winona State University was wonderful and it still continues to be. I like Winona for many reasons. Some reasons will be their campus safety, strong academic programs, care for students life like how International students are welcome at Winona University is so amazing and makes you feel at home. I love Winona State University."
Alum,4,I received my undergraduate degree at WSU. The school helped me transfer some difficult credits in order to get me my degree as fast as possible. Now I'm on my way to the rest of my career as a Physician Assistant.
Niche User,4,It is a very good school. All the buildings are in close proximity to one another so you don't have to walk to far. All the professors that I had were all super helpful and very nice. They have really good tech people to help solve your problems and they are all really nice as well. The campus supports all types of benefits and all the sororities hold fundraisers and have fun things going on all the time. I would definitely recommend this university to anyone.
Sophomore,4,Like the size of school and campus. Everything is within a close enough area to get around easy. The university is an outstanding in learning facility and in sports. The training staff for athletes is very caring and helpful when you need them. Lots of people to help when you need it from enrolling to just average day to day questions.  Most of the professors are understanding when you are missing a class on game day. Nice having a doctor and nurse right on the campus for when you are just not feeling well and need just a quick look at. Happy to be a student at Winona State University.
Alum,4,"WSU was a great 4 years of my life.  The bluffs are beautiful and the nearby Lake allows the community to kayak and more for a small yearly fee.  The campus is really pretty and has been updated in a lot of ways--there is a caribou coffee and snack shop in the library (the library is beautiful, spacious, and bright btw!), they have added another newer coffee shop in Somsen Hall as well.  Yes like all colleges there are a lot of old buildings, but they have charm and history.  The Wellness Center is amazing--relatively updated and very modern looking.    The food court has also been remodeled and looks great as well.  Overall, I had a great time at the school--true, the city of Winona is a little bland, there is the typical movie theater and a couple restaurants that aren't chains, but its a small town.  Typically, people can travel to La Crosse or Rochester for the nearest mall or other adventures.  Honestly though, Winona State is beautiful and a pretty great school.  Go Warriors!"
Junior,4,"Beautiful college located near the bluffs, filled with gracious people. I just wish the downtown was a little more developed!"
Freshman,4,A beautiful campus and town with tons to do on and off campus! Small classes with professors willing to do one on one work. Overall great school!
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful especially during the fall. For the most part everyone is very nice around here. There isn't much to do off campus and a lot of students go home on the weekend.
Niche User,4,"When visiting Winona State University, there was a large amount of information given to you. Overall the college is very clean and has a home feel to it. I hope in the future i'm able to attend at Winona State University."
Alum,4,"Winona is smaller campus,which is nice to have smaller class sizes and more one on one with profs.  The campus is located on the Mississippi River surrounded by bluffs and hiking. It is beautiful.  The science, nursing and engineering programs are highly recommended here."
Sophomore,4,"A very nice university nestled in a quaint town.  Diverse student population,  excellent campus , excellent professors and lots of opportunities for all types of social experiences.  Lots of groups and Greek life."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Winona State. My first year was amazing, thanks to the wonderful teachers, people, and atmosphere here at Winona. He teachers truly want you to succeed in class, and will help you figure out what works best for you if you are struggling. The social life at Winona is also amazing, everyone is very nice and you never feel left out!"
Graduate Student,4,"Winona State University overall was a great college to attend.  The professors were all great and very willing to help you excel in your classes.  There were numerous times I utilized the professors office hours to ensure that I was doing what was expected of myself in the class. Also, the campus is set in a way to make sure that the majority of your classes are located in no more than 3 of the buildings so that you are close to all of your classes."
Senior,4,"Winona State has a beautiful campus despite it's smaller size. Being surrounded by the bluffs, lakes and river makes it very outdoor friendly. Due to the small size, it is quite easy to get to know your professors on a personal level to ensure the best learning environment for each student. The HERS majors at WSU work extremely well at preparing you for a future after graduation. This is not a party-savy school and a lot of students leave on the weekends, but the ones that stay become very close. Also tuition is very low, and is locked, so rates will not increase for the next 3 years."
Alum,4,"Winona State University offered me a great opportunity to learn and make life long friends. My best friends today, I met at Winona State University!"
Alum,4,I loved Winona State!  Best 4 years of my life. The professors are helpful and very smart.  The programs are amazing and will make it easy for you to find a job.
Sophomore,4,"Winona State University offers multiple opportunities. However, these opportunities are not always so easy to utilize. In order for these experiences to be fully efficient and used to their maximum, some things need to change. Many students can be nervous or afraid to try new things, experience different surroundings, and meet new people. Going to new club meetings or asking questions needs to be a normality if every student is going to succeed at Winona State. In order to make this happen, I think more resources need to be made available to students who want to do these things, but have barriers holding them back."
College Senior,4,Winona is a beautiful and great school
College Senior,4,Sexual assault is not taken lightly. Safety could be a little better but steps are being taken (underground walkways)
College Senior,4,"The football field is beautiful. Sadly, there is not track."
College Senior,4,Winona State University is so diverse. Not only in students but also in majors and activities. Winona teaches students and holds highly the value of respect. Winona is a great school and I'm proud to be part of it.
College Freshman,4,The food is great and the people are nice. The campus is beautiful throughout the whole year.
College Sophomore,4,There are blue lights around campus to push if you need help. I heard that wsu has the fastest security response in the country.
College Sophomore,4,It's a very beautiful campus with lots of outdoor and indoor activities to stay fit and active.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I really enjoyed WSU. It was a wonderful experience, you could tell the professors truly cared about you. I would definitely recommend this college for others, such a beautiful campus and great academics."
College Sophomore,4,"I am part of greek life, sometimes they can be depicted as partiers, not smart, etc. But being apart of greek life we take our academics seriously and we are more focused on helping our community rather than partying."
College Sophomore,4,"I am in the Education field, teachers seem to care that we learn and get a lot of experience so that we are best ready to teach after completing our degree."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a very nice school, lots of outdoor activities!"
College Sophomore,4,"Security is always available. Although some students have had bad experiences dealing with certain issues, I however always feel safe while on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Being that the College of Business is a well known program, the job placement is very high. Internships are required to graduate and I believe that is an excellent concept."
College Sophomore,4,"West campus was spacious, comfortable, and the community and atmosphere there was fun and outgoing. Having a single dorm was well worth the slightly more expensive cost. Although I didn't like taking the bus everyday, I enjoyed having a place that felt like home."
Freshman,2,Online learning during the pandemic was not good. I understand it was hard for everyone but the way some professors handled it was poor.
Alum,2,"I tell people not to go here even though I recently did. It's super expensive compared to most Wisconsin public colleges with similar programs/features. The ""beauty"" of it isn't worth the boredom. Almost all of the students are white. Students here don't get very involved in any extracurriculars except the Christian clubs, partying/getting drunk, athletics, and greek life. They don't generally care about politics or current events. The professors are okay at best. My degree/experience did not actually prepare me for my job, one which WSU likes to brag about their program for."
Alum,2,"good college- VERY boring. I decided to transfer after two years... (preventative measure, so I didn't die of boredom)... that being said, professors are great as well as 35% of the students"
Freshman,2,"Academics are decent. I'm just here to get my bachelor's and get out. I have however, never been around such a boring group of young people. This is an actual university?! The entire campus looks and acts like they just stepped out of a JC Penney catalog. No diversity. Even the hipsters are boring and conventional. Students can be closed-minded. Don't come here if you are POC, queer or don't miss high school. There is nothing to do but ""party,"" which here means drinking in muggy frat basements with dull 18-20 year olds who've never left their backyard and think that drinking and smoking without having to worry about getting caught by mum is the definition of ""lit."" The music scene here is trash. There's nothing but dad rock and folk, which gets tired after a while. There is no semblance of alternative culture whatsoever and artists will fall to drugs--which are offensively subpar here."
College Junior,2,I have no interest in Greek life and most of the campus doesn't either.
College Freshman,2,I don't prefer the greek life but for others it can be a good way to meet people.
College Sophomore,2,Athletics are not very popular here.
College Sophomore,2,"If you have a good professor and try hard, you'd do just fine and have a great experience. However, bad professors plague this university. The biggest improvement the university could make is to get rid of terrible professors and pay more attention to the good ones."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of us avoid the hell out of it because of the intense parties they throw, and that's mostly all they're noted for. Fraternities and Sororities are typically best avoided."
College Freshman,2,they professors I got this semester were very unorganized and never kept records of my assignments/grades
College Freshman,2,All the school cares about are the nursing students.
College Freshman,2,"I was not impressed by this school. I have from a suburb of the twin cities and am used to having something to do at all times, Coming to Winona was a different story. there is not much to do unless you want to party. I regret coming to this school. I am transferring at the end of the year. don't go here!!!"
College Freshman,2,Very demeaning to try to get in
College Freshman,2,"For someone who works extremely hard and is greatly improving, no financial help available"
College Freshman,2,There can only be as many girls in sororities as there are boys in fraternities so being that the girl to boy ratio is 7:1 there is a very low chance for girls who aren't cookie-cutter Greeks to become a sorority sister.
College Freshman,2,The cops in winona are great but campus security is a joke. I've seen campus security park their own personal car in a no parking zone more than 10 times. Even though we are supposed to check in past 11 in most dorms I haven't had to more than 2 times this whole yeaR. They are pretty pointless to have around.
College Freshman,2,"This is not a college town. Despite popular belief, this is not a college town."
College Freshman,2,The shuttle is on time only half the time. Good luck getting anywhere on the weekends.
College Freshman,2,"Low quality, no variety, hope you like the salad bar."
College Junior,2,The registration is impossible because the classes people need arent always offered and most of the professors suck at teaching.
College Sophomore,2,bars and fast food. learn to cook. fast.
College Sophomore,2,"I attend Winona State University and being in a small town we have almost nothing for off campus eating. Yes, we do have a couple McDonalds, an Erberts and Gerberts and like six bars, but that doesn't really make me want to go out. Another thing that makes the off- campus dining difficult is the distance from the school to the ""restaurants"". Most freshman do not bring a car to school or just can't afford one in general, so having the restaurants so far away makes it a chore to try to go somewhere with friends, or just get away from school for awhile. We have a couple restaurants closer to campus, but after awhile you get sick of eating the same old thing. I love my little school and the tiny town it's in, but coming from a bigger town to here is quite a big difference."
College Sophomore,2,Not many policies are enforced
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive any financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,Mostly fast-food and expensive restaurants. Nothing really good.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not very popular here. They now have houses.
College Sophomore,2,It required an individual application for each scholarship.
College Sophomore,2,"I have had a difficult time receiving financial aid at my school, I recommend applying for a lot of scholarships before you get to college."
College Sophomore,2,"It was really easy to get into this school, but it was difficult to be in contact with the school about the process of choosing this school."
College Sophomore,2,It's boring here to play in the night.
College Junior,2,Winona is a drug and alcohol free school. I honestly don't see any around unless you hear people talk about it. Which they are usually off campus using them. I don't think there is a lot of peer pressure to do drugs or drink. They are really good about enforcing the rules. 
College Junior,2,I honestly don't party so I am not sure where all the parties happen. I know that people really do enjoy the parties they do go to on the weekends. 
College Sophomore,2,"Winona State is a ""dry"" campus, yet many students are out partying and getting drunk. They are usually disruptive and loud (I've been woken up far too many times by drunk people thinking it's funny to yell as loud as they can around the dorms).
There are many cases of alcohol poisoning, and far too many students wind up in the hospital."
College Senior,2,Greek life doesn't seem to be very dominate at Winona State. I have barely heard of any sororities or fraternities. I think I only know of about 3 or 4 frats or sororities. I don't really know much about any of the Greek life. I'm not sure if there's Greek housing or not. They're not very good at advertising the Greek Life. There are also not many diverse fraternities or sororities here on campus. Just within the past two years we have chartered our first multicultural fraternity. We have yet to charter a multicultural sorority.
College Senior,2,The diversity among the women and men in Winona is not very vast. A lot of the men and women look the same and come from similar places. A lot of the student body here comes from predominantly white small towns. I have met people at this school who have said they have never seen or met an African American before.
College Senior,2,"There is public transportation, though it is not very well known.  I have a car at school and it is a very nice convenience, though not a necessity."
College Senior,2,There isn't a ton of variety in Winona for dining options.
College Freshman,2,The sporting events aren't extremely popular at Winona State.
College Freshman,2,Greek Life is not that well known at Winona. I would not know how to get involved because it is not that popular. It does exist though!
College Senior,2,There isn't a whole lot of things to do around the town. You have to find good people and find fun in things that you may not have originally done had you been in a bigger town. The bluffs are beautiful! And they have a place where you can rent canoes in the summer and ice skates in the winter for free!
Freshman,1,"This is not the school for you if you’re like me & don’t like to party, & aren’t a crazy religious person. The kinds of people at winona are either super into the church affiliations- which is borderline cult-like, or spends all their time under the influence of something. Winona has a serious drug problem and it seems like no one is acknowledging it. There is nothing to do in Winona, for the first couple weeks you can find a certain amount of things to do- but after awhile, you realize you’ve done everything and it’s boring. The staff here are mostly helpful, except for the arts program is a mess, I’m changing my major because of how little I’m learning and it’s being taken out of my grade for not ‘listening’. There are only 5-6 teachers in the art department. If you don’t have a car- you’re doomed & have to spend the rest of the year depending on your friends/others to give you rides."
Sophomore,1,"Dealt with anxiety and depression during my second year. Administrators brushed me off and lectured me how to manage my time more effectively. Ended up in the ER and had to withdraw after professors refused to work with me so I could get back in the saddle after missing class. Amazing place otherwise, but the staff could not be more callous and condescending to those with disabilities. I regret applying to Winona State and I doubt I will return."
College Junior,1,I see it all the time.
College Sophomore,1,"Winona State is fantastic if you're a nursing major, but not if your an art major. The entirety of the art department is a mess, and receives very little funding and attention compared to other departments. The building is in shambles compared to the shiny new science buildings.

I can't speak for other programs, but the Graphic Design program definitely needs help. It's run by only one professor so it's typically 3 condensed courses stuffed into 1 course to make up for lack of staff. That professor, while he means well, focuses only on trying to get you a job, but does not teach you how to actually DO the job. The classes are all project-based with little to no lectures (this is not a good thing), and the grading is extremely arbitrary.

If you want to major in Graphic Design then I sincerely recommend you look at a different school."
College Senior,1,"Diversity at Winona State is very poor. There are many international students that come to Winona, but when it comes to people of color the population is very small. This campus is predominately white. There is a lot of ignorance here at Winona State concerning anything that is considered diverse whether it is race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation etc. Winona is slowly making progress but still has a long way to go before they accomplish diversity."
College Freshman,1,"Winona is always dead. Downtown is literally a long street that takes up about 8 blocks and there's only bars, which you can only get in if you're over 21. There is absolutely nothing to do here, specially in the winter. In the summer at least you can be outdoors and hike the bluffs or go to the lake and have picnics but in the winter you're basically stuck indoors unless you have a car and can drive home, or to La Crosse or Rochester."
College Junior,1,I keep trying to get in contact with someone I was told to contact and she is never there. Also as a transfer student you have to hound them about getting the transfer scholarship and the phi theta kappa scholarship. I lost out on 1000 dollars because I thought that the scholarship was automatically applied.
College Junior,1,I see Greek Life as a bunch of snobs who don't know how to make their own friends.
College Freshman,1,"The transportation in Winona is pretty bad. I come from a big city so I'm used to there being lots of public transportation. In Winona, I can't even find a bus stop. They're in the most random places, like in front of people's houses. I don't have a car so it makes it hard for me to go anywhere because I can't ever find where the bus picks people up, or where it goes. They also don't run very often. But the public transportation is cheap in Winona. The campus bus on the other hand is a lot better. It runs every 15 minutes, and in the mornings there are two buses running. On the weekend it's different though. There's a van that runs every half hour which is kind of irritating, especially if you're trying to get somewhere and don't have a car. For long distances there is the train and there are buses but other than that you either have to have a car or a friend with a car."
College Junior,1,"Winona state parking does not offer very many parking passes or spots.  I understand parking passes are a way to gain more money, but there needs to be parking lots a little off campus for the students who dont get a parking pass.  The facilities and parking services are very harsh when it comes to tickets and they don't work with students when wrong ticketing occurs.  I have had very poor interaction with parking services.  It is necessary to have a car on campus if you have a job or live off campus.  Along with alternate side parking, it is very hard for college students to find parking spots and respect the rules."

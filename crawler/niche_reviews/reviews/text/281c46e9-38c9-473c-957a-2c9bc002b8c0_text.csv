Junior,5,I am in an advanced degree program for educators.  Currently I attend school one night a week as well as have classes online.   Having a blended approach to school allows for more flexibility and being able to take the necessary classes required for my degree and allow me to maintain financial security for my family.   NNU is the best school for educators in the state of Idaho.  Being able to attend this college is a dream come true.  They have literally held my hand and walked me through the entire admissions and financial aid process.  I am excited to be able to pursue my education at this great institution.
Junior,5,"I am so happy I went through the online program. As a current firefighter, it is a logistical nightmare to go to campus classes due to my rotating schedule.  NNU's online undergraduate program gives me the flexibility to work full time and finish my dream of earning my graduate degree."
Junior,5,The application process was flawless. NNU's staff was more than helpful when I applied as a transfer student. Time was of the essence to make the July 6th start date and the University staff set me up for success. I haven't been a college student for several years and am very assured by my choice of attending this University!
Junior,5,Very good online learning experience. The professors are organized and helpful. The course work is manageable and interesting.
Alum,5,My classes were in person. There were aspects of online like discussion  boards and everyone was respectful
Alum,5,NNU is a great school for anyone. I applied for an accelerated teaching program and everyone  was like family. I enjoyed every aspect.
Senior,5,"The professors here are friendly, know who you are, and are happy to help.  They are also very down to earth."
Graduate Student,5,The professors take a vested interest in their students.  I have received prompt feedback every time I had a question.  I appreciate the deep critical thinking required from the professors.
Freshman,5,I really liked my experience at Northwest Nazarene University. I made some awesome friends and my professors were really helpful. I had a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to going back.
Niche User,5,I absolutely love this school. I love the religious aspect of the university as well as the sporting events
Senior,5,"NNU is a great school. There are a variety of different degree programs for all types of students, whether you are a traditional undergrad, non-traditional adult student, or a graduate student."
Freshman,5,I like how the church is really involved but not to a point that t's annoying.  I really like that the campus is dry therefore there are always ways to have sober fun that isn't distracting.
Alum,5,"From the first day I toured NNU I knew I wanted to spend the next four years there. NNU is a small campus, which is an excellent opportunity to get to know your profs a little more. The community is welcoming of all people. As for the academics they are rigorous but that is to be expected."
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE Northwest Nazarene University. It's a small school, which I love, because it allows for intimate class settings and professors get to know you individually. I love the community, the events, academics, etc. They offer great programs and it's obvious that the professors and faculty want you to be there."
Graduate Student,5,"NNU is a welcoming Christian school. The professors genuinely care about their students and will work with you if you are going through a rough time. In addition, NNU has the best nursing and engineering programs in the state. I highly recommend NNU to anyone seeking a quality education."
Sophomore,5,NNU has been home for me this past year. The staff and faculty truly care about every student and the community overall is phenomenal! Not only is every student there amazing but the education is great as well!
Junior,5,"An amazing University. Staff that cares and a pure environment that allows for deep, focused study. The campus is fairly small and it is easy to get from class to class. The landscaping is well-maintained. It is nice having all four seasons here. Small class sizes are a huge 'plus' and students are friendly here."
Niche User,5,"Love, love, love the campus. A lot of renovations are happening and the campus is just blooming. It's a very diverse school and it's also Christian, so I'm looking forward to attending. I have about 20 friends who go there already and they love it. I meet them on campus all the time for volleyball or study sessions and I can't wait until I attend in the Fall. I took a tour and was able to get the real NNU experience and absolutely loved it!"
Freshman,5,"If I had to use one word to describe NNU, it would be COMMUNITY. NNU is an amazing place that has shaped me into who I am today and that is because of the loving community that students get to experience every day. I have only been studying here one year (Class of 2022) and I have grown spiritually and intellectually. You will not come out of NNU the same person you walked in as and that is because of all the amazing qualities that come with studying and living in a small, compassionate university like NNU."
Freshman,5,I had originally attended a local private college for a few months. That college had no sense of community and had lied about all the promises they had made during my admissions process. NNU is not like that at all. They have constantly been welcoming and caring during my entire admissions process. They haven't tried to make outrageous promises they have no intent of keeping. They have been completely honest about every situation and that is just one thing that makes this college so wonderful!
Graduate Student,5,NNU has some wonderful professors that truly care about their students. With small class sizes NNU is a perfect fit for a person seeking more one on one time with the professor.
Alum,5,"The best four years of my life were spent at NNU. NNU offers small class sizes, caring profs, and a top notch education. NNU is one of the most distinguished schools in the state of Idaho. I would without hesitation recommend this school to anyone seeking a quality education."
Freshman,5,"This school has amazing people and opportunities just overflowing all over campus. The professors love their students and make sure that they are always comfortable and know what they are learning, unlike other colleges. NNU has incredible students who are willing to get involved with the community on and off campus. My first year here has been nothing but great, and I very much enjoy and love being a student here at NNU."
Niche User,5,The college councilors are really helpful and energetic. They help get students set up a ready to go for college at any time they'd need help.
Junior,5,An amazing school. Family culture with professors who truly care about every student. This place lets you know that you belong and that you are loved. Very clean and well-maintained. Small class sizes. Area for improvement: the food is terrible and way too costly.
Freshman,5,Northwest Nazarene University is a fabulous college with professors that care about their students and are excellent at teaching their programs.
Freshman,5,"Going to NNU was the best decision of my college career yet. The professors seem to really care about the students and the people are generally friendly. The class sizes are smaller than other universities, which is good if you value more individual time with the professor."
Freshman,5,NNU was a very great experience for me and I think others should experience life on campus here too! The student body is very involved and loves their fellow peers. The professors are very understanding with you as long as you communicate with them about circumstances and situations and things like that. The students are very fun and it is very easy to make a lot of friends here!
Freshman,5,NNU is perfect for those who are searching for small class sizes. Smaller class size means more individual time with the professor. The people here are outgoing and for the most part friendly.
Sophomore,5,"Northwest Nazarene University has challenged me academically and has transformed me into another person. My time here so far has been nothing short of incredible. Smaller class sizes, which means more individual time with the professor."
Alum,5,"NNU offers small class sizes, which means that your profs will actually get to know you. The campus is small, but it is nice. NNU is especially well suited for Pre-Med, Pre-Law, and engineering students because the university is home to the states best pre-professional programs."
Freshman,5,My experience at Northwest Nazarene University was nothing short of excellent. With smaller class sizes NNU’s professors take the time to get to know you a little better. NNU’s professors actually care about the students education.
Freshman,5,"My time are NNU has been excellent. The professors here actually care about your education since the class sizes are small. This university is especially well suited for nursing, engineering, and Pre-Med students."
Freshman,5,"NNU is a perfect match for those that want to get an education, while envoking religion into it. Since NNU is a small school the classes are also smaller, which means that you get more one on one time with your professors. NNU is also home to Idaho’s best engineering and Nursing program."
Freshman,5,"Words can’t explain my experience at NNU. NNU offers small class sizes, which is good because the professor actually know your name. Recently the university partnered with the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine(ICOM). This is especially good for all the pre-med students at NNU."
Freshman,5,So far my experience at NNU has been nothing short of excellent! The professors here really seem to care about the students. NNU is also home to Idaho’s best nursing program.
Senior,5,"NNU’s academics are rigorous, yet fun. At NNU the professors really are interested in your education."
Senior,5,"My favorite thing about NNU are the professors here.  They are excellent and accomplished teachers who truly care about their students and work to create meaningful relationships with us.  Throughout my time here at NNU, I've come to get to know some of my professors so well they feel like family to me and that I think is amazing.  There are many many other things I like about NNU but our professors are definitely my favorite part about the school and for that alone I would highly recommend it."
Sophomore,5,I am a transfer student going into my first year of nursing school. All the professors I've had are great and make sure that you succeed in their classroom. The advisors are great and will get you to where you need to go.
Alum,5,The class ratios were perfect and made it easy to enter into class and seminar discussions. The professors know you by name and go above and beyond what is necessary to help you succeed. The professors at NNU want the absolute best for everyone of their students.
Junior,5,"NNU’s nursing and engineering program is known in the state of Idaho as one of the best. The classes are small, which is great because you actually get to know your professor and vice versa. Overall, NNU is great school that has a lot to offer."
Junior,5,"I am currently a junior at NNU and so far my college experience has been the best! NNU has many things to offer. The campus is small, which means smaller class size. NNU is also known for its engineering  program. From what I hear many NNU graduates end up being admitted to their top graduate school choices."
Freshman,5,I loved the community of the campus and all of the events that are thrown at the students. I think the professors are very understanding and able to get help.
Senior,5,"Northwest Nazarene University is centered in Jesus Christ, the NNU education instills habits of heart, soul, mind and strength to enable each student to become God's creative and redemptive agent in the world. NNU is a Christian university of the liberal arts, professional and graduate studies. NNU is founded upon belief in and relationship with God. Therefore, we seek to build our lives and the practices of the University upon the Kingdom of God as revealed in Jesus. NNU has 4 main values: Transformation, Truth, Community, and Service.

Alongside that, NNU has an amazing community surrounded by individuals who invest in others. NNU welcomes every one. Class sizes at NNU are small, which enables professors to instill personal time into every student. NNU also puts on weekly, fun and exciting events for students to connect deeper with one another. 

I would highly recommend NNU to anyone!"
Freshman,5,I really feel that everyone on campus cares about each other and the people they are serving.  This is a great environment to be in and to learn in because it allows the individual to thrive with out the fear of judgement.   It is a religious community and that heavily contributes to the loving and accepting environment.
Alum,5,"Great school! At NNU there are small class sizes, which means that you get one on one time with the professor. NNU has a lot to offer. Definitely worth your money."
Sophomore,5,"NNU has been a life-changing experience for me. I have been transformed into a better person and will keep transforming for the next two years, as I finish up my major and two minors. The School of Business is one of the best in the area and the professors are always open to talk and have their doors open."
Junior,5,"The small class sizes contribute to a concentrated education environment. With only a few exceptions, all professors are concerned and personally invested in each student's success. Widely available study and tutoring help."
Sophomore,5,"I love the Christ-centered community that is created here at NNU.  The professors are so willing to invest in individual students, and the friends I have made will be life long."
Senior,5,I love my school of Northwest Nazarene University. There are so many wonderful people and the student life is absolutely one of kind! I will definitely feel home sick once I graduate.
College Senior,5,"It really depends on your major, but I have personally had a great experience. Gen Ed classes tend to be on the larger side, but even then, the biggest class I've ever been in had about 80 students. As you get deeper into your field, it is common to have classes as small as 3-7 people. Most professors I've had are great; they are ""fantastic"" at best and ""average"" at worst. There are a decent variety of courses for a college its size, and they go deep into the material. The work load also depends on the prof and the class, but I have never had a class that had too much work to handle."
College Junior,5,Majoring in communication science and being apart of the communications department has been one of the best choices I have made. My professors make a genuine effort to get to know not just my name but where I come from and my story. The class sizes are great and have made a huge impact in my ability to ask questions and receive help in my classes.
College Junior,5,NNU is great at getting their students in every major out in their field requiring a form of field experience or internship. NNU is extremely connected and has incredible opportunities for their students to explore careers in their fields.
College Junior,5,We are told to plug campus safety's phone number into our phones as freshman so that we have it if we ever find ourselves needing it. They check the doors at the dorms every night and are willing to help wherever we need.
College Junior,5,"Living on campus is one of the greatest things about attending NNU. Each dorm is great about hosting a variety of dorm events. One of the best parts about living in the dorms is due to the community of NNU. The community is close knit so the random events, hang outs, and conversations are some of my favorite memories I have of NNU."
College Junior,5,The athletic programs are filled with talented athletes. The athletes are pretty good at expanding outside of their teams with friend groups on campus. Each team when away does devotions keeping that Christ Centered atmosphere.
College Junior,5,"The community at NNU is the greatest and one of the most supportive communities I've ever been apart of. I love that I can be in a community that not only is supportive in every way I need academically but also socially and spiritually. Between all the student life events, living on campus, and the students that make NNU the place that it is I couldn't have chosen a better school for me. The smaller community and class sizes allow for so many different opportunities to work hands on with professors whether it is in understanding a class or working on a research project with them. The campus life is so great and a positive community to live among. Also NNU being a Christ Centered community makes the experience of being a student here even better. I am given opportunities to grow and learn in my walk with God while being supported by a lot of my peers."
College Sophomore,5,"No drug/alcohol usage on campus, probably select students off campus but there are strong rules against it."
College Junior,5,"I really like the courses I've taken here at NNU, especially this fall semester. I am really close with almost every professor that I have been taught under. Some of my professors have helped me with personal problems and I feel safe to talk to them whenever I need it. All the professors are very well-versed in their subject and know a lot about education and people. There are a lot of variety in courses, the only thing that I would change is that certain courses should be offered more, but because of the size of this school I understand why they are not always offered every semester. The class sizes are very reasonable and small. Gen Ed classes are a bit bigger but it's nice to get to know people outside of your own major anyway; major classes are very small and give you one-on-one attention with the professor."
College Junior,5,"I think there is a lot of value in getting a degree from NNU because we have a liberal arts education, are known for being Christlike, and attain skills that can be used in any area of work or study."
Junior,4,"I currently have only been admitted and do not actually start my classes until August 30th, 2020.   I  do know from reputation that the professors are incredible.  The willingness of the staff that I have encountered so far has been incredible.  I am excited to become a part of this institution."
Junior,4,"The professors and faculty are incredibly welcoming, friendly, and kind. However, the cost is very high and they do not offer many scholarships."
Senior,4,"Overall its a good, small school. Pretty quiet. Student events are sometimes fun but a lot of them are very similar. The small class sizes are nice and professors care about each of their students individually."
Junior,4,"Small, close-knit campus.  Professors truly care for their students.  Campus is clean and safe. Not much diversity which can be stifling.  Not many food options on campus."
Niche User,4,"Honestly this is one of the best Universities I have been honored to study at. The environment on campus is truly one of a kind. However, I can honestly say that the resources that the university provides to its students are out of this world. Some of those resources include libraries use and active tutoring, which are available to any Northwest Nazarene University students."
Freshman,4,I really like the sense of community you get with everybody and how much almost everyone want to help and just be part of your family.
Freshman,4,I like how all the people know each other and the friendliness. I also like how they have many things to do on the first week of college life. This way we get to meet our life long friends on the first week of school.
Sophomore,4,"The community at NNU is great! I feel loved and welcomed at all times. There are tons of opportunities for you to get involved because people really care about you and your success. So if you want to be involved somewhere on campus, you will receive help doing that. It’s great. People are also willing to include you in their friend groups. I found that it was not hard to connect in multiple places because people are so loving and caring. Without the community aspect that NNU offers, I don’t think I would enjoy my time here at all."
Niche User,4,"Northwest Nazarene University has a beautiful campus and a wonderful atmosphere. Their business department is excellent and surpassed my expectations. I was skeptical about the place at first because it was so different from my home, but I soon fell in love with the place and its people. I might have only been there for a day but I had already made some wonderful friends there who helped me in my decision to apply to that school. I hope you all have a wonderful experience there, because I sure have."
Senior,4,"The only reason for the four stars is the price is a bit high.  The professors want you to graduate and do their best to make sure you learn what you need to do so.  It's a religious college, but they are excellent at making you not feel uncomfortable being a non-believer."
Alum,4,The culture on campus is very positive and the professors are very involved in students' lives. I wish that diversity was more openly accepted at the school.
Junior,4,"I have loved my experience at NNU! I have learned a lot academically but, I have also been pushed to develop myself as a whole individual. There is someone or something on campus that can be suitable for just about everyone."
Sophomore,4,I love Northwest Nazarene Because of the small class sizes and the excellent professors/staff. The individual attention I get at Northwest Nazarene University makes me feel like I can succeed despite my learning disability. The faculty at Northwest Nazarene is top notch and make sure that none of their students fall behind
Senior,4,"The community at NNU is amazing. I have never lived in Idaho my entire life, but after a year at NNU, I feel at home there."
Freshman,4,"I will be a in coming freshman this next fall and from what I’ve heard, NNU is so amazing! I’ve made a couple small visits and everyone is beyond nice and everything is super close to campus!"
Junior,4,"Great school, great nursing professors.  Certainly prepare yourself to work hard if you want to make it."
Niche User,4,I have received a substantial amount of information via mail and talking with students and administration of the school. I have heard very good things about this school.
Niche User,4,I truly enjoyed the AP Credit teachers. They cared about my education and made sure I understood the curriculum.
Senior,4,NNU is an amazing place because it has an amazing sense of community and involvement. Things I would like to see change are small things like quality of food in the cafeteria and more food options around campus.
Sophomore,4,"I like the community at NNU- it is really strong. They make a conscious effort to reach out to everyone, even those students on the fringes. I wish there were more opportunities to get involved in acting out your faith on campus. The lack of bible studies and such has been a struggle for me. "
Junior,4,"While I am not entirely thrilled with the location, the school and the people greatly compensate for that. Not only is it a beautiful campus, but the students and professors all care about each other and create a warm, loving environment. Plus, with it being a small campus, you are able to build strong relationships with most everyone, including the professors. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at NNU. "
College Senior,4,"Outstanding quality of academia. And underrated school for sure. Students are required to put the effort into doing their best, but profs and staff are more than willing to help students who seek help. The registration process can sometimes get messy but normally gets resolved in the end. The learning commons (opened in 2014) is the favorite place on campus to study, complete with modern and useful furniture, a large library catalog, friendly staff, and many study rooms with full-wall white boards to write on. Other popular study places are in dorm lobbies, outside on a nice day, and at the Flying M Coffee Garage, about a mile away from campus in downtown Nampa."
College Senior,4,"VERT strict lifestyle code- completely dry campus, even students who are of legal age can get in trouble for on- or off-campus drinking. In some ways, it is nice to not have that stuff around the dorms.The majority of students here do not use alcohol or drugs (and they know this coming to campus), but it is also not hard to find someone to party with. Most parties happen off-campus at someone's house, and are generally not ragers. There's only been one or two major ""busts"" during my time here. Basically, ""if you seek, you will find."" But it's not a big part of campus culture."
College Senior,4,"NNU is considered one of the best schools in the state of Idaho and in the Northwest. It's top programs are nursing, elem/secondary ed, business, and engineering. It seems that just about everyone at NNU who majors in these fields lands a job offer before or soon after graduation. However, these are far from their only good programs. Department profs and staff do a great job relaying information to students about intern and job opportunities, career fairs, and other opportunities to further your prospects. They are also great about working with you one-on-one. The trick is that ultimately, it is up to the student to take advantage of these opportunities and do the work.

P.S., regardless of your major, get acquainted with Amanda Marble in the career center. She's a goddess when it comes to helping with resumes, job apps, etc."
College Senior,4,"While it's luster has worn off as I've deepened by education here, NNU is still one great school. The small, Christ-centered community has helped me in many ways, from finding employment in my field to getting help with classes to getting connected with the Nampa and Treasure Valley community as a whole. It's not a school for everyone, as it's generally pretty ""tame."" Also, Idaho winters suck unless there's snow on the ground. But I am privileged to be able to do my undergrad at this institution, and it is also up for consideration for continuing my Master's at."
College Sophomore,4,I feel like the program you're in is gonna work their hardest to make sure you have an internship/job coming out of school. Anytime I have ever needed help I have gotten it.
College Junior,4,We have a lot of employees that are on the Campus Security team. They are always helpful and very understanding if someone is studying late in a building and if someone is locked out they come help us. They are all very kind and fun.
College Junior,4,"The dorm life is awesome because I get to know all the people in my class. I like that we are segregated by sex because it lets me focus on friendships with other girls without having to worry about boys around or anything like that. If I want to talk to the males, their dorms aren't far away. The best options is that freshmen girls get a spacious dorm with a sink and new and portable furniture, the sophomores get smaller dorms but it's more fun because you get closer with them. The upperclassmen get apartments and it's fun to be in a co-ed building but still be separated by a lobby area. Dorms are great for social aspects as well as academic because you can study with friends or work on projects together. All the dorms are relatively close to all the academic buildings and cafeteria. It's really convenient to be centered with the other buildings. The housing process was easy and I didn't have any worries that I wouldn't get a dorm or apartment."
College Senior,4,The campus community is great
College Junior,4,I have had many opportunities for on campus jobs and volunteer at many places. Working toward interning now at a church right on campus. Plenty of great opportunities for advancement in your career.
College Junior,4,"Every professor genuinely cares about you and loves to hear your stories, experiences, and hardships. I have numerous professors who have asked to take me out for lunch or coffee just to get to know me. Professors who have laughed with me and helped me through some really rough times. Professors here are all around excellent people."
College Sophomore,4,"Sports at NNU are not the main thing. Really nothing is the main thing, though. The focus of the school is much more closely revolved around the idea of equal importance and full support for all of those participating in school groups and athletics. Sports are well attended, rivalry games especially so. Student spirit ranges from supportive to off the charts, crazy, screaming group of college kids. It's always a lot of fun to hit up the games and lose your voice screaming in support of the Saders."
College Senior,4,Varsity sports regularly compete for conference championships.
College Junior,4,"Basketball and Volleyball are fairly well attended, but other sports are not very well attended by students. Our volleyball and soccer teams are very good in our division, at that shows at volleyball games which students attend. Our athletic facilities are up-to-date and open for regular student use, except for the athlete only weight room and locker rooms. There is a variety of activities in our sports center, including racquetball courts, pool tables, and a rock wall for the rock climbing course. While we do not have cheerleaders, we do have a student section leader at sports games that leads the student section in cheers and general school spirit."
College Junior,4,"There are so many different athletics offered at NNU. The fan support and student involvement are very prominent, especially home games because people will dress up, cheer loud, and have a lot of school spirit. I can tell that the team performance is great because our school is centered around being Christlike in all aspects of campus life."
College Junior,4,There have times where it has been late and I have had to walk across campus. I do not like being out in the dark alone. I called campus safety and they gave me a ride back to my dorm. Campus safety also does regular checks on all the building and the parking lots to make sure nothing abnormal is occurring.
College Junior,4,Very excellent staff of people who try there absolute best to make everyone feel safe and secure on campus. Campus safety does an excellent job as well as the councilors offices.
College Junior,4,"Love living on campus as it creates an excellent connections and friendships. The dorms, while not very vogue, are rather well kept and comfortable, with a little moving around. Love how NNU does within this sphere of campus life."
College Junior,4,I love going to events put on by athletics. School spirit abounds at these games and events and are always a great time.
College Junior,4,I love that this school gets into our basketball and volleyball games so much. It is fun cheering my school on. I never had school sport pride until I came here to nny
College Junior,4,"This school has been for me a beautiful fit. The experiences I have had after just one year here have made me realize how lucky I am. The community here strongly works to make everyone feel not just included but loved, cared for, and involved. So many amazing things to do from hiking, eating out, bowling, campus golf, inter murals, music, and lots of hilarious conversation topics. Absolutely love it here at Northwest Nazarene University."
College Sophomore,4,Campus security cares about their students.
College Sophomore,4,We have a variety of great programs offered.
College Sophomore,4,"I spend a lot of time in the science department because of my major, and the professors are some of the best people I have ever met. They work with students and genuinely invest in their lives. My professors have taken time to get to know me personally and each of them show great knowledge in their areas."
College Sophomore,4,Drugs are not majorly prevailent on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Most people do not participate in drugs or alcohol.  There are still some people who participate, but that is a very small amount compared to the rest of campus"
College Sophomore,4,I always feel safe on campus and campus security is uber helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"Student sections at games are pumped up, and our athletes strive to be the best they can in their sports."
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are a big part of campus, and are always fun to attend."
College Sophomore,4,"I am very glad that I chose to live on campus, life at NNU is much better when living in the center of the community.  I have far more friendships because of this, and have become so close to many people through campus housing.  Worth the money, no doubt."
College Senior,4,"Our campus security gives every freshman their phone number the first day of the year. They are personable and accessible 24/7, and have answered and addressed the issue every single time I have called."
College Junior,4,"It is never a dull moment at an NNU athletic event, it ranges from professors and faculty to spirited student body!"
College Sophomore,4,"Some of the sports teams are really good, while others are not as good.  The last year more fans started coming to the games because of the improved school spirit and student section."
College Freshman,4,I can walk across campus by myself at night without feeling really fearful.
College Freshman,4,I like how small the classes were and that the professors knew you by name.
College Junior,4,"Because I am a music major, I do not know the internship programs very well, but I hear from my fiends that it is fairly easy to get an internship if they ask their advisors."
College Junior,4,"The buildings are a little older, but they are fully functional. The social aspect is wonderful and socializing is encouraged."
College Junior,4,Athletics are highly supported by all student and staff. Students are all very supportive and attention most games.
College Sophomore,4,I have yet to hear of someone who graduated without a job waiting for them on the outside.
College Sophomore,4,I am not super into athletics so I don't have a huge glimpse into that aspect of campus. But the gym facilities for students to work out in are good!
College Senior,2,"NNU's party scene is lacking. Most students don't party, strict lifestyle code and all. The parties that DO exist happen at an off-campus student's house, at BSU, or while off camping or back home for break."
College Sophomore,2,There really aren't many parties or bar's that people attend.
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many parties here
College Student,2,"There is none, except that I heard there's a secret sorority somewhere. No new news yet."
College Senior,2,"Four years ago, I would have written a very different review. As a freshman, I though NNU was great. As I sit here in my senior year, I cannot wait to leave. 

I am regularly academically disappointed. While there are some wonderful professors, there are an equal number who are horrible. Recently, NNU has had a difficult time attracting good professors due to low pay and an unappealing location. NNU feels a lot like high school academically. I am currently in a class with assigned seating where we are required to turn in our outlined notes of our reading. Because of the small class size, some of the professors are able to assign a lot of homework; this is usually a tactic to boost poorly performing students' grades. This homework is generally busy work which interferes with my real learning.

I feel like my tuition money is wasted on a daily basis. A large portion of it goes to ""spiritual development."" This includes paying for chapel speakers (yes, you are required to go to chapel 2-3 times per week. Yes, you will be fined if you do not go. Yes, they block cell phone service in chapel), busing the choir to churches to sing hymns, and the salaries of a whole team of people who provide spiritual guidance to the campus. Meanwhile, dorms are in shambles and pay for professors is too low.

The atmosphere of this school breeds hypocrisy. People who lead worship or speak in chapel get popular. People are very accepting; unless you drink, or swear, or aren't a virgin. These people are shunned and gossiped about by the ""holy"" people. 

While many websites say there are nearly equal numbers of guys and girls in this school, I do not know where they get these numbers. For traditional undergrads, there are many more girls than guys. In my class, there are 2 girls for every guy. In last years freshman class, these numbers were closer to 3 girls to every guy. This is very unfortunate since so many girls here want ""ring by spring"". 

Lastly, there is nothing to do in Nampa, ID."
College Junior,2,The food is totally hit or miss. Often times the food is just poorly made or looks unappetizing...which might be part of making/ordering food in bulk. The meats are almost always sketchy..
College Sophomore,2,The off-campus housing is great! ... If you can find it. Most of the options get snatched up really quickly and people hold onto them for dear life. It's really hard to find someplace close enough to campus that is in okay shape and in the price range.
College Junior,2,There aren't many options unless you're willing to spend an arm and a leg.
College Junior,2,"It's definitely nothing great, but it is college food. What can you expect, right?"
College Sophomore,2,I didn't get help in finding a scholarship since the deadline had already passed and was told to look for some myself.
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone is nice and welcoming but won't go out of their way to help you or be your friend. It is especially hard for the international students, unless, maybe, you're on a sports team."
College Sophomore,2,"Their really isn't anything exciting other than the food selections, which are mostly fast food options."
College Junior,2,My class has a very competitive attitude that the professors seem to encourage which is detrimental to the environment.
College Junior,2,My school is a Christian private university.  It is very conservative and has some cultural differences but is not accepting of sexual orientation.
College Freshman,2,The main transportation is your own vehicle or a friends vehicle. You could call a taxi if you wanted.
College Senior,2,"The campus is very strict when it comes to drinking and drugs. First time offenders are put on watch duty and they have to report back to the dorms by 10 pm or 12 am at the latest. After a few times, you are in danger of being expelled from school. Since NNU is a christian college, it is pretty easy for most of us to follow those policies because they go along with our morals."
College Junior,2,"Difficult to get hold of the financial aid office, and apart from loans, had no resources for students like me."
College Freshman,2,"NNU has many evening activities, and they provide entertainment and fun without alcohol and sexual activities. This way people can have fun without hurting themselves"
College Sophomore,2,Northwest Nazarene U. is a Christian university and is very strict about drug and alcohol use. There is zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol even for students who are 21+.If a student is caught they could face consequences ranging from academic probation (limited involvement) to expulsion.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of small apartments near the school and they price is reasonable if you have a roommate. Most of the housing is low-end and, in some cases, it is scary. Most people would probably rather live on campus."
Alum,1,"Academics in some areas are good, but in others, they are dumbed-down and really more like high school classes.  The campus is tiny and the food options are pretty bad.  Transferred out of here after 2 years."
Alum,1,"Great place to meet hypocrites. This was the worst experience in my life. Joining the Marines was a breeze after I left after 3 years. This is a school of fakes. A waste of money. I didn’t learn a thing and it took years to pay it back for nothing.  They fined you for dancing, for missing chapels, for nail holes. They send their Ra’s to spy on you in Boise and fine you for everything. I graduated at Gonzaga. Now that’s a great school."
College Senior,1,We have a made up engineering frat.
College Junior,1,"Doesn't exist, for the most part."
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life. It isn't allowed on campus.
College Junior,1,The strictness of our school is way over the top. There are 25-30 year-olds who are being told they cannot have a drink... there are 18-23 year olds being told they cannot spend time with a member of the opposite sex except for certain designated hours... there are fines for everything which should be illegal... but it is a private christian school so it's somewhat understandable.
College Junior,1,"We don't have any! But that's good,"
College Freshman,1,NNU does not have a Greek system.
College Junior,1,I hate the food on campus as it's a poor quality and you can tell its meant to feed the masses but if you live on campus you have to have a meal plan
College Junior,1,"It snows in the winter and I have to commute 20 minutes, it is very inconvenient."
College Junior,1,"The school I am attending is very expensive. Financial aid doesn't cover the cost of my school, that is why I am applying for scholarships."
College Freshman,1,You can't live off campus until you are a senior or married. Unless you know how to get around it.
College Sophomore,1,"The public bus system here sucks, but there are always people going to walmart or different stores. So if you don't have a car you can usually get a ride with someone."
College Sophomore,1,Best to Have Your Own Car – Public transportation and bike lanes are not available.  Most off campus needs are driving distance away.

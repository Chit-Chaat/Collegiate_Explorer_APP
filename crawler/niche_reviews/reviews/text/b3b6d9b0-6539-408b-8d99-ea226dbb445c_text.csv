Junior,5,I love the environment and how the teachers cared about my learning. The campus was really close to dorms and is very affordable.
Senior,5,"Only due to Covid-19 however, this is not at all as easy as some other schools. Lockdown software will be used to prevent cheating."
Senior,5,It has an amazing business program with proffessors that are there to help you succeed both academically and in your career.
Sophomore,5,"Northern Illinois University offers a great sense of community and support. All of my professors and instructors as well as peers value my time and thoughts, and I feel included in my clubs and activities. I have met some amazing people during my time at NIU!"
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman and so far things are going great. I spent a long time before I came to NIU as an enrolled student, and I love the professors. They are top notch and they really care about their students."
Sophomore,5,"Spending my entire freshman year at NIU, I've grown tremendously as a person and I've learned what I like and dislike about the university. I commend NIU for its faculty and staff all around. During my first year experience at NIU, the faculty all across the board have been so helpful and understanding while I adjust to the new norm and figure out what I need to do."
Alum,5,I had a great time and was able to graduate with a lot of help from the campus. Only thing I wish is I was able to make it to more things for transportation students. They usually do things late evening or during the weekend where traveling students are either too tired or don't want to travel far for activities when they aren't at school already.
Alum,5,All online educational interaction while at NIU was first rate.  Easy to use systems and very attentive faculty.
Alum,5,"Great campus, great experience.  Large university feel in a classic college town, but only one hour from Downtown Chicago if you're in the mood for a city day."
Alum,5,"While I was full time and took a lot of my classes in person face to face, it was great to have a few classes online. They were great which some of the classes were pretty easy to take online, while some of them were challenging to do as well.  A few classes I took online were a few ETT classes such  as 229, and 429 which its basically computer programming teaching you programming and using Microsoft such as Word, PowerPoint, and Excel, which in this time majority of Business use each of these on a daily basics in there work in the companies. Overall, I enjoyed the online experience at Northern Illinois University, with taking some classes online besides face to face to help me under how online learning works versus in person which it is an entirely different experience, but also rewarding in its moments."
Alum,5,"My experience at Northern Illinois University was a great one. my 5 years there for my undergraduate was great with exciting new experiences, meeting a  lot of  different and great people from places all around the world. It has been  a challenging experience as well with class, getting real world experience to help you out in your career that you select. Living in the dorms was an experience that was great to help me  meet so many people and meet some outstanding people who have became friends. Campus is also great too it its not as big as other schools, but it is a decent size campus where you will be walking a lot. Northern Illinois University will help you to achieve your goals and dreams that you will reach for."
Alum,5,I have taken several online classes. All of them are organized and clear. If I ever had questions they were answered immediately.
Alum,5,Great campus and professors. Everything is close. Transportation is provided by a bus system. Campus is clean.
Junior,5,It is hard to balance online classes and in person once you really have to learn to discipline yourself. overall professors can be very understanding and give you a good amount of time to submit what's needed. Recently due to Covid-19 the a lot of my professors did a very good job moving in person classes into online always kept us updated and gave us enough time to prepare.
Freshman,5,It is very diverse and the campus is amazing. Also everyone from the students to the faculty are very nice and willing to help.
Sophomore,5,"On the surface NIU might seem like an average school. But when you really get down to what’s at NIU, it just becomes more clear that for the price NIU is an excellent school.

The people at NIU are great, and in my first freshman year I’ve met some of my favorite teachers in my entire life and I’ve only had one teacher that I wasn’t too fond of. I’ve made some amazing friends, memories and partook in some excellent programs.

The price is not high, it was close to home and the education I’m earning plus the people I’m meeting leads it to be an excellent school."
Sophomore,5,"I actually love the campus, I love the diversity its overall a great school! Classes are smaller sized and teachers are great."
Junior,5,"I took a couple of classes online. Some where of my choice while others were the cause of Covid 19. Both times, NIU handled everything so well! Online classes are organized and teachers are always there to help. We even have a class Facebook page with other students as an extra support group. The teachers were understand and helpful. Wonderful work NIU!"
Junior,5,"My experience has been nothing but good here! I have made so many good friends while I was here, even as a commuter. Everyone here is so passionate about their school work and their hobbies. There are plenty of clubs and sports to join. They could work on the safety of their campus, as there are many crimes that happen around campus. Teachers and students are inclusive and support the diverse population. I have yet to meet someone who does not have at least one friend.  The campus is not too big, and they have enough space for everything. Early morning walks to class are my favorite! Truly an amazing school with a beautiful campus. I love NIU. GOOOOO HUSKIES!!!"
Freshman,5,"I am undergraduate so this would be my first year at NIU. The staff and students are very reasonable and willing to help you be successful. I am looking forward to my four years at NIU,"
Senior,5,I liked how it's a diverse school and the professors really make sure you understand the material. They're always there to help.
Graduate Student,5,"Great professors. Supportive staff. Affordable tuition. Opportunities for scholarships and tuition waivers. Hundreds of student organizations for every interest, ethnicity, religion, political persuasion, major, etc."
Sophomore,5,So far my experience with faculty and other students has been positive. Everyone has been very helpful.
Graduate Student,5,The best school hands down.  The administrative staff make it worth it.  They help you on everything.  I had approach other schools but no one does it better than here.  Everyone is always looking to help you.  I have never received the support I get here anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,"As a first year college student currently in her second year looking forward to her third I've felt like this school has been the best at making me feel at home. Not only did they help me transition from high school to college, the opportunities here and tremendous and has an abundance of resources and guidance for those feeling lost through their college career."
Niche User,5,I love Northern Illinois and I will be attending Northern in the fall of 2020. The thing that I like most about northern is that it feels like you're in another city. Northern is in it's own city and it's so many things around it and you can't get bored around Northern.
Junior,5,So far my experience has been great. Spring 2020 is my first-semester attending school here and my experience has been good. Easy to adjust and having no trouble feeling like I am part of the school.
Freshman,5,"So far, I am completely enjoying my college experience. Being a double major student means that I'm almost always overworked and stressed out, but the University is very accomodating in helping me with my experience. There are many study spaces that accommodate student preferences of study spaces which are open until late hours, which I find very helpful."
Graduate Student,5,"I love the commitment to student-centered service that I have experienced at NIU! My current program in Clinical Mental Health Counseling has challenged me to participate in introspective reflections, and to learn about a variety of worldviews and cultures. The faculty is very passionate. It is my hope that all students can have such amazing faculty teaching their classes."
Niche User,5,They have a great new sports complex. I recently attended a baseball camp and I was very impressed with the facility and the professionalism of the coaching staff.   As I search for a college to attend NIU will on the list.
Freshman,5,I enjoy many of the on campus events and constant encouragement you get from your teachers.You’re constantly involved in something where it be an after class club or floor meetings that discuss norms and helpful tips for everyday dorm life.
Freshman,5,"Northern Illinois University is a small campus feel with a big campus reach.  Excellent academics and goes above with campus security, making community groups that support growth for all students!"
Niche User,5,This is a really great school! very hands on and intimate. Many opportunities and help to students in need.
Senior,5,"Amazing professors. They inspired me to do my best. I was able to attend campus conferences, talks on campus, and present at regional conferences. I attended a community college before N.I.U., yet the world opens up when the faculty and staff provide mentor ship to students. ‘‘Tis was key for my great experience. I had the desire to accomplish different outcomes, which paved the path to receive assistance."
Niche User,5,I would say this is a great college because I had a college fair and this guy showed up talking about this college. I was very fascinated into what he was telling us about this school. I didn't ever stop asking him questions because I wanted to just learn more and more and more. I asked questions like Can I still do sports when I study for my major? And I can. I asked about the environment when the people around there. The spokes person said it was a great enviorment to be in that the people are super helpful. There's alot of activites to do around campus and more.
Junior,5,"NIU has a rich diverse student atmosphere and phenomenal instructors. I love the free tutoring and writing assistance. Student payment for fines, tuition and fincial assistance needs to be updated(Only payments via cash, check, bank or Master card/Discover but not Visa or various credit companies are accepted)"
Sophomore,5,"Being a member of the NIU Huskie community means to me that our campus community promotes understanding and respect both on and off campus.  The NIU Huskie community embraces diversity by not only sponsoring unique diverse programs but as well as having students, faculty, and staff from various religious, cultural backgrounds and diverse lifestyles attend NIU. It allows us to support one another, interact, share experiences and our life struggles.  I will learn new skills, doing something that I love and getting to know new people, from academics to students, who will be working with me shoulder to shoulder through this important time in my life. Having this open bond with others is what builds valuable relationships and gives me a deeper sense of belonging and that is why I chose to become a member of the NIU Huskie community."
Senior,5,"Northern Illinois University offers many opportunities to meet different people and become involved on campus. NIU offers many financial assistance as long as you keep your gpa up. The campus is committed to offering healthy options and accommodating for students with health issues and disabilities. There are many options on campus to increase the safety, students can utilize Huskie safe line which is a late night bus service from 11pm-5am. It allows students to travel in the middle of the night with campus security driving the buses."
Niche User,5,"I love the fact that the university is so close to downtown and the dorms have lots of room. I have not been to many sporting events, but D1 hockey is amazing to watch. I cannot wait to attend NIU in the fall."
Freshman,5,"I am loving it here, everyone is supportive and wants to have you succeed. The campus is very well connected and you can get where you are going pretty fast."
Niche User,5,"When I went to visit NIU, I felt welcomed. The people was so friendly, the food was good & EVEN the parties were fun. I have family that attend there & they also recommended me to attend there."
Alum,5,"I truly enjoyed my classes.  I was an art major, and took some education classes as well and I had some really wonderful professors that truly cared about their students and they were genuinely passionate about what they taught.  I am honestly considering going back to get my minor before I continue on to my master's degree.  

The only complaint I have is transferring from another state can be a little difficult, credits may not transfer directly, but because of my experience with the professors I still gave this university a 5 star."
Sophomore,5,"Between the huge lectures and social events, I'd say I was nervous enrolling into a university. However, NIU did a great job transitioning freshman into the college lifestyle. For example, there are office hours for those students who need that one-on-one advising. There are also fraternity's and sorority's that host events to help rush incoming students. I'd rate my overall experience, 9/10"
Freshman,5,Very diverse campus!! And very helpful professors! Very positive vibe! Academics has a multiple amount of choices you can choose from! And the parties are awesome! Safety is never a issue there’s always police in every corner 24/7.
Junior,5,"Here at NIU, the faculty really cares about their students. We have an excellent accounting program that is catered to passing the CPA exam. Only thing I would change is the Barsema Hall parking lot...it has a lot of pot holes!"
Freshman,5,"Since I have been attending Northern Illinois University, everyone here has been very accommodating. Whenever I got lost, it was a upperclassman or a staff member to help me find my way. My professors all are friendly and when I need help, they offer tutoring hours so I can get a better understanding of the content.  The student life here is extremely diverse. This brings about open-mindedness and create new perspectives. Also students are more aware of the things they say and do to ensure no one is offended. Campus food is amazing. There are over three different dining halls to grab something to eat. Some of the selections include: pizza, burgers, sandwiches, pasta, a variety of breakfast, and flatbreads. The dorms are spacious and there is central air in every residence hall. There haven't been any disputes in my hall and for the most part everyone gets along. Overall, my experience here has been great and I recommend everyone attend NIU."
Sophomore,5,"Very diverse.Being at Northern, I've met a lot of people who share similar interest in things as I do."
Niche User,5,"I visited the campus and I immediately fell in love. As a STEM invested student to see a campus that truly devotes itself to its students especially heavily in the science and math department was very refreshing. I hope to go there again, for real this time!"
Graduate Student,5,I am pursuing my masters in nursing education and this school has helped shaped me as an educator and leader!
Niche User,5,"NIU - College of Business is a sleeping giant!! i highly recommend the Marketing program!!

This program partners with organizations like Second City. Get ready to have fun while sharpening and honing your skills as a young professional in the marketplace. Also a great place for adults able to work nights! Or take their online Digital Marketing program!"
Freshman,5,"Northern Illinois University was a means to getting my degree. It is located close to the Chicago land area, so I was able to feel the college independence, while still getting support from my family.  Their prior experience helped me navigate through N.I.U.'s system. It is a big university, so I had to get used to being a number, rather than a name.  Eventually, I was able to manage and navigate through the systems of support I needed to be successful."
Senior,5,"Northern Illinois University is home to nationally-ranked programs that aim to further the education of thousands of students each year. Inside and out of the classroom, students find themselves completely engaged in all that they do."
Sophomore,5,I like the diversity the campus offers. I think there is a place for everyone. The classes offered are great. I also love how the staff is so helpful. All you have to do is ask and they are glad to help.
Niche User,5,It was a great place to make connections and meet different new people. I saw how the sisterhood has impacted the lives of different women.
Niche User,5,I didn’t got to Niu yet I’m transferring but when I visited during my senior year of high school I had a great time
Niche User,5,"I really liked the atmosphere at NIU. Also, they have a lot of a good opportunities for my major. I am going back for another tour of the campus before I apply for the Fall of 2020 and I cannot wait!"
Senior,5,"Northern Illinois University is a college you have to make the best of! Resources and opportunities are out there, you just have to grab hold of them! Latching on to a professor and/or program can pave the way for a world of success for you here at NIU! Don't miss out on possible opportunities!"
Sophomore,5,My first experience with NIU was amazing. I met a lot of amazing people. Not only that but the classes  I took were pretty great. I took a communication class and just fell in love with the professor. She was very kind and she helped me ver come some of my fear with talking in front of people.
Senior,5,"The atmosphere is amazing! There are so many different things to do around campus! The teachers are wonderful! The teachers in the art building are just a few of the most encouraging people on campus. I've met other teachers from other degrees and they are just as encouraging! A lot of teachers will spend time getting to know students, as well as, helping students with their academic goals. Not only are the teachers amazing, students just as amazing! There are lots of different clubs and organizations people can join. There is a club or organization for almost everything! A lot of organizations will host events or take trips."
Graduate Student,5,"Unlike other colleges, NIU sets students up to succeed. The professors care about their students success and help them through their classes. There are many resources for students to utilize."
Senior,4,"NIU is a great school and for the most part meeting all of my expectations i had when arriving. it was a little nerve wrecking moving away from home as i was nervous about being an out cast or not making new friends, but i had quickly found out that was not going to be the case, students are very interacted with one another from class projects to study groups. aside from that, the professors at this university are outstanding. all professors that iv had teach with a passion and sense of humor that go hand in hand with one another. they are very interacted with their students as well hoping for the best for them all and willing to go above and beyond to make sure they have done their part so all students can succeed in their course. the campus lay out is very nice and everything is very close to one another all with in a radius of 2 miles from each other, from the dorms, to the buildings classes take place in to the facilities to work out or go play basketball with friends."
Senior,4,"i was very nervous about this online experience that is currently going on. iv never been the best at sitting at a computer learning, i tend to get very distracted easily but my professors are very lenient during these times and have found a way to not make this experience all that hectic. they have really gone above and beyond as well to making sure i am succeeding with material that could be difficult the first time around by offering more than usual office hours and great peer tutoring assistance."
Junior,4,"surprisingly good, given the state of the rest of the school. This is mostly because of the dedication of the professors."
Junior,4,There were some crimes but the neighborhood is very aware and is there to help. It could be too quiet for someone who is used to the city.
Sophomore,4,Everything is pretty nice when you get used to it. People are nice and there isn't really any problems there
Junior,4,"NIU has great teachers that are willing to help you whenever you need it. There are many clubs and ways to get involved at NIU. The campus is elegant and clean. The price to go to NIU is a bit high compared to others in the state. Unfortunately, NIU isn't in the safest part of town and there has been one shooting in a campus parking lot within my first semester of going here. Overall, NIU is a great school but there are probably better options for the price."
Sophomore,4,"Overall a great school with resources fit for all careers that are being followed at this school. However, it is expensive."
Sophomore,4,So far being online has been difficult with the professors just uploading videos without actually teaching through virtual calls almost like it is live. It is hard to stay on track and keep up with all the work since we are given more because we are at home.
Senior,4,NIU is a good value school. The tuition is fairly priced and there are no pointless fees that most colleges charge. The campus is pretty nice some of the interiors of classrooms need updating.
Freshman,4,We're just starting school in Northern Illinois so I don't really know that much about the campus. The way that teachers have feeder does this work week though and it is amazing in Great. They are prepared to help us out and did you help us out in so many ways right now and they are understanding.
Freshman,4,My online experience with Northern Illinois is going pretty good so far. I'm understanding what I'm supposed to do and I can't really say that much because it is my first week but it's been good so far.
Sophomore,4,"I have had a few course being taught all virtually due to the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. In my opinion, my instructors did a great job relaying class information and deadlines to us. Although I definitely prefer face-to-face instruction, I do not mind taking online courses at NIU since my teachers actually put effort into creating a structured virtual environment."
Freshman,4,Well so far I have not taken any online classes. That's not to say that I won't be taking any online classes especially because of covid-19.
Sophomore,4,"At the beginning of the 2019-2020 academic year, NIU started off the Fall semester with face to face instruction with the teacher and student and the Fall semester went smoothly and according to plan. As the Spring semester began and COVID-19 began to emerge, face to face classes began to transition from face to face to all online. I can't speak for everyone on campus, but through our online instruction NIU was very understanding considering the circumstances. Faculty and Staff were more helpful than ever and I thank them for that. I finished that semester with some of my best grades yet."
Alum,4,The campus is huge. There's a lot of programs and organizations students can join. The school promote both very well. I enjoy that the building I attend for courses is filled with people who share the same major as me. Something the school can change is segregation the school have. The parties on campus only blacks attend. Black frats and sororities do not have their own house while white do.
Alum,4,Online classes were amazing and teachers were able to teach material just like it was a regular classroom. Depending on the teacher the workload could be a lot or it could be minimal and mostly relying on exams and tests. The teachers gave great feedback and were available when I needed help.
Sophomore,4,I love Northern Illinois University. Home of the Huskies!!! I am currently a student at NIU and I like it.
Sophomore,4,My online learning experience with NIU was good but challenging. I had some difficulty transitioning from in person to online but I give NIU credit. They handled it very well and adapted o the fly.
Sophomore,4,"Northern Illinois University is honestly a really nice school. Most of the faculty are amazing, helpful, and extremely nice and caring. Makes for an amazing atmosphere for students who are away from home. The food on campus was very good and they had a lot of different options around the campus as well. However, the only downfall was that the surrounding area outside the campus was a little lack luster. There wasn't much to do, so not many good ""hang out"" spots for groups of friends."
Sophomore,4,"Most of the teachers I had adapted very well to online classes, and most made accommodations and were extremely understanding about each student's situation. My teachers made keeping up with classwork just as easy as in-person classes."
Freshman,4,I took one class online my second semester. The class structure was easy to understand and the professor was always available to if I needed help.
Freshman,4,I like that I was able to fit into the campus very easily. Campus is easy to navigate and I feel safe in my dorm and walking on campus.
Junior,4,Northern has a lot of wonderful professors and students. I am impressed with how Dr. Freeman has been able to do the best for the students. The only down side is that it is very hard to find resources for people of color if you don't know anyone on campus but once found it is great and makes one feel more comfortable.
Alum,4,"I was able to work hard and have fun while I successfully completed my degree.  If you're looking for an affordable education, definitely look into NIU."
Freshman,4,I personally haven't experienced the online learning but the people I know have enjoyed it. Maybe one day I wil do the program.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at NIU! I had many life changing experiences and met so many wonderful people who had significant impacts on my life. Things have changed since I graduated in 2015, but I am proud of the things I was able to accomplish at NIU."
Sophomore,4,"Over the course of my experiences at NIU, I have taken several classes online.  Many of the general education requirement classes are offered online to students that commute and have busy in class schedules.  The general education classes that are online are really easy and simple to complete through the Blackboard and other online resources that some professors utilize.  I definitely recommend taking gen eds online or as many as you can because it saves the time that you have to go to and from classes and you can work at your own pace."
Sophomore,4,"Northern Illinois is a great university that gives so many opportunities to students on campus.  There are hundreds of organizations on campus from greek life, to academic clubs, athletics, and music.  Many of these organizations offer diversity and immerse you into the different cultures around campus.  There is a bus system that is great during weekdays, but barely runs on weekends.  I love how close campus is to the city of Dekalb and to all the shopping areas.  The school has a great mix of students who live on-campus, off-campus, and commuters. People at NIU are also really great.  You meet so many new people that are genuine and down to earth.  Overall, a great undergraduate experience!"
Senior,4,"I’ve enjoyed my time at this school, and when I’ve struggled there has always been someone there to help."
Senior,4,"There’s a good balance between the online classes,m. Some teachers will work with you while others offer a structured system."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes were a struggle, but at the end of the day my teachers handed online classes very well. They regularly sent updates out which made it easy to stay on top of my work and monitor all my upcoming assignments, projects and work. I was a student who lost a lot of motivation during covid-19 but even my worst teachers sent out updates and kept me updated about everything."
Sophomore,4,My teachers were very understanding and they made sure we could what needed to be done. Although i don’t like online learning it was alright.
Sophomore,4,I like that NIU has a very diverse community and a lot of available academic resources for students.
Senior,4,"Overall, i loved my experience at NIU. I made many wonderful friends and learned many things during my time there. If I were to change anything I would try to make the community a better and safer place to live. Dekalb tends to be a scary area to live in but as long as you are careful not to travel alone in unsafe situations you will be okay."
Freshman,4,The education part of school is there but the professors do not care very much for the students getting the work done and actually learning the subject at hand. Some professors go out of their way to help students while others just show work on the board and then you are on your own. Being in college is just being an individual working everything out by yourself.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy northern so far. My professors are very understanding and proficient. The advisors make themselves available and are easy to contact.
Freshman,4,"The campus was very nice and beautiful. However the campus is in the middle of no where. When you step onto campus you feel the good vibes at the school. The school is pretty diverse as well. There is a good mix of African Americans, whites , Hispanics Asians etc. The city of Chicago is also not far from the campus it takes approximately 1 hour to get there. If transportation is an issue getting on the train is always an option. I couldn’t see myself going anywhere else."
Senior,4,"I am a student-athlete, and the athletics department is awesome!  It has opened many doors and given my opportunities to test my limits.  Academically, there are a few great professors here and there.  Lots of resources on campus, and I feel safe when I'm out and about on campus."
Freshman,4,"Pretty good. Classes are easy. CHANCE Program is great, counselors have great communication with students and give really good advice on which classes would recommend to take."
Niche User,4,"I enjoy how large the campus is without it being too much to take in at once. The people there are great and the education is excellent. The only downside is other than Dekalb itself, you're about a half hour drive from any big towns."
Freshman,4,"Northern Illinois University is such a great school one that I am proud of attending to, one of the main reasons I came to NIU was because of the diversity that the school presented and coming from a high school that had a lot of diversity it was nice to see a college campus that presented the same environment. NIU is also very close to my home and coming home on the weekends has been very helpful to me."
Sophomore,4,Id like there to be more safety precautions at Northern Illinois. Very often are there robberies and shootings right outside of campus and I feel as though the university brushes it under the rug. NIU is very diverse and the staff is great.
Junior,4,"So far I am enjoying attending NIU. Teachers seem nice and helpful. However the online aspect is terribly difficult to navigate, and it can be hard to get in touch with the correct people when trying to call or email."
Senior,4,I have attended this school for going on four years and the experience has been very rewarding. I believe they have done a great job preparing me for life after school through the curriculum and many resources. The campus is  also newly renovated and very beautiful! The campus is extremely diverse and there are many different clubs and organizations to be apart of.
Niche User,4,"Great campus, needs more diversity. The opportunities to do things seems endless. Professors know what they are doing, and you actually learn. Visiting this campus from Chicago makes things very feel very different."
Senior,4,This university is diverse and offers a wide variety of resources. The newly renovated Holmes Student Center has become my new favorite hangout/study space.
Sophomore,4,I think one of the best things about applying is how helpful everyone was when I got to the school and I automatically felt welcomed. One thing that was a slight inconvenience was because the application was not in the common app it took a little while longer.
Junior,4,It's been good so far until now and I feel I have gained lot experiences from this university. The engineering department is good and the professors are keen to help you out if you are struggling.
Freshman,4,My experience at northern is decent. But I tell future students make friends because it is ruff and don't be afraid to ask for help and if your not ready go at your own pace; it's never too late.
Freshman,4,"I like how Northern Illinois University always has things going on for the students to do. They have many ways to get you to meet new people and make friends. Also, it's a little boring sometimes its suppose to be a party school but parties get shut down easily. The school is known for football so the football games are always fun to be at."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Northern Illinois University has been a mix of numerous feelings. I have met a variety of people, I love the fact the school is so diverse. Including the mass number of clubs and activities to join around campus, there are over 300 organizations to get involved in. Campus life is fun there is always something to do, also the library and study hall are open pretty late. The staff all over campus is very helpful when it comes to seeking help or clarification about courses, financial aid, bursars and anything else you can think of."
Freshman,4,I love how diverse the school is and how much they help me out as a young mom. They give me a lot of resources when it come to child care and paying fo rent. My support system is amazing here. They just need to stop the robbing off campus because it makes it feel unsafe.
Sophomore,4,I love living here and meeting people and the class sizes are perfect for a great learning environment
Freshman,4,"As a freshman student here at Northern Illinois, I have loved my experience so far. I cannot speak for anybody else but I have loved the professors, the food, the opportunities the university gives the students, and the different kind's of activities the university does. Like I said before, I cannot speak for everybody, I can only speak for myself. I have loved my experience here so far and I am certain I will continue to love it!"
Junior,4,"I like how large NIU's campus is, it feels like I'm farther away from home than I actually am. I wish the college was a little more student-oriented on stuff like the bus routes."
Freshman,4,"I am new here, but I like it so far.  It is a VERY large campus so it is a little bit hard to navigate and find all the places I need to be.  The teachers are very helpful and the SOTD is FANTASTIC!"
Junior,4,So far in my two years of attending Northern Illinois I’ve had a great experience and awesome professors that care and want to see others and my self succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I loved the diverse culture all around campus and the different types of learning communities offered. I am an English major and I love  my classes and professors, but I wish there were more open times for classes."
Junior,4,"I truly do love NIU, but the campus is definitely outdated.  If the school updates the main buildings and dorms I think an uptake in enrollment would definitely be a possibility."
Sophomore,4,"My experience in Northern Illinois University so far has been good and I have learned and realized a lot of things about myself. Some of these things include being able to communicate with new people, being outspoken as well as staying positive no matter what is happening in my life."
Senior,2,The classes that have always been online are great and the professors know what they’re doing. Classes that used to be in person and were pushed online due to COVID are awful. Professors don’t know how to teach content and just curve all the grades. I’ve learned nothing.
Niche User,2,"Hated every moment I was there. I kept my head down and nose in the books and pulled off a 3.8. 

Campus life is terrible, there is ""off campus"" shootings all the time. Students are more concerned with partying than putting in the work. 

Staff and faculty are rude and the financial aid office harrassed me for a whole semester."
Niche User,2,poorly staffed and low support for staff. dangerous campus. I have lived on campus for 3 years and it has only gotten more dangerous and violent since I've moved here.
Junior,2,"This school is slowly, but steadily going downhill. The crime here is terrible and occurs often and there was even a stabbing recently in one of the resident halls. If you don't have a car it is even worse trying to find things to do. Invest in a better university and campus."
Senior,2,The advising department and the administration have poor communication which affects students ability to graduate on time due to class requirements not being made clear. If they worked on this then The student would get somewhat of the education they're paying for. The area of DeKalb is not a safe one.
Junior,2,"Absolutely terrible. I thought NIU was my dream school but was disappointed by the lack of student activities and diversity and lack of faculty guidance. The more important part that really got me was that the crime rate is TERRIBLE. ITS REALLY BAD. In one semester there has been a stabbing, breaking and entering, and a robbery. I can honestly say from being a student that lived on campus, I would spend your money and time elsewhere, especially if you want to feel safe. Not worth it."
Junior,2,The professors are awesome however COUNSELORS for ONLINE programs are not so great at communicating and helping new students navigate through their programs. They simply are not available to follow up on their word to get back to you regarding your questions or concerns. When you reach out to them again they promise to get back but never do. Then things just get weird from there. It has been a terrible experience for me especially since I am unable to travel to the university.
Sophomore,2,"Northern Illinois University has a lot of potential to be something very great and give students a memorable college experience. However, they do not have great organizational skills, nor financial skills, and they do not support diversity. A recent article was released from our very own ""Northern Star"" university newsletter about the 1.6 million dollars in technology that has been lost. This is one of the examples of poor organization. Financially, minority groups have seen cases where $40,000 of alloyed grants towards these organizations had been dwindled down to a measly $3,500 annually while also making in-state tuition and out-of-state tuition the same. There have been noticeable decreases in student enrollment due to it being so expensive to go to a university that doesn't give nearly half of the investment back. It is sad to see such a beautiful campus decline."
Niche User,2,"The campus  is a little bit outdated and not modern. Also, the surrounding area is a little dicey. However, the staff is very friendly and welcoming! The buildings are near each other, which is a plus."
Junior,2,"I like that Northern Illinois University is close to my hometown. The old buildings are very pretty and some of the professors are friendly, kind, helpful, and inviting. Parking is one issue that I find to be a huge one. There are so many students that choose NIU, but there is very little parking. More and more commuters are attending NIU and because of that, I think there should be way more parking. It is beyond frustrating when you leave 45 minutes early for class and you are still late only because there was nowhere to park. The financial aid office is small, slow, and incompetent. I counted a total of five times that I walked in there and was told the wrong information, only to come back later and told something completely different. All this inaccurate information led me to have late fees and added another stressor to me."
Alum,2,"You can make the most of it if you choose, but it's nothing special unless your in business or engineering"
Junior,2,There is no difference in the quality of education between NIU and a community college. I wasted time and money going to NIU when I could have taken the same courses at a community college and not be forced to take bogus courses so the greedy heads at NIU can fill their coffers.
Freshman,2,"So far I haven't enjoyed my time here. Unless you are a partier or an athlete there isn't much opportunity to meet people in a fun environment. There also isn't a very large LGBTQ community. Dekalb is you typical small midwest town, in that it's conservative set in its' ways. The dorm you choose is very important! Neptune is great because you are so close to classes, however, the floors are so large that it is difficult to form relationships with the people you live with. The other dorms seem more social, however, they are pretty far from most classes."
College Senior,2,The social atmosphere is effected greatly by the Greek life. I personally don't like them very much.
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is generally safe, but the town is becoming more and more unsafe."
College Sophomore,2,I really wish I wasn't 17 when I started school because my parents made me pick this one and I never even visited it.
College Sophomore,2,Registration with the right classes is pretty awful in business.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of peer pressure on alcohol. I've literally had people shove drinks in my face even when I said no thanks and some people will get mad if you don't.
College Sophomore,2,There are almost always reports about 'off campus' aka the apartments students live in barely a block away robberies and muggings and assaults
College Sophomore,2,"I transferred out after not being able to deal with this hellish place.. It started with a horrible roommate from hell and ended up in the hospital from stress, bullying in the halls, someone breaking group therapy rules and trying to talk to me outside of group therapy, the headache that is the business advisers who will let you take wrong classes after going to them and then saying it doesn't matter because it counts towards how many you need for graduation anyway and teachers refusing to accommodate me  properly even though I have the government documentation. Don't expect to meet anyone who really cares about you other than what you can do for them and don't come in expecting to make friends and party. Get in and get out is the best advise I can give."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are a lot of crimes at or around campus. There are robberies, thefts, bomb threats, and home invasion. Definitely be careful, have pepper spray and keep yourself safe."
College Junior,2,"NIU does do a lot of things to try and keep the campus safe, but unfortunately a lot of crime does happen often. They send safety alerts to your phone every time there is an assault, break in, or any serious crime. I get one of those texts at least once a week."
College Sophomore,2,There are lots of safety bulletins on campus about shootings and robberies.  there are a few safety precautions on campus but once you move off campus you're pretty much on your own.
College Freshman,2,I don't like to walk outside at night
College Freshman,2,Some of the greeks have nice parties. The NPHC greeks are a rarity and you never see them. It's mainly the white typical greeks. There are a few racist frats that won't let you into parties if you're a minority.
College Freshman,2,I was sexually assaulted while attending school therefor I really disliked the environment.
College Junior,2,"Advisors are terrible, they do not seem like they want to help. There is not much to do around the area, few bars and no shopping. The weather is extremely cold and the wind makes it worse. I do not feel very safe at times and feel the university only wants me for the money. However, there are some professors who do care and help."
College Senior,2,"I feel as though there's always something bad happening there. I'm glad I always had day classes and never any night classes, except for my first semester there."
College Senior,2,"I'm upset that certain classes are offered during certain semesters. That can delay a student in receiving their degree. Many of the professors only care about getting paid. Look around online for reviews on the teacher. I have had a few great teachers, but a lot of them weren't that great. Many didn't care about the students. I guess that's why the ones that don't care about the students have a tenure. I was also upset that they only allowed some classes to be taken by sophomores or juniors. I changed my major a year after transferring there from a community college. I wanted to take a certain class, but I couldn't because I was going to be a senior the next semester."
College Senior,2,I feel as if they do an okay job at this. They don't recruit very well.
College Sophomore,2,Sometimes there are greek houses that are not focused on school or studies. Their main focus is parties and women.
College Freshman,2,"If you are a guy and not in a frat, then you can forget about partying. Fortunately for girls, you can go as you please."
College Freshman,2,"The only night I went out I came back to my dorm at 3 am. By this time, they have you check in through the front door. However, when I walked to my elevator by myself a guy approached me and cornered me and asked if I would have sex with him and he scared me so much. I don't know how he got in since he didn't live in my dining hall because I asked where he lived and he said the apartments. It was very scary and I don't know how security let him in."
College Sophomore,2,The dining hall food can be pretty bad. But thats all i can eat because I don't have any spending money so I'm forced to eat it everyday.
College Junior,2,I do not see any polices affecting students academic or social lives in Dekalb
College Junior,2,"actually, NIU is not a party school"
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to choose from
College Sophomore,2,There's not a lot of variety and the healthy options are terrible.
College Student,2,I had multiple problems getting financial aid. Most of my problem was the law changed where you have to put that you both parent file but file separate and it said I had the taxes wrong. Every time I summit my financial there was some type of problem that I did not understand.
College Freshman,2,There are way too many people in one place for my taste. People are jammed in a room and dancing to one genre of music. You would be lucky if you dont see any alcohol and drugs at the party either
College Freshman,2,"Too quiet, too boring, no fun, have no feeling of being home"
College Freshman,2,"Neptune is the worst. People here are obnoxious, they should go back to preschool based on the way they act."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't qualify for any scholarships or financial aid. I didn't get high enough grades in high school and my parents make too much money to qualify for aid, but not enough to pay for my education."
College Sophomore,2,You have to make sure to get a great professor or your experience won't be nice at all.
College Sophomore,2,The scenery is almost non existent or looks bad.
College Sophomore,2,"I was so difficult to apply for financial aid, and I did not even received any."
College Sophomore,2,It is very difficult to get into a physical therapy program.  There were many steps in order to apply to the NIU program.
College Sophomore,2,"Unless a student is going to a university related event, there is not much to do near the school."
College Senior,2,These cops have a power trip. They have nothing better to do but go after kids for stupid stuff.
College Senior,2,"It's typical for it not to be too great. Landlords are obviously going to take advantage of young college kids and exploit them for whatever they have. This means that they're usually pretty cheap and nothing gets fixed or cleaned because they don't want to hire someone to do it. Transportation is nice because there are huskie busses running everywhere. Usually parking is okay, not much visitor parking other than the streets. Costs are pretty low, but you're getting what you pay for."
College Senior,2,The apartments they use for the houses are pretty nasty. I never see the greek kids doing too much either.
College Student,2,The food sucks. It is the same stuff everyday. Needs more healthy options.
College Senior,2,"Alcohol consumption is a pillar of the NIU social life and is very pronounced.  On popular party nights and days with sport events, for example, drunk students and visitors line public areas around campus.  Drug usage is also a popular activity among students, and parties are often to host drug use.  Furthermore, drugs are very accessible.  Campus and local authorities are very forgiving of public drunkenness and underage drinking, but seem to have a very low tolerance for any other substance."
College Senior,2,"Parking at NIU is common complaint among students.  Off campus parking is arguably sufficiently available, though many (if not most) spots require a 10 to 20 minute walk to campus.  On campus parking typically requires a semester or year pass which costs something around $100, except parking outside of the library which is $5 a day before 7pm.  All of the lots can often be filled, especially on days with poor weather."
College Junior,2,Its colder out here than back at home in Streamwood.
College Freshman,2,We don't have much here
College Freshman,2,"NIU is known as a party school. Pretty much everyone goes out to party starting on Thursdays, that's why I usually go home on the weekends."
College Freshman,2,"I think they should have more busses that consistently after 6pm because a lot of students on campus don't have cars. Esp on weekends, you're basically stranded. Also I think the busses are way too crowded during certain times so for those times they should have more busses"
College Sophomore,2,"As far as campus strictness, it's very lax. There are rules in place but they are not followed at all and there isn't really any consequences for people how don't get caught."
College Freshman,2,"There are a few choices that are close to campus, but most of them are pretty far away from campus."
Senior,1,"Unless you want to major in business or Nursing, pick a different school. NIU has a terrible science program from professors to resources and content. I’ve had classes that are curved so much that a 66% is an A in the class. This means the professors are failing at their job. And this does not seem to bother NIU at all. I have learned nothing and the tuition has been a waste of my money. I wish I could start a new undergrad degree at a different university."
Niche User,1,Didn't take any online classes but this dumb review is demanding a 100 character review of something I didn't take.
Alum,1,"Blackboard and HuskieLink are not compatible with all types of screenreader technology, meaning that some students with visual impairments cannot use them or cannot access all of their features. Many courses require the use of Blackboard and all students organizations are required to register on HuskieLink.

These issues have been reported to different bodies within the university, yet the problem persists. In many cases, the university will expend more time and energy covering up instances of inaccessibility and silencing students than it will actually trying to make things accessible."
Senior,1,"The school is horrible. No assistance in any aspect. The school doesn’t offer a lot as far as majors and minors, orgs, and the campus is boring. Every year the school gets worse and worse. I wouldn’t let my worse enemy apply and come here. The people that work in the financial aid office don’t know what they doing. The HR office clearly hires anybody. I hate it here"
Junior,1,"Every staff member I have had to talk to has been completely rude, nonhelpful and annoyed I was there. Their job is supposed to help students and they seem totally annoyed you are there. I have had negative interactions with the financial office, disability resource center, biology advising, and regular academic advising. I wish they weren't so rude and did their job in helping students not making them feel unwelcome. Whatever happened to I'm sorry I don't have that answer or I am not sure. That is a lot more friendly  than how would you expect me to know that, or why are you here, and what do you want."
Alum,1,"If I could give it zero stars, I would. I'm an alum from 25 years ago and just as it was terrible then, it seems to have gotten worse over the years. As a teacher, I encourage students not to go to NIU unless it's their only chance of getting a college education."
Senior,1,Barren antisocial campus.  Dumb students.  The college tries to be PC way too much.  No one talks to each other.  Students seem slow and dumb and the classes are BS.  It’s like a community college but I like my community college better than this depressing place.
Alum,1,"When I first came to NIU, it was an alright school. Over the next 4 years, you got to see how toxic the politics were of the high administration of many of the colleges. Professors tended to very qualified but the programs were absolutely horrible. Not a safe campus, party scene was not so good, student life seemed very toxic. Food was okay, area is dull, and Campus is just a mess."
Freshman,1,Probably the worst public university Illinois has to offer. The administration does not care about students in the slightest. The grading system uses points and not percentages and does not include dropped assignments (which every one of my classes has). Meaning I do not know my true percentage grade going into finals. The campus is dangerous. We had a break in at the dorm I live at (Stevenson) where three students were mugged and a gun was pulled. The campus is way to big. With nothing right of the dorms but apartment complexes my closest class is a 10 minute walk (compared to Eastern which is a 2 minute walk from the majority of dorms). I can honestly say my first year here will be my last I am transferring to another school in the fall.
College Junior,1,very loud and noisey and i've heard some bad stories
College Freshman,1,It happens too often for me.
College Freshman,1,NIU is probably the worst university in Illinois. Avoid it at all cost.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid process is horrible. My parents have almost ran out of money and the only thing keeping me in school is my loans. I am in terrible debt and it just keeps getting worse because we aren't getting any aid.
College Sophomore,1,The police shut down every single party.
College Sophomore,1,Basketball has the worst team and no support.
College Sophomore,1,The Wi-Fi is horrible on campus.
College Freshman,1,This year has been crazy with the weather. It's hot then there's a blizzard! When it rains/snows it sucks cause it comes down super hard because there's no buildings blocking it.
College Freshman,1,"I live in Northern Illinois, so in the winter, getting around is very tough. It gets so cold here, so that makes it tough to get around."
College Senior,1,we're in winter for almost the entire school year and the bus system needs more buses
College Freshman,1,in the winter its beyond cold and you slip because ice be out
College Freshman,1,Living in Neptune having to ark at grant and it cold having to walk back to your dorm
College Senior,1,"In the winter its so cold and windy which makes you almost not want to be at NIU, and in the summer if you live in a dorm, make sure you get a residence hall that has a/c because you will regret doing that right away"
College Sophomore,1,None of the CA's are helpful and the dorms are all small and old with most of them lacking air conditioning.
College Sophomore,1,It gets cold way to fast here and its always very windy and rains almost every week.
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid office is run by students who don't seem interested in helping so it has been a big issue of just trying to get loans and financial aid.
College Sophomore,1,There is almost nothing to do off campus. The school is located in the middle of nowhere. The locals are also completely separated from the school. Also safety is a huge issue here and a lot of students don't feel safe walking around at night. 
College Sophomore,1,"The school is working on getting rid of on campus printing which all students, myself included, rely on almost every week."
College Sophomore,1,The rec center on campus is one of the smallest in the state and always crowded. There is not a variety of on campus activities so student involvement is very minimal.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The parking is ridiculous and extremely limited. Teachers and commuters get the better parking spots so for students who live on campus, you have to get up super early to get the good parking spots. The parking permits are a little pricey and depending on where you live, that will determine which parking permit you get. The University parking services will give you a ticket and the prices vary. You need a car out here to get around but the parking is so terrible."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The nightlife is pretty sad. There is nothing really in DeKalb for college sudents. If you are 21 and older, there are a few bars that are okay. There are no clubs and a lot of the house parties get shut down. If you come from a big city, you will get very bored being out in the country. If you do want to go to a decent club, you need to have a car so you can drive to a nearby city that offers more nightlife options."
College Senior,1,They are not active and are rarely seen in action on campus.
College Junior,1,You don't have to do not park on campus those tickets and fines are scary.  They are not worth it. Plenty of people I know have gotten tickets for even being parked somewhere and didn't even know they could.
College Sophomore,1,"Unfortunately the winter months make commuting to the university rather stressful. Snow, ice, wind and cold!"
Recent Alumnus,1,The buses use to run really well my freshman year and now they take forever to get from one point to the next.
College Senior,1,I would not recommend this school to anyone!  I have been given teachers that have never taught before and are horrible at it.  I am in my senior year and have not learned anything relating to my major.  I wish I could get my money back and go to a school where they actually know what they are doing and talking about.  Do not go to this school!
College Junior,1,The parking lots are terrible.  This has been a my number one issue with the University since I have been there.  There are never any open spots unless they are all the way 15 minutes off campus.  The teachers have majority of the spots and many always remain empty.  It is ridiculous the price they sell the passes for and the amount of stress that comes along with trying to fight for a spot every morning.
College Freshman,1,"I got financial aid but the school took away a scholarship because I had too much ""taxable"" scholarship but yet I had none."
College Sophomore,1,There are barely anyone around.The town is boring and does not have many main stream stores. There is not much to do out here. Corn fields are everywhere. Having a car is much needed in order to get to and from the stores in the next town over. The bus only comes every hour. I'd rather go home every weekend unless there are events going on on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at NIU is a nightmare all the time, if you have a car and want to use it to get to class instead of the bus service or walking then you better be ready to pay some money and waste some time.  You need to buy a special pass to park anywhere on campus- which is fine, except their parking is so limited that you need to get to your building or the parking garage 30+ minutes before your class to hopefully find a spot."
College Senior,1,"Parking is expensive, fines are often given out due to lack of available parking and the bus system that picks you up takes a long time"
College Sophomore,1,"And there is no handicap when m
y family comes to visit.  Parking at Douglas is awful!"
College Freshman,1,"Parking close to classes is very ruff,and it isn't too close to where you stay especially if you stay at Neptune. We get a ticket or get towed for parking in places thats convience for us but as well as being illegal."
College Freshman,1,"Dekalb is a small town that is all about our college and its students. Its not that much to really do here besides work out,do homework and eat."
College Junior,1,"The parking passes for non-reserved spaces are priced ok, but the locations are pretty awful.  Anyone can buy a pass, and they don't keep track of how many they sell, so there are more people  with cars than there are parking spaces and it's really difficult for commuters to find a space for the first month of the semester, so get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class starts.  Unless you live in Neptune, having a car on campus is worth it because the parking for residents is by the convo.  They are ridiculously strict about parking and will hand out tickets left and right, so park where you're supposed to or you'll get tons of tickets."
College Junior,1,A couple years ago had a guy shoot someone and have their house searched due to excessive amount of guns. Recently one dies due to alcohol poisoning. So I say they are out of control!
College Senior,1,"The parking spaces fill up very quickly, with the most convenient parking spaces completely full by 9:30 AM. Even the remote parking lot can fill to capacity, or worse, it will be filled with pond size puddles if it has drizzled the day before. If you have early morning classes or evening classes you'll be okay, otherwise it will be tricky for you. Parking and permit access is not prioritized by class rank."
College Sophomore,1,"Permit costs are not terribly expensive, but it would be nice if they were a little cheaper because parking on campus is just awful.  There is a central parking garage for commuters and staff that fills up by 9 am, and the other commuter student lots in good locations fill up just as quickly.  There is one lot that is a pretty far walk from most of campus that is usually available, but the walk is harsh in winter and it makes the price of a parking permit seem unfair. Parking services is usually not very understanding about extenuating circumstances, and even though there is not adequate parking for students they will be sure to write you a ticket if you are not parking in appropriate locations."
College Senior,1,The police pull you over for the smallest reasons. The residence halls are strict in allowing only a certain # of guests in your room. The policy on drinking is strict as well.
College Senior,1,Not a lot of good parking for off campus individuals.  Especially near barsema
College Freshman,1,I really don't like the prices of the dorms and you aren't even getting your money's worth.
College Freshman,1,"The dining near campus is unhealthy places like Buffalo Wild Wings, Domino's, and little small restaurants that sell cheap food but isn't good for you. I've gained a LOT more weight than I expected all because it's hard to find somewhere to eat healthy and conveniently/"
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is a serious hassle at this school. The price of the ticket is ridiculous, and you aren't even guaranteed a spot after paying $80. You have to arrive pretty early just to make sure you find a spot, and for commuters it is very hard to find anything decent. Be ready to walk half a mile to a mile every day in all kinds of weather."
College Senior,1,I didn't get enough to pay for my college expenses.
College Sophomore,1,"It's free, yes, but the bus rolls around every 15min and you could walk to your class in that same amount of time"
College Junior,1,"Not Much – There are some places here, but not the variety I am used to and like. I end up going to the same few places. Although, seeing as Dekalb is much smaller than the other suburbs I'm used to I'm not surprised, just whish it were better."
College Sophomore,1,"As a commuter student, I get to see all the problems with parking every day. At Northern Illinois there are mostly Blue and Yellow spots, (blue for teachers and special cases and yellow for commuters). There are never any spots for commuters unless you get there before 9 am while there is always blue spots open. They will ticket anyone if they see something that is even slightly wrong. For example, students can't use the meters at all. There are no signs saying this but they give you a nice little ticket if you do it anyways."
College Senior,1,"Like anywhere in the midwest the winter is cold. It snows quite a bit, and it is very windy in DeKalb."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not enough instructors – Most of the majors here at Nothern do not have a great deal of instructor to teach certain courses, so students are forced to take courses in other other semester because some courses are fall only and spring only classes, which results in a setback for their graduation year."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have applied for many  scholarships and have not recieved any.  The financial aid is simple if you can fill out a FAFSA, and the grant money is available if you qualify, but I have no luck with scholarship money.  I have written essays and filled out surveys.  So far no luck."
College Junior,1,As far as i can tell the Greek life doesn't exist i haven't seen much activity from the Greek culture at NIU.

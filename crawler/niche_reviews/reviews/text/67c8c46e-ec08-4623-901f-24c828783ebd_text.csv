Alum,5,"I enjoyed the close feel of the campus community. I think that the strength of relationships formed between you and your fellow classmates though campus-wide events is invaluable, and is needed to help you push through the academic rigor of Wabash College."
Senior,5,"Takes a special person to thrive in an environment like Wabash. By this I mean that it is not for everyone. It’s a grinding school, and if you want to be at the top you have to grind accordingly, just like in real life. If I had one bad thing to say, Wabash has been really bad in the recent years regarding who they have given tenure to. Some very deserving educators have been let to move on, and some who should have been sent away were kept for the long haul."
Freshman,5,I wanted to go here because of the experience of meeting Wabash students. My parents really like it too. I have really enjoyed my first semester and look forward to the rest of my Wabash career
Sophomore,5,"Wabash College is an amazing college and there is no college like it. With the feeling of brotherhood and tradition throughout the campus, you can see why many who graduate, come back and give back."
Sophomore,5,Great experience so far! Made friends effortlessly from the brotherhood instilled from day 1. Professor access also made it easy for me to find success in the classroom.
Niche User,5,"What I love about Wabash is the brotherhood they illustrate when you attend the college or even just there for a campus visit. when I first encountered and visited Wabash I didn't know what to expect considering they're a small school with only males who attend the school, however this would open doors full of opportunities because of how less distracting it would be; the opportunity to be able to meet with teachers or my professors without having to worry about too many students; the capability of achieving so much more than just the average person, because Wabash wants people to do just more than attending, but leave with a purpose in life."
Freshman,5,Wabash is a great place to go. They push you to apply yourself and aid in giving maximum opportunities.
Senior,5,"Wabash is one of those colleges that not many people hear about and even less pursue, but there is so much to Wabash that not everyone gets a chance to hear about. The glaring rewards of having one of the largest and most influential alumni systems should be important enough. The academic rigor that I have witnessed in the few days I have visited campus is challenging but is still possible with the number of resources they provide for you. Take a visit."
Sophomore,5,"When you get to Wabash, you’re welcomed with open arms and everyone there, students and staff, make you feel right at home. The classes are very rigorous and demand a lot of time for studying and that’s what has helped me gain the knowledge I have learned in just my first year of college. I’m very happy with my decision of calling Wabash my home for the next four years of my life."
Alum,5,"If you come here, work hard, and give your best effort in school, athletics, or building something new, you will be rewarded. The school pushes for entrepreneurship and innovation, and will guide you the best way possible to fulfill your dreams. Unique programs. However, the Party scene has nearly died completely. More of an academic atmosphere and can become stressful at times."
Freshman,5,"Wabash college is a great place to attend school. Even though it is an all boys school, it helps you stay more focus on your schooling. They have hands on experience to where you can talk with the professor and eat dinner with them, so that they can help you understand what you need help with."
Freshman,5,"This was my first year at Wabash College and couldn't be happier with the experiences I've been given and education that I've received. The professors here are incomparable to other professors elsewhere. They make time for you, not the other way around. The courses are tough, but due to the help centers that are available to the students, it is hard to fail. Here, you are a gentleman and follow the gentleman's rule, and in doing so the administration treats you as an adult and holds you to a higher standard."
Alum,5,I would like to see a commitment back to the Greek-life.  It is beginning to fade and fade fast.  The 50% Greek life is one of the reasons I chose Wabash.  Hate to see the decline in Greek life.
Junior,5,"Along with the challenging academics, the population size is small so professors are actually able to know their students. They care for all of us. When you’re not doing well in your classes, they will literally invite you to their homes for dinner and tutor you. Just an overall great experience I’ve had so far at this college."
Freshman,5,This college is wonderful. The professors care about my education and I feel included in everything from social experiences to athletic.
Alum,5,"Wabash is one of the last all-men's colleges in the country.  But the lasting quality of its educational experience allows its graduates to compete with and out-perform top graduates of the Ivies and similarly ranked schools.  The major difference is that our students don't typically come in with high grades and board scores, but boy do they ever leave with an education.  As a result, Wabash is arguably the greatest value-added institution of higher education in the country."
Freshman,5,"Wabash is such a wonderful experience to me so far.
The college is doing their best to provide students with the most excellent academic quality. 
However, that is not the only thing about Wabash. 
They're also focus on developing you as a well-rounded person with many skills that you can learn from all the clubs, activities, classes,etc. that you participate.
The tradition of the college is also one of the most compelling factor. There're a lot of things that I can name them all. But you're see when you get in.
Overall, Wabash is a college that stands out in a bunch of Liberal Arts College nowadays"
College Sophomore,5,"Wabash, our career services, and our alumni network are second to none. There are constantly opportunities for students to improve resumes and find job/internship opportunities."
College Sophomore,5,Athletics are great. At Wabash College we have great Academic and Athletic success. I am part of the Wabash Wrestling team which just recently took 3rd and 4th the past 2 years in the division 3 NCAA championships.  We recently got a new wrestling facility that is state of the art one of the best in the country.
College Sophomore,5,"Wabash College is a small college that is all about the success of their students.  It may be very tough classes, but with the Wabash Always Fights motto, Wabash students push through the difficulties with other students and professors that make it very easy to approach for questions and help."
College Freshman,5,"One of the best educations you can receive. A Wabash education is highly valued across the country, and even the globe. We have exceptional professors, a very challenging curriculum, a heavy workload, and lots of resources to help you succeed!"
College Freshman,5,"Men here are serious. We have fun, but we do it right. and safely."
College Freshman,5,The Gentleman's Rule does a wonderful job keeping the peace and safety on campus

College Freshman,5,"Couldn't ask or much else. New dorms, easy process, great community, fantastic RAs, and the Gentleman's Rule! WAF"
College Freshman,5,"I love it. I just finished my freshman year and could not be more satisfied with my college choice. Truly, this place is special. No where on Earth can you find such an incredible environment like you find at Wabash. It takes a certain kind of man to make it here. Wabash turns boys into Wabash Gentlemen and I am so proud to be part of it.  WAF!"

College Freshman,5,Everything is top-notch. It's definitely like heaven here.
College Freshman,5,There is so much school spirit that it is impossible not to go see the battle for the bell.
College Freshman,5,It was a long process but necessary because they don't make mistakes. Also a lot of students get scholarships that cover all the tuition.
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of diversity but no one is treated differently. Everyone is a Wabash man.
College Freshman,5,I have absolutely no fear about anything at my school. Everything is perfect and I wouldn't like to go anywhere else. Everyone here has a very positive attitude and would be more than happy to help others in need.

College Senior,5,It is always a beautiful day mixed with a beautiful campus. A wonderful combination!
Niche User,4,"I only visit Wabash once and got to meet some of the people there which kind of got me the idea of the student life. Wabash is an only male school and it also has a low teacher to student classroom ratio which is what I like to see in college  since it will be easier to have closer relationships with the faculty to have a better experience in college. But, that's not it Wabash's study abroad program its an amazing thing since the students won't have to pay to explore the world and expand their perspective globally."
Sophomore,4,"Wabash College has professors that challenge you every semester. It is not a wild and crazy school, so it keeps you focused on your studies."
Niche User,4,Wabash is a great school for men looking to better themselves and pursue their goals. The dedication Wabash has to its students and vice versa is well built over the decades.
Freshman,4,"Wabash College is a very challenging school to attend but the work is well worth the reward! The professors are extremely inviting, the atmosphere is uniquely exciting, and you will be a better man when you leave. Not to mention, 98% of students here have a job or are enrolled in a graduate program at the end of their four years here."
College Sophomore,4,My professors have been very knowledgeable of their courses and do an excellent job explaining course concepts.
College Sophomore,4,Mr. Woods does an excellent job maintaining campus security.
College Sophomore,4,"Many students are involved and play sports. Sports is what attracts many men to Wabash but it is the academic piece that keeps them there. The fan support is decent for small college athletics, but this is coming from a kid who played high school basketball in Indiana where I played in front of 1,200+ fans on any given night. The school spirit is incredible, especially any time we host NCAA tournament games or play our rival school Depauw."
College Sophomore,4,Wabash College has helped me become my own person. The challenging course work along with playing basketball for the college has been a challenge and a blessing. I have learned how to manage time and stick to a schedule. Wabash is unique because it is one of three all male institutions in the country. The level of tradition that is at Wabash is second to none as any alumnus will tell you. Our alumni network is all over the world and every single alumnus of Wabash is willing to help the next generation of Wabash men achieve our career goals. If I had to go back and do it again I would choose Wabash every single time. It is the best decision I have ever made.
College Sophomore,4,Its good especially the new dorms we just got. They are nice and very spacious. I really enjoy the housing options at Wabash College.
College Sophomore,4,Campus life is simple. I do not have a car so I remain on campus the entire year and I do not have any issues. People are friendly and talk to you when they see you.
College Sophomore,4,"For the school being as small as it is, the fan base is very enthusiastic. Football and basketball are the primary sports, in which Wabash does fairly well. The fans for the football games always fill up the home stands so the atmosphere surrounding sports is very vibrant."
College Freshman,4,"Its a small school, but were serious. We're serious about our education, our athletics, our arts, and of course, our party scene. There are a lot of great fraternity parties like FoamComing and Monon Bell. The parties are always on weekends because Wabash student are much too busy with, and serious about, their education. But those weekend parties are a blast!"
College Freshman,4,"There are some good bars off campus that are fun. But during the week its all about academics. The weekend is the time for fun, but the week is work. With that being said, there are plenty of opportunities to ""de-stress"" during the week, just make sure you get your work done or you won't make it here."
College Freshman,4,Great big melting pot of ideas and cultures. Very comfortable and accepting with/of all people
College Freshman,4,Great experiences. Im independent but a lot of my friends love the fraternity life. we have some wonderful traditions at wabash and the Fraternities do as well. Lots of fun parties as well
College Freshman,4,"We have some of the best Div 3 programs in the country. Wrestling team placed 3rd and 4th in the nation the last two years and has a brand new, state of the art facility. Football is great, always do well in the NCAAs. The Monon Bel game is incredible. The Brotherhood always supports every sports team. Strong commitment to each other on campus."
College Freshman,4,Greek life is a big part of Wabash.
College Freshman,4,"Wabash has a strong school spirit, which shows clearly during bell week. 

Can't complain about athletic facilities."
College Senior,4,Great athletic programs. I love playing intramural sports.
College Freshman,4,Its really nice. The rooms are pretty big and they all have A/C.
College Senior,4,"It is a small liberal arts college, so everything is small, but very nice and up to date."
College Senior,4,I received two merit based scholarships simply based on my high school academics worth over 5 figures!
College Sophomore,4,"I am new to the Greek life, but find that they are very community minded.  There is great support academically and socially.  I spent my first year as an independent and still have many non-Greek friends.  Most Greeks live in frat houses just off campus."
College Sophomore,4,"This is an all male school.  For the most part, dress is very casual."
College Sophomore,4,Wabash is quite a diverse college.  There are also many opportunities to share ones beliefs without feeling threatened.
College Senior,4,"If you choose wisely the housing is great, but some of the underclassmen independent living options are pretty bad."
College Senior,4,We need a few more parking spots but I have never found myself not able to find a parking spot
College Freshman,4,The greek life is amazing. Everyone helps everyone with everything. There are some great parties but most important is school work.
College Freshman,4,Most people do not live off campus because most of the school is interested in greek life. They really push the greek at our school. There are off campus apartments for rent for a good price but most people live on campus.
College Freshman,4,"So far, I've never seen an underage drinking, and there hasn't been a fight because they're drunk or anything like that. But the enforcement is strict, and you will get expelled if you are caught which is why people are following the rule."
College Freshman,4,"There is not really a need for transportation at this school. There is a train that runs between Indianapolis and Chicago with a stop in Crawfordsville, but that is only really used to go home. While at the school, you don't need a car to get around campus, it is small enough to walk everywhere, as in a 10 minute walk from the farthest points on campus. If you need to go into town, classmates are very helpful with lending you their car for a little bit or driving with you."
College Freshman,4,they do alot for the community and throw all the parties. And they uphold a lot of the traditions at Wabash
College Sophomore,4,The weather doesn't really affect anything here at Wabash for the most part.
College Sophomore,4,"Wabash offers many challenging courses. The workload is not going to be easy, but that's the beauty of Wabash-- it prepares you for grad school or the "" real world"" while encouraging you to think critically. There are many resources for students to use which include free tutors, time management consulting, and professors are always available for help."
College Sophomore,4,"The academics here at Wabash are very rigorous overall. The professors expect you to put your best effort forward in everything you do. I am a Rhetoric major and the Rhetoric department is very prominent in what/how it teaches. The professors write their own textbooks so they teach the students exactly what they know. And since Wabash is such a small school, becoming close to your professors and getting their help is very easy."
College Freshman,4,"I'm at Wabash College, and so far I cannot complain with the education level I have received.  I am a Psychology and Economics major, and I must say that the classes for these two are among the hardest I have ever taken.  All of the professors are willing to help me if I ever need it."
College Sophomore,4,Campus Is Easy to Manuever – Wabash College is a small campus. The best thing about the school is that I can walk from one side of campus to the other in 5 minutes in or less.
College Sophomore,4,"Wabash College is one of three all male colleges left in the United States. The ball male experience is one of many things that make Wabash College unique. Wabash College is all about tradition. The faculty of the school work hard everyday to teach us about the history of Wabash along with the intended subject. The small campus size ( roughly 900 men) makes it easy for anyone to fit in. Also, the small student size allows the students to create a brotherhood that will last a lifetime. I am happy that I chose To go to Wabash College. As our motto says, Wabash Always Fights!"
College Sophomore,4,"The greek life at Wabash is very popular however, both greeks and independents get along quite well."
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty Good – Two Immersion Trips: Virgin Islands and France
Difficult. But great classes."
College Sophomore,1,"There are zero clubs and bars in this town. Unless you want to drive all the way to Purdue, you will never go to a club while here. With that said, there is still a lot of drinking done on campus, Fraternity parties here get a lot of girls for being an all guys school."
College Junior,1,"Crawfordsville, Indiana is a pretty boring town with not much to do, good school but bad atmosphere off campus."

Freshman,5,"It has been an awesome experience so far, at first I didn't know what really to expect because it is my first time going to a school this big. I am lucky to be in the men's soccer team, I have meat many great people, whom I became friends with and they have helped me to become more familiar with the school and the resources in the school ."
Junior,5,Great support. Great professors. Really good social work program.  I love it. Having to transfer to remote learning was nerve-wracking but RIC did a great job with the transition
Junior,5,This semester has been difficult with remote learning. But with the help of platforms like Zoom is easy to say up on your work and do well.
Senior,5,"Online support was great so far. Yes, at the beginning was very tricky but it got better, and I was able to borrow a computer for the semester and the IT department was very responsive for nay issues with the computer. Professor have been very understandable and helpful while teaching online"
Senior,5,So far I have been at RIC for 3 year almost working towards my BA. The teachers have been very helpful with me and very understanding specially this year. I even get to borrow a computer because I don't have one to do my online meets and school work.  The financial aid office and the bursars has been very good as a customer service provider (I called a lot) and very helpful with the financial aid package and school payment plan.
Junior,5,The atmosphere on campus is very warm and welcoming. Upon transferring to RIC I immediately felt like I had fit in and was apart of this family of people that wanted to help others and strive!
Junior,5,Taking classes online with the professors at RIC was amazing. Not only do they focus on your well being as a student but they treat you like actual humans and don't only care about you turning assignments in on time. They are very understandable and want to make sure that you understand the material that is being taught which as a student made me feel way less stressed.
Sophomore,5,"It has been wonderful learning online, it was an adjustment but I truly did enjoy seeing how well our professors handled things and made sure we were okay."
Sophomore,5,I love how the professors and staff interact with us. The environment is very welcoming and I truly enjoy being on campus!
Junior,5,During the pandemic my professors made sure everyone was understanding the material and held online meetings.
Junior,5,It’s great everyone is flexible and always want to help other students. Even provide whatever is necessary to help students achieve their academic goals
Junior,5,I am currently a Junior and so far I love the diversity and their willingness to help students through academic studies and personal situations.
Freshman,5,Staff are all friendly and super helpful. RIC makes me feel like a student not just a number not like other schools
Freshman,5,Never took online classes but I’ve only heard good things and I want to try next semester to update my review! Super excited to start. I am planning to take a mixture of both in person and online classes for better time manage
Junior,5,"My experience at RIC was great, I enjoyed earning my degree here. The college is located at in a great area right in my hometown in Providence. I felt very supported by my advisor and professors as an undergrad, they are very knowledgeable, care about students succeeding in their courses, and connected to great resources outside in the communities."
Junior,5,"Some courses were offered hybrid prior to the Covid-19 epidemic, my professors organized the syllabus and blackboard in sync so its easy to navigate and know when to complete assignments. All the information and even extra sources are all accessible right at a link of a button. My education was just as great as taking courses in class. Professors create a flexible, rich, educational environment."
Sophomore,5,"Rhode Island College is one of the best! I am currently in the nursing program and it is preparing me for the future. I have learned so much just from being there for one year. The academics are great, staff, teachers, athletics. I am so grateful I am apart of RIC!"
Sophomore,5,"Rhode Island College is an extremely well built college filled with inclusive areas, empathetic teachers, endless opportunities and resources students may need (whether it is mental health, disability services, or other needs). Rhode Island College is also a very diverse community. The college tuition may be a bit pricey, but with the endless opportunities and services given, it is worth it."
Sophomore,5,"The online experience is different than being in person within Rhode Island College. The teachers, however, continue to be flexible and empathetic towards their students that may have differing situations that could result in them struggling in school."
Freshman,5,"The fact that students and teachers are well integrated makes it very easy to feel like you can succeed to your potential. The ease of access to the college counselors has been especially useful for me, and when I have hit personal  the staff have acted amazingly with their support and have acted very efficiently in placing a very structured plan for me so I can balance my studies with well-being.All of the tutors are very supportive and we have lots of independence to get on with our own research and further studies. Also the great feeling of community and the support given to students that need extra help.The teachers are supportive – we are given clear goals for the future.Although students are all working hard and we are being academically pushed, there is always a feeling of happiness around the site."
Freshman,5,"My experience in college has given me a chance to sharpen my skills in my field of choice. There have been, and there will continue to be, many opportunities to learn more ways of improving my craft as a result of my time in school, which I am truly thankful for. For example, the Writing Center at my school has taught me many writing tips and rules that I was unaware even existed, and would still be unaware of had it not been a part of my experience."
Alum,5,"Loved my experience in undergrad and grad school. Great campus, supportive professors, fun campus life."
Sophomore,5,Overall I really do love Rhode Island College. The academics is very good. Although some of the professors are difficult it is a very good focused environment where everyone is trying to succeed. There’s a lot of support available if you need it no matter what it is you’re going through.
Sophomore,5,"Rhode Island College is great and provides a clean, safe environment for their students. Rhode Island College provides a wide variety of courses for students to enroll in to further on their education."
Niche User,5,"I liked the diversity and everyone there. No one was rude or in polite, they all were nice. Really would like tot go there in order to be closer to home and achieve my academics there."
Freshman,5,It’s a very close knit community. The buildings are remodeled and look great. A lot of different studying halls. All sorts of different clubs to join. RIC is meant for everyone
Junior,5,"I love it. great school, friendly staff and students. I have done so well at RIC and recommend it to anyone. Great nursing program which is why I am attending!"
Niche User,5,The school is very accessible and affordable. The program provides access to professors that are also professionals in the field and work in the community. The internships that are a part of the program give the student the opportunity to gain experience in the field and apply their knowledge and skills in real world setting. ”
Junior,5,Small so teachers and student interact. Most teachers are open to helping outside of class and you can make a good relationship with professors that way. Beautiful campus!
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman commuter student at Rhode Island College and so far my experience has been excellent. My current professors and peers are extremely kind and encouraging. I enjoy the small school atmosphere and the many resources available on campus whether it's situations with school or your personal life, there's someone to help."
Graduate Student,5,"Amazing professors, classrooms are small and interactive. Amazing academics, campus is easy to navigate, a lot of updates buildings and technology. Love the atmosphere."
Junior,5,the school it self is good and know is geting better with the new consturction. the teachers here are nice and they want to help you learn and pass the class. what i would like to change is the food and how much the books cost.
Freshman,5,Rhode Island College is such an amazing school to go to because all the staff is very helpful and has such a positive attitude that makes being there a better place.
Sophomore,5,so far I've had a very good experience at ric. I've made a lot of good friends and the classes and professors are very good.
Junior,5,Rhode Island College is a great school! It has a healthy environment of students and lots of activities that go on throughout campus. The community is super friendly and overall a good atmosphere.
Junior,5,"I love Rhode Island college because of its Diversity, professor, environment, welcoming, friendship, safety"
Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed RIC so far. I have live on campus and enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I have met there.
Junior,5,"As a current Junior at the college, I cannot stress the importance of this institution to the community and the state as a whole. The campus is located just outside of the city and is a joy to walk through. The scenery is gorgeous, and someone is always waving or stopping you for a quick chat. Every professor that I have taken has had a positive impact on my education and given me skills that I can utilize in my future career. The professors are also passionate about the individual subjects of which they teach. You can get a quality education for a tuition price lower than many colleges in the area. I would definitely recommend RIC to others pursing a college career."
Sophomore,5,Rhode Island College has a wonderful atmosphere and is focused on nothing other than their students education along with their experience on campus. It's a wonderful school!
Senior,5,"great professors, small class sizes, great bang for your buck in terms of money compared to what you get academically! Not too many events on campus though, if you can live with that!"
Junior,5,It provides good resources to every student and it haves a good environment for student to express themselves
Junior,5,"As a transfer student, I feel RIC has done quite alot in order to make me feel welcome. It houses many resources that have become a regular part of my school routine. Everyone is very kind and willing to take time out of their day to help. Professors try their best to make sure students get the most out of there classes and are happy to assist outside of class hours. Many programs such as study abroad are openly broadcasted making for potential access to be planned rather than chance. The campus itself is easy enough to navigate while still being an adventure to explore. Parking can be a hassle but as the old saying goes ""the early bird catches the worm"". Overall it's a well packaged experience."
Graduate Student,5,"Rhode Island College is a small, tightly knit community of teachers and students. This allows for relatively small class sizes that help you truly learn. The professors are extremely caring and helpful. They often stay after class and make appointments for extra help if needed. I would 100% recommend this college. Thank you for an amazing education RIC!!"
Freshman,5,I am a freshman and there’s so many opportunities to be involved in campus! There are also many different types of events to attend from sports to movie nights. I believe that there is something for everyone at Rhode Island College. It also provides a great education for a low price. You’ll take classes you love while making lifelong friends too.
Freshman,5,I like how it is very diverse and the college experience has been great. The professor are really caring and want you to succeed.
Niche User,5,"I am going to Rhode Island College this heat and I am going to a a Freshman there. I have your bed the school and taken trips there multiple times already. The campus is very nice, and so are the students. They have lots of great opportunities for all students and the stuff is amazing. I look forward to going to school at Rhode Island College for the best four years because I know that it is a great school that will help me in my future."
Freshman,5,"Many activities going on, always fun. Residential halls are nice. Many buildings across campus have been renovated. Overall great experience"
Niche User,5,"I have not yet attended Rhode Island College, but my experience from my tour there was unforgettable. The student showing us around informed us of all the great things on campus and around the school. The campus has ssuch a welcoming feel and all the students there are so nice and always are there to help."
Junior,5,So far I really like this college. There are a ton of resources there and the staff really wants you to succeed. I just wish it was easier to pay for.
Junior,5,"Going to a college known nationwide for their Education program, I am proud to attend this school, studying Special Education. For an affordable cost, I am receiving a quality education, and am getting an abundance of experience in my field. Rhode Island College ensures that their graduates will be more than ready to excel in their rewarding careers through the opportunities the college provides for their students."
Junior,5,"Great school, friendly professors. Great for commuters. School is remodeling some buildings which is great."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed the opportunities presented for people who aren't as bright or had trouble understanding their classes because as an international student, the curriculum and way of life here in America is somewhat different and I was grateful for the help that was provided for me. for a change I would like to see diversity on the campus."
Junior,5,"So far, I do love the diversity. I walk around and everyone looks so different. I also see how kind everyone is towards one another. I love how patient the staff is. When I was registering the first time, people were kind and helping me the best way they can. 
Something I would want to change is probably the process itself of registering for classes. It was a bit confusing for me. Other than that, I have no complaints."
Senior,5,Great nursing program that really prepares its students for the NCLEX. Students who graduate from here have at least a 90% pass rate. The program also really prepares  you for the nursing work force.
Junior,5,"Rhode Island College is a great college for in-state and out-of-state students alike. With great degree programs and extra-curricular activities, and friendly people from the students to the faculty and staff. The professors are very passionate in what they teach, and are willing to do anything that they can to help you succeed in both your classes and your personal goals. If you choose to attend Rhode Island College you will get a rich college experience, full of knowledgeable professors, friendly peers, and a well landscaped college campus. Being a RI native, there is no other school that I would choose."
Graduate Student,5,I graduated back in 2010. I met some pretty awesome people whom I’m still friends with. I enjoyed most of my classes and enjoyed the campus life a lot!
Graduate Student,5,"Rhode Island College has been such an amazing experience. Although it is a small commuter school,  they have plenty of activities and student organizations to be involved in.  I completed my undergraduate degree in the Feinstein School of Education and am now continuing onto my graduate degree in Social Work.   I suggest taking advantage of professors office hours and spent time on campus!  Also, Learning 4 Life (L4L) and ALLIED (leadership course)"
Sophomore,5,As a freshman right out of high school I wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had great proffesors who were easy to talk to. The others students no matter where they were from or the age difference were all very welcoming and just great people all around.
Junior,5,"Rhode Island College was an easy transition for me as a single working parent. I applied in 2015, and was called in to interview with staff because I am an ""adult learner,"" and I have not been to school in quite some time. I believe this interview was to observe me, and see what my future goals were, but more importantly, why the school should accept me as part of their student population. Not to say that I wasn't worth it, but to see how serious I was about attending after being away from school for so long. I understand as a learning institution, that fostering a students academia and talents are taken seriously, and they wanted to see if I was ready as well. Furthermore, I was accepted, and I now have 72 credits, and I am looking forward to enrolling in graduate school in the near future. RIC has definitely opened some doors for me that I never knew were possible. The teachers are great, and the night classes offered work perfect for parents who work during the day."
Graduate Student,5,I love rhode island college the professors there care for you and work with you to succeed. My mentor and my advisors are the best people I have met and they want nothing but the best out of you the student life is great and the environment is wonderful especially during the fall semester.
Freshman,4,"I have been taking classes online and at first it wasn't easy to adapt, especially because of so many distractions we have at home however I managed to pull through and I have been enjoying every moment of it. I have amazing professors that help us with many things and they are very good people with a lot of empathy."
Junior,4,"The professors at RIC are very caring and will help you when you are struggling, some go above and beyond to help you. The only complaint is the yearly increasing tuition."
Sophomore,4,Online learning has been extremely challenging however it is worth it. I would rather learn online than not at all. I am so thankful that RIC has provided a great way for students to learn online.
Freshman,4,"At first, it was incredibly difficult transitioning to online learning, but gradually as the months went by I was slowly getting used to it. Though I felt I was not getting a good amount of social interaction from my peers, I find online learning to be much more beneficial for me as a student. It gave me the opportunity to learn at my own pace, and if clarification were needed, I would send an email to my teacher quickly and efficiently.I would love to have online learning integrated into the natural college environment,  as I got so much more done in such a shorter time, and I feel like I'm actually learning the material and not just grazing over it like I would in a standard classroom.I felt as though my anxiety has dropped tremendously while being home, because if something were to go wrong with my tech, I can simply pause what I'm doing and fix it."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed the size of the classes. It made me feel more comfortable to ask questions if needed and easier to communicate with other students.
Freshman,4,"I attended Rhode Island College's Orientation seminar for incoming freshman. I enjoyed the atmosphere, the library, and all of the staff seemed professional and knowledgable. I look forward to continuing my education here."
Sophomore,4,Go Greek!! 100% best choice I made for myself at RIC. If Greek Life isn’t your thing that’s okay too! There’s so many opportunities to get involved on campus and I highly recommend you do. Since RIC is a mostly commuter school it can be hard to make connections with people. Definitely worth it to at least learn about all the groups on campus. Whether you decide to join on or not totally your choice but I know I can say for myself it helped make college a better experience both academically and socially for me.
Freshman,4,"My experience has been good so far. I would only change a few things like the campus food, is too expensive and not all that. Also when needed help for example like building 3 you can be left a bit confused!"
Freshman,4,"I have not yet gone to this school yet. I’m attending fall of 2020. While taking tours on campus I was very satisfied with everything I saw. There was many different types of places to eat on campus. While looking at the dorms it seemed very safe. Each student has there own profile card to get into the sleeping building and other buildings when needed. I also really enjoyed on how the nursing program interacts with other schools local to us down town from us, and gives us transportation if needed. This may be a D 3 school but it's perfect for students like myself that want to major in something and also do a sport. Since 2013 I have played softball and I looked into doing a sport possibly at Rhode Island College, but my main focus would be to get into the nursing program and major in this area. If softball and nursing are too much on my plate I plain on focusing in my career witch is my near future."
Sophomore,4,"This has been my first semester at RIC, I transferred from a community college and I was extremely excited to start a new school and have a different experience. Before the virus, college was great. I would go to my classes and make new friends. The professors where always really helpful and would do would the possibly could to help with any struggles I was having. After the virus we had to transfer all the classes online, it wasn't a difficult transition but it was definitely challenging to change the schedule I had before, the professor all tried to make it as easy as possible and provide anything we needed to continue to be successful this semester."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed going to Rhode Island College because of the smaller student body. It was nice to see people you recognized as you walked to class. I also appreciated that many of the students attending this college are commuters. The students you are in class with are at all different points in their lives. Everyone is juggling many other things other than school which shows throughout the students you encounter. Everyone is working very hard to earn their degree while caring for children, working, caring for grandparents and much more. 
All of the professors I encountered truly cared about their students and their success. The professors can be seen working just as hard the students to create a great course."
Senior,4,"Rhode Island College is an excellent place to start your adulthood. for a state school, the Art program is an exceptionally welcome community, professors have justifiably high expectations, and will help students at every turn to achieve these expectations. I personally had a very good experience here academically. downsides are that it takes maybe 3 semesters to get used to how the website works (and honestly, I'm still unsure of how it works), Barely anyone actually graduates within 4 years unless you know exactly what you want to do with the rest of your life as soon as you enroll at 18 years old. This is a very serious school, dedicated to producing quality graduates, with real career goals."
Niche User,4,"I have loved when i went on field trips, i felt very welcome and i felt at home. I was very happy to see that i got accepted here. From what i heard, from everyone that goes there or graduated from there, they all say its like everyone is a family. This school school is known for having a wonderful teaching, nursing, and theatre program."
Sophomore,4,I transferred to RIC and its been a different experience from my previous school. They have a lot of resources to help you succeed.  there is also a lot of activities to do on campus.
Senior,4,RIC can be a very welcoming school. They try their best to bring students in. The School of Social Work is one of the best programs at RIC. The professors really care about their students and want the best for them. Learning 4 Life department cares for every students success and can make a big difference.
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman at Rhode Island College and so far it's a decent college. I feel students are more to themselves; they don't get as involved as they should.  The classes are designed nicely and some of the teacher's teaching skills are not as great or pleasant to some students.
Senior,4,This college is a campus that is easily maneuverable for people with mobility issues. The campus is diversified and safe. Provides a well rounded education. The only drawback is you really need to be set on what career path you are following. Needs improvement in advising and financial aid.
Freshman,4,Offer several majors from all spectrums. Offers graduate courses and advanced courses. Newly renovated science buildings. Affordable tuition.
Junior,4,This is an amazing school that helps students achieve academic success with all the great support services on campus. The professors care about all their students and want the best for them. I think the school should improve on staff diversity and the pricing on food.
Freshman,4,"I like that Rhode Island College is a smaller school, meaning it has smaller faculty to student ratios for better learning experiences. The faculty here are caring towards their students and want only to see them thrive in their classes. I feel as though I will be successful throughout my studies here at Rhode Island College."
Freshman,4,"I like how the campus is small so we do not have to do much walking. I like how everyone makes you feel welcome, it is like a little town within a town if that makes sense. Everyone is friendly and very serious about their education. Overall it is a great school!"
Alum,4,"Rhode Island College is an excellent school with a very supportive staff. The student community is tightnit, and there is something for everyone: small class sizes, knowledgeable professors, and a wide range of clubs activities, including Greek life. The campus has undergone renovations and is has beautiful facilities. Overall, RIC is a great bang for your buck if you're looking for an excellent education and location!"
Senior,4,I think all order the school is great. The teachers and advisors I have came in contact with were very great at what they do.
Senior,4,I love this place. Dorms are cool. When I formed I was in an all girls building. I made some of my best and closes friends there. Classes are awesome. Many options for classes though. Food isn't that great.
Senior,4,"This college is amazing, while most of the professors care about the students there are a few that just don't care, but there are more that do care. Some of the buildings are falling apart but they are fixing them."
Sophomore,4,This is a very calm school. It has a very nice and accepting environment. Everyone on campus is willing to help you out and is very friendly. There are many programs and services willing to help you with all sorts of issues or concerns you may have. They never turn you away or discriminate you. Overall the best quality of this school is the unity of the student body and faculty.
Junior,4,Teachers are good and very helpful with any of the work that is given.What i would like to improve is the ability to change my major without having any problems with credits.
Sophomore,4,"I felt comfortable starting classes here, they really make sure students are comfortable and have resources to help them."
Junior,4,"RIC is a good school overall.  After all it is what you make of it! You will encounter both good and bad professors just like at any other colleges/universities. Attend classes, try to get involved on campus if you can, and stay on top of things.  If you do all that, then you will be fine! You get a LOT at such an affordable price!"
Junior,4,"Rhode Island College is the perfect school that is not too big but not small either, there is a positive enviornment, I would like to see a change in admissions."
Sophomore,4,I love the variety of small and large classes that always me to chose the class environment bed suited for me. Campus life is fun and inviting and provides many opportunities to meet new people.
Junior,4,"It is a commuter majority local college. While it is cheap and convenient, the nature of it can make it difficult to meet people while going to class."
Freshman,4,It’s nice here it’s just really small but everyone is super friendly and the academics are pretty good! Just be careful with what professors you pick!
Senior,4,The great thing about this school is that the tuition is much more affordable than other schools. It is in a good location and I believe I have received a pretty good education.
Junior,4,"Great teachers, they really want to see you succeed and they go above and beyond to help any way they can. There is lots of room on the campus."
Freshman,4,Before i started i had mixed feelings but now that I have been here for just a semester I love it. I have met many now friends and learned many things so far. All of my professors have been good hard working people and put a lot of time and effort into what they do.
Junior,4,"I’m a junior in the nursing program at RIC. RIC has one of the best nursing schools in New England, it’s hard work but it’s worth it in the end. The nursing professors are amazing! They’re always willing to help and give extra help if needed. They know what they’re doing making the program 100% better, and they want their students to succeed."
Graduate Student,4,"The flexibility of the graduate classes, most classes are later the day or evening.  the state of the art simulation labs and the whole NEC building in Providence. Great learning environment."
Junior,4,It’s a small campus so it’s easy to navigate! Classes are small also which helps getting to know peers and professors very well
Junior,4,"I would like to be eligible for scholarships so I can continue my studies. Right now, I'm not eligible because I have to raise my RIC GPA in order to be readmitted into the communications program so I can prove that I can keep a good GPA.  This hardship is disappointing, and I hope I can find a way to overcome these obstacles."
Alum,4,"I loved the faculty and staff at Rhode Island College, it was always such a supportive environment. However, the lack of opportunities for students to stand out makes competitive graduate degree programs more of a stretch."
Niche User,4,"Many professors all of the country can be helpful and some may not be so helpful. Here at RIC its very easy to obtain a professor that is kind, always willing to help, positive, and just overall outgoing. All of these qualities make it much, much easier to learn. Take it from me, a junior at RIC, as long as your close to your professor and ask for necessary help when you need it you will learn everything that you need to know."
Sophomore,4,"I love Rhode Island College. Beautiful campus and always ready to help staff made me feel that this was a place where I could learn, improve myself, and earn a better education than in my home country, Poland. I took eight incredible classes, and I liked all of them, with no exception! Moreover, all of my professors gave me support during my first year and made sure that I was on the right track, which was very important to me, as an international student. I wish there were more scholarships for students like me, who are struggling with out-of-state tuition."
Alum,4,"I got a great, inexpensive education here. The school of social work has fantastic professors who all still work in the field and are able to give both an academic and real life education - which is priceless."
Junior,4,I just started attending this college and my experience so far has been good. I dont live on campus but just walking around it seems nice. There is plenty of parking available so as long as you are early for your class you will be fine. Be sure to check rate my professor before taking classes as I have heard of and have had a few that are not great.
Junior,4,"RIC is pretty good. I have been here for 3 years and I love the small family-like atmosphere. The tiny school was the reason I applied and went here. Over the years, most of my teachers have been amazing. A lot of them go above and beyond to help their students succeed."
Freshman,4,"My favorite part of Rhode Island College is the sizes of the classes. They are rather small, which makes communicating with your professors easy to do. In addition, the wide variety of classes allows myself, one who is unsure of my major, to try new classes that might help me choose my major. If I could change anything at Rhode Island College it would keeping  the cafe open later."
Senior,4,"My experience at Rhode Island College has been a good one. I have meet nice people, most of the professor are nice, caring, and understanding. The school has also tries to get students to participate in after school events and conferences."
Sophomore,4,"Very diverse school, has many majors, great professors, needs more availability within class times, needs a physical update."
Sophomore,4,"I'd like Don to get better tasting food, more options, and for a small restaurant/cafe to open up on campus. Also their shoveling and plowing skills sucks!"
Freshman,4,"Overall, I like Rhode Island College a lot. Most of the professors I have had have been very nice and understanding. Also, there are so many resources on camp that really make day to day life a lot easier. The dorms are also well taken care of and all the RAs are very helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I love Rhode Island college, I really do. It helped me get out of a dark place in my life and make friends and have the ability to do things, where I currently live is not available. The only major thing I would change is how the food is and how it is served. I believe we should have the ability to pay a certain amount and have a buffet style."
Freshman,4,Rhode Island College is a great school. I love the student life because I am not a party person. There are fun events that happen on campus that I attend. The academics are pretty  decent and it is not too quite hard to keep up with the work.
Freshman,4,"Rhode Island College (RIC) is an amazing school so far. As a freshman, I enjoy my classes as well as clubs, athletics and other activities held by the various clubs. The food is good although alittle on the pricey side if you don't have a meal plan. All the faculty I have met are caring and considerate. Other students are friendly and if not at least polite.the campus is very well kept, there may be construction but a campus that is not innovating is falling behind."
Sophomore,4,"RIC is a great college, particularly for a bachelor's degree, but you need to put the work in. The school is mostly commuters, but the campus life is not too bad. There are things to do around campus, however, the clubs and organizations could use some work and events need to be better promoted. There is some level of apathy among the students, perhaps because there is a small population of resident students and a lot of them tend to go home on the weekends. Therefore, it may seem like there is not much to do. However, Providence has a ton of nice restaurants, and shopping areas."
Freshman,4,"Rhode Island College is constantly innovating the campus so there is a lot of new technology to work with. The professors are very helpful and are willing to work one-on-one if you are having trouble. Some students may complain about the cafeteria not being the best but Rhode Island College is really good with switching up the meals and putting out an array to chose from so its not really bad at all. There is also two cafes on campus. Dorm life is something that takes everyone time to get used to but there are janitors to clean the common areas everyday so its not unsanitary to live in, and the RAs that work the desk at night are also really friendly. Overall the campus has a good atmosphere and the students are welcoming to new students and students of different cultures, nationalities, etc."
Junior,4,Rhode Island college has a fair amount of impressive professors that know and understand their field adamantly. It has an incredibly helpful staff and programs that allow students help one another in any and all subjects.
Senior,4,"I like RIC because it's very close to commute to others, especially since I use public transportation. It's also a small community. Most classes related to my major will contain classmates that you've been familiar with in past classes, or you'll see them in future semesters."
Niche User,4,"The school is very small so it's easy to get to know people.  If you don't live in campus it can be hard to meet people unless you do a sport.  However, the professors are interested one achieved student and take time to get to know their class.  The class size are also very small, so it's easy to get acquainted with the professor, as well as the other students.  It was a great experience for me, I highly recommend, even if you just go to do gen eds then switch schools.  Wonderful place"
Sophomore,4,"I like that Rhode Island College has diversity! Most of the profesors are friendly, and want to help their students succeed. If people have questions about the services offered at Rhode Island College, the staff are happy to help!"
Freshman,2,"I did not take online classes but I can say that online education is still in its youth. Many approaches are possible, and some may ultimately benefit students with deep and diverse needs."
Senior,2,"I have had a terrible experience at Rhode Island College. I am currently in my fourth year at the college and have no insight on when I will graduate. I have taken all required courses for my major on time, but since the Sonography program only accepts 7-8 students per year I have been set back two years. I applied to the sonography program twice and have been rejected both times. I have very good grades and am told each time that my interview for the program wasn't the best it could be, even though I gave clear answers each time. Overall, RIC has wasted my time and I will not be recommending the college to anyone."
Senior,2,I am in the music department and none of the teachers communicate to the program does not flow. However most of the individual teachers are awesome but there are some teachers who hold a lot of power over the students who are not so good.
Freshman,2,It was not the best experience academically for my first year/semester. I also had a lot of issues with unkempt roommates but the PEP administration are amazing and have definitely helped me out so much
Alum,2,"As a history student, the professors were excellent. However, it always felt that the school was run by a chicken with its head cut off. It took months to make my graduation final. They ""forgot"" me, and I had to spend hours playing back and forth with the records department. Because they kept telling me to contact someone who no longer worked for the college. Not a great experience."
College Freshman,2,We don't have Fraternity or sorority houses so greek life isn't very big at all here.
College Freshman,2,I personally think that all the buildings should be redone. Only one has and it's terrible to try to get into and I think that's not fair.  We should all have good options to pick from .
College Senior,2,"There are no parties on campus ever, and if someone tries it is in a suite with a small group of people. The bar/club scene are okay but you have to be able to get there yourself as there are none within walking distance."
College Senior,2,"A large portion of the school community, commuters and residents smoke weed daily, in there vehicles, or the dorms."
College Senior,2,"The whole housing system is screwed up. With all the new changes they have started over the last 4 years it seems to be less and less worth it every year. Freshman will be in doubles, no matter what. Housing of breaks is not offered, even with some academic reason, even when classes are held. Very frustrating to get over break housing permission and mis communication on pricing."
Recent Alumnus,2,It's not great. Very expensive for what you get.
Recent Alumnus,2,There's really no Greek life. There are only a couple of sororities but no Fraternites.
College Freshman,2,"The off-campus dining for RIC does not exist, but there is always uncle tony's"
College Freshman,2,The food on campus is pretty horrible. Unless you want to get diarrhea every night don't eat it.
College Freshman,2,"I know we have greek life, but we may as well not even have it at all. I've always wanted to be in a sorority so when I got to RIC I always asked around about it. I never heard anything really good about it ever. If I hadn't asked around, I wouldn't of even known it existed. It's below average (like everything else at this school)"
College Junior,2,Sports are not really a big deal at RIC no ones really pays them much mind.
College Student,2,"I don't really go to parties, so hard for me to rate this question and not why I'm at school"
College Junior,2,All of the building are really old except new hall. I live in Weber. The floor in the bathroom is coming up and the cleaning guy does not clean the bathroom once a week like he should. There is mold everywhere. I complained about my bed being broken 8 months ago and I am still waiting for it to get fixed.
College Sophomore,2,"Most students are from Rhode Island or close to it.  If your from out of state, you'll have plenty of people to laugh at because apparently our accents are funny and yes, a lot of people know a lot of people in little rhode."
College Sophomore,2,"The officers are really awkward. They ticket everyone they can. They watch you like they think your going to do something bad. Drugs and alcohol are very present on campus to students at least, policy's are strict since we are a state school. Visitations are a hassle and a half! In my opinion, if you want to do anything that will get you expelled, go do it off campus, there are 7 others in providence to visit."
College Freshman,2,"I live in Thorpe Hall.  The single dorms are very small.  The walls are paper thin so I can hear everything that goes on in other rooms and in the common room I feel like I cannot have a private conversation without someone being able to listen in on it.  Also, the noises distract me from my sleep and from my studies."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot to do off campus unless you have a car, and even then the only places in Providence that interest me are the mall and Thayer Street. "
College Freshman,2,"The spots are too tight and especially with Rhode Island drivers, there's more of a chance of someone scraping your car with theirs by accident, and they won't even notice or do anything about it. Parking also fills up very quickly and there's only one lot for residents and it's near dorms, so there's no parking near classes so in the winter you have to walk "
College Freshman,2,The campus food is bad because everyday is the same menu.
College Freshman,2,The police will ticket you if you park where you aren't suppose to. It costs alot for a parking permit but i got one because i wanted a car on campus. you don't need one but its nice to have. There are places close by to walk to if you don't have a car though. if your a commuter the parking sucks
College Junior,2,It is really hard to find parking at Rhode Island college I think this is the biggest problem here. Sometimes students have to park really far and sometimes the weather is really bad this also causes us to be late because there is no parking spots we actually have to wait for some to get out of a parking spot. 
College Senior,2,MANY TIMES HEAT OR AC ARE NOT WORKING
Recent Alumnus,2,The food is very bad quality.  Mostly everything is fried. Some of the food such as burgers are not always cooked. The dining hall is a good size and is always clean. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not sure what it is about this campus, but it seems like everybody is distant and guarded in some way. When I was at CCRI it was much easier to make friends. At RIC people seem miserable or emotionally cold. Have been here over a year and nothing has changed. Nobody really talks to one another before the professor comes into class, and if you do ask another student a question, they will give you a one or two word response and the conversation ends. So there is that first day awkward silence, everyday! I can give several examples but that would just take too long. I am not sure if many of the reviews on here are actually real, or perhaps students that do give these reviews have never attended any other college, or already knew their friends from a previous school, so they think this behavior is normal, but it is not. Long story short... it almost seems like nobody wants to make any new friends."
College Senior,2,many of the scholarships are to specific for any of the students to apply for. They don't have enough for students with financial difficulties.
College Junior,2,"RIC is a dry campus and the RAs really enforce it! Even if your over 21. Providence has a good nightlife scene, just plan to stay off campus until you sober up."
College Junior,2,"Parking can be difficult during the day, so its nice to have 8ams to get prime parking. However as long as you arrive a little before your class, there are spots. You just might have to walk a little bit."
College Sophomore,2,"Apartments around RIC are not easily obtainable. You have to do a lot of searching to get an apartment around the Rhode Island College area. There are plenty of apartments about 1 mile in the PC (Providence College) area, but they aren't that presentable."
College Freshman,2,"If you live on campus you won't need a car but will want to have one to get around Stop and Shop, CVS, and Family Dollar are within walking distance but not ideal when you have bags."
College Junior,2,"I'm sure Greek life exist at RIC but i am a day student, who work in other to afford school and a life after school. therefore it may exist but it is non existent to me."
College Junior,2,There are numerous races and religions on campus however there is definelty a majority
College Junior,2,"The facilities are okay and all, but you use only what applies to your major. So if you're into theater, you'll use the main campus for your basic stuff, but will live in the Nazarian Center. I've been in just about every building, and I mean they're not BEAUTIFUL, but they're decent."
College Junior,2,"Wifi SUCKS. If you want to watch a video or anything, go to the computer lab-otherwise your laptop is only good for typing essays. Wifi isn't so bad in The Donovan Dining Hall, which is sort of where everyone hangs out anyways (but there's no cell service at the Don). The computer lab is pretty much open whenever you would need it, and you get 250 free pages to print. That should be enough unless you're a Education or Nursing major."
College Junior,2,"Don't have anything to say about New Hall. I lived in Willard, which was quiet on my end, but parties were definitely happening. I've been told Weber is the place to be for parties but I'm sure that's due to who you actually room with. Thorp is probably the worst. Suites with like 8-10 people, but I mean I guess you'll never be lonely. Willard is the only dorm in which you don't have to check your friends into your dorm-it reminded me of an apartment which was great. You sometimes have to share a room with one or two other people or have adjoining rooms with a bathroom in between. I got lucky with a single adjoining another single, which was great. You do have to clean your own bathroom though :( I've heard Sweet Hall is the most bitch-packed. Weber and Brown are essentially the same thing. Campus is DEAD on the weekends though, beware."
College Junior,2,"I've known girls who played softball/baseball and guys who played basketball. Never personally saw a game, but just look us up, we're not GREAT in anything really."
College Junior,2,"Being a guy myself from Rhode Island, nothing ""special"" about us. Your typical New Englander at RIC, not many from other places in the US or International students. If you are from somewhere besides RI, it may be refreshing to you. For the most part: jocks, hispanics, computer nerds, other.

The girls on the other hand are a little better at RIC. Still your typical New Englanders but they just seem to be a little less susceptible to the stereotypes. Also, there are some good looking girls from the richer parts of Rhode Island."
College Junior,2,"I actually LIVED on campus and honestly it is so boring on campus that all people do is smoke. I didn't notice too much alcohol, but it definitely happened being so close to the Providence club scene. The ""safety"" was pretty much a joke. RIC Police are a thorn in your behind when you're too loud and someone else complains, but most of the time no where to be found."
College Freshman,2,I did not get any financial aid through RIC and I am enrolled completely on student loans. The process is easy enough and quick but not many students benefit from their funds.
College Sophomore,2,I have heard on numerous accounts of people talking about drugs.
College Junior,2,"It's Providence, so if really need to go somewhere, chances are you can walk. Other than that, theres ripta, which you can ride for half off as a student. Most students here just own a car and drive. RIC has no transportation system of its own."
College Junior,2,"Wifi Is Not Reliable – I live on campus and the Wifi is always going in and out. The speed is not much better, my advice is to bring an ethernet cord just incase. It has saved me when doing homework at 2 in the morning. 
I would defiantly invest in a personal computer being that the computer labs are not 24 hours, a personal printer is optional I got one for the convenience."
College Sophomore,2,Dining Is Far – Dining off campus can be pricy and a far distance.
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing to Do - EVER! There is never really anything to do on campus. This college is nothing like the neighboring schools - but it is the least expensive tuition for a four-year school. The students just come to class and leave straight after. The mapping of the buildings is strange and inconvenient. Nobody goes to the gym there because it costs hundreds of extra dollars to have a membership there, on top of the tuition. There is not much grass. The library is old and always too hot, even in the winter, and everyone talks loudly there, so it's not the best place to even study - it's better just to drive off-campus to a cafe to study. Nobody really hangs out on campus. There are no fun traditions. Nothing. But the students accept this - it's a cheap education."
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing to See Here – This is a four-year school that could easily pass for a community college, what with most of the students just driving to class, attending, and getting right back in their cars to drive home afterward. There is nothing special to keep the students on campus. The gym facilities are on the other side of campus and require a membership fee of hundreds of dollars, on top of the tuition you already pay and the ever-mysterious ""Student Union Fee"", a fee of over one hundred dollars which is included in our tuition. I can guarantee more than half of the students don't even know what or where the Student Union is - it is a bookstore on one floor, and two floors of just hallway and bathrooms and meeting rooms, for clubs, which mostly meet elsewhere anyway. I have visited friends on many campuses, and I am not at all proud when those friends ask to visit me at my school. It's always the same thing - ""well, there's nothing to do there."""
College Junior,2,"Not Much You Can Get Away With – Campus sercurity are aways on the prowel so it best to be where you are suppose to be. They pretty much have a law for everything you can think of. And the first offense is not to bad, but you wont want to do it again in the future beacuse second or third offense can get you suspended or kicked out. Drinking is also not allowed on campus"
Recent Alumnus,2,Great new hall but all other dorms need updates.  They are falling apart and gross to live in.  The process to select a dorm is not the best either-lottery.
College Student,2,"Don't Stop Trying – First, you need to fill out your Fafsa and be alet to dealine times and exactly what your filling out. When someone does not call you back from finacial aid, keep trying, they eventually do."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much housing at RIC.  Staying at the school is boring and sometimes creepy due to lack of people.
College Sophomore,2,Lack of Greek – Rhode Island College is not really involved in the Greek life. There are no Greek houses however we do have Greek clubs that students can participate in.
College Freshman,2,"I love my teachers they're funny and nice....but we never do any work. I guess that could be a bright side for most people? But, if I'm paying thousands of dollars a semester I want to learn something. Homework is scarce...My teachers are all really disorganized....and they just act like they don't care..."
College Sophomore,2,"Computer Lab – Here at Rhode Island college the technology we have is not very efficient. We have two computer labs, both spread on different sides of campus. The computers are slow when you first sign on, so if you are in a rush you're out of luck. During the day the computer labs are often very busy and it is hard to find a spot with a free computer. In the dorms, the WiFi is always going in and out of connection."
College Junior,2,"Apartments Are Low Quality – Many of the apartments available for students are located around the campuses of Rhode Island College and Providence College, but unless you are willing to pay quite a bit per bedroom the quality of these apartments are quite low.  These schools are in the middle of the city, so the neighborhoods and parking availability aren't the best either.  RIC has off campus housing assistance and the landlords seem pretty acceptable as long as you aren't too loud for your new neighbors."
College Sophomore,2,"If you like a quad with very little grass, most of it being dead, RIC is for you"
College Junior,2,No much variety or meal plan options for commuter students.
College Sophomore,2,Campus parking at Rhode Island College is a nightmare! Unless you arrive on campus before 8:00AM good luck on trying to find parking. Since most students at RIC commute there is a huge lack of parking centers at RIC. At times it can take 40-60min for a student to find on campus parking.
College Sophomore,1,"There is only one building/dorm on campus that is adequate enough and cleanly enough for students. It is the only dorm that students want to live in because of the layout of the suites. All of the other dorms are drafty, old, dirty, and a lot of times the water is cold. It's not the most enjoyable dorming experience."
College Senior,1,There is no party scene at the school at all. If you want to party go to PC
College Senior,1,The greeks do not have any housing on campus and I think are not worth spending the money on dues when you would still have to live in the dorms
College Junior,1,Not really a thing ON campus.
College Junior,1,it to expensive finical doesn't help at all
College Sophomore,1,we have sororities and fraternities but they aren't taken seriously because we are such a small school
College Sophomore,1,I try to avoid getting food from here
College Freshman,1,Do not come to RIC if you are trying to have some fun.
College Senior,1,I am a Rhode Island resident my whole life. And I hate it.
College Junior,1,No one is really into Greek life. No major frats or anything
College Freshman,1,"It's the same food every day and the dining hall closes very early, with only two cafes on campus (one more convenient than the other). They only have grill and deli and salad stuff everyday, instead of offering more choices like pizza and pasta bars (common food many people like) or other things. The dining hall is a separate business from RIC and scams you by setting high prices for food, and unlike other schools, you have a limit on how much your meal plan covers (such as your meal plan only gives you $8.50 for dinner, $7.50 for lunch, $6 for breakfast, if you go over you have to use bonus points based on your meal plan, or pay out of pocket). Overall I dislike the dining hall very much"
College Freshman,1,Off-Campus dining is poor because students do not have discounts and service is bad.
College Freshman,1,campus do not have bar therefore it is extremely difficult to find one.
Recent Alumnus,1,To be able to find parking be ready to come in 30 minutes to an hour before class. It is impossible to get parking near class if your running late. The good thing is rhat parking is free.
College Freshman,1,"The parking at Rhode Island College is horrible, if you want to find a parking spot you have to come relatively early in the morning."
Recent Alumnus,1,There are usually never any spots. The way the parking is created is narrow one way travel... so you have to drive around the whole campus if you do find an available spot.
College Junior,1,"At the start of Fall '12, RIC re-did their already miserable parking system. There are now 2 commuter lots (commuters only) that are reasonably close to the main buildings, 2 open parking lots (anyone can park there), 1 resident parking lot (dorm students only) and the rest are faculty/staff parking lots where no student is permitted to park. There are always spots in faculty lots, but students WILL get ticketed ($80 fine) and/or towed if they park there. Always get to campus at least a half hour to 45 minutes before your first class to find a spot. There have been times when students have missed class because they spent the entire block looking for a parking spot. Carpool or take the bus if at all possible."
College Senior,1,The parking on campus can be a complete nightmare. Attempting to get a parking spot after 9:15am until about 12pm is luck of the draw. The first few weeks of school are the worst. You learn to follow other students leaving campus and stalk them to their cars.
College Freshman,1,"Parking can be terrible for commuters, typically in the morning hours. We are a commuter school and there is never enough parking."
College Freshman,1,"Put simply, there is just not enough parking!!! The new teacher vs. student lot regulations made it even worse! I can't imagine what it was even like a few years ago before many of teh lots were expanded or created. Some days it has taken me more than 30 minutes ot get ANY spot, whether it be on or even off campus. REMOTE PARKING LOCATION WITH SHUTTLE TO CAMPUS OR A GARAGE IS NEEDED ASAP!

If it's any consolation, the police officers are not too strict; they understand the situation and let 'small' parking issues go."
College Sophomore,1,"There is little to no night-life on campus. You have to go off campus if you want to have a night life, and you have to have a way to get there. The buses stop early so taxis or DDs are the way to go"
College Junior,1,"They don't care. Period. About the only strict policies they have are: 1) Library closes relatively early-so study early. 2) The main & dining hall closes early -so eat early. 3) You have to check in your friends & can only have so many people in your room at Weber, Thorp, Sweet, & Brown Hall."
College Junior,1,"There is literally ONE dining hall. No. Joke. It's ridiculous too because they only have ONE section that ever changes & after going to school their for a month you'll get sick of it. You got your cheeseburger/hotdog stand, your subway-type stand, and then your ""hot lunch"" stand (like we're children!). It's honestly pathetic. We have two cafes (one on the opposite side of campus-and limited choices). You cannot use your meal plan (only dining dollars) and it's expensive. The only reason I don't give this section an ""F"" is because the pizza at the cafe is good. The pizza at Donovan ""The Don"" Dining Hall is disgusting though."
College Junior,1,"RIC has a greek life (a poor excuse for one). No houses, just small rooms in the Student Union that holds paraphernalia. Also, the greek life is truly culture-based, although the sororities are a little more flexible in this regard. There's an italian frat & african american frat, that I know of for sure. It's a joke. If you are greek and at RIC, I haven't even noticed you for the most part."
College Sophomore,1,I live an hour away and it snows a lot. It's not fun to drive in that kind of weather.
College Sophomore,1,"Awful, there is never any spots. Students need either assigned parking or parking garages."
College Junior,1,"Not a Big Deal – Greek life on campus is not very noticeable. It not something a lot of people want to join, there are no special housing for greek life, and I never heard of them throwing a party. Though they might throw a few events. Since this is a big commuter school not much happens on campus"
College Sophomore,1,"The college parties that the students here go to have nothing to do with their college at all. Most students commute. There has never been anything even close to a party on or near campus. Most kids live at home with their parents to save money. Any parties we go to are parties far from campus with people who we probably didn't even meet at school. The bars around are fun, but I think after going to bars every Friday for a whole semester, I have seen one person who goes to my school out at said bar - one! All I can say is, if you want to have a fun nightlife, you'll have to wait until you're twenty one and take it upon yourself to find the fun - because the fun isn't coming to you."
College Junior,1,"Rhode Island party sense is not the best Clubs close at 1 or 2 in the morning, and you need to car pool with someone who has a car. I been told Rhode Island College parties are horrible, people sit around and drink all night. If your looking for a decent party hit up a Johnston and Whales party."
College Sophomore,1,Horrible Process – You barely get any financial aid. The people who work in  the Bursars office are rude and do not care about how you feel. Money is a big issue for people in school and especially being able to afford it. Horrible experiences every time.
College Junior,1,"RIC Dining – Donovan Dining Center is the main place for food on campus. Sandwiches and Salad Bar is great, all other areas are lacking. There is also a cafe on campus, they have a great selection of wraps, sandwiches, soups, etc."
College Freshman,1,Don't Go Here! I hate it here. There is no campus community and it's nearly impossible to meet anyone. Everyone is either a commuter or goes home every weekend. Even the people who live on campus already have their group of friends because they are all from RI.
College Freshman,1,There seems to be no parking available on campus ever! It is so hard to find a spot. I recommend getting to campus at least 30 minutes before class starts!
College Freshman,1,"I live on campus but I find that the walls are really thin..I can hear everything that my roommates are doing....(not always the stuff you want to hear). I have to leave my room if I want any peace and quiet. When I moved in this place was just disgusting.....gum on the wall....hair and dirt all over the bathroom...stains in the carpet...cracks in the wall you name it.  I find that the college upperclassmen dorms are so much nicer then any other building you'll see. But obviously, when they take you on a tour they'll show you the really fancy new dorms with kitchens....it's all a lie"
College Freshman,1,"There's absolutely nothing to do. The first week of school I thought I would go to a lot of cool events, but it just seems that the school don't care about any of the students who live on campus. After thursday the school turns into a dead zone. Most people are commuters and leave for the weekend, and RIC does nothing for people who are here on the weekends. If you want to have a good time in Providence, you're better off just buying RIPTA tickets and head downtown for your whole college experience. The best times I've ever had in Providence have been when I've gone off on my own. OUT-Of-State people BEWARE!! You're better off going to pretty much....any other school"
College Freshman,1,"You'll starve – The food here is terrible! You only get a certain amount a food you can buy per day and they over price everything. Ten grapes for 3.50?! yeah okay. If you like good food you're best bet would be to buy a bus pass and head downtown, otherwise you just might starve.."
College Sophomore,1,"School Experiance – In all honestly, I hate my school. Weekends here is like a dead zone. Everyone goes home. It is also a big commuter school. Most people that come here are from around Rhode Island, so it's not very unique. Not many sports teams. A few local sororities and one frat. It's so lame. If you come here, your coming here for school and nothing else."
College Sophomore,1,The food here is horrible! there is the same thing everyday with only two specials. Breakfast stops at 10 am and dinner begins at 3! We only have a certain amount of money we can spend so we can't buy a lot of food..if your hungry your out of luck! Also throughout the whole campus there is only 1 dining center.
College Junior,1,"Barely Any to Give – I graduated 5th in my class from high school and have a solid 3.6 in college, however, I only get 1000 dollars a semester towards tuition, even when I lived on campus.  The rest was in loans.  It's so highly competitive, you're incredibly lucky to get anything from them."
College Freshman,1,Not a Big Sport School – RIC does have sport but we dont have school sprit since we are divstion 3

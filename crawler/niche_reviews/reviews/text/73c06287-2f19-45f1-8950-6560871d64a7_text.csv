Sophomore,5,"I really enjoyed my first year at Fort Kent! There is a lot of diversity and I learned a lot about different cultures. I made a ton of friends and everyone is so friendly. The classes are small compared to most colleges, which I find very helpful for one-on-one time with the professors. The professors are also very friendly and there is a lot of fun activities to do and lots of resources here at Fort Kent. In all, I cannot wait to graduate in 2023 with all of my friends and to look back on the memories that we have made together at Fort Kent! I 100% recommend going!"
Junior,5,"Great Nursing Program, and a very friendly environment. Town and Campus are very nice. Makes you feel welcomed all of the time since being away from home. I love the workers at the college as well, and the diversity is great. Allows for lost of experience even in the middle of no where in Northern Maine. Fort Kent is for sure the college meant for me. GO BENGAL! Can't wait to head back up in the middle of nowhere in the fall where I can just live life peacefully while obtain my life long dream as Nurse."
Junior,5,"I took online classes this spring because of Corona, and it was handled great under the circumstances. Great professors, easy to communicate with as well."
Sophomore,5,"Attending the University of Maine at Fort Kent has been one of the greatest decisions of my life! I have met so many amazing people from different countries.  The campus, although small compared to other universities, has a great sense of diversity.  The professors are extremely helpful and accessible if students have questions!"
Freshman,5,I have had a great experience at this University so far. I love how everything is so close and in walking distances. The people are so friendly and caring all around. The atmosphere is so clean and healthy and anyone will lend you a helping hand. And most importantly the instructors are beyond amazing and so helpful. One thing I wish to see a change would be the library it is a fantastic place with great resources but can be very loud at times and difficult to stud in.
Niche User,5,"Next year I plan on attending the University of Maine at Fort Kent. I’ve visited a few times, and when I step on campus, It already feels like home. The atmosphere and the vibes I get are all positive. I’ve lost more people than I can count on two hands being only eighteen years old. I’ve learned to love a person for who they are, not who you want them to be. Never take anyone for granted. I  believe they just need to advertise a little bit more, I would have never even thought about it until my aspirations coordinator told me."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about the college and I can't wait to attend. The University is very small and diverse, the college has many different races of people and it creates free learning experiences. I grew up in a small town and Fort Kent allows me to go back and not just be another number to a professor, it creates a more personal relationship. I just wish the University was closer to home."
Sophomore,5,"I was accepted to UMFKs BSN program in the fall 2017. So far, all of the teachers are extremely nice and helpful. The campus is beautiful"
Sophomore,5,The university of Maine at Fort Kent is a small close knit school in a small French speaking mostly community. There is alot of diversity among the students there. The faculty care about the success of the students. The nursing department is welcoming and encouraging. The grading system is like the other college nursing programs
Senior,5,"UMFK is a great place to live as it is a low crime area, and a great place to focus on your studies and earn your degree!"
Freshman,5,"I enjoy UMFK, because it is a small university and is very diverse. I feel UMFK has a great academic support. Overall UMFK is a great college, and I would recommend it to others."
College Sophomore,5,Its a hunting community so the majority of people have common sense with firearms. Also we speak up when something is abnormal.
College Sophomore,5,Most professors are speaking and teaching from years of experience in the field and most still work in their field. Teaching is their second job.
College Sophomore,5,We are taught from real work experience and know what to expect and are prepared.
College Sophomore,5,Get better financial aid living on campus and the lodge is just like and appartment
College Sophomore,5,Good computers. If you need to use one it is very likely available.
College Freshman,5,"The format online is convenient. I can access my class on Black Board at all hours. 
The online nursing classes are working for me. I can e-mail an instructor, and they get back to me promptly. The grading is fair, and the other students are able to discuss issues with the rest of the class through Black Board."
College Junior,5,UMFK has a great diversity of races on campus. The student activity's office makes sure to highlight each culture at different events.
College Junior,5,We hold national championship titles for men and women soccer.  It is phenomenal.  The diversity that sports brings to the community is life changing.  What a wonderful experience it is to be a part of!
Sophomore,4,"Due to COVID-19, we had to do online schooling. It was hard to adjust at first, but then I got used to it. I really enjoyed doing it online, but the hardest thing for me was not being able to do my clinicals or labs, and that is very important for a nursing student to have!"
Sophomore,4,"The community is what really makes this town enjoyable. Everyone is very nice and close. The campus is very tiny and that is what makes me excited to gonto school everyday. I don't feel like a number, but more as an individual. The nursing major is one of the hardest in this school and must be taken seriously."
Senior,4,"UMFK is a small college, in a small community. Classes are efficient, the school is very close knit. Instructors commonly know you and can help you as an individual in each cours.e"
Sophomore,4,"Fort Kent is a small town. Even though it may seem small there is still things to do. The food at the cafe is not very great, the bengal lair is a great option though. The campus feels very safe. All the professors are very nice and helpful. Many of the staff are incredible as well. The library has many great resources that help with assignments. TRIO is also a great resource. They can help provide tutoring for when you need help in a class. The staff at Umfk always want to help you do your best and push you to pursue your academic goals."
Junior,4,Academic advisors and professors have been pleasant to work with so far and invested in helping their students succeed. The accelerated nursing program is a great option for non-traditional students looking for a career change .
Niche User,4,"Very clean, campus with a very inviting and safe atmosphere. Great facilities, specifically the nursing department. All staff that I interacted with were more than willing to answer all questions and help in any way possible."
Sophomore,4,"Great nursing program so far. Just completed my first year. Love living in the dorms, love the diversity, athletics, and the activities. The early education program needs to much better."
Junior,4,"I wish the school wasnt so isolated, there is nothing really around it or anything to do there. if there was more to, more kids would probably go there and stay, i have a lot of friends transfer to other schools, for this reason and to just be closer to home. on the other hand i like how everyone is friend's with everyone."
Freshman,4,"My experience at UMFK has been positively shaped by the friendly people that I have encountered on campus, and off campus in the community; people are very willing to help. Also, the professors I have had so far are very well educated and care about student success. The cafeteria food is average and excellent at times. Winter drags on a little too long, but there are many things to do outdoors like skiing, ice-skating, or playing hockey. The summer season is exceptional and makes the winter weather worth it. The only advice I would give is to make the most out of the opportunities given and get involved."
Sophomore,4,I really like my teachers because they are vary involved with the students. Also the community of the school and the town is great. You feel like your at home.
Sophomore,4,"Small college, safe environment,  plenty of classes to choose from, online classes available, winter and summer sports, helpful support system."
College Junior,4,Wonderful opportunities for intern and externships.
College Sophomore,4,"I have not heard anything that has happened with health and safety of the students, I think because everyone knows one so nothing can get by. The only thing that may be a problem is alcohol consumption; thats what many people do, but it never impacts others safety (always someone who is the DD)."
College Sophomore,4,"If you create your class wish list, and are able to get it approved, and then enroll at the right time so one would be able to get into the classes he/she wants. Even if one is not able to get into a class, you can talk to the professor running the class and see if they will put one more person in or put you at the top of the waiting list. The professors here really care about students. And depending on what you are studying to be, depends on the classes; but if a class or multiple classes are not offered from UMFK, there are other schools that they work with so you can take the same class online and still get the credit. There are also classes offered throughout the summer and during winter break which really helps some to get classes done and out of the way, so they can worry about the ""big important"" classes (nursing, forestry, etc.)."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't greatly know about this, but have heard others being able to get internships on the career they intend. I do know from multiple people that before they graduated from UMFK with a nursing degree, they already had jobs. Jobs hold the UMFK nursing at a high level."
College Sophomore,4,"It all depends on where you are. There are two regular dorm rooms that are all right. These dorm rooms are right on the campus are are close to classes and dinning hall. But, you have to share a bathroom. And sometimes, you can get a single room. But there is another dorm that is called the Lodge. This is one that I have been in and I love it. There are three types of rooms: triple single, a single double single, and a double. So depending on where you are the max number of people you share a room with would be four people. But, you have your own bathroom and shower, while also having your own little day room, one-two closets, and a kitchen (sink, microwave, and normal fridge). I have a single room right now and I really do like it because I can hang out with roommates, but then not have to share a bedroom with them. I have had a double suit before, and it really is not bad. But how you rate the dorms depends on where you are and how clean you keep it."
College Sophomore,4,"UMFK only has soccer and basketball athletics and both are very important. Everyone goes to the games and they are a fun time - you are able to get out, take a break from studying, make new friends, and hang out with friends. It's rather funny because a lot of people really get into the game, but these people will always support the team(s) and ""back them up""."
College Sophomore,4,"Yes it is far away, but I would say that it was worth it. Some may say that they don't get enough nursing courses, but that is their fault; they make their own class schedules. UMFK is unique, just by the location; you are able to view and become accustomed to different ways. Everyone is very nice up here and are willing to have a conversation or help you out. One of my favorite things to do up here, even though I study constantly, is to go to the Snow Dog Races in the Spring and go over to Canada to go out with friends and shop. There are other things to do up here like ice skating, hiking, fishing, hunting, snow shoeing, ATV and snowmobile riding, skiing, and more if you go out and find things. I would defiantly choose this school again if I started all over just because where I want to be later in life (career), this school will teach and try their hardest to help me get to where I want to be. They care and are willing to help however they can."
College Sophomore,4,They act no different than anyone else
College Sophomore,4,Awesome area to take a break from homework and go hunting
College Freshman,4,"I don't participate in sports at my school, but I attend the sports events. These events are very fun to attend."
College Freshman,4,"My school is very secluded, but it is not hard to stay busy being a nursing student. I spend most of my time studying and preparing for tests. My experience has been difficult going to school in such a new environment. I moved 3,000 miles away from home in order to have a new experience and see a different part of the country I live in. The school I chose is perfectly matched to my goals because it allows me to be in a nursing program at the start of freshmen year while all other schools on the West Coast require two years of schooling before you can be accepted into the nursing program."
College Junior,4,You get to venture out into another country.
College Junior,4,Always a salad bar; different foods each day.
College Junior,4,"The area is full of a lot of different cultural events including a ploye festival, World Acadien Congress, and sled dog races."
College Sophomore,4,I dont think their is much drug use or peer presure
College Junior,4,UMFK is known for its reputable nursing program. It is a hard workload but the advisers and professors are accessible if you need help and guidance and the classes are small so you get more one on one attention.
College Junior,4,We have snow 5 months out of the academic year. The roads are well plowed and the campus is well taken care of in order to get to classes.
College Sophomore,4,I chose UMFK because they are known for there exceptional nursing program. The classes are small and you get to know your professors on a personal level. The workload is hard and demanding but well worth the education I am receiving.
College Sophomore,4,Hard to park close to the school when classes are going on but who cares its a small college
College Sophomore,4,Nice small town easy to get around and meet people and enjoy college life.
College Freshman,4,We have a very diverse campus and everyone seems to be extremely accepting of everyone. It is a great learning opportunity to learn from other students about different cultures.
College Freshman,4,The gym and library are great resources for students. The Bengal's Lair is probably the most popular school hang out which is great for socialization.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the small class sizes that allow more 1-1.
College Freshman,4,Cancelled classes are announced on local tv and radio. The Center is located in a mall with plenty of parking and roads are plowed. No problems
College Junior,4,Apartments are available all over town. Prices range from 300-800
College Junior,4,"The University has a wonderful sports center, library and a new recent winter long green house has been built.  It is wonderful to see the new greenhouse and the products it produces even through our winters! Students have the lair,  a cafe student center, to conjugate and socialize.  The clubs available are wonderful."
College Junior,4,"The classrooms could use some renovation, but the nursing labs are wonderful for the direction and purpose of my education.  The University focuses on the academics and not the facility upkeep.  This does not take away from education.  Student living is great, there is a modern dorm on campus."
College Junior,4,To live off campus at the university of maine at fort kent is affordable to any student and students can make the rent cheaper by having more that one room mate. Plus alot of the utilities are included in to the rent as well which is good because it does get very cold up here in northern maine.
College Freshman,4,Rocks dinner is local and nice family owned and pretty affordable. Other then that their are a lot of chain restaurants here.
College Sophomore,2,"If you want to participate in any parties you have to cross the border to Canada, or many students simply drink in their own rooms"
College Sophomore,2,"The school system promises you aid, then never applies the aid to your account. You end up having to go in and fight for it to be applied and argue that you should not have a collection agency come after you for the money that you do not owe that they said they would give you in aid. I have been dealing this for two years and have had the same issues every semester."
College Sophomore,2,i have never lived on campus because i was so disgusted by the dorm options
College Sophomore,2,"Being in Northern Maine, winters are long. With that said, it is understandable that we deal with snow for a large portion of the school year. It is annoying to have to walk on campus on snowy or slushy walkways, but these are a result of the geographical location of the school, not a poor job by campus staff."
College Junior,2,This is a rural university so finding housing near the campus is difficult. You have to travel quit a ways to and from classes if you live off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"There are three restaurants in town, two of which are expensive, and the other is chinese food. There is a Subway and Mcdonalds as well, but those get old after awhile."
College Senior,2,But what would you expect when living at the Canadian border?
College Senior,2,"I haven't run into much in the way of drugs, plenty of people drink though. Coming from a big city to this little one is kind of a shock. It's really chill out here."
Freshman,1,"The school is a lost cause for education. I went there for their nursing program, and was disappointed in the curriculum and how the program was taught.  The school itself has a 34% retention rate, which makes sense since many people transfer to better colleges to receive a better academic result. It seems as if the school just cares more about their acceptance numbers than the students, would rather let the students fail then try to work with them to help them succeed. I can't say anything really good about the campus since I wasn't impressed and don't plan on ever returning."
College Freshman,1,"It is very hard to get financial aid, unless you play sports."
College Freshman,1,Food should be a little more appetizing not only pizza or fries

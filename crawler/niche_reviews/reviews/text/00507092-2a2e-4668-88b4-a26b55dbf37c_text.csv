Freshman,5,"The administrations that did my paperwork intake was really nice and she wanted to know what i was interested in and what would best fit me and my daughters life style, i don't like having to drive so far but i will go there to best support me and my daughter for the future"
Freshman,5,This is an excellent hands on school with amazing classes that directly get you hired in the field you want
Freshman,5,"I liked the care, the listening ear, and the professional service delivery. They are precisely detailed with a lot of information at hand that reduces time consuming. They are up to date and ready to go an extra mile to help anyone who knocks the pacific Pioneer College"
Niche User,5,"I love the staff of Pioneer Pacific. Everyone that has worked there, that I have met, have been so kind. They are willing to work with you, answer questions and go above and beyond what is expected of them."
Freshman,5,"Seriously the best college ever and I have not even started yet. The staff is friendly, kind, and wants you to succeed."
Freshman,5,So far my experience with Pioneer Pacific College has been excellent. The admissions process is very easy and the admissions team is very helpful.
Freshman,5,"Extremely small class sizes, which allows a lot of one on one with the teachers. Teachers seem like they actual want the students to succeed and there are no classes that are an ""easy A""."
College Senior,5,"We had a easy time transferring credits.  They are very flexible with our online classes.  We go to school all day on Saturday, so it is like two days of work into one, so it is very important for us to be in class.  If we need to miss class for some reason we could miss up to two and half days.  if we missed three day we would get dropped.  I do online classes because i cant afford to drive 2 hours to class and back home for four days out of the week.  We have assignments through out the week and then  go to school all day Saturday, so I would say it is very flexible but I would say harder because if you were in class you would have more dialog and you could sometimes hear the teacher say; this might be on the test."
College Senior,5,"Our small class of six students all work online.  We can call Monday through Friday to get help with application or technical support for our classes.  We have to work independently and it is a lot more work and you have to be committed to get your assignments done.  There isn't a teacher saying turn in this assignment except for Saturday class.  We (the students ) lean on each other for support and help.  We also, can call or get a hold of the teachers any day of the week.  We have a great relationship with each other and our students.  We car pool and pull our money together so that we can get to school."
College Senior,5,"I picked a field that will be here for a long time.  Everyone has to see the doctor and there has to be an Medical Assistant to help the doctors.  For us we have an ex-ternship, and most of the time we get hired through that organization.  We have a lady to help us with areas that are hiring CMA's.   They help you interview skills, resume, and anything else that you need to help you find a job.  I know most of the medical schools don't have this an option.  I am not sure about the alumni , but I can say that our small group talks to each other on FB and texts each other for help, and we have already talk about going to each others graduation."
College Senior,5,I was having troubles with my online course in order to add a clients in the system and there problems.  The teacher looked at the situation and found out what the problem was and had me go in a different way and   then the system corrected correctly for me.  The quality of the courses are great.  It depends on the student and how dedicated they are to study and ask for help when they need it.  The school has over a 60 percent of the students graduate.
College Senior,5,"When you get ready for your ex-ternship, Pioneer Pacific helps you with the process.   Usually when you are done with your ex-ternship the company you worked for usually hires you.  if that doesn't happy then they have a dedicated person to help you find a job.  They have post on the wall weekly for openings that are near the school to about 2 hours away.  It depends if you need something farther, you just need to let them know and then they look and help you find something in your area."
College Senior,5,"Pioneer Pacific is the only college that offers online schooling for Medical Assistant.  Then we go to school on Saturday and do our practicals.  Even though they cost a little more then the other schools, the benefits are you have three more months of college and they really sit down and help you through out your time at the college.  We also have a program; when you graduate you get Microsoft word versions to up date for life.  You also have an email address that will be yours for life as well."
College Senior,5,"When you have troubles and you need help, I have had teachers on vacation stop and help me while they where at Disneyland.  When I went to the college and all of the teachers where in class, the head of the college came out to help me with my assignment so that I could understand what I needed to do.  I have never found a college that is so devours and goes beyond of their way to help the students. I would promote Pioneer Pacific to anyone that wants to go to college."
College Junior,5,They have a career services office that helps get the students set up with a job before we even graduate.  We do numerous clinicals and visits to numerous different nursing fields to see which area suits us best.
College Junior,5,The teachers and other staff are so helpful when it comes to credit transferring questions.
College Junior,5,"I have not taken online courses, but I would not doubt they are less from the best."
College Junior,5,The experience i have encountered have enriched my desire for the medical field even more so. I love what I do and I am grateful to being doing it.
College Junior,5,"The classroom help is beyond my expectations. Also their continuous drive to help us, the students, to get out there and find a job is outstanding. The teachers, students, and other staff facility have never once said that we couldn't do sorting that may have been challenging for us. Having so much support from the ones around through such a rigorous journey has made my college experience that much better. It's a fun, clean, and professional environment it is almost hard to not enjoy learning."
College Junior,5,"I was scared about my first college experience, but they made it less stressful."
College Junior,5,"The information is clear, direct, and helpful."
College Junior,5,"Not only do the teachers do everything to make you feel welcome, but the staff (such as administration and receptionists) do also."
College Junior,5,I really like that they really care about there students and there success.  The class sizes are smaller and I can get more one on one help when needed.  I also like that this school jumps right into what i want to do and not have to take a bunch of unimportant class just to get credit.  Everyone there seems to be very helpful and understanding.
College Senior,5,"Class sizes are perfect for me because i don't like a full room of students so everyone in the class gets some one-on-one time with the teacher if they need it. Professors are great they know what they are teaching, they are extremely helpful, they have patience and care for their students."
College Senior,5,I havent gotten fat enough to get internships but i do know that there are career counseling meetings for students that are required right before they graduate.
College Senior,5,"As an Accountant major i find it very fun and right from the beginning of my second term i started getting Accounting classes the teachers are great mentors because they know what they are teaching. Workload is  not too overwhelming which i like, i get my homework done in one night."
College Senior,5,"I absolutely love this school. Descriptive in every topic. Also, hands on and if a student needs help and it doesn't understand the teacher will go through that topic with you until you understand. Teachers at Pioneer Pacific College are very helpful and help the students find an externship and their future job."
College Junior,5,The fact that they have 3 different times of classes made it the choice of school for me because nursing school is expensive I have to work in order to attend school and be able to pay my bills.
College Junior,5,We are walked through the different steps for setting up all of our accounts during orientation.
College Junior,5,The financial aid process was made easy due to them walking you through every step and always checking to make sure every little step was completes.
College Junior,5,"After completion of my first program at PPC I was helped tremendously with finding a job, and was kept posted on new job listings."
College Junior,5,"My program is a little challenging, but I love every minute of it. Every 10 weeks I recieve a new class with new curriculum and it definately keeps you on your toes. I am certainly never bored. The workload is a little heavy at times, but it is never so heavy that I can have a life outside of school, which is important since i have a 6 year old, a disable husband, and a disabled mother that need me."
College Junior,5,"Class registration is awsome. Every term the had you a shedule of classes, so their is no fighting for the classes you need and no unnecissary courses. The Instructor are fabulous and are there when you need them. Also the Instructors are alway find new and inventive ways to make classes more inteactive and interesting."
College Junior,5,I have had very few problems at this school and when I have all I need to do is talk with my program directer and we get it handled.
College Junior,5,I can always find a computer to work on and there are no printing costs. The network is fast and reliable.
College Junior,5,"I have been to a couple of colleges over the years, and this one is by far the best one I have attended."
College Junior,5,I know I can contact any teacher or faculty member if I need to.
College Junior,5,I really enjoy Pioneer Pacific College becasue it has helped me get back on track in my life
College Junior,5,The teachers can be assertive as well as friends to help the learning process
College Junior,5,Everyone I know that has graduated from my field has earned a job before or after they graduate
College Junior,5,"I enjoy the fact that its an intensive schedule intended to get me employed with a caeer, and not just a job."
College Junior,5,"All of the information is up to date, and the teachers know what they are talking about"
College Junior,5,They are all really great I have made a lot of friends
College Junior,5,The career services department is AMAZING they are a resource for the rest of your career life!!!
College Junior,5,The financial aid staff are great
College Junior,5,I love My College. Its great for what I need
College Junior,5,We are students here to be serious about our education and we value the others that are in the classroom

College Junior,5,I love the campus in general.

College Junior,5,I love the school and the classes. The professors make sure that their students learn the right way. Lots of opportunities.
College Junior,5,I have been offered everything about being a medical assistant.
College Junior,5,"There is a lot of diversity at my school (ethnic, economic, political, religious and even sexual, but the most important thing that categorize each and every one of us is that we share a common goal and that is ""Success in life"" . Pioneer Pacific College will make that happen."
College Senior,5,"Our student population consists of diverse, hard working, goal oriented people. I can't pronounce the name of an Indian student I have befriended, but he insists I call him ""G"". Like most of us here he has an upper-lower class economic position. "
College Senior,5,"Very thorough studies of various subjects all collaborating to build, and keep building an ideal nursing machine. Knowledge of liabilities, medications, procedures, anatomy, pathogens, diagnosis, treatments, sterilization, decontamination, and so much more. You could not believe how much I have learned in the first term alone. Each aspect we retain branches into the trunk of a constantly growing tree. The workload of our program is proportionate to the material. Yes it is a lot but it allows our instructors to assess the product of the lessons."
College Senior,5,"I am currently employed, so the use of the career services have not been needed yet."
College Senior,5,"There are four computer labs, totaling to 60+ computers. All with exceptional access, and internet quality. It seems as if every room at this school has a printer."
College Senior,5,"Athletics and campus activities may not be provided, but the effectiveness of the resources present in my opinion demonstrates the best learning experience."
Niche User,4,Very good school would recommend to anyone. The teaching method should be the way all schools are ran.
Niche User,4,I'm actually attending the one in Springfield Oregon. The school is great the staff is great. When you need help there's always somebody there that can help you. The teachers are also accessible by email. It truly is a great School. I truly enjoy and appreciate the accelerated program. The thought of me going to work sooner than later makes me incredibly excited. I would recommend this school to everyone.
College Junior,4,"We have a career service office that helps coordinate jobs and they keep in contact with us to see how our careers are going.  If we need to look for another job or are interested in finding a different job, they will continue to help after we graduate."
College Junior,4,"The courses and professors are professional and there to help students succeed in their career choices.  They only offer the classes that pertain to your degree, but they do set up your class schedule for you.  The class sizes are small, which means more interaction over class material."
College Junior,4,"There is a lot of hands on experiences in the program I'm attending.  Not only do we get hands on, but we also have smaller class sizes, which makes it easier to communicate and work with the teachers.  Due to smaller class sizes, we form close bonds with peers, which makes study and learning the material easier."
College Senior,4,This school has been convenient for me because they offer evening classes which is great for me because that allows me to go to work in the morning. Our program counselor is very flexible when it comes to our schedules we can just go talk to them if we dislike something or does not fit with our schedule if they are available to make a change they will. My credits didnt go through because by the time i received them i was already halfway through the class.
College Senior,4,The career center is very helpful because everyone is assigned a career counselor depending on the program you take and they are the ones that are helping us through our whole journey through school.
College Senior,4,"Its a small school with caring teachers, they will tell you when your graduation date will be even before you start classes, and the time it takes to graduate it very fast because you wont have to take extra classes just to get credits which is why i chose to go to this school. I wanted to get my degree and start my career as soon as possible."
College Senior,4,"I haven't started yet but so,far the application process has been so easy. The start has been very helpful in helping me get things together and actually calling me to see how things were going."
College Junior,4,The experience is great with all of the hands on experience. The teachers are very knowledgeable allowing them to answer any questions we may have.
College Junior,4,"The size of the class greatly effects the quality. With being such a small class, it allows you to develop relationships with your classmates and instructors. You also have more one on one time to ask questions to better comprehend the material."
College Junior,4,There is a wide variety of people at our school. The majority of them are dedicated hard workers who are putting themselves through nursing school while having a full time job. They have to learn great study habits in order to succeed.
College Junior,4,"The workload is heavy. There are multiple chapters covered in each of the 5-6 classes you have to take, and with working full time it is even more hard to find time for everything."
College Junior,4,"I think that the programs that are at our school are great, but not much variety of programs."
College Junior,4,I think the financial aid department especially is extremely helpful. they go through everything with you step by step and so does the admissions office.
College Senior,4,"The school staff and administration strive for each and every student.  In my personal experience, I am very pleased with the quick responses, answers and guides that I received."
College Senior,4,Carlos was my admission processor and he was great.
College Junior,4,The teachers are so helpful. They make sure that they can work with you one way or another. They let you know when they are free if you have any questions and they are so open that if we have homework questions that we can even email them if we are not at the school.
College Junior,4,"They are very helpful. They are right there when you need them. I know that if I have a question or if I need help, I know that I can go and find them and they wont have an problem helping me at all."
College Junior,4,The staff at our school is always there to help whether you are a current or past student make no difference. Donna in our career services department is always checking in with students and keeping tabs on what they want and need when looking for work.
College Junior,4,"Being a small campus most of the students get to know each other well, and even spend time together as friends outside of school hours."
College Junior,4,"The tuition is a little higher, but I do not have to pay for books and I graduate much faster than a reagular college. Our financial aid staff are always there when you need them and they are a pleasure to work with. The school is very open about what you can expect and when you can expect it."
College Junior,4,Their student clubs are interactive and the attmosphere is inducive to socializing.
College Junior,4,I have made many friends since I started at PPC
College Junior,4,"Its always fast, and I can always depend on it when I need to complete an assignment"
College Junior,4,I know that since I joined FBLA that I have been more involved in the schools events and programs
College Junior,4,"There were no hidden fees, and they were very clear to me about any fees that I will be having."
College Junior,4,They Reasonably accommodate your life and work around schooling
College Junior,4,Their is no WiFi and that sucks but otherwise the connection speed is great
College Junior,4,The teachers are knowledge in the area that they are teaching. The work that is provided is great and can be applied to work experience.
College Junior,4,The curriculum is great for work place and the workload is good with a full time.
College Junior,4,"The programs can seem expensive but I feel it will cost about the same some where else. The issues that sometimes bothers me is the fact they will let anyone into the program even if this what is best for the student. They are a profit school so they need students to make money.

The education is the right price for the tuition I pay"
College Senior,4,"The only thing I dislike overall, a few of the teachers expect very little. This isn't a great quality for someone who seeks a challenge."
College Junior,4,"Definitely made tons of friends. Even though there were social cliques, people still defied them and got a long with each other."
College Senior,4,I considered law enforcement but I was certain I wanted to be a nurse.
College Senior,4,At Pioneer Pacific they have a open door policy. Only 17 credits were able to transfer which was disappointing but the collage is  worth it.The collage is small and very friendly.
College Senior,4,"When I talked to the admissions specialist .he was so helpful and introduced me to all the staff . The career counselor helps with internships, part time jobs and jobs after graduation. I was very impressed by the school."
College Senior,4,They have a great job placement program and success rate.
College Senior,4,The computers are decent but the internet is slow.
College Senior,4,"My classmates are great. We support each other.  We have all ages, all types of people in my school."
Junior,2,"I can't say it is a good college. To begin with, they had me take three tests. Reading, Writing, and Math. I pass both Reading and Writing, but failed Math. Yet, they have me taking an English class that I don't need. Second of all, they fired a teacher who was very good and replaced with one that has dyslexia. She can't read, she misses classes every time, she marks down half our points for not being there when reality she misses school more than us students. She doesn't bother to teach or explain lecture. (She never bothered to give us lecture) I am paying over 20,000 plus debts so I can be put in class that I don't need and be assigned to a teacher that doesn't know how to read!? Plus! The majority of the staff that work there are rude, mean, very disrespectful, do not cooperate or help. (Can't say that for all staffs. Some are dedicated to teach their students) I am trying to make my money worth. I am paying to get an education."
College Junior,2,They don't really help out job placement but does have a career center. They don't do alumni network either but I would like too.
College Junior,2,There is not personal in the building or surround area. We are here for school and not to hangout.
College Senior,2,The campus is nice but there are no athletics or much for student services center.
College Senior,2,I don't know anything about online courses at Pioneer Pacific.
College Junior,2,"Aid the Financial Department – As many of us have had the ""luxury"" of dealing with, financial aid is supposed to be a good thing. My experience, at first, was great. But after a while, things started to get complicated and I had several issues with the school pulling my money and actually giving it to me. I honestly don't know if it is the school or the source of the money but I am not the only one who has had complaints about getting financial aid and student loans. It has taken several phone calls and visits to the office to get all of these issues taken care of, and I am still dealing with financial aid. So far, it has not been great, but I won't start to grieve until it starts to affect my education."
Graduate Student,1,Do not go here... no credits are transferable! I went for medical assisting and then tried to get into a nursing program and non of my credits from the medical assisting program will transfer.
College Junior,1,The campus is for education and not for other resources
College Junior,1,"Personally, I just prefer face-to-face interaction. Technology hardly worked at campus computer's."
College Junior,1,"THIS SCHOOL IS a RIP OFF – The associates degree that Im going for is close to 30,000 total. I understand that education doesnt,and wont come easy, but when it comes to a school such as PPC the 30,000 that I will have to pay back isnt worth it. I feel like so much money is being flushed down the toilet!"

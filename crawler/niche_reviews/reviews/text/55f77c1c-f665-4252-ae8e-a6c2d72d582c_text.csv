Freshman,5,"I did not originally have an online course, but due to COVID-19 the college closed to keep the students safe and they made the transition from in the classroom to online very easy. The class was time consuming but very easy."
Freshman,5,The staff at WVUP is amazing. They really care where each student is going and help the students find their way in the college classes
Freshman,5,"They are very helpful, and patient. They are willing to work with you to make sure everything is done properly."
Sophomore,5,I love the home like feel I get with WVU-P. All of the professors are very helpful and open themselves up to you all times.
Freshman,5,Smaller classes allow for more face to face interactions with teachers. The campus has no dorms which could be a problem for students who cant afford to rent an apartment or stay with someone.
Freshman,5,This school is awesome. I love it! They have good classes to choose from and great teachers.And I would invite people to enroll there for all there college needs.
Senior,5,I am going into my fourth year at West Virginia University Parkersburg and have enjoyed my experience there. I am enrolled in the Education program and have loved every minute of it. It is challenging but everything that I am asked to do will be important when I become a full-time teacher. The instructors are always willing to help the students succeed and become the best teachers that we can become. Their doors are always open to help the students to make decisions or work through problems that is going on the in classrooms that we are placed in. I would recommend this program to anyone thinking about getting an education degree.
Sophomore,5,The atmosphere and the teachers are great. The professors are well educated on the subjects they are teaching.
Sophomore,5,"All of my professors have been nice, Professor Thompson in particular is always energetic and understanding, he really goes above and beyond for his students making sure we understand the material. The administrative staff is also really nice and they seem to care about the students as well. Those combined with the exceptional price of education makes this school an amazing place to study! The school has many study areas which are cozy, clean and well lit, as well as a tutoring center. The only slight drawback is parking for the Caperton Center and Applied Technology center leaves a bit to be desired, but the short walk is occasionally enjoyed."
Sophomore,5,WVUP is a great school.  It's centrally located in Parkersburg and is fairly close to home. You get provided with a great education at a minimal cost.  My overall experience has been amazing! I enjoy every minute of my time here.  Nothing major needs to be changed!
Niche User,5,"At WVUP everyone is there to help you succeed. They do not leave and student behind. They have tutors there for any one to use, if needed. Class sizes are small so there is more room for one on one. The classes are not just lectures, you are allowed to ask questions and interact with the professors."
Niche User,5,The professors are very intelligent and welcoming. The building is very neat and clean and the students are nice.
Senior,5,"I love the diversity of the college, as well as the setting, the college is close to a lot of different atmospheres."
Freshman,5,"My name is Leah Sutton. West Virginia University at Parkersburg is great. I have lived in Parkersburg all of my life, and by going to school here I get to stay close to home!"
Junior,5,I like that it is a small campus and even then the class sizes are small. I also like that the professors are always willing to help with anything you need and work with the class to figure out the best way to go over the material.
Junior,5,Nice community college. You can get a degree for less money than a big college with the same classes.
Freshman,5,"West Virginia University at Parkersburg is a good school for those who lack a huge income. They offer a multitude of services for veterans and the disabled, and are very welcoming to all who apply."
College Junior,5,"Unfortunately I am not working right now so my schedule is actually quite easy to accommodate.  However, I know many who are working and have said that the availability of classes is great - especially the evening and online classes."
College Junior,5,"Because I am in the nursing program and this area is low on nurses, the local hospitals are always looking to the college for new graduates to come work for them."
College Junior,5,"There are so many courses of study available at WVUP.  From nursing, criminal justice, art, mechanic, music, teachers/education, and more! Classes are just the right size which helps with getting to know other students. The professors, to me, are top notch. I have not had one yet that I did not like! Honest."
College Junior,5,"I am currently in my first semester of nursing school for RN.  This program is one of the top programs in WV. Although the work that is required outside of class is intense and time consuming, I know I am getting the best education. They have the second best lab/simulation facility in WV with real life mechanical bodies to learn on. The professors and instructors work as hard as we do to keep us moving in the right direction!"
College Junior,5,"So far, I have had the best experience at WVU-Parkersburg.  This small college is close-by with so many different education paths available. All of my professors have been incredible and actually seem to enjoy teaching. As an adult returning to college, I couldn't imagine a better place. I would definitely choose this college again and wished I had my first time around 15 years ago. My favorite class ever was Deviant Behavior because the professor truly knew the material and was super engaging with the students. Hoping to take another class with him if possible!"
College Sophomore,5,Met a lot of interesting people an learned a lot from the professors
College Sophomore,5,I was able to sign up for the classes I wanted & needed quick and easily. My credits transferred with no problems.
College Sophomore,5,"The degree I'm pursuing will help me advance in my career as an ECE teacher since not only will I be certified as a teacher, I will also be able to classes on my own time."
College Sophomore,5,"So far everyone I've been in contact with at the school has been extremely helpful and kind. I'll be starting classes in the fall for the first time here as a transfer, and it seems everyone has gone out of their way to make sure I'm fully prepared."
College Freshman,5,West Virginia University at Parkersburg is a great place to learn !
College Freshman,5,West Virginia University is a great place to learn !
College Freshman,5,West Virginia University at Parkersburg is a great school !
College Sophomore,5,This college has really been great! I have learned a lot being here and everyone is so helpful!
College Junior,5,In the business and economic we have the best best best chair and staff of the entire school! They are so helpful and knowledgable about real world experience while helping you with absolutely anything!
College Senior,5,You can print for free which is awesome. Connecting your personal computer is really easy as well. I also love and hate the fact that in some classrooms the wifi is spotty. Good because it keeps me off my phone but bad because my laptop will run slow.
College Senior,5,The student resources are great. The library and computer labs are filled with plenty of study space and resources to study and research.
College Senior,5,Everybody is very nice. They some times tend to stick to themselves and don't branch out much but when you find someone from one of your classes outside of class or need assistance with anything they are typically very sociable.
College Senior,5,Accounting is a very than what you would think. I really love the accounting and business teachers. they are all very knowledgeable and have tons of experience. I thoroughly enjoy talking to them.
College Junior,5,"Everything is located in a very von sway fashion. The school's lay out is very peaceful, if that makes sense. They have lot's of activities every week. We have a great study center. The library is located beside the student lounge. The food is great. I fell in love with the pizza. When i look around every student looks at peace with what they are doing, and that puts me at peace."
College Junior,5,"Well to start the library is loaded with computers. You can print off of the computers in the library or the labs all you want, and that helps. We have five computer labs downstairs side by side. So with all that the need for a personal computer at school is pointless. But a computer at home is a MUST. The network at school is up to speed. They notify everyone if their is going to be any changes either by text or e-mail. W.V.U.P. has all their duck's in a row,for sure."
College Junior,5,"I am getting two year degree. I am forty one years old. I haven't had use my brain like this in a long time. So it's like i'm stepping out of a long nap. As the weeks pass my confidence grows. W.V.U.P. knew exactly how to set my classes up for me to achieve my goals. The professors are very proud of what they do, you can tell by the way they do their job. They are kind, well spoken and know their trade. I am thankful for what they do. And I am proud of my college."
College Junior,5,"The school is five miles from my home. The staff was/is very helpful through out the whole process. My instructors have worked with me through a week of the flu. It seems that W.V.U.P. wants to see everyone succeed. And as far as transferring credits, I looked on my olsis account one day and there were my credits, and I didn't have to ask at all. I didn't have money for food my second week. They gave me a fifty dollar food card. It was to be paid back, but how convenient was that? No confusion or frustrations."
College Junior,5,I'm an older student and it is great having help with computer issues. 
Senior,4,This is an affordable college that has many resources to help its students succeed. I would recommend it.
Sophomore,4,The atmosphere is very welcoming and dedicated to helping students succeed. Teachers are able to cater towards each individual student's needs which is a breath of fresh air for college courses.
Junior,4,"I have great instructors, the classes are interesting. The online classes are user friendly. My class schedule is flexible so I’m able to work full time"
Junior,4,"West Virginia University at Parkersburg is a great place to go if you are looking to stay home and commute. They are a small but excellent school. The only downfall is they don't offer dorms for students, I believe if they did offer dorms they could continue to grow and become progressively better."
Sophomore,4,"I went to West Virginia University at Parkersburg three years ago, and I find the school to be more organized. I recently had new student orientation, and it was so simple and the administration had it planned out of where to go. One of the education advisors was very helpful and made sure I was ready to move on."
Niche User,4,My experience has been great. I love the flexibility of classes. Teachers are very considerate of student home life.  The teachers provide good sources for the students to complete their work in a manageable amount of time.  All the staff are very friendly and easy to work with as well. I feel like I’m home at WVUP.
Freshman,4,This college is definitely good for anyone who wants to be close to home and affordable classes. I have had a great experience here with the people and professors. The professors all want to help and class sizes are small and comfortable. All the students here range from high school to Older adults and everything flows nicely.
Freshman,4,I love attending this school it’s in my home town so it’s nice to be near family. There are some very nice and professional proffesors/instructors and then there’s the not so good ones. I suggest that you meet with your proffesor before you start the class because even though it’s college some can be a pain in the butt. Overall love the school and the staff is always quick to jump with help they can offer. Love the tutoring center and the services they provide!
Junior,4,"I am just about to begin my third year at this facility. I have to say that this place means business. I have had to work my tail off every semester to keep the acceptable academic standings I have. The courses, teachers and content are extraordinary. For being such a small school, they have one hell of a drive for success with all of their students. I am very happy to be attending. I am extremely impressed with this establishment. 

As expected, there are no dorms or housing."
Freshman,4,I believe my school is great! I love living off of campus and commuting to school from home. The office staff and counselors are great and so helpful with any questions/problems I ever have. My professors are great teachers and they are good at developing lesson plans very well. They understand that not everyone learns the same way.
Sophomore,4,West Virginia University at Parkersburg has a lot of good qualities for the newly graduated high school student and the more non-traditional student like myself. The science teachers are tough but I feel like I'm really learning. I would probably make the teachers a little more accessible to students. They are all nice and great but can be a little intimidating to reach out to when struggling with areas of certain subjects.
College Junior,4,"I have only had a couple of online courses and the system I took them in is not in use. They just updated to BlackBoard this semester. So far, the functions that I have needed to use in it seems to be great and I've heard others say how much they like it. Of course, it was an adjustment for those that were used to the old system."
College Junior,4,I cannot give this the best rating because I am still not familiar with everything they have to offer for career prospects.
College Sophomore,4,They always have a lot of stuff going on that's informational
College Sophomore,4,"I have had a great experience at WVUP. The class sizes are reasonable to allow for a more personal atmosphere with the instructors. There are many degrees to chose from there as well, The entire staff are very helpful to enable my college experience to be rewarding."
College Junior,4,Lots of chances to advance
College Junior,4,It's nice. Professors I've had really care
College Junior,4,"I've enjoyed my experience at WVUP. I've had kind, helpful teachers, stimulating courses, and have been able to keep up with the work to maintain a high GPA."
College Freshman,4,I didn't have any issues accommodating my schedule
College Freshman,4,Overall my online courses have been an okay experience. If I ever had any major trouble with computer malfunctioning my professors were understanding of the problems.
College Freshman,4,I have had an overall good experience with the academic aspect of WVUP. I look forward to continuing my major and even taking summer courses to complete it more quickly.
College Sophomore,4,There is wifi available to all students and we are able to print information from the library.
College Sophomore,4,The nursing program is very demanding and it has a very good success rate.
College Junior,4,Our academics offered are very tailored to our communities work force.  They are currently working on adding new programs.
College Junior,4,"We are a really friendly, help anyone out that we can, fun group of people."
College Junior,4,Pretty normal college campus . Easy to get around and supplies all the necessary needs.
College Junior,4,"I was a transfer student who moved back home. Once I figured out what degree I was going to go after and accomplish I have had tons of help and tons of encouragement from all my professors, advisors and upper administration. I have made great friends and connections while being at school. I have really enjoyed it once I became apart"
College Junior,4,We have a lot of fun activities and clubs. Our student body is comprised of a decent size international community. They are really involved with the school
College Junior,4,"It's a great place that is convenient and close  to home, semi affordable compared to most universities and you can still get a four year degree. Great professors and advisors once you get through the gen eds and start taking your degree serious."
College Senior,4,I really enjoy the range of classes that they offer. The only downside is they are switching to a heavier use of online courses and because the teachers aren't used to it either it makes for some very difficult course work.
College Senior,4,"I come from a very small school so it is odd coming to a school where I don't know anybody. This school is very large but the college I attended before this was a lot smaller and I had quite a few classmates that I went to high school with here. I really hate how the out of state students, even at reduced tuition, are doubled from in state. However, it is still very cheap compared to most schools."
College Junior,4,"I am majoring in Multi-Craft Technology. I have worked this field all my life, and I know with this degree I will get the better positions for my old age, so I have a heads up on the teaching's. And that makes it unique to me, the way they are giving the hands on experience, after teaching you the written aspect of the situation. We are not over loaded, but they keep my nose in the books."
College Junior,4,"I don't everything available, but it is there if I want to"
College Junior,4,I am glad I am going to this school and look forward to future schooling with them
College Junior,4,I have had no trouble with classes at all
College Junior,4,wish I had done it years ago
College Junior,4,lots of spaces to work
College Junior,4,I love being there the instructors are wonderful and so helpful
College Junior,4,The hours have been cut that and it hurts not to be able use the tools that are provided .
College Junior,4,"All of the professor want you to know what is going  and care about my education, except the problem with the online classes. "
College Junior,4,I feel that I should be able to get a job with my education. 
College Junior,4,I love their student success center! 
College Junior,4,The professors are very personable and want to teach you! The small to medium class size allows for more one on one time. Most of the professors will learn your name and give you alternate explanations for topics you don't understand. The only problem I have is with the online programs. I am getting charged $45 a semester to use an online server that is not big enough to handle all of the students. Most of the time I cannot get logged in to access my assignments.
College Senior,4,Classes and professors are generally adequate and challenging while giving you the education you need.
College Freshman,4,most of my professors are very highly educated and are passionate about the education that they bring to other people.
College Freshman,4,"I'm an education major. The classes I'm taking are related to my major. The facilities are nice, the computers are up to date which is nice. The school wide email system is very efficient. I only wish there was more music related programs within the school especially having as many students as we do."
College Junior,4,"Everything I need is right here on campus.  There are so many computers and iPads that a student doesn't really need to own one.  The faculty and staff are so helpful and friendly, and the Student Success Center (tutoring) is a life-saver!"
College Sophomore,4,"I have yet to have any trouble with network capabilities here on campus, as far as printing access, computer lab availability, etc. I will say, however, that occasionally the wireless internet connection becomes unavailable for periods of time, likely as a result of the volume of user attempting to simultaneously access the bandwidth."
College Junior,4,"Very affordable, and I have earned tuition waivers and scholarships that have reduced my need for loans."
College Junior,4,"I still prefer being in an on-campus class, but the eCampus offerings are sometimes the only way I can enroll in a required course.  I have become accustomed to the format, and have done well."
College Freshman,4,There are both traditional and non-traditional students.  Some of the traditional students do not seem as interested in getting their education which can make it difficult on others.
College Junior,4,"I have not had any issue with the academics. My processes have been very smooth. All though I do know some that have had some big issues and have tried to help them out when they seek my advice. Get to know your professors. Always keep good communication skills with professors, advisors, and anyone else you have contact with at the college."
College Sophomore,4,Its great i can work and be able to have time to do homework without rushing
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't used the career services yet, but the Student Success Center is located in the same office, and they are always extremely helpful to me!"
College Sophomore,4,"The staff have always been very helpful to me.  Of course there is always a line clear down the hallway at the start of every semester, but I've always tried to take care of all my issues beforehand, so I won't have any problems when the semester starts.  I think they could use more staff at these times."
College Sophomore,4,"The internet is usually reliable but there have been times where it has been off for the whole entire day which is not good sometimes when you need to get a project done. It is reliably fast on most days too except for the days I had described. The library isn't state of the art in all means but from the small selection of books that they do have, is a great selection of all different types of subjects needed for school reports and ect."
College Junior,4,I transfered back home to WVU-P after a year of attending Alderson-Broaddus College.  I was pleased that most every course I completed at AB transfered.  I really haven't had any complaints with academics here at WVU-P.
College Junior,4,Pretty Good Facilites – This schools facilites are pretty good. they have everything you need within a short distance to each other.
College Junior,4,"There is an amazing amount of diversity in the makeup of our student body.  I am a 55-year-old full-time student attending mostly physical campus classes, and I see such a large range of ages, races, backgrounds, and ability. The majority understand that one student's success reflects on all of us, and we go out of our way to extend offeres of help and idea-sharing between classmates."
College Sophomore,4,Surprisingly Exciting Experience! I have felt extremely confident ever dice I made the choice to become a teacher the classes have been challenging but exciting enough to be encouraging. This school has provided me with a healthy dose of experience already and I haven't even been admitted to the program! I'm so excited to be able to continue my education here and complete my bachelors degree.
College Freshman,2,Unless you do nursing there really isn't anything available
College Junior,2,I will not be able to go to post grad school at this location because it is not offered. It is a affiliate school so I would have to move two hours away to be able to attend.
College Sophomore,2,I have been trying to figure out how to apply for scholarships and this school just has had me chasing my tail and hasnt offered much help to fill out papers on scholarships.
College Junior,2,The online classes I have taken I haven't been able to get ahold of the professor when their was a problem. 
College Junior,2,The workload seemed just to be busy work. The registration process was difficult. I wish there was more peer-to-peer interaction. 
College Junior,2,I have a problem with getting financial aid because I make too much money. People in the financial aid office are unknowledgeable about the Promise Scholarship requirements and how to pay back loans. 
College Junior,2,"I am a nursing major. The professors are all nurses themselves and have a great amount of experience. Unfortunately, they incorporate the broken technology and don't care about the problems students face with it. The servers do not log on most of the time, and the professors do not announce assignments in class. Many of us don't have internet at home and have to work out a way to do our paperwork. We have had problems with the school bookstore regarding program codes, DVDs, and eBooks and all the professors can say is ""it's your responsibility to have this done."" All I can say is at least this is how the real world works."
College Senior,2,All housing is off campus and private. Groups tend to be invite only and student interaction is by student initiative only.
College Senior,2,To my knowledge there is little to no help upon completion of your degree.
College Senior,2,Not very many scholarships available. Higher one has made refund more difficult. Five week hold on refund can be taxing for students.
College Junior,2,"There is no interaction with the teacher and I have gotten no response from a recent e-mail. The questions on online tests are directly from the book and some are very subtle and hard to answer. With only two due dates the whole semester, it is easy to put off because of other closer due dates in other classes, resulting in irregular studying."
College Senior,2,"Not alot of campus activities, but they do offer some."
College Junior,2,My Experience at WVUP Has Been Tedious. The facilities at WVUP are constantly improving. They have no organization when desiging programs. They do not always offer the same classes every semester so it makes it difficult if you do not follow their plan.
College Junior,2,"Lack of Career Programs – While we do have career counselling services, there is a sad lack of an office to assist students with job placements or internships."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Be Prepared to Handle It Yourself – The financial aid given at the school is fine, it's just that you have to handle most of it yourself. If you do not have your tuition paid by a few weeks BEFORE class you will be de-registered. And there is no letter sent out notifying when you need to do so. Also, attendance is taken for each class, and if you miss a class or two you will more than likely lose part of your financial aid. No matter how well you may understand the material."
College Junior,1,I don't think there is anything unique about my school. 
College Junior,1,The online courses are an absolute headache! The server will not connect most of the time. The IT people say it's because the server can't handle the amount of students. Teachers don't make posts until the last minute. I'm paying $45 a semester for this and I'd expect it to work.
College Senior,1,"I have had tremendous problems with the financial aid office at WVUP due to a bad grades almost 20 years ago. I had requested and received grade forgiveness, which should have kept me from being on the academic probation list once this was approved. However, even with 3 semesters of Dean's list grades and a gpa of 3.57 I was placed on suspension due to having to drop one class due to a conflict in work schedule.  I am now prohibited from using any kind of financial aid or student loans. (My student loans will now go into default due to this situation) The only way I can now continue my education is either through scholarships, my own money (which I can't afford) or to transfer colleges."
College Sophomore,1,The school that I attend has a little bit of everything. There are young high school graduates to adults with families. Mostly are school consists of the older generation. Which means that young freshman and undergraduates do not have the same experiences and advantages as they would if they attended a larger college with more students in their age group.

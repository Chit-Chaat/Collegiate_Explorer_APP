Freshman,5,Concord University has some of the best teachers in their program. They all really like their jobs and genuinely want their students to succeed.
Freshman,5,"Due to corona, I had to take some of my classes online. This was new for the school so obviously it didn’t go smoothly, but all the teachers were still actively engaging with students."
Junior,5,Love the dorms! Athletes and teachers are great! Should add new upgrades to the football stadiums as the new coach takes over though !
Freshman,5,Athlete at Concord. It is a nice home setting college. Mid-size Univeristy with lots of stuff to do when not in he classroom or at practice. Would recommend.
Freshman,5,"Great school, good sports, teachers, nice views and dorms! Good overall experience. If you want a good college experience concord will do that for you"
Alum,5,I love this university. This school prepared me better than I could have ever imagined for my full-time job. The Business Department are excellent especially the Accounting professors. There were plenty of real world applications and the professors actually care about their student's success.
Junior,5,"the area is beginning to build up all their businesses. If you know where to look, there are so many fun things to do and cute local places to eat. Plus, living in WV, you are closest to some of the best outdoor adventures. It’s rural, but means it’s good to actually focus on your studies rather than wanting to go out clubbing. The professors truly care, and while they are difficult, their passion makes it easy to learn. Best Pre-Med & Business school in the area, hands down."
Freshman,5,"Going in as a freshman in college, Concord has already offered me many new opportunities and encouraged me to try new things."
Senior,5,"I believe that Concord University has a very good biology program.  I believe that Concord Unviersity prepares you very well for the future and for life outside of college after you graduate.  Concord is a great school, that provides many different community service, social, and academic opportunities."
Niche User,5,"Concord University is the best place to socialize and experience a change like never before. I feel that many students will learn many things living on campus and experience true relationships with professors, coaches, trainers, and other students. I wouldn’t change a thing about Concord University."
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful, and you can tell a lot of people from around the area take pride in it. Also, you can really tell that professors care for the work they are doing and want to pass that passion onto the students."
Niche User,5,Beautiful campus located in a small town. Excellent Education program which I am persuing. Cost is much lower than other colleges I looked into.
Sophomore,5,"The staff is very personable. They are always there for the student first. Very helpful and informative. The campus can be kind of confusing between buildings looking somewhat similar. However, the staff has recently provided several ways to improve the direction of where to go for classes. Most professors are extremely caring and understanding. They work with the students inside and out of the university. The learning process is very well thought out and re-looked at many times with many eyes to make sure it is the best possible scenario for the students."
Graduate Student,5,"Concord University (Erma Byrd Center) has provided an excellant education for me in the Socical Work Program.  The financail aid department is excellant helping with any issues that arise.  CU has two different campus sites to choose from and the faculty is exceptional, putting their students education first."
Junior,5,"Concord university not only offers a wide variety of up to date majors, wide branch selection and qualified professors but it also provides the student with a high quality residence experience that makes the student want to be there constantly; in addition, the athletic department highly focuses on each sport depending on the respective season to ensure that each sport is having an equal amount of support.
And for non-student athletes the SGA introduces a long list of activities that students will not only enjoy but learn something from them."
Niche User,5,"When i visited Concord University, I really liked the scenery and everything about it. The people there were serious about their jobs and they cared about everyone interested in going to Concord."
Freshman,5,Great place to meet new people. Class is almost like being in high school but it isn't as strict. It's my home away from home.
College Sophomore,5,I am in a sorority and it has made college better.
College Freshman,5,I came from a very small town and when looking fort he right college I searched for the small community that I am used to and Concord University fit it perfectly. Concord is small all the professors can get to know their students and the class room settings are small.
College Freshman,5,"The Administration is really nice. They don't want you to get in trouble and as long as you're not breaking any major rules or endangering yourself or others, it is hard to get in trouble. Noise complaints aren't formal, they'll just ask you nicely to turn it down unless there is further issue to the point of annoyance. Parking is also not very strict. There are almost always plenty of spots, and all the parking lots are pretty close together, so it's a difference of a minute or two. If a commuter parks in a dorm lot- as long as they're gone by the end of class- then usually they're fine."
College Freshman,5,"The honor's program that Concord offers is great. They're still looking for more people as well, so it is really easy to get in as long as you have a 3.5 to start off with. There are also a lot of other scholarships and they accept financial aid easily."
College Sophomore,5,"Always getting alerts via email, text and call."
College Junior,5,"Many top student athletes come here. There isn't a better place, and we have tons of trophies."
College Senior,5,Lots of one on one time with profs snd feel they really want us to do well
College Junior,5,Concord is known for being an excellent Teaching school.  Some of the best teachers in West Virginia have come from Concord University.  The education department thrives on ensuring a positive and nurturing atmosphere in order to promote healthy relationships and long lasting impressions.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone finds fun and we stay safe for the most part. 
College Sophomore,5,"I love it, I myself am apart of tau kappa epsilon and we are the most involved in the community and bringing people into the Greek life. We love to bring cool activities for the small town to be apart of. "
College Sophomore,5,I love the workshops and opportunities are great.
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is the most popular. I love it
College Sophomore,5,I love the dining and student facilities. 
College Sophomore,5,I love the friends and diverse people I've met. And the academics are amazing. 
College Freshman,5,"Homecoming, greek life, the student activities, the dorms are nice."
College Freshman,5,"Small program, but both of the professors are geniuses at what they do and we are relatively close to DC so if we wanted we could have good internships."
College Junior,5,Very rigorous. Especially the sciences.
College Sophomore,5,"I am on the baseball team and we are involved in a 1,000 hour community service project every year. We managed to meet this goal last year while simultaneously winning a Conference Championship"
College Sophomore,5,We have small classes and our professors are great
College Freshman,5,Concord merges to be the kind of school you want it to be.
College Freshman,5,Nightlife is great because most students focus on their school. I live in a small town so most move away for college just to explore other places.
College Freshman,5,"Diversity at Concord is very good there are lots of different race, believes, clicks, and etc. For example, in the hall I passed by three different people and each was a different race."
College Student,5,There is no public transportation at Concordia because their is no need because it is such a small campus it is no hostel to walk to all your classes
College Junior,5,The town people are really amazing and will do whatever it takes to make you safe. Concord University in Athens is amazing and I would recommend anyone to go there cause it is a great experience and there are plenty of store's like Walmart and Gamestop near by.
Recent Alumnus,5,There is always a spot to park if you are a full-time student as a parking pass is included in your tuition.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Concord University is a great school and one of the best, if not the best, in West Virginia for undergraduate education. Given the opportunity, I would certainly choose Concord University again. I am currently working on my Master's Degree in Chemistry at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) with full funding, which means that I pay nothing for my education at RIT due to my undergraduate accomplishments. I accredit this to Concord University. I am not the only student from Concord here in the Chemistry program AND in other programs. I know some of my classmates went to Indiana University's Ph.D. program, Notre Dam's Ph.D. program, Wayne State University's Ph.D. program, and Emory's Ph.D. program. I will also soon begin working on my Ph.D. as well. That is over 50% of the students in one graduating chemistry class going to acquire professional degrees."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The application process is very very easy and the requirements are not bad either. Just go online and fill out the application or print it out and send it in. I will say that just getting into the school is the easy part. Many people get into Concord but few can actually handle the rigorous courses, at least in the sciences. Not many people make it through the sciences."
College Senior,5,Much of this are never told to us as we meet at night and it is looks peaceful .
College Junior,5,"Concord offers many Majors like education, business, and biology. The education department is nationally recognized, as well as the pre-med program."
College Senior,5,"Small Departments – Because Concord University is such a small school, some of the departments are rather small. However, the teachers are all great, knowledgeable, and have helped me through classes. One of the best things about Concord is that the students and the professors have a relationship with one another, no one is just a name. We all get personalized help and instruction from our teachers, they've always been a support for me. The campus is beautiful and well maintained, but parking for commuters is always an issue every year."
College Junior,5,The Teacher Education Program Is One of the Best in the Country. Concord University does an amazing job at preparing  future teachers.
College Junior,5,The weather at Concord is wonderful!  I especially love autumn at Concord.  The beautiful Fall leaves make the campus even more appealling!
College Junior,5,"If you like rain then this is the place for you, i happen to love rain!"
College Freshman,5,The cost of Concord University is very accessible to any student who is having financial difficulties. It is one of the cheapest schools in West Virginia.
College Student,5,"No Drugs – Concord has strict policies and fair rules. There are barely any drugs and if caught with drugs, the student will be punished. Drugs aren't really a big thing. If they are doing drugs it is just smoking. Many students are focused on studying and graduating."
College Junior,5,"Alberta Street – A 10 minute walk will get you to alberta street where you can literally find everything fun. They have a wide variety of options from high end cafes and bistros to food carts with cuisine from across the globe, from the grill cheesed grill (yum) to yakuza a japanese food bar, their is something for every one at every price point.
This street is portland in a nutshell, weird, funky and fun!"
College Senior,5,"Nature Filled City – Portland is a very organic, green city. We are about recycling, going ""green"" protecting the planet and keeping nature number one. The air feels clean, you would never see so many trees anywhere else."
College Sophomore,5,"Perfect for Social Butterflies! Concord's students are laid back students. As far as dress, it varies: Some students rock sweatpants and tees for comfort, while others dress more fashionably. Most students seem friendly and willing to help. It's easy to approach other students on campus. The social life at Concord is amazing: Everyone seems to know everyone, thanks to the many organizations and Greek groups."
Recent Alumnus,5,Very Diverse – The school has a variety of student of all ages and colors. Everyone is friendly and open to population .
Recent Alumnus,5,"The school has a list and maps of various restaurants within the area.  Also has a list of restaurants that give the student discounts. In the area, you have a wide variety within 5-10 minutes to travel too.  The food is great and the service is great."
College Junior,5,"Concord has up to date, fast, and reliable computers. The school has done a great job with keeping the computers new with high speed internet services. I know for a fact they are always working on the computer systems to update them and make them even more reliable. There are several computer labs so it is always easy to find a computer to do work on. It is a little more difficult during finals, but if you wait for class change you can usually find an open computer. I give Concord an A+ for their computers."
College Sophomore,5,"One of the best things about Concord University is the attitude of the students who attend. It is extremely hard to find yourself a student, much less a teacher, with bad manners or attitudes towards others. I am a returning sophomore student and I still have not find a person who makes me think down on their behavior."
College Sophomore,5,"Small and Friendly – My favorite two things about Concord is that it is a small campus (with a small student body) and all the people are very friendly. Since the classes aren't that big, teachers can take a personal interest in your education and help you to reach your potential. You won't ever find someone at Concord who isn't smiling or willing to help you in some way. I love this school and think that it's the best college in America."
Niche User,4,"I've been to Concord several times for the Upward Bound program, a visit, and I am also going there with my club in high school known as FBLA. The cafeteria has just been remodeled and looks amazing. I also love the convenience of where everything is on campus. Once you get used to walking around everywhere in college, you really realize that Concord is a smaller campus and there isn't as much walking as anticipated."
Freshman,4,Concord is just a beautiful school with the mountains close in distance. Seeing the leaves change color and knowing it’s fall is great.
Junior,4,"The community is wonderful, most of the staff is wonderful. My only complaint is that sometimes they expect a bit too much out of the students."
Freshman,4,"The campus is very beautiful, there are many different cultures. the teacher to student ratio is very good. you would enjoy going to concord university"
Sophomore,4,"I love its professor and location, but they should have more outdoor space and smoking free the campus!"
Freshman,4,"Concord University is a beautiful campus with excellent academics. I could not think of one thing I would change about this place other than the community, however this is not Concord's fault and shouldn't be taking responsibility."
Senior,4,Concord University is a great place. The views all around the school are just to die for. I like it because it is small classes and you get a lot of one on one time with teachers and they get to know you better. The only thing i wish could change is the amount of stuff in Athens. I just wish there was much more to do.
Freshman,4,I like the small class sizes and how close it is to home. I like how willing the professors are to help. I dislike how money hungry and unconcerned with student affairs they are. There's literally nothing to do here.
College Senior,4,I am really enjoying my experience here at the school!
College Senior,4,I really appreciate the quality of the course materials. The professors are real specialist in their field.
College Freshman,4,I love my team and a lot of people go to our games.
College Sophomore,4,I have had an overall pretty good experience in college so far/
College Sophomore,4,"Concord University seems to be big on athletics. It has a teams for soccer, volleyball, tennis, softball, baseball, track and field, cross country, and football. Teams from each sport seem to always to go good or even great."
College Freshman,4,Most of the students that live on campus get involved with greek life.
College Junior,4,"Concord is a great school for anybody wanting to better their lives. Not only in school, but in life too."
College Freshman,4,"At the Higher Education Center, the Concord Administration are great."
College Junior,4,Campus housing is very great! Its too big but also not small. Some of the visitation rules are unnecessary but i believe the housing is very spacious.
College Freshman,4,The food is good. The staff is mostly friendly. It's a good place to eat.
College Senior,4,"Best way to get the school together is the football team, even for non-athletic types."
College Freshman,4,"Some of the greek groups are not so good... and they can be disruptive and rude for both fraternities and sororities, but the majority other than two main groups are very polite, fun to be around, and generally interesting and lovely people."
College Freshman,4,"Concord puts a lot into them, not as much as some other stuff, so it's not solely sports oriented, but they are very nice and useable."
College Freshman,4,"Concord is a great place for people who want to go to a nice university, but want a smaller town. It's very safe and there are police on campus, yet I've heard of them being used. There's a subway, a wingspan, and a starbucks on campus which is all reasonably priced. The bookstore is a little pricy, but average for a college store. The cafeteria is okay- could use some work, but not too bad for the price either. Over all, classes, food, dorms- it's pretty good- above average and the campus is beautiful."
College Sophomore,4,Very organized and many enjoy them if they can't make it on a varsity team!
College Junior,4,Concord is pretty average with their strictness. Security is easy to get along with.
College Junior,4,Dorms are okay but need updated. The RAs are usually always hosting an activity in the evenings.
College Junior,4,Greeks have their own wing in the dorms instead of chapter houses.
College Freshman,4,The online class that I am in goes smoothly. The professor makes sure that we know he is there to help.
College Freshman,4,Concord University is a widely accepted school. Many teachers in the area attended Concord and are always excellent.
College Freshman,4,"I'm not sure yet. I have yet to start school, but from what I can see from other people it seems like it's a good major to be in."
College Freshman,4,"The campus isn't huge, but it is well kept and most everything is updated."
College Sophomore,4,There were different options for admission that I was able to take advantage of such as tuition reduction.
College Sophomore,4,It provides an opportunity for those not involved in varsity sports to have and sports outlet
College Sophomore,4,On the most part the professors are very helpful. There are a few who are not.  The courses I have taken have been very enlightening and well structured. I had a very good freshman year.
College Sophomore,4,The possibilities of student career prospects and the value of a degree  from this school are endless.
College Sophomore,4,"Students athletic center is better than average as it includes swimming pool, dance center, basketball court, training and lockers room are very good and well as the weight rooms."
College Sophomore,4,Diversity is great as student come from all ethnic/racial backgrounds and appear to blend and associated well together.
College Junior,4,The program has many great professors willing to work with students and a challenging curriculum.
College Junior,4,"Courses are challenging and thought provoking, professors are enthusiastic and willing to help students succeed."
College Senior,4,they are pretty fair with us but do enforce their rules.
College Senior,4,we are not far from several places to go if we need something in a hurry.
College Senior,4,Because of the time that my rep took with me and how he was willing to go above and beyond to help me.
College Senior,4,"There is all kinds of ethinic diversity ranging from African American, Hispanic, Caucasian, you name it to much to list."
College Senior,4,I am only focused on school when i am in the area.
College Senior,4,So far my instructor is very knowledgable and gives us all the information and on time.
College Senior,4,"My name is Lisa Miles I am a single mother of three children with no support, and I am a full time student at Concorde and need the extra funding to go to the remaining balance to the school itself. Please I need some help thank you so much and have a great day."
College Junior,4,Everything from social gatherings to book clubs and much more is available. The school spirit is unmatched.
College Junior,4,"Everything from fresh burgers, coffee, sandwiches, pho, and tons of other quick and ethnic options are available. Most places give student discounts with your student card. A popular place is the Lab."
College Junior,4,"The only reason I chose great is because the free way is right next to the school, so getting here with your own transportation is easy. Also, the metro runs right along the side of the school, so public transportation including buses is great. However, the airport is not close, nor is the train. People rideshare and there are tons of SC transportation modes in campus."
College Junior,4,"It's California! It mostly never rains, but when it does it's a welcome relief from warmth. Be sure to bring sweaters because winter can get down in the 60s! Enjoy the sun and don't worry about when it rains."
College Senior,4,Lots of options not far from campus
College Senior,4,Im a ministry major and love the closeness eith profs and classmates
College Freshman,4,Concord is strict in terms of rules and regulations
College Student,4,"I am really happy with what I plan to do. My country has very good engineering colleges to choose from but I don't find them interesting and fun. I want to see new horizons, travel and learn cultures from different parts of the world by being in a different part of the world myself. My career goals are to hopefully earn a bachelor's degree in Computer or Chemical Engineering. I also want to complete my master's degree. With that, I can come back to my country with an elite capability of intelligence and practicality within myself. About finding my job in my field, I hope I can find an engineering job which not only focuses on work but also environmental protection and well being. I want to have fun and be happy with whatever I do."
College Student,4,"I have taken a short internship in the Red Cross back in my country. It was about medical purposes. Yes, I do have some concerns about finding internships in USA when I will get there."
College Junior,4,I love the business program here. The teachers are too into reading off powerpoints though instead of actually trying to interact and get the students involved.
College Junior,4,The work load is easy although the ciriculum isnt as easy. They do present some interships but none for out of state students.
College Junior,4,I have very happy now that I am in the program.  I am especially thrilled about the professors.  Each of them are very knowledgeable about their content area and are eager to help whenever problems come about.  I plan on graduating in a year and fulfilling my career as an elementary teacher here in West Virginia.
College Junior,4,"I have not seen local weather affect campus too much.  Because Concord is in West Virginia, snow is the only factor that affect school.  This past year, school was canceled and delayed more than usual do to the massive amount of snow."
College Junior,4,"I believe our campus has a wonderful student relationship.  The majority of on-campus students are athletes.  These students work hard to support each other and promote dedication.  Additionally, the relationships between sororities and fraternities is excellent.  These two groups need to not interact much with the athletes but work exceptionally well with each other.  They too are constantly encouraging the others to be the best they can be.  All students enjoy campus gatherings such as parades, bonfires, bingo nights, and movies."
College Freshman,4,The people in the financial aid office explained everything and I knew before hand how much I was getting.
Alum,2,"Concord professors back when I graduated in 2006 we’re not very accommodating to people who are different. Being told I shouldn’t be in college with a disability is horrible.   

Some professors decide they don’t like you and then decide no matter what you do they will fail you. 

I fear for any student that has special needs here.   I saw they have an Autism program.  Please parents consider elsewhere for your students.  Some of the same crappy professors I had back then are still there. 

I did have some great professors and role models but they don’t want to stand up for you due to bullying."
Junior,2,"I entered this university under the assumption that I would have the normal college experience in terms of how long I would be enrolled here; upon arriving at the school, I was told that in order to get out in the normal ""4 years,"" I'd have to take an average of 21 hours a semester. Music education is the only program I've found handled like this at this school. I was also told that it was an ""affordable education."" I don't call being $50,000 in debt being affordable in the slightest. Any student who attends this university under the guise that it's affordable is being lied to. 
In addition to all this, Concord is trying its best to completely choke my program out. It's providing less funds each year, cutting music scholarships that are vital to students like me getting swindled on tuition costs, and they're trying to cut classes that I need to graduate. I know for a fact that I wouldn't be compensated for a single dime if my program gets cut before I can graduate. 
"
College Senior,2,"Landlords jack up the prices for poor quality places, thinking students won't know/be able to afford any better and actually use threats/intimidation among other shady tactics when they speak out. If you can find a decent landlord, good job. If not, move outside the area but close enough to drive/catch the bus to campus."
College Sophomore,2,"There is only one dining place, a small franchise restaurant."
College Sophomore,2,The school takes away grants if you live off campus.
College Junior,2,"Unless you want to drive into Princeton, your only option to eat near campus is Gino's."
College Freshman,2,There are no options unless you want to live in a bad part of town or have a lot of money to waste on a place.
College Sophomore,2,"campus is located in small town, pretty much nothing around ( except outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, rafting, skiing, etc)"
College Sophomore,2,"There's nothing around campus, there is one club in princeton that is 20 mins drive from school.

Mostly house parties but always get busted by cops. so basically no nightlife."
College Freshman,2,need to have a car to go here and there
College Freshman,2,not much student use it
College Freshman,2,I didnt got any scholarship. I am an international student and i am still struggling to get some scholarship
College Junior,2,theres only really two places to choose from and you still dont have the freedom its just like living on campus
College Junior,2,"For admission into the Teacher Education Program, one must submit a series of paper work.  In order to be eligible, an individual must have completed the required courses, passed Praxis Core Academics tests, worked 25 hours with youth, as well as write a couple philosophy statements.  I would suggest to anyone to apply early and ask questions whenever they arise."
College Junior,2,"I have lived on campus for three years now.  Though I have enjoyed the easy access to my classes and the cafeteria, I do not enjoy living in the dorms.  My dorm building is very old, run down, and it very cramped.  I share a room with one girl and the entire floor shares two bathrooms.  This sometimes because a major problem with privacy and availability of showers, etc.  The cost of living in the dorms is outrageous but I believe that is an issue at any university."
College Student,2,really cold......due to the fact that am an international student and its not that cold in my country
College Senior,2,"If you don't have a car, and if your times do not match up with the local transportation. You pretty much don't go anywhere unless you walk."
College Sophomore,2,Wish visitations were less strict. 
College Senior,2,Good school but a little expensive
College Sophomore,2,"The police officers do their job when it is necessary, but they do not look for anyone breaking the law and when they are confident there are inappropriate activities occurring, they tend to stay away and let them be as long as they are not affecting other students/people."
College Sophomore,2,"I live on campus so I am not too familiar with Off-Campus Housing, but I do know there are many complaints about poor water pressure and such things."
College Senior,2,The financial aid process when you are in grad school is non-existent. I feel that 'they' think when you are in a grad program 'they' think you have a stable high paying career. Your options in a grad program are loans (more loans) or paying out of pocket. I wish there were more options for students that are in a grad program because not all of us can pay out of pocket or want to rack up more student loans...
College Junior,2,I do not like sharing bathrooms with 20 other girls and I hate the fire alarms that keep going off n the middle of the night
College Freshman,2,"I will be a freshman this year, the only thing that I have under my belt as far as finances go, is the $5,500 loan that I got from the school.  I filled out the foundation scholarships and got absolutely nothing from that,and one was for just being a girl."
College Freshman,2,"The classes you take vairy from teacher to teacher, wether its any good or not, some of the teachers are complete loones and not in a good cool sort of way. The campus is beautiful but there are a bunch of safety issues and not letting the student body know if something dangerous is happening. It was bad, there was a guy running up to girls at night, pushing them up against their cars and putting his hand down their pants, and then he'd just run off, it wasnt on the website, no letters sent out nothing from what I could tell. Half the paper work seems to get lost or misfiled with some people, I myself had to send in my highschool transcript twice. So overall not great but, it's what I've got to deal with."
College Junior,2,"None of the dorms are air conditioned and two of them have community bathrooms, which can get really really gross. The two best dorms, North and South Towers, are outrageously priced. WiFi is easy to crash there, and a lot of times the elevators are undergoing maintenance so you have to walk. However, the other dorms (Wilson and Woodell) don't have elevators at all."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much of a nightlife. If you enjoy parties then you will maybe find a few ""get-togethers""."
College Sophomore,2,The cafe isn't the greatest but its whats around. It can definitely get old.
Recent Alumnus,2,Very bad. They need to get a contract with a new dining company.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Nothing much going on in Athens, WV or even Princeton, Wv for that matter. Concord University is the attraction."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The only place to eat in Athens in Gino's Pizza which is terrible. You have to drive 10 minutes into Princeton to get any other restaurants. The selection there is okay but having been to a lot of other college towns, I know that there is much much better."
Recent Alumnus,2,Terrible. No clubs/bars close to campus. Lots of house parties though. It takes some time to get used to but those can be fun. The on-campus alcohol policy is also very strict.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Student life is the worst part about CU. There isn't much to do due to it's remote rural location. Though the school tries to keep the students entertained, they usually fall short. Besides the occasional bingo night, band, or sporting event there isn't anything else besides studying, which is a good thing because you will need to do it. The night life also is non-existant outside the constant house parties from Thursday night to sometimes Sunday. 
The dorms are also not that great. They serve their purpose but the housing department is a pain to deal with and it takes them forever to respond to issues.
The people are GREAT though! Everyone is nice and very helpful. Southern hospitality at it's finest."
College Sophomore,2,"The diversity at CU is pretty average, though accepting."
College Student,2,It goes out pretty frequently and has spotty reception to begin with.
College Freshman,2,"There's pretty much only one option in Athens: Gino's pizza. Princeton isn't too far away, but it is mainly limited to the main chain restaurants."
College Freshman,2,"Completely average. On campus parking is good for the closer dormitories, but not so well for the North and South towers. For commuters, the most available parkings spots are at the football field which allows average distance to all class buildings, but the parking spots are dangerously close to each other."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking costs are not bad at all and the tickets are not overwelming either, but trying to find a safe parking spot is awful."
College Freshman,2,There really isn't much of anything right around campus. There is a larger town a couple miles from campus but it costs gas to get there.
College Student,2,"Our school is pretty generic, the track is falling apart, the class rooms are very nice and clean and up to date but the floors are dirty or cracked and the side walks are dirty with trash or spills and the parking lot is small so you can never find a place to park."
Niche User,1,"This school has cut a lot of really good programs. It used to be extraordinary, and now it is almost less-worth-going-to than a community college."
Sophomore,1,"My worst mistake I’ve ever made was going to Concord and now I’m trying to transfer. The campus is not safe because of some sexual assaults. The food tastes worse than terrible. The location is...gruesome, boring, you would have nothing to do around here. Bla bla bla. I mean I hate this school."
College Freshman,1,There is only one restaurant in Athens. At least it's pizza.
College Sophomore,1,They don't tell you thr scholarship details and possibly getting the scholarship for one year only.
College Freshman,1,Campus is really good but local atmosphere sucks
College Freshman,1,Bad at nightlife. cops shows up in every offcampus party
College Junior,1,"The spring and fall days are decent. Although there is still nothing to do on campus. The winters are terrible, theres no night life and its always too cold to be out doing activities."
College Junior,1,In the town of Athens. There is approximately one stop light and two stores. The campus is very protected and theres nothing to do for students.
College Junior,1,"I personally love the town of Athens, where my university is located; however, others do not feel the same.  Athens, WV is a very small town that only offers Concord University, Gino's (an Italian restaurant), and CVS.  Additionally, there are a few number of apartments complexes, two banks, one gas station, and 5 churches in the community.  One would need to drive 20 minutes for Wal-Mart, medical care, or restaurants. I grew up in a very rural community so I enjoy the peaceful life that Athens offers."
College Junior,1,"There is practically no nightlife. There is a club about half an hour away from the school, and it is 18 and up, but it can be really sketchy."
College Sophomore,1,There is only one restaurant near by. It's nothing special.
College Junior,1,"Although each student who drives a car to campus is required to buy a parking permit each semester, parking is very limited.  If the main commuter parking lot is full, there are very few other options."
College Freshman,1,"The parking is awful, nearly every spot is filled all of the time; if you want a good spot, you have to get it early"
College Student,1,"It really depends on what you do. If you go out to a house party and the cops are called they don't really say much besides keep the noise down, but if your drinking in your dorm and the cops are called you're busted if you're not 21."
College Junior,1,Very Christian – If you are not above 21 and can go off campus then the on campus activities are very limited and restrictive
College Sophomore,1,"Concord's parking is the most stressful part of any school day. The parking lots don't offer much space, and the one closest to classes is almost even dangerous to be driving in - I'm sure there are multiple hit and runs a day. There just aren't enough spaces available, and the ones that are available are so difficult to park in."
College Sophomore,1,Permits are reasonably priced but parking is way too limited.
College Junior,1,"Housing System in General – The Housing on campus is ridiculous.  Buildings are old, AC is not available.  The process for selecting roommates is ineffective.  Dorm visitation restrictions at a public institution is also an issue.  College students are adults, not children.  They should not be subjected to these situations."
College Freshman,1,"Parking at my university is impossible. The number of spaces is extremely small compared to the number of students who need to park, and the spaces are unbelievably close to one another. It's almost scary to park in the parking lot because of the fear of hitting another vehicle. Anyone who begins class in the middle of the day will probably have nowhere to park."

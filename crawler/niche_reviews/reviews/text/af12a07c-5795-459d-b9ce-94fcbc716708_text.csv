Alum,5,What I liked was the striking environment and the involvement of the students.  For first year Physics lab they had us run through a few standard labs just to experience and then they turned us loose to do other labs.  One of our labs was with two friends.  We managed to get a key to the old astronomy building where a solar telescope was removed leaving a many storied hole in the building.  We managed to rig a pendulum to measure the latitude.  It was fascinating.  We were measuring the precession but got an interesting effect.  The pendulum which started as a line drag  showed that it was an eclipse with an increasing minor axis. Not a perfect result but one which required learning a lot.  Where else would they just give a bunch of teens the keys to play with the building.
Alum,5,Four years at Caltech were a unique experience.  I was there in the esrly 60s and it is hard to explain the effect of sitting around and talking with Richard Feynman.  He was a unique individual.
Freshman,5,"Some of the best (and worse) people you will ever meet. Nurses here take care of you super well, especially if you encounter the Freshman Plague. Professors go really fast and expect you to know a lot more than you're taught in high school. The emphasis on honor code makes this school truly unique."
Niche User,5,"I loved visiting caltech! I loved the campus, it was so beautiful. The houses each had their own personality, and cool traditions! I got to play tennis on the courts there and stay with some other girls in the houses themselves. We staying in flemming house and spent a lot of time in the common room! We also were able to tour the academic facilities and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is associated with Caltech and it was truly inspiring to see. We were given the opportunity to see current projects in JPL like the 2020 mars rover! I cannot wait to apply!"
Sophomore,5,The size and academic rigor of this institution makes it the perfect place for a STEM-focused student to go and grow.
Niche User,5,"California Institute of Technology is definitely a dream school. The engineering classes seem very interesting, and I look forward to possibly study there."
Freshman,5,"The best school in the country, period. Great research opportunities, faculty and resources make up Caltech. But it is the incredible people around that make it such a worthwhile experience."
Freshman,5,"I love Caltech! The collaborative environment here is amazing and I am learning a lot! The challenge is there, but for people who love the sciences, this is the best school in the country."
Alum,5,"The place is no different from HELL.
You have all the access to the top of the top of any field. But you have to work hard.  you are going to take the same class with first year grad students from your junior year.   By the time you finish your four year inmate life, you get extremely well prepared for grad school, or you will become too full of the subjects; you do not want to see the subject which once you liked.  GOOD LUCK"
Alum,5,"Not just 'small', intimate. Imagine a top-tier university where many classes have 15 or 20 students (or less) AND do not get cancelled. This is true of English lit (Falkner and Fitzgerald), Entrepreneurship, Poly Sci, Anthro or Macro and even science intro classes. This is simply a small but spectacular place. A student body of UNDER a thousand students, and these will be a thousand of the brightest stars you will ever hope to meet. You will personally know almost all of your classmates (there will be only ~270 TOTAL, including all majors in your class), plus your professors typically teach only one or two classes (except for freshman lectures) and are personal. Research opportunities abound. My upper division classes had 8 students. Really. Every course I took opened my eyes and inspired me. Caltech is full service: my graduating class included a business, econ and even a journalism major.  I took fencing (epee) and beginning golf classes. Each had maybe 6 students(!)"
Niche User,5,I loved the campus when I went on my tour! The trees and greenery really draw you in and give you a feeling on inclusion. Can't wait to apply to this wonderful small university!
Alum,5,"Tough, Good for research and general science. Expect to work hard, but feel very rewarded. Houses system is a plus."
Freshman,5,"Great academics and opportunities, beautiful weather. Very demanding but also a very supportive community."
Alum,5,"If you like science and tech, this is the place to go. Small school makes professors, research, work study, and other opportunities more available. You learn to work with others to get through the academics which are tough, but you ultimately come out with a great sense of accomplishment. It is not the right school for everyone but if you want to major in science or engineering, it would be hard to find a better place."
Sophomore,5,You can do things here no one else can.  Research and professors and classes all incredible.  Hardest school in the world.  Work is insane.
Alum,5,"Great school. Really tough to get in, even tougher to get out, but well worth it, overall. Can't get an education like it anywhere else."
College Freshman,5,Caltech is a place of wonderful innovation and the students really do care about one another.
College Sophomore,5,"Bro, it's Caltech. Coming back here to get his PhD in physics was some kid's fallback plan."
College Sophomore,5,I'm working at JPL for the summer. It's pretty ballin.
College Junior,5,"So far it has been perfect. I am sure in my future, it will only get better and better. As I gain what I need to complete my courses."
College Junior,5,"Each day is sunny and warm to me! No matter what the weather really is. I am in a great school, doing great things to change my life! What more can I want?"
College Junior,5,Institute of Technology is the best.... I value anything they are doing to help me change my live.
College Junior,5,Its the rules... NONO.... you will get the boot. We are their to learn not party.
College Junior,5,Everything that they have their is pretty up dated. They keep up with the times.
College Junior,5,"Whatever you need, someone will be there to help you. You just have to ask for help or what you need."
College Junior,5,"These Ladies are awesome. It was simple and easy. They answer any questions you have, if they don't know the answer. They find it. Most of all it was very comfortable to do."
College Junior,5,"their are many places to buy food around the school area, and it is not just fast food. They have many sit down dining places in that area."
College Junior,5,"Institute of Technology, well it is a great place to go to school. They are very strict when it comes to over all values. they give each student respect and have all the tools on hand to help you meet your goals. Everyone is wonderful and help students and other.  I enjoy going to school their. I get up early and leave my house at 6:45 each morning to get their in time, and to get to class on time. I like being a little early so I can slip into the class mode. Institute of Technology has made learning fun."
College Sophomore,5,"Caltech is in a very safe neighborhood, and I've gone on countless walks alone at 3 am without  feeling unsafe."
College Sophomore,5,"Caltech is probably the best place for geology in the country.  There are lots of field trips, brilliant professors (the tops in their fields), and it's easy even for freshman to find research opportunities."
College Sophomore,5,"At Caltech, we lose most of our games in every sport (except fencing), but the athletes keep working hard and having fun.  It's the kind of sportsmanly behavior you don't get often with more successful teams."
College Senior,5,"Where I live, It's kind of a small town so you can ride your bike easily to places and there are lots of buses to be able to get where you need to go. I live here and have my own car, and I know traffic really well so it's super easy for me to get around and be able to judge how long it where take me to get from point A to point B."
College Junior,5,The computer system at the school is one of the best that I have had the pleasure of being able to use. The systems are fast up kept and they rarely have issues.
College Junior,5,"The campus is clean, green and filled with amazing professionals to help you achieve."
College Junior,5,I have been treated with the up most respect. I am also attending another college in order to purse all of my achievements. IOT has helped me aspire my goals as they see how hard I am working to get there.
College Junior,5,They bend over backwards to help you peruse your goals.
College Freshman,5,"There is wireless access all over the campus so students can work anywhere they would like, indoors or outdoors. The wifi is quite reliable and fast although occasional short-term breaks will occur. The libraries carry enough computers all with the latest softwares in the typical format of large clusters and in the format of individual workstations. Each house has its own computer room equipped with color printers."
College Freshman,5,"There is absolutely no pressure to use drugs on campus. In fact, drug visibility is so low here that people might look slightly askew when they do see someone using drugs. The small community causes people to be more considerate to each other, and the intellectual atmosphere puts the focus more on academics than on drugs and alcohol."
College Freshman,5,"awesome. excellent education. everyone in all options have job/internship opportunities over the summer through the university. I'm only a frosh, but there are lots of mentors to explain the different options"
College Freshman,5,"This is literally the best school in the world. You receive an excellent education. While the classes are hard, it is worth it in the end"
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far at Caltech has been that yes, the rumors are true: it's really hard. However, if you are willing to put in the work, you'll be okay. I really like it's spirit of collaboration: students work together on problem sets, and then TAs and professors are there to help if you still can't get it. It's a pretty positive learning environment."
Alum,4,"Caltech is a very work hard play hard mentality. Academically, it has the most rigorous and intense coursework I've ever experienced. Alumni agree that any job after graduation pales in comparison to the Caltech workload. The professors are amazingly competent, and it's treated as no big deal to take a course taught by a Nobel-prize winner. I would say the classes are very theoretical with an emphasis on proofs, so it's not very industry-oriented (unless you study computer programming). Socially, although there's no Greek life, all students are sorted into one of eight dorm houses, which are essentially fraternities. There are parties, you just need to know where to look for them. The food is terrible, eating out or cooking your own is both cheaper and tastier. The dorms are old, but no major issues. Caltech isn't perfect, but it'll challenge  you academically and get you a good job after graduation."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman in the second term, the experience here has been pretty positive. The coursework is definitely challenging, but it keeps me motivated to pursue higher goals. I am extremely grateful for finding such a like-minded community of scholars who are supportive and caring."
Freshman,4,"Good school for science - but just that. It is a technical school. The House System is good - IF you get into the house you want. There are a few students who are placed into houses they rated very poorly; for these individuals, House Life is poor."
College Freshman,4,"You're guaranteed off-campus housing if you want it. Also, ""off-campus"" means ""across the street from your classes"" still, so you're fine there."
College Freshman,4,"They're very flexible about drinking -- ""just put it in a cup so we don't know"" is a common theme."
College Freshman,4,The only school policy that is really prevalent is the honor code.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of options in Chandler (and the South kitchen), but dinner is subpar"
College Freshman,4,The housing system is definitely unique
College Freshman,4,"Food in Pasadena is expensive, but good."
College Freshman,4,Caltech's honor code is great!
College Sophomore,4,"Most people get awarded SURF money, if they apply."
College Junior,4,I live only a few miles away from campus and it is an ok area. 
College Junior,4,"I am a single mom with two kids, I do not have a Nightlife. "
College Junior,4,I love that we have more interaction time with the teachers. 
College Junior,4,I never feel unsafe walking alone on campus. I do however don't like when some of the other students smoke weed in the smoking area. 
College Junior,4,I drive my own car so it doesn't matter if they provide transportation. 
College Junior,4,The school does not offer a lot of extras but I am there for an education so it does not matter to me. 
College Junior,4,There is more one on one interaction with all of the teachers. 
College Junior,4,"I have been here for over 10 years and I love it but don't know if I will stay. I have two young children and do not want to raise them around all the crime. 
"
College Sophomore,2,"Housing Can Be Unreasonable – As far as I know, academic violations are dealt with reasonably, but housing can be a bit ridiculous at times (this may apply more to Avery House, since it's a much newer residence hall). We were threatened with fines for drawing with chalk and window markers, both of which are easily removable. Also, Caltech has had issues with incidents of ""hazing,"" which in my opinion some members of the administration did not mediate very well; the punishments were widely viewed among the students and unreasonably severe."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If You Want to Be in a Sport, No One Will Stop You – If you're willing to show up and participate, a team won't turn you away. The quality is not very high, but it's a friendly environment. The gym is nice, we have a good training staff, and the coaches are quite good. Fan support is lacking. There is no women's soccer team, though women can play on the male-dominated co-ed team."
College Freshman,1,Not a big part of Caltech :/
College Freshman,1,"Not Much Support – Students are generally too busy and uninterested to come to sporting events, and a perpetually losing team doesn't help. About 5 or 10 people show up for most home sporting events."

Junior,5,I really enjoyed taking online classes at Wayland.  I liked the flexibility of doing class work from home coupled with the message boards in class that made me feel inclusive with my class mates.
Junior,5,"Wayland Baptist is an excellent college if you are interested in a Christ centered education.  I really enjoyed the classes for my basics, and the staff is very helpful and friendly."
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman in the fall, and everyone that has experienced registering for college, you know it is quite frustrating. But every department at Wayland Baptist has already made me feel like I have been going there for some time now. There is a real home environment when they are helping you will scholarships, grants, housing, etc. They have made the process very simple, despite not being at the office due to COVID-19. I really appreciate all they have done and I cannot wait to go there in the Fall."
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any classes yet but my baseball coach, Brad Bass, has told me I will be taking online classes during the Spring baseball season and I have talked to most of my professors and they said it is very simple and they will give me some grace because they how tough online classes can be and especially knowing I will be a full time athlete come Spring time. So I am looking forward to doing and completing those classes."
Senior,5,Some of the online content wasn't available when assignment was due. I had to email the instructor to add to the blackboard.
Senior,5,"If you are looking for a Christian University that helps empower you then Wayland Baptist University is the school for you. I studied Business Administration with a specialization in Cyber Security and I tell you, the Professors that I had for my MISM classes were excellent. They were straightforward and always assisted when help was needed. There is no room for giving up. When a student is about to kick the bucket and give up, the Professors and Staff are there to motivate you. We are Wayland."
Senior,5,I struggled when I first took online classes. This struggle didn't hold me back because I taught myself to explore my backboard. The blackboard that Wayland uses is simple and unique for different Professors. What I mean by this is that every Professor builds their setup differently. Online is simple. My Professors assisted by posting videos in which I found very helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the flexibility of Wayland's external campuses. I am nearly done with my degree, minus a couple of semesters but resources are limited. I've had some really great professors during my time and I'm glad that Wayland gave me a chance to earn a degree."
Niche User,5,i liked how personal they are with each student. they really want to make sure that you get everything you need for college. they go the extra mile!
Junior,5,I love the atmosphere of Wayland Baptist where everyone helps each other out and there is a true sense of care at Wayland baptist university
Niche User,5,What I love most about the campus is that the students are very kind! They definitely follow a Christ-like path and help you out at all times.
Freshman,5,I love the professors at Wayland. It is obvious that they care about the success of their students! The campus is also very nice. They’re remodeling several buildings to improve the campus.
Freshman,5,The way that the staff take care of and help the students adjust to university life has been an amazing experience. I have never felt so valued and loved. Something that could change would be minor communication issued between Professors and students.
Junior,5,"Great university! It is a private education, with public cost. The classes are not too big, which makes it easier for students to gain relationships with teachers and to learn in a more personal way. The campus is beautiful and there is always fun activities going on so everyone can be involved!"
Junior,5,"Wayland Baptist University, has given me an amazing education so far in my education here. I am a student at the New Braunfels campus - School of Nursing. The overall experience so far with this college, has just been amazing. Wayland has given me an opportunity to become a Nursing student. Their professors have been very helpful I teaching and the level of professionalism is just as great."

Freshman,5,"I was just there for Big Weekend and I fell in love with the pace. It's beautiful and the people are very friendly. 
   They speak of family and are very genuine about it. They understand that i come from a place where I had to build a family out of friends  and they are the same exact way. A family is what they call themselves because a family is what they are."
Niche User,5,I will be attending the university in the fall of 2019. Wayland is a very good school with a very well known reputation. The dorms and the campus are very nice.

Junior,5,Wayland Baptist University is a truly unique school. My experience so far has been nothing but positive. I have really appreciated the faith based learning but yet the availability and acceptance to all as well. The Professors are always there for you and are extremely qualified.
Alum,5,"I had a fantastic experience at Wayland Baptist University (WBU). I spent the first 3 years at their physical satellite campus in Sierra Vista, Arizona, and the teaching was great. Their teacher-to-student ratio averaged about 1 to every 15-20 students, which enabled a small class learning environment. The staff was very hands-on throughout the process. WBU has a rich culture and pleasant looking residential campus in Plainview, Texas, though I would not recommend anyone go to school here if they want to party and drink...this school should be taken seriously for what it offers academically. This is not a party school. It is a friendly, warm Christian environment where educators care about their students and faculty go the extra mile to ensure students are taken care of.

WBU is very committed to working with non-traditional students and is extraordinarily supportive of its military student members. I received both my Bachelors and Masters degrees from here."
Sophomore,5,This campus is great because everything is in walking distance. The classes are small  enough for one on one help. The teachers want to actually to get to know you and help you meet your learning needs. Then people are here are very welcoming and walk around with big smiles.
Freshman,5,"I attend the Lubbock campus.  All staff that I have encountered have been so nice and helpful.  As a non traditional student, their program allows me to work and to finish my degree without schedule complications."
Junior,5,Great school and I love it so much. Professors are great and so are the student. They all have helped me out so much.
Junior,5,"I love that the classes were small and the professors took the time to get to know you. Online classes utilized Blackboard and were organized and easy to follow.

Wayland Baptist focuses on adults with careers and offers night classes to help accommodate working students."
Senior,5,Being an online student can get crazy at times. Each professor I have had for the last year and a half has been very helpful and understanding .
Graduate Student,5,"I've attended Wayland University via online courses being that I am military and move around often.  Thus far, I've had a wonderful experience with this University in the journey of higher education."
Senior,5,"Very pleased with the professors and the ability to attend classes online. I attended classes at the Fairbanks, AK campus. Currently, I am finishing my degree online with WBU."
Junior,5,This school has a great atmosphere and is very welcoming. They have a brand new nursing program that is separate from the main campus. This makes learning more enjoyable and understandable when it comes to technology. Most of the professors are well rounded on their subjects and are willing to help their students no matter what.
Junior,5,Positive and supportive experience through the application and registration process. Received good information in regards to financial options. Course workload is what I would expect.
Freshman,5,All the professors I've had are extremely helpful. My academic advisor is friendly and proficient in helping me choose my classes. Registration and financial aid are easy processes! I can't wait to graduate and get a job with a company I'd love.

Senior,5,"Wayland, and it's staff has been of great assistance in helping me to achieve my degree.  When I first enrolled, I was unsure of what path to take.  Wayland has assisted me in choosing a path I wanted and helping me to get there.  It is a wonderful and outstanding association."
Junior,5,"My experience at WBU has been amazing. It's is very beneficial for a student that has a busy schedule and needs flexible class hours. It's is a faith based university, although you do not need to be of a certain religion to be apart of the community setting. The staff welcome you with open arms and are always there to help you with your classes  and any home issues that may arise."
Graduate Student,5,"Wayland is a university that has smaller branches in rural areas, which is why I chose to attend.  They offer in class and online courses to suit working students.  They are always polite when you call with questions and try to assist students with their needs.  The only thing I would change is the price of tuition.  It is a little higher than some colleges; however, the courses are 11 weeks."
Freshman,5,"Haven't started here yet but am looking forward to my Freshman year here. 
I have loved meeting the coaches and some of the players."
Freshman,5,The staff and professors are all very kind and helpful.  The course catalog has many options that the advisors can help you to plan out your degree.  There are several campuses that you can attend and also online classes.  I am very pleased to be a Pioneer.
Niche User,5,I liked how small the campus was. I also liked that the teachers were willing to help me with any problems I may have.
Junior,5,"Wayland Baptist University Hawaii is a great and convenient place for me to go to school. The classes are very intimate and the teachers are very thorough in their teaching. Most of the students are older and have a military background. Although I am one of the youngest students there, there are some that are even younger. This is because my school offers a jump start program where kids in high school can start their college classes. I think it is better to have an older crowed of students because they are serious about their education and are mature. I really have enjoyed this school."
Senior,5,Wayland has helped me succeed in furthering my education even in times I wasnt sure if I could. During my time so far at Wayland there have been some amazing professors that truly care about there students.
College Sophomore,5,"It's a great school to go to. Everyone is very nice and is like family. The classes are taught well by the teachers and I learn a lot. The teachers are always passionate about teaching their subjects. The staff is great, everyone is like family. The student's are usually all older, but it is good because their is a certain level of maturity in the classroom."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe on campus. There is always staff that take the time to get to know us and make sure we are okay. There is a never a time that I would feel like I would get sexually assaulted on campus. There is always staff around to get their attention if needed. If i ever had a problem by being harassed by any one, i know i would be able to talk with someone on staff."
College Sophomore,5,Everything was great. I couldn't ask for a better situation.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone gets along and if not you then will find a way.
College Sophomore,5,Wayland is made up of Athletes. 90 percent of the campus are students attending on some type of scholarship.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors look out for their students and that's one thing I really admire about them. Anytime I have w problem with anything, my teachers are always lending a helping hand. There are a variety of courses offered in my field but I am not quite aware of the others. The class styles are learning enabled and the size is not bad at all. I am always seated in the front rows so it doesn't bother me."
College Freshman,5,There is an active police presence on campus and I feel very safe.  There have been no issues I am aware of since I started attending Wayland.
College Freshman,5,I live in a fairly new dorm. We have our own bath room with a shower so we do not need to share with others.  My room is spacious and has plenty of room for two people.
College Freshman,5,I love Wayland there is a real sense of community/family at this school. I feel safe and right at home.  I intend on staying here until I receive my degree and I recommending that my sister attend here too!
College Junior,5,"For me personally, it was my first choice and has been from I consider the best in flexibility. I work full-time, am married and have 4 children with one of whom is on college himself. The flexibility with the courses and material has allowed me the opportunity to fit obtaining an accredited degree within my means."
College Senior,5,Awesome school for Vets and willing to work around the student.
College Junior,5,Wayland is one of the top private schools to attend.
Recent Alumnus,5,"We have all types of students on campus. We have international students, military and civilian students. Some of the students receive a GI bill, while others have to take out student loans in order to pay for school. We have students from Norway, Canada, Mexico, and India. We have both democratic and republican students who have many debates during class regarding their affiliation. We are a Baptist school but we have all types of religions (Hindu, Jewish, Protestant, Christian). We have many students who are married or have partners."
College Sophomore,5,"Campus is actually very diverse, and even though it is a private Christian college they do not discriminate because of religion."
College Sophomore,5,It is not super strict or super lenient.  I would say it is average.
Senior,4,I had a great experience with Wayland Baptist University. The school counselors were great in being available to advise me in just about anything that I needed help with.
Senior,4,"Most of my classes that I took for my Bachelor's Degree in Applied Science were mostly conducted on campus. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, recently I've been completing my courses online. It has been a seamlessly, effortless experience. I am graduating this year in December 2020!"
Senior,4,I like the convenience of small classes. I Like how they transition from face to face classes to online classes. The instructors were there when I need them.
Junior,4,"This college has been very good to me as a student, with all the teachers, advisers and financial aid office help that has been given to me over the couple of years that I have been attending this college, it has been the best one that I have been to."
Alum,4,I loved the support and the flexibility concerning my degree. The staff and students were very supportive. I just wish that there was more resources for students and alumni that do not attend the main campus
Graduate Student,4,"The staff has always been very helpfull and repectfull, even when i ask a dumb question.  Most of my classes are on line and the system works really well. I highly recommend this achool."
Sophomore,4,"All the staff and students are very helpful and kind, its easy to find out where you need to go and what paper work you need filled out. The campus itself is being and a great view. Classes are good, teachers are good at their jobs. The only thing that is not the best is the food at the cafeteria, however downstairs at pete's place the food is pretty good. The school is close to stores and other food places so its easy to get around and get what you need."
Sophomore,4,It's a good school.  It has been a good experience with online classes. The professors have been very informative and helpful.  I would recommend this school to other working adults.
Senior,4,The professors are very nice. As other universities you will have that occasional teacher that doesn't care. I have only had one of those.

Senior,4,Wayland Baptist University is a great place to attend. It is conviently located throughout the city they have great online and classroom courses that make learning fun. Wayland has so much to offer . They have a great nursing program where the on hands learning is so crucial to what you need to excel in your studies.
Freshman,4,"One thing that I really enjoy about Wayland is how close the school is. It is a small private university, which means a lot of us know each other and we have a 1 on 1 with professors or anyone who will help us in any way. I've gotten closer to God thanks to my school. We have chapel every Wednesday and that helps many of us stay consistent with our religion."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed the time I spent there so much everyone was so nice and helpful I loved the baseball coaching staff and the campus and the location of it !
Sophomore,4,It's a small campus yet easily to get around. The teachers help you by gathering up a study group to make sure you wont fail in their classrooms. On the other hand you begin to meet foreign students and learn from different backgrounds in their communities.
Niche User,4,I had a great experience while at Wayland. I took concurrent classes during my Junior and Senior years at Plainview High School. Wayland was small enough to get around easily but was big enough to have the classes I needed. The professors I had were extremely knowledgeable and personable.
Sophomore,4,Wayland is a great university with very flexible course availability and works with you to attain your education goals.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is super amazing. It brings a warm home feeling that I really like and everyone in the dorms are super social and nice
College Freshman,4,Our Athletics in our school is very popular . Mostly everyone in this school are in sports and everyone else would always support the team and give them tons of spirit/couragement. Also our faculty for athletics are very kind and help our team out alot
College Freshman,4,My overall experience with this school has been pretty good. Everyone here is so nice and caring. My favorite experiences at the school has to be the dances they host for us they are always so much fun. What makes it unique is our safe environment.
College Sophomore,4,"Wayland Baptist University Hawaii is a great and convenient place for me to go to school. The classes are very intimate and the teachers are very thorough in their teaching.

I think it is better to have an older crowed of students because they are serious about their education and are mature. I really have enjoyed this school."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone helps one another no matter what. we all stick together as if we are a family.
College Sophomore,4,Security is very good. We didn't have any known accidents my freshman year of college.
College Sophomore,4,Just like many places in life there are those up's and those down's. but at Wayland Baptist the good definitely out ways the bad. This place became home away from home. When I first stepped on campus I thought to myself things weren't going to be right. The people were amazing. The environment was amazing. The teachers were amazing.
Recent Alumnus,4,There is a huge amount of school spirit when it comes down to sports except track and field. However sports at the school perform really well and each team always shows togetherness whether it's in the cafe or wherever on the school's campus. The facilities however are good for practicing but it can be better for performance purposes.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The faculty and staff is very considerate about everyone's situation when it comes to financial needs. The only reason I wouldn't choose it again is because it's in a lonesome area with not much to do. However, I would choose it again because it's the best school I ever attended in both sports and academics."
College Sophomore,4,"Going into my first year at Wayland Baptist , I didn't know what to expect. The first day I got there people were o nice and caring they wanted to make sure everyone was comfortable. As days went on you could see that the campus life was more of a family than anything else. And that's something that's hard to find places especially being in a new area."
College Senior,4,Worked with me to get my classes I needed and my credits transferred :)
College Senior,4,"From the comfort of my own home, virtual classes are super safe!"
College Senior,4,I'm taking courses from the comfort of my own sweet home :)

College Junior,4,"If you're looking for a place to belong, get involved, and where atmosphere is important, then attending one of the top Christian colleges and universities in the country may be right for you. Choosing Wayland Baptist University means you'll be part of a family at one of the leading Christian, Baptist colleges in the United States."
College Junior,4,"The Wayland Baptist football program recently signed twelve new recruits, taking the Pioneers' total thus far this year to forty-eight. The signings include defensive lineman Marc Wallace of Plainview, son of former WBU all-american decathlete Rodney Wallace, a member of the Wayland Baptist Athletics Hall of Honor."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy the small classroom size, in some of my classes I have less then 20 students in them.  It really gives you an advantage with working one on one with your professors."
College Freshman,4,The school could use a pool.  I a on the swim team and we practice at the YMCA pool.
College Sophomore,4,"Wayland Baptist is the only university that I found that offers more online learning, more semesters per year, and course work that really serves as an aid for non traditional students.  It is the only university in this area helping adults become more marketable in their jobs and career fields."
College Sophomore,4,I was admitted quickly and easily.  The office staff at my location was extremely helpful with the registration and admission process.
College Freshman,4,I love to live on campus because you don't miss out on what's going on during school. It's easy to get to classes and very convenient. To get into housing it was an easy process and they helped me along through it. It helped me make new friends and become more social with the girls around campus. I like being on my own but sometimes I miss being under my parents roof.
College Freshman,4,The student involvement in sports are great. We have a lot of support from the students and community. Our school spirit is great and everyone gets dressed up for games. The facilities for each sport are evenly distributed on equipment and support from the school and students.
College Freshman,4,"Being around different people and experiencing different things makes school great for me. Also, being apart of the girls wrestling team has made it an easier transition from being dependent on my parents to being independent and on my own. My school has made me a better person and more into church and closer to God. I wouldn't trade this school for another because it gives me a chance to continue my wrestling career, pursue my education and become stronger in my faith."
College Senior,4,love the school is tiny b ut you can get lot of one on one with the teachers
College Junior,4,"Dorms are very nice, but the amount of rules is excessive"

College Junior,4,great location for a variety of choices to eat
College Junior,4,i always see campus police nice friendly bunch
Recent Alumnus,4,"San Antonio is filled with dining, parks, sports, and shopping. The school is right next to a big shopping center that has all of these amenities."
College Junior,2,Most students just live on campus since the size of the tiny is very small
College Junior,2,A lot of the food is just the same. Either fast food or mexican places
College Junior,2,The food selection is very small and a lot of the food seems to just be reheated instead of being fresh
College Junior,2,Really takes a long time to process.
College Sophomore,2,They do not have options 
College Junior,2,Not much is offered at my campus on Waylands main campus and I do not attend their so I am not sure.
College Junior,2,The school does not offer sports at my campus and the bigger campus is not as popular with sports as other colleges.
College Junior,2,Not a lot of scholarships for students at AK campus
College Freshman,2,WBU Drugs – The drug scene here is active but quite well hidden because there are checkups as it is a baptist university.We also have dogs come and sniff around the dorms when there is suspicion.
College Sophomore,2,"Plainview Texas – Although there are more fast food restaurants to eat at , there isnt really a big varity to choose from."
College Senior,2,Wayland baptist sits in the middle of Plainview Tx . Its a great place to attend if you are really wanting to get a degree. There is really nothing to do in this little town . The people are nice and easily to get along wit . The teachers and students are easy to get along too . Wayland baptist has the best athletes but some sports don't really have the facility needed to be the best . They need more trainers they poor little trainer they have get tossed everywhere he has a family of his own and never really has time because of the lack of trainers . They need more trainers and a bigger training room .Other than that the people who work for Wayland are great especially the scholarship coordinator she is the best .
College Senior,2,"Not My First Pick but It Will Do – Wayland is an ok school. i was just lucky enough they offer my major. I would not advice anyone to come here if they want the full college experince. if you want to be sheltered and told what to do, then this is the place for you. as far as the education goes it is overall good."
College Senior,2,"Dorm Rooms – there are many rules that are way over used, the rule of opposit genders in the same room. the door must be open, the over head light must be on and both people have to have both feet on the floor. You cannot even watch a movie with the lights on and the door open due to the other people coming in and out of your room, and the noise in the hall. Wayland needs to get with the times. there are many other things to worry about rather than the lights being on or off. such as where to put all the students. wayland just recently turned a girls dorm into a boys due to the over booking. now there are several girls that must live off campus in a 2 bedroom house with 4 girls. it just doesnt make sence."
Niche User,1,It’s was an awful experience the school knows about this but never took the time to resolve the issue I had while those people are enjoying their life my life was a miserable experience as I lived in those dorms the students there gave me a problematic experience where I had frustration that the dean of students didn’t took proper action what kind of a Christian school it is this is not right really I do warn you future students not to come here because of the poor way they run this school if you do best of luck
Niche User,1,This university has become one of the most disappointed school that i was going to applied.i heard that this is school is very discriminating and very races to not only to the student but also the faculty that are on this campus and  i mean the people are very bigot and also i heard that one of the employees here actually lives in the dorm exactly what kind of a school is this what kind of school are you running. I was doing research and  heard that a student was suffering because of the students in the dorms were discriminating just by the size of The head that the student was saying and the ones who did this were the soccer players including an employee in the team and how they were using this excuse of culture and diversity to play it out and how the office people actually believe more of the soccer players then the student who was discriminated. No surprise that the employees who work their or even the dean of students as the student didn’t care to actually put an stop.
College Sophomore,1,No such thing as greek life on campus. There is no dorming and people only enjoy the greek life out side of school
College Sophomore,1,"There are no athletics at my school. Because it is a sub campus and because the students are older, there are no sports."
College Junior,1,Its a dry campus and alcohol is not permitted on campus or dorms
College Student,1,Drugs are not allowed and everyone does their own thing
College Sophomore,1,This town of Plainview does not appeal to college students cuasing students to transfer and have nothing to do. The town recently closed  the meat that caused the community to  loose over 2000 jobs. I'm  transferring to a conservatory in  New Jersey next fall.
College Junior,1,There are two frats and one sorority. They don't ever do anything. They don't have a place to stay. They are basically just like other students
College Freshman,1,"Wayland has extremely strict rules about drugs and alcohol, so the availability is very very low. However, it's not unheard of for a few big parties a year to have some alcohol- it IS a college after all! The negative effects of being caught with alcohol or, even worse, the drug dogs catching you on one of their random searches in the dorms far outweigh the desire to get them. Peer pressure isn't a huge issue as most students are here to learn and not to party, but the bottom line is that the friends that you make can determine your choices so, while Wayland doesn't have a lot of this type of activity going on, such things still do happen rules or not."
College Sophomore,1,"Wayland is a baptist school so they do not promote parties and such. However, they did try throwing ""clean"" dances which did not do very well. The bars here are for 21 and up. Lubbock is near by with plenty of clubs for 18 and up."
College Freshman,1,Drugs at WBU – Drugs at WBU are quite rare because it is a baptist university after all and so the rules and consequences are rather strict. The staff take quite great measures (in my opinion) to ensure that there is zero drug tolerance.
College Freshman,1,Its mostly hispanic and african american dominated student population over here. The international students are mostly from South America and hardly any from Asia or Europe.
College Freshman,1,Small Town Plainview – You can watch our sports teams but thats about it.
College Sophomore,1,Finding a parking spot on campus can be very stressful. For many finding a parking spot that is in the right letter zone is painful and most of the time very hard to access. As a freshman or a student living off campus parking is a very stressful process.

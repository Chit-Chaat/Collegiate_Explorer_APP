Alum,5,My educational experiences at McKendree prepared me for a real world career in a field I love. Being able to work with professions and students who care about the world around them and how we all fit together made the experience even better.
Alum,5,McKendree is a wonderful campus with a diverse student body and activities to meet everyone’s different styles.
Freshman,5,I took online classes because of the COVID19 situation and I do feel like the teachers accommodated me well during this time. They made sure that we were not overloaded with work while still helping us learn and gain valuable educational experience.
Freshman,5,Sports programs that allows for higher educational opportunities that are tightly entangled with the supportive staff within a smaller college atmosphere.
Sophomore,5,"I feel like since online classes have began, students are more likely to get the work done. I personally believe that online learning has been very beneficial."
Freshman,5,"I experienced online format because of the coronavirus. Although there are some internet problem, I have a good experience when learning online. The instructors are dedicated and hard-working to give me the best foundation despite the fact that they have to switch to online learning."
Freshman,5,"I like McKendree University because it is a smaller school with the better half of 2,000 students enrolled."
Sophomore,5,Small class sizes allows much more direct work with professors.  Professors seem to really care about their students.
Freshman,5,"The community is not only diverse but everyone is as close as family on campus, and I can not think of anything that could change for the better"
Freshman,5,"The faculty cares about their student both in and outside of the classroom. The extracurricular activities are excellent. The campus scenery is very beautiful. The community on campus feels like a family. Overall, I would like to see the university offer more in terms of financial support and opportunities for financial assistance."
Junior,5,"Great professors and environment, but the school definitely prioritizes sports over all other things. It is disenfranchising for students who are not athletes."
Alum,5,"I liked the close knit feeling at McKendree.  I was always known by my first name by all professors that had me, the campus was small enough to find what you needed, and someone was always willing to help out."
Freshman,5,I have had a wonderful first year at McKendree and would recommend this school to anyone! The professors give plenty of individual attention and offer help whenever is best for you!
Alum,5,"The professors at McKendree University are dedicated to teaching the students life skills on top of their respected subjects of study. They are genuinely concerned when a student is not in class and will reach out to the student to determine how to catch her/him back up. McKendree is interested in allowing students to make their marks on the university, in the community, and on each other."
Senior,5,"I love McKendree because of the professors, campus experiences, and the location.  I could not imagine getting my degree anywhere else."
Sophomore,5,"The best part about McKendree University is that while you are gaining an amazing education, you are also gaining an amazing network of friends and colleges that will be there for you when ever you need them. Every staff and faculty member, whether you are in their major or not, wants to see you improve and succeed in whatever you are doing. Everyone supports each other on this campus. Whether it is the concert band going to a basketball game or the volleyball team going to the show choir finale show, the support from everyone is amazing. It is a very small campus but in a way it is a blessing. You really get to know everyone and it is very hard to not find a someone to be friends with. With that being said, since it is such a small campus in the middle of a very small town, there is not a lot of parking and there really isn't any attractions near by the campus. That being said, the atmosphere of the surrounding community gives the campus a very calm and safe feel."
Junior,5,"McKendree is a very small school. They are a tight knit community, all the students know each other, and after a year all the students know all the teachers. All the teachers seem to really care about their students and work hard to be available if a student needs help. The staff and students make you feel like you’re part of a family that does care about you, your wellbeing, and your academics. McKendree is a highly competitive school, they take pride in their sports teams as well as their clubs. McKendree is also very diverse, students come from all parts of the world to study there."
Freshman,5,Everything about the college is perfect. The staff are welcoming and warming. The students are also a shoulder to lean on in times of need.
College Sophomore,5,"Mckendree offers and wide variety of interships, in all iys majrs even though we reside in a small community. While career services a the school are always on the look out to help students in any way they can from picking a career to working on your resume. Making getting a degree from McKendree like getting a degree from an ivey league school like harverd."
College Sophomore,5,"Even thoigh McKendree is a small university, they offer a large variety of courses to take on a regular basis. With kind hearted and passionate proffesors that not only challenege thier studnets but will always mae time to help them wben needed."
College Junior,5,I love it and hopefully wont have to leave it. It's my home now and I have an amazing family there.
College Junior,5,We have a very high job placement a lot of my friends already have jobs lined up or they have started working already.
College Junior,5,Mckendree has a very safe campus. Walking alone at night is no issue at all and most people leave their doors open so others can say hi.
College Junior,5,"Living on campus is what made me come out of my shell. The resident assistant really made the community whole, and the food was always ready when I was hungry. I loved it."
College Junior,5,"They are great, the get out and show spirit. They also spread important messages around campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Very good experience! Professors are happy to be helpful, there are a lot of different courses offered, and administration is always helpful when thinking about registering for classes."
College Sophomore,5,"Small school, hardly any crime or issues with assault."
College Sophomore,5,"I like the housing. The rooms in the traditional dorms are bigger at this school than at many others, even though they are still relatively small. It is easy to feel like the floor you live on is a family, and everyone in the traditional halls seems to grow close enough to consider themselves a family."
College Sophomore,5,"What makes my school unique is that it is small. This allows classes to be tiny and the professors to know their students by name. Professors are always happy to lend a helping hand in learning the material, or even helping the students out with personal issues if needed. The school is like a family, and a home away from home."
College Freshman,5,Sexual assault isn't a problem at our university.
College Freshman,5,Very roomy and looks very clean.
College Freshman,5,The athletic director and athletes are the best.
College Freshman,5,The professors and students are all helpful.
College Junior,5,The best experience i have had at school was becoming the president of my university Black Student Organization. With this position I am able to help people on a bigger scale and get other people to want to help other and bring people together.
College Freshman,5,I have never once felt unsafe on campus its like im in my own home.
College Sophomore,5,I don't think I have ever felt unsafe on campus. Public Safety is always patrolling and there are procedures in place for any issues that may arise.
College Sophomore,5,Public safety walking/drives around campus every fifteen minutes.
College Sophomore,5,The school have job/internship programs often for the students.
College Freshman,5,Living here on campus is really good for me because I live a few hours away from home but I am close to the city and close to other relatives of mine. I currently live in the new dorms that were recently built and they are great. I have my own room and bathroom which is very convenient for me and I have quite a few friends that come over because my room is bigger. Even though it costs more I was happy to live here because it was what I wanted. My social life is good because I talk to people in my class and most of them live in the same building as me and that gives me a chance to have study groups with them and even go places with them outside of school.
College Junior,5,"The career center have very nice and helpful people. When I applied for an internship, she made it easy to understand what I needed to do and it was easy to get enrolled."
College Sophomore,5,The academics at this school are phenomenal. This school is one that will make it possible to get a job right out of college.
College Sophomore,5,There is a wide variety of classes to choose. The professors are very nice and respectful of you. If you are having trouble they will have one on ones with you and help you individually if you need it.
College Sophomore,5,Everybody makes you feel like you matter. Feels like a home away from home. There are so many things on campus to get involved with. Your teachers know your name and encourage you to text or call them if you need help. Attending this school was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
College Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere here at McKendree. This college is fairly small and you get know everyone very well. This establish better friendships and real friends. Also the education here is great. It is challenging but the reward will by far succumb the countless nights of studying and doing homework.
College Freshman,5,There are opportunities to learn & gain work exp.
College Freshman,5,"CS works you hard, but you learn a lot."
College Freshman,5,"I lived off-campus at the Hawkins Point Townhomes at 9680 Hayden Drive. Right on route 4 and I-64. I was a few minutes from downtown and close to the nightlife in downtown St. Louis. Not a good place for house parties because of the on-site supervisor calling the cops easily. But, if you want a safe and brand new rental to study in peacefully so you can go out and party at night I would recommend it. I also lived in Lebanon for a short-while in a townhome on the hill. They had good parties there but the darn place kept falling apart. "
College Sophomore,5,a typical internship is like getting on the job training
College Freshman,5,Everybody basically meets each other before school even starts like on Facebook so they interact well with one another.
College Sophomore,5,"I have just started attending McKendree University.  So far, I can tell that campus security is very tight and strict - as it should be.  As far as school policies, I cannot determine.  Only one of my teachers takes roll."
College Junior,5,Parking at McKendree in Radcliff is great. It is a small outreach school so parking is right next to the building and the classrooms.
College Junior,5,"The workload can be tough, but you definitely learn the best skills available to advance in nursing.  My clinical experiences have been fantastic."
College Senior,5,"McKendree has the best of both worlds.  Located in Lebanon, IL, we have all the good ol' fashioned fun of a rural community, from festivals to football games to classic car shows.  The main street through Lebanon is full of antique shops and quirky craft stores.  Other nearby towns are similarly set up.  At the same time, Lebanon is just under 45 minutes away from St. Louis.  Not only is the night life jumping, the cultural and arts attractions are plentiful and either cheap or free.  Forest Park (which is bigger than Central Park in New York, btw), is chock full of free attractions, from the art and history museums, to one of the top rated free zoos in the country.  There is always something to do here."
College Senior,5,"Small Town Next to a Big City – Lebanon is a little town, so there isn't much to do. Drive a bit and there is plenty! Fairview Heights has tons of shopping and its 15 minutes away. St. Louis is only another 5 from there."
Recent Alumnus,5,Free parking and close to the class buildings.  I could park less than 20 feet to most class buildings within 15 minutes of class starting.
College Sophomore,5,Popular Majors – mckendree has a variety of majors. i think the health and psychology majors are the popular majors. i think it's cause of the advisors. the advisors are very involved on campus and available to students for help.
College Freshman,5,"Athletics is a huge part of the core of Mckendree so the athletes get the very best fields, courts, tracks, etc. Everything is maintained perfectly. The library is easily accessible to everyone and there are many resources available. Campus activities board never fails to have something going on whether it is bingo, dances, or giving away free things at sporting events. The campus itself is very small, but it is part of what gives it such a huge, homey appeal to people."
College Freshman,5,"International Relations- Countless Opportunities – Mckendree University is a liberal arts college so our gen-eds require more varity, but this helps people expand their knowledge and explore different interests. As an international relations major, my advisor knows about various career paths and different options. The school and the professors are very flexible with my outside activites and the professors get to know you on a very personal level which really helps in the coursework. In my program, there are so many study abroad options and many different language opportunities which helps later on in life. The curriculum is always very demanding, but like I said, the professors really know how to help students out. The facilities are fantastic, it is a private college so everything is top notch for students in every department. The university is very close to St. Louis, so there are countless internship and job opportunities close by and the teachers and faculty do an excellent job of getting you put into the right field for you."
College Student,5,"Family, Supportive, Hard-Working – The fans base at McKendree is overwhelming. The team players are committed to do their best."
Recent Alumnus,5,Bearcat Pride – The athletics programs at Mckendree U are one of the most important parts of the campus life. The football and soccer programs are the the highlights of the fall semester
Freshman,4,I enjoyed the small community and how people generally keep to themselves. There needs to be more organization and less dysfunction in the dorm systems. There is music up to 1 a.m. which disrupts me from studying.
Freshman,4,"Like that online options are available, especially being involved in sports. Looking forward to fall of 2020!"
Sophomore,4,Mckendree is a smaller school. It has opened up many opportunities for me to get a head start on my career. People that go to Mckendree usually plan on graduating from there. I love Mckendree and I believe it will lead me to great things.
Freshman,4,The Professors that I have encountered have been very friendly and helpful. They truly want to see their students succeed. The housing is good. The food is good and there is mostly a good variety.
Freshman,4,"McKendree University is a great place if you're looking for a small college with professors who genuinely care about their students, the only down side is the food options."
Senior,4,I attended McKendree University for my undergraduate degree. It has a compact campus which makes getting around very easy. The classes are small so there is lots of individualized attention. I do wish I had obtained more skills for the workplace before I completed my degree.
Junior,4,"I currently attend McKendree and the school is perfect for me. I've had very few professors that I've disliked after two years of attending. It's a small university which is completely fine with me because I get more help from professors, can easily navigate the school, and don't have to walk miles to class. I am also receiving an incredible education. The flaws of McKendree, however, are the lack of things to do, the lack of school spirit, and the use of money. I believe that my money towards McKendree should go to rennovating buildings, improving parking, and adding new housing options. I also believe that the school spirit could be improved because few people attend sporting events. Lastly, events are rarely planned at McKendree and it is located in a small town so it can be difficult to find things to do. But overall, I believe that the unversity has suited me well and I am glad I chose it."
Niche User,4,It has a girls wrestling team which I think is very cool because not many universities have wrestling or they don't have a women's wrestling and that is very unique.
Sophomore,4,Overall McKendree has given me friendships that will last a lifetime! I love the small campus atmosphere which makes everything so much easier to take in.
Senior,4,I chose McKendree because they were willing to work with me in finding a degree program that would easily transfer into the graduate program I am looking at applying to after gradation. It is a very military friendly school and as a veteran that was very important to me. I enjoy the smaller class sizes and most of the professors are dedicated to their students and classes and do everything in their power to help the students succeed.
Junior,4,I really love the overall atmosphere of McKendree. It is a wonderful institution and I'm glad I chose to attend such a unique University.
Senior,4,"It has a nice, open feel - that classic, honest, Midwestern personability. Classes are relatively small, perhaps 25 maximum for a general education course or something else that's popular, but it's not unusual to have only 6 or seven in more major-specific elective-type courses. This allows you to be very friendly with fellow classmates and faculty, and really be able to understand what needs to be done and exactly how to do it, or at least have the option of quickly approaching your professors. It's located in a charming little town, but also close enough to both Scott Air Force Base and St. Louis to fulfill most needs. My only qualm is the old science building, because it needs some better desks (and it's only that particular building). Also may-or-may not be haunted.

Good for people who want a relatively quiet place where you can still interact with plenty of people but can actually get your work done and learn something worthwhile."
Senior,4,"McKendree is a very clean, friendly campus; however, the buildings could use a little work. It is expensive, but I enjoy it here and I have made some great lifelong friends."
College Sophomore,4,"I personally enjoyed the housing at McKendree, while most of the housing is definatly not perfect. The living arrangments still come though and meet my housing needs including spaciosness, cleanliness, independence, driendliness, and utilities. Over all I cannot complain."
College Sophomore,4,"While McKendree University is a small university in an even smaller town, deciding to go to McKendree was one of the best decisions I ever made. Unlike other universitys I visited my senior year which were large, overwhelming, and stressful. I find that McKendree was totally diffrent, its mid sized campus allows me to have the full college expieience with out feeling over or under whelmed. The passion the proffesors have combined with the small class sizes makes me feel extremly more comfotable in class because it makes it easier to have ask questions and have free discussions on the topics in class amonst the proffesor and fellow classmates. Also I never feel neevous about asking my proffesors questions about the topics and assignmenys before and after class, I know they will always make time for thier students. Lastly unlike other campus, the people I meet at McKendree are some of the kindest, honest, and most loyalest I have ever met. Have the time when I leave my door I can often leave it unlocked because I know no one will steal from me. In conclusion from my perspective, what McKendree lacks in size it definatly makes up for in edjucation and a sense of community, which I think it simply the bee's knee's."
College Junior,4,The games are always packed. We love going to games.
College Junior,4,"I love where I go to school, money is the only rough part."
College Sophomore,4,Administration is happy to be a reference for students when it comes to looking for careers. There are also affiliations with other schools that allow students to find a program that works for them.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not really into sports, but the games always bring a lot of people and if you go with a group it is pretty fun. School spirit is always high, what with everyone having clothes bought from the book store, and there are lots of ways to get involved on campus with or without sports."
College Sophomore,4,Good everything cool class sizes only like 17 people in a class
College Sophomore,4,I haven't lived on campus yet but I heard it was the best this fall I will be on campus
College Sophomore,4,Greek life at the school helps one another friendship expand longer and if you're a non Greek or Greek it don't everyone cool their are no Greek housing available
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at my school is great I will be playing football this season myself
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience at the school so far is cool everyone nice and respectful. This school is unique because it's an small university were you can get to know everyone in the class and get closer to your instructor.
College Freshman,4,They housing is great and community bathrooms are kept squeaky clean! The new halls are a great addition to the housing life and gives people more options.
College Freshman,4,We have a good variety of greek life and they do a great thing for out school and the community around us.
College Freshman,4,I am part of the varsity women's soccer team and i couldnt be more proud of our fans and our training facilities.
College Freshman,4,Its a great environment with enthusiastic and helpful people everywhere you go. I wouldnt want to be anywhere else.
College Sophomore,4,"Career Services is a great office that McKendree has available for its students, but I feel that it is highly underutilized."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are great. They expect the students to give their all and are always willing to help if needed. There are lots of different courses offered and encouraged at McKendree. The class sizes are nice and classes are engaging.
College Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at McKendree. The professors are very passionate about what they are teaching and helpful if you ask for it. There are many activities available for students to participate in for fun and also for academics. I love the location of the school and the campus itself. The only reason I gave it 4/5 is because of the price. It may not be the most expensive, but for someone who is there on an academic scholarship and works four jobs, it is a bit steep."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are really helpful and will take the time to help you even if you are not in their class. If they notice that you have dedication they would go out of their way to make sure you get the help and classes that you want.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is great with some minor problems, for example the noise of the athletes and music being too loud, but otherwise it is peaceful."
College Sophomore,4,"I honestly do not attend any sports games, but news travel fast in my school and my school has won most of all the games they played. My school is mainly athletes so my school has a lot of team spirit because we all support each other in our own way."
College Freshman,4,If their is a problem on campus Public Safety will come right away and get to the bottom of any situation needed at that time. I've seen them come late at night and in the early mornings because its what their supposed to do and they care about the students because they have children of their own they don't want to see go through anything.
College Freshman,4,"I currently have two jobs, one here on campus and one off of campus. It is very difficult to get a job here on campus only because we are a small campus. Our career services program helps me as well because they found multiple internships that fit what I want to do in my future career as well as a permanent job."
College Freshman,4,Since I've been here at McKendree I've only had one bad experience with a professor because of the lack of communication between us. I made a B in the class but it could've been better. I took advantage of our Writing Center and a tutor to help me throughout the way. Being active with your professor helps them to help you even more and makes the class easier for you. They are always their to help me when I need it and even their just to talk.
College Freshman,4,Athletics are a big part of McKendree because over half of the campus is involved in some type of sport and we are like one big family and we pack the building in any condition to support one another. Since our teachers are very close to us they are always their for support as well to each of their students.
College Freshman,4,"Being here at McKendree University has taught me to be more open with others and understandable of others feelings. Being that our student to teacher ratio is very good, all my teachers know me by name and so does my president. I will be here for my Master's program because faculty members are already encouraging me to pursue my dream and they are helping me along the way."
College Sophomore,4,This is a really great school but not for me
College Sophomore,4,This is a really great school but not for me
College Junior,4,"Overall, I love McKendree University. The class sizes are small and there are many types of courses available online."
College Junior,4,"School spirit is alive and well at McKendree University. I may be an online student, so I cannot ever attend a football game or anything involving sports. However, I know they do well and we even have Bearcat Fridays."
College Junior,4,I have been at McKendree Online since last August and it has been great so far. The advisors are very helpful when registering for classes and usually get a hold of the teachers via email has been easy. I love the discussion board posts and that I can take the tests/quizzes when I have the time.
College Sophomore,4,the small classrooms and passionate teachers make learning at this school fun
College Sophomore,4,I have not personally used the Athletics equipment. I am not in sports but i love watching them. Mckendree students and faculty are all very passionate about their sports teams. the passion the school shows towards its sports makes me want to join a sport to be more of a part of the school.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall at my school so far has been great, it is a bit expensive due to the fact that it's a private school but with the help of my financial aid and all the scholarships they offer for other activities on campus I'm only paying $400.00 out of pocket! It's a great environment a safe one and you can tell the teachers are dedicated and want you to succeed, it's also challenging but what's life without a challenge !"
College Junior,4,"Most of the professors here really care about their students and teach their courses really well. You can tell they want their students to succeed, and it is easy to get to know them. They are open and honest, and they provide students with proper information to prepare them for their futures. They know a lot about their subjects and you can tell they are passionate about them. The class sizes are very small and I love this! They are also styled perfectly with lectures on powerpoints and such. There are a ton of classes offered also. They are very difficult, though, and are a great challenge."
College Junior,4,"The job outlook is pretty great. All of the faculty, staff, and teachers are always finding ways to help their students find internships and job opportunities. There are always recruiters on campus passing out information on probable careers. There is a variety of resources on campus available to students to better their chances of finding amazing careers for their futures."
College Junior,4,"Athletics are obviously a big part of the McKendree experience. Most of the students at McKendree are involved in sports. It is definitely a sports school. Our teams are very good and draw much attention from fans. I feel that we have a lot of school spirit here. I absolutely love our athletic facilities! I love to work out in the gyms. They are very nice, clean, and have a lot of equipment to offer."
College Junior,4,"I absolutely love the small town feeling that McKendree brings. I love the small campus and how the classes are small and more personal. I have gotten to know my professors very well, and this is important to me. I am able to have adequate one on one time with my teachers. However, McKendree is very expensive, and I feel that with my academic record being what it is I deserved a better scholarship than what I was given. There are many athletes paying an immense amount less than me to attend here while I put triple the effort into my schooling than they do and my grades show this. It makes me feel like I should have looked into more schools who were willing to pay me more for my hard work throughout my academic history and current studies."
College Sophomore,4,Everything is close to campus and even if you live off campus it is still in walking distance to the campus. Very social and get to meet new people. I made some of my best friends from where I lived at.
College Sophomore,4,Most people on campus go to support the sports teams when they can. Everything is very nice when it comes to the facilities and the trainers know what they are doing and are very helpful.
College Senior,4,"McKendree University is a D2 private university in a small town. It has the laid back and family like atmosphere with bigger cities nearby - Fairview Heights, O'Fallon, St. Louis. Small class sizes allows you to get to know your professors and your classmates. D2 athletics means both academic and athletic scholarships are available. The faculty really does seem to care about your future and want you to get the most out of your McKendree experience. There are a lot of opportunities to get involved and stand out on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"At McKendree University, the professors and staff make it a part of their mission not only to know you on a personal level, but also to interact with you on a personal level. They know when something is wrong with you. Our President, Dr. Dennis, hands out FREE ice cream on hot days to help students beat the heat! McKendree has helped me decide my future, the staff is dedicated to helping students gain the knowledge necessary for a future occupation.  I would definitely choose McKendree University again because the level of compassion that every single professor holds for his or her job is absolutely beautiful. I cannot imagine a school in which the professors are as dedicated in helping the student on every aspect of his or her life."
College Sophomore,4,"I am becoming a teacher.  I will end up student teaching.  For this, there is no pay.  The school is very helpful to students by helping them find schools to student teach at.  As a student teacher I realize I will have all the responsibilities of a teacher.  Being a teacher or student teacher in this case is very time consuming"
College Sophomore,4,I love being in Lebanon. It is a small town just like my hometown. VERY cozy.  I like that Ofallon is just around the corner for groceries or food.  I like that St. Louis is only 20-25 minutes away for the attractions
College Senior,4,I have not encountered any problems except as to when certain classes are offered.
College Sophomore,4,There have been many different backgrounds in my classes.
College Freshman,4,"Easy to establish yourself, which is great."
Senior,2,"I was excited to learn that I was going to finally have my BBA in Management this month... until they came back needing tax info that they failed to ask for previously (a new staff member due to the previous two who had helped me leaving already), THEN, I requested they do another degree evaluation and they said, ""Oh, you only need one more course to finish, not two, but you can't take it now until March 2020...""  
No apologies, no sympathy, NOTHING.  Just requests for more $...
The administration is VERY poor."
Sophomore,2,"Mckendree University is a small private liberal arts school in Lebanon, IL. Focuses heavily on academics and majority of the student body are athletes."
Sophomore,2,"If you're wanting to continue with sports and get an education then that's really the only thing that Mckendree offers. It's a small overly priced university with not much diversity nor edge to it. It's a dry campus for starters (meaning barely any time to party and have a good time with peers or friends) diversity is oriented upon the sport you're in (if you're a softball player you typically stick with softball players, football, wrestling, etc) if you're not in a sport you're practically considered an outcast and tend to have friends who aren't doing a sport. Not many people attend student events unless it involves homecoming or football games. The education is good and there are teachers that help you and care, however they should have more majors and minors. Unless you have almost a full ride? The school basically cheats you out of your money and puts you in depth. They have good programs but it's not worth the amount of money that's being paid."
College Junior,2,We dont really have a greek life.
College Sophomore,2,This is a D3 school under the name of D2 trying to be D1
College Sophomore,2,"although the university is located approximately 30 minutes from st. louis, i find the atmosphere incredibly boring for anyone under the age of 21."
College Sophomore,2,"The majority of decently priced dining options include mcdonalds, taco bell, and wendy's. If one wants quality food, the price goes up dramatically and travel time is increased (typically located in St.Louis)."
College Sophomore,2,"I understand the need for code within the dorms, however, at times I find the strictness ruins the limited fun available on campus and instead replaces that absence with boredom and stress."
College Freshman,2,No options in Lebanon. Great variety in close towns
College Freshman,2,Easy to get away with most everything.
College Sophomore,2,I am not in any specific program at this point.
College Sophomore,2,The wirless connection here is not strong at all.
College Senior,2,I don't really know what the local atmosphere is like because I am a distance learner.
College Senior,2,I'm not sure about off-campus housing because I am a distance learner.
College Junior,2,"Lebanon has been trying to not allow students to live in the homes in this area. Students tend not to be the greatest tenants, so it is understandable. However, it is not hard to find a cheaper place to live because this town is so small. There are many other small towns around if you are willing to commute about 5 to 10 miles."
College Senior,2,Students should be able to complete all of their classes. Even if they owe money to the university!!!
College Freshman,2,It`s pretty difficult to get some basic things to buy since the place is a rural area.
College Sophomore,2,"Its Okay – Our public safety reduce the use of alcohol and drugs at the school, but will never put an end to it.  It is a dry campus, but kids still find ways to party which why it is crazier off campus than on campus"
College Freshman,2,Not Good at All – Public transportation is not good at all. You need a car or know someone with a car to get around. Everything is outside of the city limits.
College Sophomore,2,Safe but Strict – I never felt in danger on campus but public safety is always looking for alcohol to write kids up for.
College Sophomore,1,"The wifi is absolutely horrible. At times, I even drive 30 minutes home to finish my online sapling homework due to the in-campus network crashing completely."
College Sophomore,1,"There's never really anything to do on campus and/or off. If there is a party off campus, it is shortly busted by the cops and then everyone goes to brewers (which is a mistake on its own)."
College Freshman,1,Town shuts down at 8pm. Drive somewhere for fun.
College Sophomore,1,The facilities here are the worst here also.
College Sophomore,1,"When it snows, it is the worst. When it rains, it pours."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no ""nightlife"" here at Mckendree. Not really much to do on campus."
College Junior,1,"While the campus itself is wonderful, small, rural, ""personal"", and the teachers are mostly kind and educated, the policies instituted by the University itself are primal, barbaric.  They treat us like three-year-olds, not the adults that we are becoming.  Athletes slide by and can miss class all day, but as a homeowner, I am not allowed to miss because it is ot ""excused."" This University fancies itself high-class, but they will always be just another college in a cornfield."
College Junior,1,"Our rent-a-cops are more concerned with writing parking tickets than actually watching out to make sure those same cars aren't broken into.  They worry more about WHERE you park, not who is trying to steal your things.  We really don't have special safety measures, and our ""Emergency Call-Boxes"" are perputually out of order.  Very poor security."
College Junior,1,"Nothing Happens – There is never anything to do. On campus, the public safety officers shut everything down. The off campus apartments normally get shut down quick by the cops. If you're looking for a true college nightlife experience, don't attend this school. "
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not a Lot Available – I received almost no financial aid except for an out of state grant when I was 23 yo even though I lived next to the campus my entire life, however my father moved to another state."
College Sophomore,1,"There are greek groups on campus, none which house their members, and they have very little influence academically or socially."
Recent Alumnus,1,Dry Campus – The campus is dry because of religious affiliations which is fine.  Policies are pretty strict and that leads to a lot of students going off campus to drink and driving home.  Students choose to lead an unsafe lifestyle because they aren't allowed to drink in the comfort and safety of their own apartments or dorm rooms.
College Senior,1,Parking at McKendree is really horrible.  The handicap parking is limited and ACROSS the street from classes in the main bldg where the elevators are.  Freshman should not be allowed to drive on campus which would free up some parking space. There needs to be more handicapp parking closer to all the buildings.
College Senior,1,"The University provides three areas on campus for food.  The dining hall requires a meal plan, another place sells you overpriced frozen food you can go put in the microwave yourself, and the cafe is over priced.  A ham and cheese sandwich costs $4.50, and it doesn't come with anything else."
College Junior,1,"There is no off campus housing through the school, however it is possible to get an apartment in the area, but you may need to get a roommate to help cover the costs."
College Senior,1,"The food quality on campus is awful. I would get sick often while living in the dorms and eating regularly at Ames. When I left and stopped eating there, my stomach problems decreased significantly. They are also not good about specialty items for people with food allergies. 1828 is extremely overpriced and very slow. The food there is better, but not amazing. It would be helpful to have more options near and around campus, but most of the time I end up driving to O'Fallon to get a real meal."
College Junior,1,"Free parking permits, but you have to get on campus around 7-8 in the morning to park close to a class. A new section of parking was added and it is far away, freshman have to park near the gym (even if you commute), and parked cars along the road are usually poorly parked. Suites have their own lot and are lucky."
College Junior,1,"Not very much to do in the area, the local people are not always the biggest fans of the college students. A very small town with 2 main streets, and a 15 minute drive to the nearest fun place. St. Louis is fairly close, but far enough to feel like it's not always worth the effort. Some nice people and things to do, but you have to put a lot of effort into it."
College Senior,1,I agree with the sample. Parking is awful and as a freshman you should get used to walking everywhere. Parking is horrific.
College Senior,1,"As a commuter student, I hate the parking situation on campus. The apartment complex down the road directed completely at students has a huge parking lot where students should leave their cars and take the campus transportation and save parking on campus to the commuters!"

Junior,5,"The one thing I like about Cox College is the fact that they offer  2 year nursing program. Considering coming from a community college, I know that they do not offer this kind of program. You are either going to take their LPN program and moving forward to an RN. With COX, what they'll do it get our pre requisites done."
Junior,5,It was pretty neat considering the fact that being in an online class is hectic and difficult. The professors made it easier for the students.
Junior,5,Zoom made it very easy if i needs to talk to my professor but can’t due to being too far. The online tools we use are easy to navigate.
Junior,5,"The atmosphere is very intimate. Every professor is very attentive to each students needs making sure they understand everything. The learning environment is great as it can be in the classroom, in the study areas, outside, or in the hospital. Every staff member show how passionate they are about the students and their jobs."
Niche User,5,"I have recently applied to Cox College and plan on transferring there next fall. Therefore, I do not know what their college scene is like; however, they have been very good at communicating with me when I ask them questions and have also called me multiple times telling me what I need to get done before next semester. So far, they seem like a great school and I have heard nothing but excellent things about this college. They do not have dorms and no sports teams but it is very focused"
College Sophomore,5,"Super safe, no crime at all."
College Junior,5,"I am currently living at home, and home is the best!"
College Junior,5,"Cox College specializes in nursing, so I can expect that I will get an excellent education at this institution. My dad worked for Cox as a nurse for many years."
College Junior,5,I am limited to nursing school but mostly women ranging in age from 20's to 60's a few men average age 30's  mostly white
College Junior,5,am not familiar with any campus housing but nursing school is very strict
Sophomore,4,I love how willing the staff is to help students  succeed and work through any issues. Very friendly group of people and I have no trouble getting to the answers I need.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone wants to learn and be the best they can be
College Sophomore,4,The work load is hard but it is worth it.
College Junior,4,There is a good security service in place here. I fell very safe.
College Junior,4,The overall experience is great.  Easy going instructors and nice classmates make for a great learning environment.
College Junior,4,"After completion of my studies here, I feel I will have a very strong resume to help me find future employment."
College Junior,4,The faculty and instructors are very down to earth and friendly.  It is a great hands-on school to learn your skills. There is a great amount of book studying to learn the basics but the hands-on is a great re-enforcer of the skills presented in class.
College Junior,4,"Nursing school is very rigorous by nature. The teachers want you to succeed, but expect you to work for it."
College Junior,4,"Being as it is a hospital school, consistent measures are taken to keep the students and patients healthy."
College Junior,4,Cox College has  a great simulation center to help students learn.
College Junior,4,There are lots of options around to choose from depending on your taste.
College Junior,4,"My adviser has been very helpful, as have been all other staff as well."
College Junior,4,Cox College has a wide range of medicine-related degrees available. I think it has a good selection.
College Senior,4,I haven't done an internship and don't plan on doing one either.  I have heard good things about it but know nothing firsthand.
College Senior,4,I have never had an issue that would involve campus security.  I know I see them patrolling the parking lots looking to ticket those who park in the wrong spots.
College Senior,4,Not too familiar with dining on campus.  I know you can eat at the hospital cafeteria with a discount.  There aren't too many food places really close so if you don't have a car plan on bringing your lunch or eating in the cafeteria.
College Senior,4,"There are at least 3 computer labs which is nice.  I have never been in one at a time that it was so crowded I couldn't get on.  The only thing is that the teachers reserve the larger of the labs and we found that when we have the time reserved for class, there are a lot of other students in there.  Not sure how they can make that better other than hanging huge signs on the door."
College Junior,4,"I haven't seen any drugs on campus, though drinking is a HIGHLY popular activity on weekends."
College Freshman,4,"There is only restaurants near my school. They give no student discounts, but the food is fairly cheap and very good."
College Freshman,4,"My college does a cohort program, that is to where it gives the same opportunities in big towns as for little towns. It does not leave anyone out. And, it is in a very good part of town and everyone is very nice."
Graduate Student,2,"There is little communication and structure within the programs. The tuition outweighs the experience by far. The staff are awesome, but that doesn't compensate for the absence of integrity within the establishment."
College Junior,2,"The weather is awful in Springfield, which is called the epicenter of weather in the US.  It is 101 degrees in the summer, 2 degrees in the winter, and we can go from having tornadoes one day to a blizzard the next.  Class is rarely cancelled and with no dorms or student housing, driving to campus is nearly impossible in ice storms or snow drifts.  The best thing, though, is that it changes in nearly the blink of an eye.  It will be 65 and sunny tomorrow!"
Graduate Student,1,The MSOT program is the worst. They make us pay for a therapyed course or they deduct 30 points from our grade. They’ve told us time after time that we are going to fail the exam. Go to MSU if you want a good program and good professors.
Niche User,1,It is a terrible school. The professors don't seem to know what they are talking about. They are not very friendly or approachable.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have any fraternities or sororities.
College Junior,1,"The nursing program at Cox is completely unorganized.  The instructors can't get their coordination together.  Yes, there are a few amazing instructors but those are few and far between.  You learn to really cherish them because everything else--the disorganization, the lack of communication, the lack of instruction--makes you so frustrated you start to wonder why you chose this school in the first place."
College Junior,1,"There are no dorms on campus, and there has been no recent discussion about bringing them back, as at one time there had been off-campus housing options available with student aid provided at a discount by the school."
College Junior,1,"Our main campus is located in a very unsafe neighborhood, and since there is no ""campus safety"" to watch out over us, I can sometimes feel unsafe if I'm up near campus at night.  I'm glad that I'm not usually there after dark!"

Alum,5,Great atmosphere! Missouri Baptist University (AKA Mobap) is a close knit campus where the faculty and staff will legitimately go out of their way to show concern for their students.

College Freshman,5,"Missouri Baptist Is made up of mostly athletes so sports are a big part of everyday life on campus. The support from the public, staff, students and other athletes on campus is amazing. Being a athlete at Missouri Baptist I can honestly say i wouldn't want to play anywhere else! Day in and day out i enjoy my time spent with my teammates and other athletes on campus we are all one big family."
College Freshman,5,"I love attending Missouri Baptist. Not being far from home is very comforting to me and the people and professors make my time at college very enjoyable. I can honestly say it is my home away from home. Not only do we have one of the best campuses around in my opinion, we also have the best staff that will go out of their way to help you succeed. My favorite experience so far was welcome weekend. It is a time at the beginning of the semester to get to know all of the other incoming freshman and make new friends. Missouri Baptist makes a good home for everyone!"
College Freshman,5,It's the best. All the teachers are nice and it's a small campus.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is the perfect size for me! The teachers are friendly and make it a point that you understand the material and are not falling behind. Everyone is extremely outgoing and nice!

College Junior,5,I love my city and I could not think of living anywhere else.
College Junior,5,Everyone looks out for others and there is a sense of family on campus.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I haven't had one yet but I don't know if I will but if I did, I feel it would be great as everything else has been!!"
Recent Alumnus,5,This is my fourth year of college and by far the easiest process.  Everyone bends over backwards for you and makes you feel very welcome!!
Recent Alumnus,5,This college has went out of their way to make sure I get the classes and times I need.  The whole process with this college has been excellent.  I feel they are looking out for me!!
Recent Alumnus,5,Everything was smooth sailing! Everyone I have dealt with so far has went out of their way for me.
Recent Alumnus,5,Excellent housing and availability!  The price was the best part-it was less than half of what I paid off-campus at another college.
College Senior,5,I believe that our safety officers work hard and use great effectiveness
College Freshman,5,"Since this is located in a large city, there are many dining options.  There is a wide variety of cuisines in the immediate area."
College Freshman,5,I love my major.  I am taking many music courses.  On average I have 12 different music courses each semester in addition to core area classses.
College Freshman,5,It is very convenient and is free to all students.  It is great for inclement weather as it provides a way to cross campus without being in the elements.
College Junior,5,I have great instructors in the MAT program.
College Sophomore,5,"I transferred in two weeks before school started, and was still eligible for all the scholarships. They are ready and willing to help you with whatever you need and try to give you as much financial aid as possible."
College Sophomore,5,"MoBap has a good many education, music, and ministry majors. Many of the students are athletes as well."
Senior,4,"The University is on the smaller side which provides for a family-like atmosphere.  There are great teachers, staff, and faculty on campus.  The classes are set-up well, and there is a strong desire from the University to help it's students succeed."
Senior,4,"Online classes are well set-up for student success.  With the changes brought on by COVID-19, teachers had to adapt classes that were intended to be a face-to-face structure to an online structure.  All classes now are able to handle that transition if needed."
Sophomore,4,Missouri Baptist University is an excellent college. The faculty and staff care about the students well being and provide an excellent learning space for students. The learning environment feels safe and comfortable while still pushing the students to expand their knowledge. The chapel services are great and help in furthering students walks with the Lord. The school not only teaches students but encourages them in living as for Christ.
Sophomore,4,Missouri Baptist University’s in-line learning programs are excellent. They are fast paced while also being thorough and not overbearing. You get the right amount of information in a timely manner and the teachers are more than understanding in helping to find ways to better your online learning experience in their classes.
Alum,4,"MBU is a cozy campus thats just big enough to feel like a full on University without being so big that new-comers feel lost.  Lots of opportunities to connect with others and lots of things to do with the campus being in St. Louis County.  I do wish dorms were cheaper, the higher end ones are just about the same as the older dorms but for a much higher price.  It is cheaper to rent an apartment for out of town students."
Sophomore,4,"Missouri Baptist University is a great  institution that enhances you spiritually,  academically and socially. I am building that will last pass my collegiate journey."
Sophomore,4,"Great advising staff. Excellent culture. Motivational and understanding instructors. All together good atmosphere. Expensive, but that is expected."
Junior,4,I love the environment of the school because it supports my faith as a christian. I just really wish that all of the students shared my faith as well.
Junior,4,The staff is very friendly and there is a variety of degrees. The financial aid department could communicate more.
Junior,4,"Very good University if you are looking for something local, and towards Christian principles. Professors are great and really care about your education as well."
Freshman,4,There are many great things about Missouri Baptist University. One thing would be the accessibility to professors inside and outside of the class. Classrooms usually hold 25 people or less which means the professor can acknowledge students and their offices are right by the classrooms so students can easily stop by and talk. They are very personable and actually care and will take time to know students.
Senior,4,"I have experienced fantastic interactions with my Professors, they have been extremely helpful and understanding of my situation, being an online student out of state."
Senior,4,"MoBap is an excellent place to attend college if you're looking for a private Christian school. However, MoBap is not that affordable for me. Tuition costs about $13-14k a SEMESTER. However, the students are friendly and warm. A benefit of MoBap is that they have more than one location, and on their main campus, they have a coffee shop. Professors are amazing at what they do, but other resources like Records, Public Safety, and Financial Aid are not so great. Public Safety loves to ticket cars, regardless what your excuse is. Records Office doesn't really have a clue how to run things, and the Financial Aid Office does nothing in your best interest to help you get any sort of aid to help pay for tuition. Because the campus is extremely nice and landscaped, and the professors and students are more than kind, and there are dorms and brand new apartments on campus, I'd give MoBap a 4/5."
Niche User,4,"I love how it is obvious that MBU is a Christ-centered environment.  However, I did have a few problems with professors giving the students access to a homework assignment in a timely fashion.  Overall great school."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed the small campus feel because it felt like a community, and that we bonded like a family. Also, I like the fact that it was a private school, so the students were very secured, and there athletics were top notch for NAIA division."
Sophomore,4,"I love the environment and the professors in my field. I appreciate and admire their expertise and knowledge. In general, the people at MBU are caring, and as a student, I receive a much more personal education. Also the Christian ministry and Christian community on campus is welcoming and a real blessing. I have certainly grown here."
Senior,4,"Missouri Baptist University is friendly and inviting for college students. The instructors are very friendly and willing to help students succeed as much as possible. Instructors are very knowledgeable about the material they are teaching and genuinely care about the success of their students.  Overall, great college and great experience."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are great, most seem to care genuinely about the success of their students. Some of the courses such as survey of computing are outdated and unneeded in the world today."
College Sophomore,4,As a ministry major I am sure that I will be able to find some internship prospects with the help of Career services and the on campus ministry.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not much of a sports person, but I can say that MOBAP does a great job with it's athletics department. It could use a little more fan support though."
College Sophomore,4,"Going to MOBAP was a great decision. There are a varity of people, both christian and non-christian, which leads to having a more lax atmosphere. Even though there is a population of non-christians, MOBAP holds tight to it's christian values and pursues a christlike attitude. There are many fantastic anemities that help you through your classes and day to day living. I would definetly suggest MOBAP to anyone."
College Freshman,4,The support is great! It's like you are back in higschool
College Freshman,4,I love how the school is focused on sports and religion! The dorms are very nice and big!
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are a great size but the rules are ridiculous.
College Senior,4,I love most of my professors and the classroom settings. The only thing i would change about the staff is some advisors and academic counselors.
College Senior,4,I feel safe on campus because I believe things are very well taken care of.
College Senior,4,I enjoy the athletic program and I feel comfortable asking for help when I am hurt. The athletic facilities are nice also.
College Senior,4,"I have really enjoyed my school so far. If I could choose all over again, I think I would have gone to Mobap sooner so that I could get the better education I believe I am receiving now. I love my team and my coach. I play soccer for my school. 

If I had to change one thing about my school it would be to make the work study program pay for full tuition."
College Sophomore,4,"Now, I have never, and probably will not perform in an athletic organization at Missouri Baptist, however it is very evident that the campus takes pride in both their amount of sports available, as well as the teamwork within them."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are top notch, with great class sizes, not to big at all!"
College Freshman,4,"Its a really great school, with awesome professors, however cost is quite high."
College Freshman,4,Only complaint is that they aren't co-ed.
College Sophomore,4,I get to go to night school while I work during the day in the same field I'm Pursuing
College Sophomore,4,The cheerleading squad is great.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy campus housing because its friendly atmosphere and a quick and easy way to get to see and hang out with friends. Dorms are very big and we have weekly room checks so they stay clean. Open hall so friends can come over and hang out and have study groups. RA's are friendly and very helpful aswell.
College Junior,4,People are campus are very friendly and outgoing.
College Senior,4,Missouri Baptist University has an outstanding and growing athletics program. Athletic facilities are great for team work outs and team practices are very organized. Students are proud to support their teams. Students have an opportunity to become involved in team sports through team management programs. Team performances as a whole are adequate but could improve.
College Freshman,4,The professors here are great and very approachable. A lot of them have doctorates.
College Freshman,4,I like how there are practice rooms in the music building for voice and piano students.
College Freshman,4,I really love the options on pasta and soup!
College Freshman,4,"When we had the Welcome Weekend Dance, it was an awesome time!"
College Freshman,4,"I don't really like sports, but everyone that I've talked to says they're great."
College Freshman,4,"Creve Couer is a nice suburb of St. Louis, but I would prefer to live out in the country. It is very convenient though, so I'm not going to complain."
College Junior,4,They have rules and boundaries that are to be followed.
College Junior,4,There is much diversity on campus.
College Junior,4,The professors are very knowledgable.
College Junior,4,Most students seem very down to earth and friendly.
College Junior,4,The professors are knowable and always able to help.
College Junior,4,They are knowable and very helpful. They office has a quick response time
College Senior,4,I enjoy attending this facility because it is not extremely large it is just right
College Senior,4,I feel this school wants their students to excel at what ever they put their minds to
College Junior,4,"My experience with my school has been great! The professors and teachers are very hands on and always available to help you. The student body is very open and welcoming and there is always some activities to get involved in around my campus. They promote you on an academic, athletic and as well as a spiritual side to grow and become the person you would want to be."
College Junior,4,Most of the guys and girls at my school are athletes so everybody is always on the go. People usually come to class and dinner in their basketball shorts and workout clothes. We do interact with a lot of people on academic scholarships and we tend to meet them at social functions the school has throughout the years. It is a very open place and everybody is nice.
College Senior,4,I feel that the drug scene on campus is little to non existent at Jefferson College. This type of problem is really monitored at the dorms as well as on campus.
College Senior,4,"The campus security is great on campus. We do not have a health facility, but it would be nice to have one. The campus police do their jobs well and really show their presence to make sure the students know they are safe. Plus there is the local sheriffs office on campus as well."
College Freshman,4,They have an academic success center that offers free help to all students in any subject that is needed.  Registration is very easy.  The professors are very caring and are concerned for their students.
College Junior,4,It was fairly easy to enter the MAT program. There is basically a checklist that you need to complete.
College Junior,4,"I do not live on campus, but when I visit the main campus I generally find it very pleasing."
College Junior,4,"I do not live on campus, so I am not aware of many of the school policies and strictness."
College Junior,4,I always feel safe on the main campus and on the extension sites.
Junior,2,"Too many online classes for ""on-campus"" enrollment. Many online classes are very repetitive and seem to rely more on grind/tedious work. All online classes (for most part) are 8 week courses, which means there is a TON of work. 
I think the amount of online classes is demonstrative of Mobap wanting to run things as cheaply as possible. Don't have lots of resources (though overpriced) so the have profs proctor a lot of online classes.
Most online teachers are simply proctors with little interaction with them. Don't give enough opportunities to engage with teacher/watch their lectures."
College Freshman,2,"Already searching for alternative colleges, MBU is not suited for people who are typical college students who want to have a good college experience. However; if you are into having nowhere to socialize and like to sit in your room all day and dread your life, then it's your kinda place!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"MBA low level education, poor teacher quality."
Recent Alumnus,2,Poorly designed MBA program. Adj. Profs model.
College Senior,2,I found out that I was short 11000 towards my tuition
College Senior,2,There is only fraternity being Phi Theta Kappa at Jefferson College.
College Sophomore,2,Parking is okay but there's not enough for the students and if you have to pay for parking then you shouldn't have to park in the gravel.
College Freshman,2,"There is an outside company that was hired for our dining hall, and the chicken has been undercooked on several occasions and poor fruit choices"
College Junior,2,"As a non traditional student, I don't find that there are any for people like me.  I was in the military right out of high school, so I will never qualify for many of the scholarships offered because I didn't go to college right out of high school."
College Junior,2,"I give the grade of C because the parking is not really close, but it's not a huge walk either.  I think the parking could have been laid out better to reach classes without trekking through the weather so much.  The main campus is pretty small, but none of the parking is really that close to any building."
College Junior,2,Since the campus is so small even the parking that is farthest from campus is close. I don't like the fact that yu have to purchase a parking permit ever semester and the cost is kind of expensive.
College Student,2,"Apartments Are Costly – Saint Louis has apartments all over its city. The cost of the apartments depends on what part of the city you would like to live at. Missouri Baptist University would rather you stay in there new apartments villas they just built. The apartments are the same cost of regular apartments, but you would not need any transportation to get to school. Since their just right off campus, you can walk. Also, it would still be safe because you would still be under some of the school rules and regulations. But more freedom would be awarded."
College Sophomore,2,"Ask a Friend for a Ride – The only means of transportation is the bus stop outside of campus. The campus is right on the highway but is in between major streets. Everything is a drive away, walking is not an option"
Sophomore,1,"Because of this whole pandemic, we did have to finish off the year online. There are teachers that didn't know how to handle, not only just teachers but students as well. In my personal experience I don't really do well with online classes, I learn better when I am face to face and I am able to ask for help or even stay after class to ask for more aid."
College Freshman,1,There is one fraternity and one sorority. Neither of them are worth the money or time to be involved in.
College Senior,1,I attend religious university and everyone seems nice
College Junior,1,"The financial aid department is rude and do things differently than any other university I have attended. For example, I was offered $7,500 in unsubsidized stafford loans. I completed the Master Promissory Note, but I never went to the school website to accept the loan, because I knew I would pay out of pocket for most of the cost. However, the school went ahead and accepted the entire $7,500 loan on my behalf without my permission. The worst part was that I only owed about $5,000, so they sent me a check in the mail for the remaining $2,500. I had to call and argue with the person in charge that it was not acceptable for them to accept a loan on my behalf. They made me void the check and send it back. This has happened three semesters in a row. I have never experienced anything like this, and I have attended two other universities as an undergraduate student."
College Freshman,1,There really is nothing to do at night on campus. Besides the few and far between events that may occur at night everyone goes off campus to do something.
College Sophomore,1,"Not much goes on to my knowledge, but I am a commuter"

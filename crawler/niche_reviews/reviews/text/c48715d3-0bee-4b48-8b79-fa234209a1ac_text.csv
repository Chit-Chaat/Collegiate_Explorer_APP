Freshman,5,Excellent school where the professors care about their students . Great small town and close to other colleges.
Freshman,5,The online experience is good given the limitations. Of course it does lack something when you are not able to meet the professor and other stiduents.
Senior,5,Professors care about their students and put in a lot of effort into making the online learning experience bearable.
Senior,5,Great atmosphere to learn in - professors genuinely care about their students. The students are very friendly and the environment is generally collaborative. Lots of connections to be made with diverse people from all sorts of backgrounds.
Niche User,5,The faculty and students at Amherst College are very welcoming. The professors are extremely well-versed in their subjects and open to office hours with students.
Alum,5,"Great four years. Academically challenging, beautiful campus, can continue to increase diversity, competitive athletics, and variety of opportunities on campus and in town to fulfill social interests"
Niche User,5,Amherst was a beautiful campus and an amazing experience! I met so many people who I consider my best friends to this day! Would recommend!
Niche User,5,Amherst truly is an amazing school in a beautiful location. The professors are top notch and the student body is extremely friendly and open.
Niche User,5,"I visited them in July. I liked their campus, especially the outside community. This is my top choice college and I really would love to go here!"
Freshman,5,Everyone is so nice. The campus is beautiful. The food has its good days. The classes are rewarding and professors are caring. Many extracurriculars to choose from. Great environment.
Freshman,5,"Generous financial aid, diverse student body, excellent career/internship support services, and friendly professors!"
Alum,5,"I graduated in 1986 so I am sure the campus has changed dramatically. When I went there, it wasn't as diverse as it is now nor was it as progressive. However, overall, the experience was excellent and I would recommend this school to anyone I know."
Alum,5,"Small School, for sure. Everyone knows each other's business, but if you are ok with that, the academics are truly unparalleled. The professors are all incredibly intelligent and helpful, and they really pushed me to think through a problem with all its complexity, without the pressures of simplification that often characterize modern issues. My classmates were all amazing, which was intimidating at first, but which I also grew to appreciate and hopefully grow from.  The administration tries its best, but at times, students feel they aren't heard and the administration feels it is coddling students. Definitely more work to be done (in and outside the college) on understanding and making space for identities, but Amherst's diversity really pushes everyone to make that space (successfully at times and unsuccessfully at times.)"
Alum,5,"I fell in love with Amherst the minute I saw it. Located on a hill in an idyllic New England town, it embodies all the qualities I think are important in a college."
Senior,5,"I've grown intellectually more than I could have imagined during my time at Amherst. The student body is amazing from top to bottom, which allows classes to move at a very fast pace. Much material is covered, very quickly, each semester. Plenty to do on campus, in town and in the surrounding area, the Pioneer Valley is beautiful."
Senior,5,"The academics at Amherst rival any college in the country. The professors are all tops in their field, and also make themselves available at any time. This is really an important thing. The student body has the same ""on paper diversity"" as most colleges, but everyone here is highly academically accomplished, including the athletes. It is not, however, an outwardly ""competitive"" place. That's not the culture here. People are friendly and there are parties and social engagements almost all Fridays and Saturdays, but from Sunday through Thursday people study and work hard. Sports events (football, basketball, etc) are surprisingly well attended and fun events. Very hard school to get into, esp. if you are not a recruited athlete."
Alum,5,"Absolutely amazing school, life-changing experience. Met so many diverse, hard-working, passionate, interesting, intellectual people there. Got tons of opportunities--went abroad, and did lots of internships on Amherst's dime. Financial aid was amazing. Campus is jaw-droppingly beautiful with the leafy quads and the Holyoke range on the horizon. Town is super cute and charming. Most of my friends ended up at top grad schools and jobs around the country and abroad."
Senior,5,"As a senior looking back I can say I could not have made a better choice. Like everyone here I had many great colleges to choose from. My experience here has been phenomenal. One bonus for those entering after this year is all major construction will be done, including the fantastic new $300 million science center."
Junior,5,"Starting my Junior year at Amherst. It is a fantastic place to learn. Quality professors, an administration that cares for the students, faculty and staff, a ridiculously strong and loyal alumni network, a beautiful and historic campus that is meticulously maintained and thoughtfully preserved. What's not to love!"
Senior,5,"As a graduating senior this year, I can say that I will greatly miss Amherst. The people I've become friends with, the professors, the education and the opportunities have all been ""A+."" The benefits of everyone living on campus all 4 years, and the community that builds, are not understood by most who have not experienced it, but cannot be overstated."
Alum,5,"What a place to spend 4 years! The rich academic environment (intense, but in a good way), the amazing people you'll meet, and the beautiful campus and town make it unforgettable.  There's a reason why Amherst enjoys one of the highest levels of alumni support in the country!"
Sophomore,5,"Amherst is simply an amazing institution. The student body here is top notch academically, yet friendly, not cutthroat. The professors are genuinely available, almost 24/7, and have an interest in seeing their students succeed. Make no mistake, the academic environment is rigorous - for the most part the student body is made of of academic ""1%-ers,"" and the pace and expectation is what you'd expect from that.  
The town of Amherst is a quintessential beautiful Northeastern college town. 
People are super successful coming out of Amherst. The acceptances to top medical, law and other graduate schools each year is mind-blowing. Same with people going into finance/Wall Street. 
All in all, Amherst is a magical place to spend 4 years!"
Freshman,5,"As a freshman here at Amherst my experience has been nothing but wonderful. Although it has been a shock coming from Houston, Texas, I've acclimated quite well to this new atmosphere. There are a surprisingly large amount of things to do in such a small town and it's a short ways away from both New York and Boston--so the town never feels too small. Rumors about low food quality are false, I'd say it's about average. All the professors sincerely care about their students and I've learned so much in fields that I have a legitimate, vested interest in."
College Junior,5,"I would not be where I am not without these brilliant professors. They work as hard as the students, even harder, and do so much for the students. They make Amherst the fantastic place it is."
College Junior,5,"Alumni relations are so close, so eager to help students. Jobs and internships can definitely be found through the alumni network and the Career Center tries so hard to connect them."
College Sophomore,5,"Amherst has made a huge effort in the last decade or so to create a more diverse campus, and it's done a great job. Isolated incidents of intolerance are condemned by the whole student body and administration. Amherst is a place where you can meet and be friends with many kinds of people."
College Sophomore,5,"There's a huge variety of courses, and there's always more courses that I want to take than I can fit into my schedule. There's no gen-ed requirements, so you're pretty much always taking classes that you're really interested in. Professors are passionate and always happy to talk with you. Most classes are challenging, but you can get an A if you put the effort in."
College Freshman,5,"The Freshmen quad is amazing. It's beautiful, central and a great way to meet the peers in our class. Plus, all the freshmen dorms are nice inside as well."
College Junior,5,"I was accepted at my school as a transfer student from a community college, and it has been a super smooth and easy transition. The faculty at my school are so educated and welcoming. All of the students there have also been very welcoming to the other new transfers and myself. It is an amazing school academically, and it's also so small and beautiful. I love it there and I would definitely choose it again."
College Junior,5,"I feel like I'm really pushing the boundaries on my education and limits. I've learned so much about myself, and exceeded the skills I thought I had. It makes me real positive and excited for what the future holds for me."
College Freshman,5,"We're better than Williams, which is ranked #1, so technically we're #1. Enough said. 

In all seriousness, Amherst is a great school, with amazing students, professors, and staff. The academics are the best in the nation, and an Amherst degree will take you farther in life than any other college. As long as you take advantages of the opportunities here, you will love this school and leave a stronger, more globally aware and mature individual than when you entered."
College Freshman,5,"So far, Amherst has delivered a top notch experience academically. Professors are leading experts in their fields, small classes guarantee individual attention and engagement, and there is an abundance of classes to take every semester. The open curriculum allows students to explore new topics, while spending time in-depth with topics they are truly passionate about."
College Freshman,5,"A degree from Amherst is just as good if not better than a degree from a top Ivy league University. Students most commonly go into medicine, law, and finance after they graduate, and Amherst has vast resources and connections in these fields. Alumni are great mentors, and the career center does as much as it can to ensure Amherst students have ample internships to apply for and are adequately prepared for real world jobs."
College Freshman,5,"From what I have heard, Amherst attempts to meet the financial aid needs of as many students as possible. Many of my friends are on financial aid and would not be able to attend the school without their generous aid packages."
College Freshman,5,So far I've had a very positive experience!
College Freshman,5,"I got a two room double as a freshmen. I loved having my own space but also having a ""roommate."""
College Freshman,5,"All the majors generally have reasonable requirements, especially considering the open curriculum. As for internships, the Amherst Select program offers many summer-long programs around the country. It is a bit of a process to become a member (time consuming) but it should be worth it in the end. If the internship you get is unpaid and imposes a financial burden, you can apply for funding."
College Freshman,5,Amherst is a better education than any ivy.
College Freshman,5,I have never had an issue. AC police is great.
College Freshman,5,"As I said, academics are awesome."
College Freshman,5,"Professors are incredible - smart, supportive, loving human beings that you really want to get to know. 

The open curriculum is the best thing that ever happened. 

Workload is tough, but challenging in the best way."
College Freshman,5,"Psychology, and I love it."
College Freshman,5,"The Health and Counseling Center are awesome. Also, Amherst college insurance."
College Freshman,5,Amherst town is beautiful. Seriously. The entire area. Everything you could want is decently close by and if I could live here forever I probably would.
College Freshman,5,"Amherst is a place of incredible opportunity. The people are awesome, and despite everyone being super busy all the time, it's so worth it to take the time to spend with people. The professors are incredible, and there are just so many internship, study abroad, support and everything options. The people who complain mostly fail to reach out I would say - this college has everything you could ever want."
College Freshman,5,"Can't really say anything, but people in it generally love it."
College Freshman,5,"All need-based, generous, and so many support programs and additional funds if you need them. 

It can be a hassle to deal with Financial Aid, but just because they want to do their job thoroughly."
College Freshman,5,"Amherst's academics are awesome. I will probably major in Psychology, and so far I am loving my classes. Everything is fast-paced and very intense, everything is discussed, and classes are for thinking rather than for learning the material. We are expected to be prepared, and it's awesome to have such a high standard. That being said, there are so many support services available - The Q center, writing center, professors, study groups... Don't hesitate to go there; they are all great."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm looking into investment banking right now, and surprisingly, Amherst is actually a great school for that kind of thing. For starters, the alumni network is extremely strong and enthusiastic (if you email random alumni on the website directory, you'll probably get upwards of a 50%+ response rate). And most major banks actually do on-campus recruiting at Amherst, which is a godsend."
College Sophomore,5,"It's been terrific. The open curriculum makes everything so easy-- I never have to worry about taking required classes, and the flexibility I have in creating my schedule is ridiculous. Most of the classes are reasonably small, although there are exceptions (cough econ). The professors are always very helpful and accessible."
College Sophomore,5,"People complain about the administration, but honestly, they're quite lenient with everyone."
College Sophomore,5,"I don't feel insecure, if that's what you're wondering. It's a very safe neighborhood, and the campus police are nice guys."
College Sophomore,5,Very accepting and tolerant campus community.
College Sophomore,5,People come from so many backgrounds that it teaches tolerance from everybody's standpoint.  You can't judge because you can easily be judged by being different yourself.  It is amazing to learn and live in an environment like this.
College Sophomore,5,"all greek life students are well mannered individuals that take part in many aspects of the Amherst scene including but not limited to: student government, social life, athletics, and many other leadership roles."
College Sophomore,5,towns folk are very accommodating and kind to us college students.
College Sophomore,5,they do their best to help out the students. they make sure that we answer all of the required topics and assist us as best they can.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel safer on campus then I at home. With the constant police presence and the various protection measures in place, I feel safe and sound walking around at night alone."
College Sophomore,5,"almost everyone shows up to the games, if they're not bogged down with work. Team's do amazingly well, and are able to perform at their best while also doing well in their academic endeavors."
College Freshman,5,"Since Amherst has an open curriculum, all of its programs are very flexible. Even if you've already chosen a specific major, you'll never overburdened with work from that particular major-- in fact, for most majors, you'll never need to take more than 2 classes for that major per semester (out of 4)."
Niche User,4,"The beginning portion of my experience at Amherst college (orientation) started less engaging and felt prolonged. As I proceeded to the actual tour portion, I began to enjoy it greatly. The campus was small, but very diverse, welcoming, and homey. I’m looking forward to another visit. During the tour there was little emphasis on sports life, but much on subjects such as research internship opportunities."
Freshman,4,"Amherst college has a great academic environment with small classes and professors that are fully engaged and love their students. It is in a small town, but with the surrounding area and five college consortium, you can find tons of things to do."
Niche User,4,"Our tour guide was well trained. He waited for someone to leave the dorms to have them tell the group what the best thing was about Amherst. The Dean was very intelligent and knowledgeable and gave a great information session presentation to the group. It is a small liberal arts college which is academically based and hard to get into. A mini Harvard that was scaled down. A shuttle transports you to the other 5 colleges connected with Amherst (University of Massachusetts-Amherst, Smith College, Mount-Holyoke College and Hampshire College). If accepted into any one of these colleges, you can attend classes, sports, activities at any of these colleges if they offer something that you are interested in. A nice feature to have offered because all of a sudden there is a larger area of interest, sports and activities to choose from. Making it almost impossible not to have something that you are looking for or interested in which can happen at small schools with limited choices."
Sophomore,4,The small environment allows you to meet a lot of people on campus and build close relationships with your professors.
Senior,4,"I have loved my time at Amherst.  Professors go above and beyond to help their students, something that happens because of the small size of the school. Most classes don't have TAs, which means office hours and review sessions are held directly with the professors. Upper-level classes can have fewer than 30 people, which I have found to be a great environment for challenging yourself and growing academically. As a liberal arts college, Amherst also teaches you HOW to think, rather than just what to think. The school is also very helpful with outside opportunities. The alumni network is incredibly supportive, especially for mentoring or networking. I was able to receive funding from the school for my unpaid summer internship, and they also provide research funds for many students. Since there are no graduate students at Amherst, all lab, research, and work opportunities with professors can start early on in your academic career."
Junior,4,"I love Amherst. It’s definitely small and rural, so you have to be prepared to find most of your social life on campus itself. But if you’re ready for that, the academics are great, professors are helpful, people are wonderful, and campus is beautiful! The financial aid packages are amazing, because Amherst intentionally makes the hard part gaining admission—not paying!"
Senior,4,"I enjoyed my time here, but the social scene is changing and the school is becoming much more strict. I think the reason I was able to enjoy my time here is because I experienced the ""old Amherst"" in  my early years. I have a brother who is an incoming freshman and I told him not to attend Amherst. People are becoming more and more unhappy at Amherst."
Alum,4,The small class sizes allowed me to work closely with professors. The athletic department supported my development as a student-athlete and leader on campus and in the community.
Alum,4,"Overall a good experience. Pros: academics, nice campus, lots of resources. Cons:  very rural, preppy, some dorms are old, food is ok."
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe on campus -- no matter what time of day or night. The police are very kind and understanding; they really try to understand the students and any issues they come upon. Cannot comment upon health -- I haven't used the health center, but I've heard disappointing things."
College Junior,4,"I decided to not go through room draw - I went for a theme house, specifically the Russian floor in Porter House. It was great -- huge, spacious rooms, a bit away from the center of campus, very close to town. Walls were a bit thin, I got used to sleeping in earphones because of floormates walking around at night. Very great place, otherwise."
College Junior,4,"Amherst is an active, inspiring, curious place. The people all want so much more from life and are willing to do all to achieve that. Very active minds. Conversations can go in a billion different directions and it makes life at the college so interesting."
College Freshman,4,Amherst is a quiet place in general and there's not a lot going on that could harm me.
College Freshman,4,The professors are very enthusiastic and very qualified.
College Freshman,4,People in the New England area know Amherst and hold it in high esteem.
College Freshman,4,We have a great football team and there's a lot of emphasis and health and well-being.
College Freshman,4,Everybody here is super enthusiastic and so bright.
College Sophomore,4,"Alcohol is widely consumed. Weed is used by some students regularly and many students occasionally. Other drugs are used by a small amount of students and are generally not seen by the general population and will probably not be offered to you, although, on such a small campus, you can find them if you're trying."
College Sophomore,4,"The alumni network is very strong and many students utilize it to help find internships and post-graduation jobs. Pretty much everyone I know who has graduated has had a job, grad school or some other plan lined up by the end of the year."
College Sophomore,4,"Our sports are very good, often winning national/conference championships, but games are typically not very well attended. I get the sense that people generally only go if they have a friend on the team or if it's a particularly important game (NESCAC finals, Williams game, homecoming). Socially, being on a team, varsity or club (particularly frisbee and crew), is generally very helpful, and a lot of teams seem to exclusively socialize with themselves or other athletes, leading to what some call an athlete-nonathlete divide. There's definitely certain areas of campus that are seen as where athletes hang out, or where athletes live. It will be interesting to see if the demolition of the Socials and decrease of suite-style housing will do anything to bridge that divide. On the administrative side, there's definitely been complaints about lack of funding for club and intramural sports, in which a lot of people participate, particularly when it comes to field time. Club sports are administered and funded by the student government, but people seem to think it would be better to consolidate all athletic activities under the athletic department. Overall, though, Amherst has many opportunities for students to get involved in sports at different levels, and it is easy to start a new intramural league for anything that isn't already available."
College Sophomore,4,"Not everything that I expected, especially socially, but I definitely feel that I'm getting an excellent education."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful, it's FAR, far away from where I used to live (Seoul, Korea), and all the students and professors are so immersed in what they love to learn. I absolutely love it! However, there have been a few issues where the administration hasn't dealt well with students suffering from mental disabilities or other illnesses."
College Sophomore,4,"I love Amherst College with it's ups and downs. The professors are amazing and the open curriculum makes the whole ""finding yourself"" experience even better. However, if you are in minority student, affinity groups (like the black students union, the queer resource center, the international students club, etc) will be very important to your survival. Social life here at Amherst is largely run by upper middle-class white male athletes and the hook-up culture which can be very uncomfortable and weird (especially in such a small college). However when find a solid group of friends, those struggles will be minimized."
College Freshman,4,"Locals are very friendly and businesses always welcome students. However, without a car, your shopping and food options are limited to the town of Amherst and the stops along the PVTA bus line. Amherst is a typical small town with a great charm to it, but if you're from a large city, you may not find the town meets your needs or expectations."
College Freshman,4,Campus crime is low and the campus is safe to walk around at all times of day. Campus police and ACEMS actively patrol the campus and are always available to help students in need.
College Freshman,4,"Sports play an integral role at Amherst, with the majority of the student body engaged in some sort of team sport and the social scene being dominated by athletes. Many Amherst teams excel in Division 3 competitions, and school spirit is high, especially against Williams and at Homecoming. Athletic facilities for both athletes and non-athletes are well maintained and easily accessible."
College Freshman,4,"The town of Amherst, only a few minutes walk from the main campus, has a decent selection of restaurants that have their own charm and are surprisingly good. There is everything from Subway to locally owned Vietnamese restaurants, and you can never go wrong with Antonio's pizza. My only complaint is that late-night food options are basically non-existent and some restaurants are incredibly overpriced for rural Massachusetts."
College Freshman,4,"First-year housing is excellent, both facilities and location wise. After freshman year however, it's a bit of a toss-up when it comes to housing. The room draw process is archaic and flawed, and if your room draw group is at the bottom of your grade's list (as was mine), you're stuck with either a slum of a dorm, a dorm fifteen minutes away from campus, or you can try your luck opting out. On the other end of the spectrum, if you get a solid room draw spot, the dorms you get to choose from are in pretty good condition."
College Freshman,4,"Housing is great for freshman, however, off campus housing is non-existent."
College Freshman,4,if you're not on a sports team you are sool
College Freshman,4,the majors give you a lot of options to choose from
College Freshman,4,Some dorms are better than others but overall good
College Freshman,4,People are generally smart and really interesting. A lot of people look different than they are; make an effort to talk to people who look different from your typical social group.
College Freshman,4,"This campus is very diverse in every sense except for political. The vast majority of people are very liberal. You will be fine as a more conservative person, but you will need to justify your beliefs a lot. Every other minority will be fine :)"
College Freshman,4,"Amherst itself has a number of nice places, even if they are on the pricey side. Every place is good, really. 

For more alternative options, Northhampton is the place to go."
College Freshman,4,"I have not had any problems. Many students don't really talk to the administration and just complain about them. However, they are always available and willing to listent to students concerns. Some changes maybe don't take place as quickly as students would like to, but you can't build a house from the roof down."
College Freshman,4,"Well, I don't party, and I get by just fine. 

For the students who do however, the socials and theme houses always put on parties, as does the Campus Acitvity dorms. The new powerhouse significantly improved the nightlife by giving students a classy, safe location to dance and have fun."
College Freshman,4,"Honestly - the first year dorms are awesome. I also love all of the theme houses, and although some of them are a little run-down, the community is great. The sophomore dorms are awesome too, so are King and Wieland. The Socials are the Socials, but as they will be torn down they are being replaced with beautiful new dorms."
College Sophomore,4,There is tons of variety in such a short distance.  The main street of our small town is a block off main campus.  There are ethnic and healthy options as well as the traditional pizza and sports bar establishments.
College Sophomore,4,Science buildings are the only ones that are outdated.
College Sophomore,4,Plenty of authentic ethnic foods!
College Sophomore,4,"Internships are like 15-30 hours a week, getting paid above minimum wage.  They'll last for a few to several weeks.  The professionals are so kind to us during the internship.  Everybody learns alot from them."
College Sophomore,4,"The hardest part is probably finding the internship.  There are so many out there but its like ""where do I begin?""  Career advisors and professors should aid in that department.  As far as applying, be as candid as possible.  Your grades, interests, activities, and the like will do the talking for you and they will be impressed.  If you don't get selected, just think about how genius the people that actually did get selected are and don't feel discouraged."
College Sophomore,4,"The people are not the most objectively attractive but they are some of the smartest and most interesting you'll find.  Athletes do keep to their own but everybody else are the friendliest, coolest people out there.  People get along very well and are always respectful."
College Sophomore,4,People like to complain but they're just spoiled.  The food is great and better than what many schools serve.
College Sophomore,4,"freshman dorms are immaculate, but upperclassmen dorms are lacking. thankfully they are revamping some of the old buildings because sophomores get screwed in the housing lottery system."
College Sophomore,4,"just don't get below a b-, that's all. it's totally doable to get into any major of your choice, just do better in your favorite classes and let the others suffer a bit if need be."
College Sophomore,4,I feel as if there is a gap between the different races and ethnicities on campus. They seem to congeal together and don't venture out of their created friend groups based on their homeland.
College Senior,4,The diversity is a major plus.
College Freshman,4,"It is surprisingly easy to rent out a campus shuttle. Just sign up and register your driver's license, and you'll get to use the school's vans for absolutely free. The public bus system in the town is free for college students, as well."
College Freshman,4,"All of the buildings at Amherst are great. Some of them are older than others, but none of these ""flaws"" are actually noticeably unless you really, really look for it. Overall, the campus is just really, really nice."
College Freshman,4,"Housing varies wildly from dorm to dorm. All of the first-year dorms are terrific, though of course, some are still noticeably better than others. Since Amherst is a pretty small college, pretty much every dorm is near your classes (the farthest you'll have to walk will never be more than 10-15 minutes)."
College Freshman,4,"Word of advice: always use a wired ethernet connection to get internet whenever you can. The WiFi coverage on Amherst's campus is terrific, but compared to a good wired connection, the WiFi here is pretty darn slow. 

Life will be much easier if you own your own laptop, but there are plenty of computer labs spread throughout the campus, should you need them. Compared to the relatively small size of the college, the main computer lab in Frost Library is actually quite large-- there will always be a computer available if you need one."
College Student,4,It's overall great. The dorms are nice and spacious. Room draw process is kind of random.
College Student,4,There are a lot of computers available. Printing on campus is pretty easy except that you have to pay (although not too much). Wireless is kind of slow. I own a personal computer and printer but plenty of people don't.
College Freshman,4,"The school is small and so cannot offer everything, but for its size Amherst has a very good selection"
College Sophomore,4,"Amherst itself is a small town, so there aren't a huge umber of restaurants, but what's there is very good. Judie's is the place to go for popovers when your parents/guardians are around to foot the bill, and Antonio's has $1 cheese pizza slices after midnight on weekends, as well as their famous chicken-bacon-ranch pizza. For a lot more options, Northampton's easy to get to."
College Sophomore,4,"Public transportation is really convenient at Amherst. The PVTA, which is the local bus, is free for students and provides a quick way to get to UMass, as well as the shopping center that has supermarkets, a movie theater, and other sorts of stores. In terms of getting to/from airports and major cities, the Peter Pan bus runs relatively cheap nonstop buses to Boston and NYC on the weekends, and the school student association will sometimes charter free buses to the cities on holidays."
College Sophomore,4,"The computer labs at Amherst are spread throughout campus so it's not too hard to find a computer. The only problem with the computer labs is that they usually get very crowded right before classes start because everyone's in a rush to print out lecture notes or papers before class. Other than that, it's usually pretty easy to find a computer on campus. However, it's definitely much more convenient to have a laptop than to solely rely on the school computers."
College Sophomore,4,"Housing is guaranteed for all four years, which means everyone lives on campus for the most part. The different dorms have different characteristics, so it's pretty easy to find what suits you (i.e., suite-style living, singles, doubles, etc.). Freshman housing is across the board good to great, and then after that it all depends on your spot in the housing lottery."
Freshman,2,"Everyone here is selfish. There is no other way to describe it. They always talk about  wanting to have deep conversations about pressing matters but only listen to others that believe the same things as they do. Anyone with differing opinions, specifically conservatives, get talked over or even yelled at. People here are willing to be inclusive with everyone; from people who identify as a toaster over, to people that have names with variable letters. This is great, I love this inclusivity but the second someone talks about a more traditional conservative view, they are ostracized almost immediately. I was super excited to come to Amherst so I could get a degree form one of the best schools in the country and play some competitive D3 football, but now I just wanna go home and look elsewhere for an education."
College Sophomore,2,too much drinking   it is not positive at all
College Sophomore,2,too much   drinking
College Freshman,2,"Following the trustees' resolution to ban fraternities, Greek life is technically non-existent, but there are still remnants of fraternities if you look hard enough."
College Freshman,2,It is pretty bad all around unless you have a good group of friends.
College Sophomore,2,"It's pretty tame around here, and parties get a little repetitive. There are 21+ bars and clubs, particularly in Northampton, but for most of your undergrad life you won't be able to get into the fun ones. School-wide parties thrown by student organizations are generally the best, since everyone comes and there's great music. UMass is really easy to get to and has large parties, but it's only easy to go if you know someone there. A lot of parties take place in the socials, but honestly these are not great. A lot of really drunk kids in a very small space with bad music- if this is your scene, perfect. If not, and you love to party, you probably want to go somewhere else."
Freshman,1,This place is a prison. They do not care about your mental health and only care about the almuni donating money
Freshman,1,This place is terrible online classes are uninteresting and makes it tough to learn. They jusy assign work
Works Here,1,Elitist school for elitist kids. Not at all an intellectually stimulating place because it’s full of the worst kind of privileged students. The admin cares too much about rankings and not about students.
Works Here,1,"Racist, elitist college full of white boys in polo shirts. A great liberal arts school but full of snobs. The small group of low income and poc students struggle on campus. Several other LACS do a better job at diversity than Amherst does, and even recently there was a racism incident on campus. If you like Amherst, check out equally good but more diverse/less elitist schools. Campus is pretty but is designed quite poorly. Buildings are lack luster. Male athletics is the vibe on campus. The town is dreary and dingy and too far from any big city."
Niche User,1,"Terrible, small snobby, school. Faculty is not as supportive and nurturing as they want you to believe. If you're a minority or nontraditional student don't expect support. They're just checking boxes by accepting you. Once you get there you're on your own to sink or swim. They work hard to make it seem like a paradise though. They try to minimize bad press so they can get good applications. Too small for it's own good. It's like living in a fish bowl. Very cliquish. If you weren't one of the popular ones in high school navigating this social minefield will be the biggest challenge of your life. Everyone thinks they're gods gift to humanity. Academics are okay but nothing special. Education ultimately is what you make of it. You might think you're awesome for going here but in real life no one knows wtf Amherst is and no one cares. Visit, ask questions, do your research and try not to be taken in by the rankings alone. I had a good life before I ever knew the name Amherst."
College Sophomore,1,"Amherst College no longer has official/off-campus-but-still-open-to-the-administration Greek life. There are a couple underground frats which still live together and throw parties, and their membership is generally known to most students, but they have no official events or organization. It's unclear how long they will last with this status. There are no sororities. Recently, a pilot program of five social clubs have been founded. These are basically co-ed fraternities that are directly controlled/funded by the college. The aim of these is to provide more social options for Amherst students and encourage students to meet people outside of particular interest/activity groups (BSU, GAP, orchestra, sports teams) while not letting them develop the apparent exclusivity of the former fraternities. Time will tell if these clubs improve social life at Amherst or just further increase the way that students here tend to categorize themselves and ignore potential relationships outside their existing groups."
College Sophomore,1,it is not available except in underground which is grounds for expulsion
College Freshman,1,"Compared to other colleges, the party scene at Amherst is atrocious. The trustees' resolution banning fraternities combined with the scheduled demolition of the social dormitories guarantees there will be no party scene at Amherst within the next few years. I am thoroughly perplexed by the administration's decisions: the Amherst social scene has been on a steady decline for the last decade, and they have done nothing to fix it other than to build the mediocre Powerhouse, which has had no real effect other than limiting the party scene to 2am. Furthermore, Saturday night is really the only night worth going out on, and even then, there are some Saturdays where there is literally nothing going on. I actually pity future Amherst classes that will have absolutely no options for partying. Parties are an integral part of college life and provide an important outlet for stress; if the administration does not figure something out in the coming years, parties will cease to exist. Do not come to this school if you are looking forward to partying in college because you will be thoroughly disappointed."
College Sophomore,1,"buildings aren't very well taken care of, ratty and don't have very good parking."
College Senior,1,The social life here is truly awful.
College Freshman,1,"Nobody really lives off-campus. The college guarantees housing, and it only allows 50 people to live off-campus each year anyways."
College Sophomore,1,"98% of Amherst students live on-campus. Off-campus housing exists, but it's usually for students with special conditions or situations. It's available, but usually not worth it. Practically everyone just lives in dorms."

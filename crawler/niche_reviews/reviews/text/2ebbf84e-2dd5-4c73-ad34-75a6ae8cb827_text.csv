Junior,5,I have taken classes online. They are easy to navigate. They are great about responding when someone has a question.
Junior,5,I like how the teachers care about the students and want them to succeed. I hope in the future it can become a four year college.
Graduate Student,5,"Kaskaskia College gives great online learning! The professors are very flexible with the students and willing to work with whomever. When there are technical problems, there is always staff to help assist!"
Alum,5,"Literally, as perfect as a college will ever get. Helpful staff, excellent faculty, and flawless administration. If you're going to go to college, please, at least start at KC if you have the chance."
Freshman,5,"My experience was amazing. I was very comfortable in the building and around the students. Also, most of my friends are attending KC so that is pretty awesome."
Freshman,5,"Kaskaskia College has been a very inspiring experience for me. As an education major, seeing all of the professors on campus care for the students and provide the help and encouragement they need makes me want to become a teacher even more."
Sophomore,5,Everyone is always friendly. There is always someone there to help you when you need it. I always feel comfortable going up to any adult on the campus and asking for help. I am not sure that there is much that I would change. The Kaskaskia College faculty is like family to me. I have a good relationship with a ton of teachers and administration.
Freshman,5,I love the college! Great student life. Many opportunities. The staff is friendly and easy to work with.
Freshman,5,I love that all of the professors are here to help you succeed and to come better. They all see the potential in their students and will stop at nothing to help them succeed. Their music program is incredibly wonderful and supportive. Kaskaskia College programs help teams build together and bond like a family. This campus has a wonderful system for all things. They even have “student activities” groups to involve all students and they have very many cool events that brings everyone together. I can’t say I would want anything about this college to change.
Niche User,5,"KC has a safe, friendly atmosphere on campus or off, as well as online classes. The instructors are knowledgeable and always helpful."
Freshman,5,"As an online student, I find that Kaskaskia College suits my needs. I've only been to the campus a few times to purchase books, however all the faculty are very friendly and helpful. The teachers are nice and some are strict. Blackboard was a little complicated to use, however as I've been using it, it has become fairly simple.
My ratings are based on what I have experienced as an Online Student. I know they have dorms, but I have never been to them. I don't know how diverse the student body is, or how bad the campus food is."
Sophomore,5,I love this college the teachers are so understanding and smart. They are willing to stay over to make sure you're understanding the class. If I could change anything I wouldn't the college is amazing.
Sophomore,5,"Kaskaskia College is a high standard for a junior college. They have lots of classes to off, teachers are great, and campus is very nice. The athletic program has many choices for young athletes, on top of a great education. I myself am in the nursing program and I can’t say enough great things about it. Kaskaskia also offers online classes to accommodate the student life schedule."
Sophomore,5,Very personal professors and small classes! I've always been able to ask questions and feel like they are genuinely trying to help!
Alum,5,Great teachers and student life. Great athletics. Not a very big area. Wonderful facilities. Great community
Freshman,5,Love My Cosmo Professors. They work with me so on course projects and give extra time students when needed.
Freshman,5,"I love the small campus and being close to home. I think the teachers are amazing at their job, because they teach similar to how the surrounding high schools teach but at a college level. I think that Kaskaskia College could improve on their lab materials, ex. have more microscopes and samples."
Freshman,5,Everyone at the college is very friendly and helpful. I've had no issues with anyone getting me assistance and finding what I need.
College Sophomore,5,Kaskaskia is known for their nursing program.  When the employers see that you went to this college you are more likely to be hired on.  This college is highly ranked for their medical program.  It is highly ranked because teachers make sure all students known their roles as a nurse everything there is to know about their field.  All students are extremely well equipped and prepared to handle any situation that they may be involved in while they are in the real world.
College Senior,5,Graduating with a cosmetology degree from KC practically guarantees you a job a job anywhere you want to be.
Graduate Student,4,"Kaskaskia College is a great school to be enrolled in right after high school. It is a great way to complete the general classes before transferring to a 4-year college. I am so grateful for the teachers, staff, and communication this college has! I loved going there and completing some of my classes early!"
Sophomore,4,This school was a blessing for me. The academics taught here are at a very high standard. The teachers I have worked with have all been super helpful in me trying to find my career path. The president and administrative team are consistent in wanting to better the growth and development of each student on campus.
Freshman,4,"I really like many of the teachers at the school. They are all very helpful and take their time with each student. The students are all friendly and talkative, and also help each other out i.e. study groups/ group me."
Sophomore,4,Overall my experience at KC was great. The only down to my school is the financial aid department. They are clueless and make basic tasks a challenge
Sophomore,4,The only thing I really did not like was how little they offered in the education centers in surrounding communities and online.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy attending Kaskaskia. I have attended other schools and I feel I have gained most of my knowledge from there. It is a small school, so instructors have more time to help with class questions. They truly want to make sure you succeed. They offer great competitive programs."
College Sophomore,4,"The advisers make sure you know which classes you need for you major to graduate.  That way you do not waste your time taking classes that will not count towards your degree. They provide you with a print of all the classes you will need to graduate.  They go over the classes with you so know what to expect with the workload.  They help you pick your classes for the semester that way you do not get overwhelmed if you pick classes that have a lot of coursework in them.  They set up a  student orientation so you know your way around campus and do not get lost your first week on campus.  Classes of a specific major are kept together that way you do not have to run around the entire campus trying to get to all your classes. The classes are small that way you feel comfortable with asking for help if you need it and so the teacher can work with students one on one.  Classes being small also, help with letting the teachers and students to get to know each other and hlp one another.  Teachers and advisers make sure you have all the materials you need to succeed in your specific major; including setting up tutoring if its needed.  They have a success center where students can go and work on their resume and get help creating one if needed."
College Sophomore,4,The staff does everything in their to make sure that you are able to attend classes as soon as possible.  They make sure that you understand the class so you do not struggle or feel like you can not do it.
College Senior,4,"Kaskaskia College offer morning afternoon and evening courses. If you have trouble planning and being organized, their is a program called TRIO that offer assistance throughout your education period at the school. They have special workshops for daily life activities such as eating healthy, staying organized, and time management. The are a great help if you need guidance and help throughout the year. All of my credits will transfer to the school I plan on attending. Most credits transfer to most school. Kaskaskia has certain degree programs that are linked with a couple of surrounding universities. The academic advisers are very helpful with choosing the correct courses for you. If you have trouble with certain classes, they offer tutors in the student center who are great at their job."
College Senior,4,"The website for online courses is pretty easy to use. All freshmen have to take a guideline course for the website.  Some courses use other websites for their homework. Depending on the course, online courses can be relatively difficult due to the fact you have to do independent study. It is easy to communicate with the teachers and other students if needed."
College Senior,4,"Classes are pretty small so it is easy to stay focused and creates a good learning environment. Most of my professors are relatively good teachers. They teach you what they want to know and are good at helping when it is needed. The professors are reasonable and understanding. Though if you do not meet them halfway, they will have less of an obligation to help you. There are plenty of courses to choose from. Some courses even offer certificates are associates degrees in them. Most of the courses are helpful with your major. They help you to give a better understanding of your career of interest."
College Senior,4,"Overall, Kaskaskia College is a great place to start you off towards a better education. The faculty are helpful and are willing to work with you as long as you are putting in the effort. The classes are relatively small which allow the teachers to communicate with you better and to establish a connection with the students. If you like small schools and want good education I would recommend Kaskaskia College. Their sports are also a big part of why Kaskaskia would be a good place to go. They have several men's and women's teams who have a pretty good athletic record. Just recently, however, Kaskaskia has had to make budget cuts due to the government not funding the school. There will be no more student employees which they had offered previously. Though they do have a site that will help you locate jobs around you."
College Sophomore,4,I have had a great experience so far.  The flexibility of taking online classes until the program I want starts in the Fall has been a blessing.
College Sophomore,4,I love my online classes!  They give me the freedom to learn at my own pace.
College Sophomore,4,There are work studies around the campus to help students meet financial needs.
College Sophomore,4,"Since my classes are online, I don't see my professors. However anytime I have had an issue and emailed them, they have been very quick to respond and get me back on track.  I think they have my best interest as a student at hand.  They want us to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"After high school I took a year off, and then started college.  Due to hardships, I had to end up quitting college and getting a job.  Now here I am 13 years later going back to the same college!  I would say that community college left a good impression on me or I wouldn't have thought it was possible to go back so late in the game."
College Senior,4,"I learn so much hands on, but I do feel like my specific class grades on petty things"
College Senior,4,I really like the school. Everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. It is a diverse campus.
College Junior,4,Everyone is very helpful and explains anything you do not understand and will work your school schedule around ur life as a single parent to what best suits your schedule which was a big thing for me as a single parent with limited babysitters.
College Sophomore,4,All of the professors are welcoming and there to help you understand and make you better.
College Sophomore,4,"I can always count on coming to a center and being able to work on my assignments in a good manner. Having all the necessary equipment to do so. If I have ever had a problem, the staff is always there to help me threw it."
College Sophomore,4,The academic advisers are always available  to help plan out the next move to fit the person's needs.
College Sophomore,4,My program consists of a 72 credit hours maximum spaced out over 4 semesters. Some of the classes require you to be accepted into the program to take while others are general.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is friendly and most of us grew up together and went to the same high schools. It's not a very diverse selection of students.
College Sophomore,4,The campus has a great gym and walking/running trail. The student center is very user-friendly. I find the library to be one of my favorite parts of campus. The food could use some work in vegetarian selections.
College Sophomore,4,My professors kept me well informed through email and the school's online class system. We could discuss topics with peers and professors as we needed.
College Sophomore,4,I like meeting some new students that have they same challenges in life.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't had a lot of online classes, however I'm looking forward to understanding the computer more and more so I don't have to learn by trial and error."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers and guidance councilors help tremendously when I am trying to continuously go back to school for medical coding and billing.
College Senior,4,It is so great to be able to have the option of acquiring help with financial aid. I am a single mother and there's no way hat without the help I'd be perusing a career in nursing or much less a career at all. It is a great gift and opportunity that is unexplainable with words.
College Senior,4,"They have several computers available to students in the library, as well as a few other computer labs as a choice also. Printers available free of cost (within reason) to all students.  I think it is great In That aspect given the fact that there are always ways to ensure you can comets your Assignments everyday even if you do not personally own a computer with internet access."
College Senior,4,"I honestly only know about their plays being a pretty big hit, but the school and students always have as sort of project or experiment going on. They are pretty active I'm their sports carp gory As well.  Several of the students that attend KC are there through sport scholarships.  Also a large percentage of the students seem to participating in at least one extra curricular activity if not several more.  In my opinion the resources at KC are never ending as well as in most cases quite creative as well."
College Senior,4,I raised my high school GPA from a 3.3 to a 3.6
College Senior,4,it was the right choice to start off at community college
College Senior,4,I have a great school schedule
College Freshman,4,The process has been easy and nothing has been difficut.
College Freshman,4,They made sure that I had no worries finacnially. 
College Freshman,4,Its a good school and the teachers are wonderful. It was just not my first choice to go to a community college.
College Freshman,4,They work hard at making it possible for students to have the best learning experience possible.
College Senior,4,Everyone seems very friendly and usually knows your situations.
College Senior,4,The education is great for the price
College Senior,4,"The curriculum that Kaskaskia College has to offer is great. It is a great college to get your general education in or you could even major in any of the programs (cosmotology, automotive, PTA, etc.) All the counselors are easy to work with. The teachers are very understanding and helpful. I do feel that some of the classes workload is a little much and others there is not enough. Overall it is a great place to start a college experience."
College Junior,4,"K.C has many free services like WiFi which is very helpful when doing homework or other task.  They also have a free gym and workout room, which makes working out so much easier.  Overall they have many resources, all of them are very great and I wouldn't change anything about them."
College Junior,4,"K.C. has a great gym on campus, with many training program options.  When looking for sport options K.C. has many including baseball, basketball, tennis, and soccer.  Over all, K.C. is a college of many opertunities and if you work hard you will succeed."
College Senior,4,It's very affordable compared to other Community Colleges.
College Senior,4,"The online course website has a 24-hour tech support group to help with technical issues. Textbooks for every class are available and at reasonable prices. There are several amazing clubs to join and always something to do on campus, like the fitness center and fitness trail or watching TV and playing games in the student center. Students can also work on-campus."
College Junior,4,The course-work is pretty easy but time management is a must.  It is very easy to forget to turn in assignments.
College Junior,4,the school offers the right courses for my major at the college
College Junior,4,some of the students seem to think they are better than thou and have attitudes even though we are all there to do the same thing which is to learn. I feel we should all be equal----young and middle-aged to old
College Junior,4,they offer a variety of academics that are plainly excellent
College Junior,4,wireless access is very good and available at any given time
College Junior,4,generally the campus has the all around needs fulfilled from the library to the computer lab
College Junior,4,I feel this is one of the best two year colleges in the state of IL. The teachers are very knowledgable and willing to help if you are having trouble with any subjects. The guidance counsellor has helped me greatly with registration and financial aid.
College Junior,4,I chose Kaskaskia College is because I live so close to the school and its the only college that is close to me that has a Culinary Arts program. That is the degree I am achieving.
College Senior,4,"Academic Experience – So far, I have enjoyed my classes.  I'm excited about the program.  There will be a lot of hours put in, but it will be worth it in the long run.  There will be a lot of studying and memorizing, but in order to be successful upon completion, it is more than necessary.  The facilities are very up to date.  When finished with the program, I will be able to work in a hospital or doctor's office anywhere in the United States."
College Senior,4,"Studen Diversity – There is a vast range of diversity at Kaskaskia College.  There is a wide range of ages of students as well as backgrounds.  It's difficult to describe a typical student because there are so many differences.  However, the majority are young people who are looking to better their career options in the economy we presently live in."
College Senior,4,"I think it awesome how I can got to a community college closer to my residence. The program seems like it is going to very hard, but it only for a year. I like that it is only three semesters."
College Senior,4,"I like how the college allows you to take different courses at campuses that are closer to my residence. I also like how most things such as forms, etc are done online."
College Junior,4,Happy With It – My school is perfect for me in the past. I had no idea what i wanted to do with my life so it helped to take classes and figure out what i was interested in without the cost of an expensive 4-year.
Niche User,2,"The teachers I had when I attended KC were all wonderful. There is little to no diversity and the only things the school is recognized for is it's agriculture and nursing programs, leaving the arts with little to no funding. It is very affordable, especially if you are still undecided of your career path and just want to work on Gen Eds. The school mirrors the area surrounding it, its just a little to boring for me."
College Senior,2,I cant really think of any uniqueness of the school except that people there are nice.
College Senior,2,"There have been sevearl issues with the school systems, including the one for classes, and the one for student connection.  As for computer use, good luck. Either your battling for a computer at the lab, or the mac you need to use is never free.  Its almost a guarantee."
College Sophomore,2,"Although I do believe that our school is very nice and clean we do not have many extras at our center. The only recource on campus is the computer lab, which is open to the public."
College Junior,2,"Campus Life – I like attending Kaskaskia College, but I would have loved to have a better experience. I feel as if I'm just a number here, not a college student. They have a poor graduation rate, and I don't want to be associated with that. I'm currently in the process of transferring school. The teachers are wonderful at Kaskaskia and the students are friendly. I've had a poor experience with the financial aid advisor and the academic advisor."
College Freshman,2,"Rate Kc – The aid office employees were somewhat helpful.  Although I wasn't approved for aid, i asked where else i could get help, they didn't give me much help.  Her best answer was get a private loan at your bank!!"
College Senior,1,"Hardly any interaction, the program is a pain to use, and if instructors arent consistent with due dates, you tend to fall behind quick. I really would choose in person if I could."
College Junior,1,"You're supposed to be able to take the courses you want in college. I went to register for my Spring classes and the advisor told me I couldn't take the classes I wanted, that I had to take what was available. I knew the classes I wanted to take were available. I was lied to."

Sophomore,5,Awesome place with great people! I love my professors and being able to go to in person labs. U of I is a great place to learn about agriculture and food and how the world gets fed.
Senior,5,"Usually the online classes are all through BBLearn just like the online content for in person classes.
We have been using MHConnect for HyFlex classes during covid. It's gone really well.
The University of Idaho has handled the pandemic in the best way I have seen from any university. We just got a new president before this and I am really proud of the strong leadership he has demonstrated.

Online classes are great here too."

Students are friendly, creative, and driven, and I find it easy to make friends because I relate to many of my peers! The professors and faculty are all very personal and are motivated to further your learning. What's more, the Moscow community is very active and creative. There are countless opportunities to support local artists, creators, and producers through the weekly Saturday Farmer's Market events, going to art shows, or buying books or plays by local authors or playwrights at the various bookstores! The town is safe, and the university is lively and fun. I absolutely love this school!"
Junior,5,I love Idaho and got involved with greek life right away which made it easier to find more friends on campus and start my new life with new people by my side.
Sophomore,5,"Being a student at the University of Idaho gave me the opportunity to invest in myself and my future pursuits in a fun and determined atmosphere. Our campus is very supportive and engaging with its students, I never felt alone or misunderstood. The campus and its students are very friendly and welcoming, it was the perfect place for me to take my first steps at leaving childhood and entering adulthood."
Junior,5,"I really enjoy the University of Idaho and what it has to offer. With COVID being an issue I am still thankful they are offering face-to-face classes on campus. Most things that I've heard from friends have also been very positive about the school, staff, and the city of Moscow too. Great value school!"
Junior,5,"Personally, I have not taken any classes online through the University of Idaho. Although, I'm sure they do a great job of getting information across and making sure students are still being well educated."
Senior,5,Great class size to professor ratio and lots of opportunities for research. I participated in athletics and loved the student life. The campus is beautiful and there are lots of fun activities in the small town.
Senior,5,With covid-19 many of my classes became online. I am not the typical student who prefers an online class but my professors were very accommodating and helped me learn the material.
Alum,5,"Residential and rural campus in a great small college town, amazing education for the price. Faculty are invested and have great industry partnerships throughout the Pacific Northwest."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love how social the community is (both on campus and off)! The CBE (College of Business and Economics) stays connected and allows students to find opportunities to better their college experience through the faculty, staff, and other CBE students. Based on your college and major, you are able to connect with alumni, professors, and fellow students to discover different scholarships and internships. Overall, the University of Idaho has helped me to branch out, gain valuable learning experiences, and develop my own independence in a safe environment."
Freshman,5,The University of Idaho has been a great experience so far. The facilities have been outstanding as well as the staff.
Senior,5,University of Idaho has a size that makes it feel like a community. After 4 years I have got to know many people especially from being a part of Greek life. They have many events and clubs and organizations offered to students and have a wide variety of majors to chose from. I love the campus and the safety. The professors Ive had are all very kind. I am doing a double major in advertising and education with a minor in dance. All the classes I have taken in these fields have been enjoyable and I feel like I can connect the content Ive learned to my future career choice.
Freshman,5,When i was Touring i was very impressed with the area of study heads and the information they gave me.
Junior,5,The staff really seems to care about everyone that they come across! The campus is also extremely beautiful and the Moscow community really supports the University!
Alum,5,"I have been in college four years now, and I feel that these past two years here, since transferring from North Idaho College, have been the best two years of my schooling yet. The college is amazing mostly with the community that encompasses it, and how much variety that U of I gives. Now I can see why my parents and there parents came down here to study."
Niche User,5,"This school has an awesome engineering program, really appreciate the staff and faculty. When I called in to schedule a visit, the person on the other line was wonderful to speak to and had my best interest at heart."
Niche User,5,A good college that invests into you. Good campus and overall allows you to create new friends that will last a lifetime.
Sophomore,5,Great competitive education with a board of faculty that want to push you to work harder and grow. Very hands on with learning experiences!
Sophomore,5,"University of Idaho is an excellent college. I am in the College of Natural Resources and it is outstanding. The professors are extremely knowledgable and really care about our success as students. They really try to get us into the industry before we graduate so that we have a job lined up by the time we graduate. I would recommend this college to anyone but especially people that like a smaller college. There isn't a ton of people but there is always something to do, It has a big college view without a ton of people."
Freshman,5,"Being a freshman just after my first semester, I can really say that I love it here at U of I. I grew up in a small town, dreaming of getting out there and seeing what a new community can really offer me, and so far Moscow has given it to me. I have so many new friends and people I don't see that could be anywhere out of my life. The classes are challenging, sure, but the resources on campus help me get the leg up I need to succeed with my friends and newfound family around to support me."
Freshman,5,"The University of Idaho has a beautiful campus! I also like how many opportunities there are between classes, athletics, and clubs."
Junior,5,Amazing school. Does need to take tips from Washington State on how to run greek system. Was amazing freshman year but has gone down every year since.
Freshman,5,"I like the Moscow community and how you have everything you need but it is still a small town. The campus is also safe, you can walk around at night without fear."
Junior,5,"It is a very professional school, and by that I mean nearly all the teachers are there to help the students succeed, and the students are there to graduate, which is reflected by the high graduation rate."
Alum,5,Moscow Idaho is one of the best college towns I've experienced. The close-knit campus and nearby amenities make living there a joy.
Niche User,5,I loved going to visit the campus. It's so pretty there and when you need help finding something there is always someone you can ask.
Niche User,5,"I recently visited this college and I loved the campus tour that was given. They had so many things to do and they motivated you to go to a college that fits you the best. The people were so kind and they made it sound so simple, the people there gave me a bunch of advise and the experience. I will keep this college in mind and see if there are other options for me and what I want to study in the future. It was a different enviorment for me and I am glad that I experienced it with people I have never met before, it was something I thought I would never do but here I am and I am glad that I did it."
Junior,5,Deciding to attend the University of Idaho was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made; I wouldn't want to get an undergraduate education anywhere else!
Niche User,5,"I like how nice and helpful all of the staff members are. They are very friendly when you talk to them, and they are there to help you out. The University of Idaho offers an excellent engineering program that is geared for those intending to make a decent wage right out of college."
Freshman,5,"University of Idaho is an amazing and beautiful school. There's wide range of majors to choose, that I didn't even know existed! The staff and teachers are all very friendly and helpful every time I need help. Student life here is great because you get to meet so many different type of people, and people here accepts you for who you are. There is great room service and dorms as well. There's many fun events that the university always therefore, making a freshman student like me, feel welcome and experience different things every day. University of Idaho maybe known to be a party school, but to me is definitely not. The study environment here is perfect. There's so many things you can do to de-stress and just have fun while maintaining your grades. University of Idaho is definitely perfect for me and one I definitely recommend anyone."
Freshman,5,"I loved U of I. The campus is beautiful and the classes are just hard enough to keep me on my toes, but not enough to make me feel overwhelmed!"
Sophomore,5,Itâ€™s an amazing campus full of life and the people there are just awesome. Found some of my greatest friends here. Also has a great Christian church named Resonate!
Freshman,5,"After applying and exploring, I chose to go to university of Idaho because the students are the focus at this university and I have personally felt taken care of."
Junior,5,"This campus is beautiful, but the true value is the high level education students receive for an incredibly reasonable in-state cost.  Tuition is very competitive, and the living options are all affordable.  Greek life on campus is strong, and extremely inclusive.  There is a house to fit any personality, including several fraternities and sororities that do not allow alcohol.   A fantastic place to obtain an education and also make lifelong friends."
Sophomore,5,"This university is great! The facility is amazing and the staff is incredible. This campus is very diverse and that's something I love about it. The campus is always clean and you can see all four seasons in one day. The student base is incredible and very united. I've been at this campus for one year and I was welcomed with open arms and I loved it ever since. I always told everyone I was going to be a Vandal and 8 years later, I finally became one. This campus is the once for everyone."
Alum,5,"Beautiful campus located in a quaint college town.
You get experience all four seasons. 
Many resources and involvement opportunities for students."
Sophomore,5,"It is a great University with a small town feel with food market on main street, lots of bikes ridden to and from school. I believe there could be more affordable housing for college students."
Sophomore,5,"It was hard going off to college and being so far away from my family however, with time it became easier. U of I has so much to offer, and hopefully with recent changes in administration it will become even better! I recommend exploring the possibility of Greek life to get yourself more involved and social. I stayed in the Tower my first year, and I was very miserable. I have thoroughly enjoyed my classes thus far, except for STATS 251, but that could've been a lot better through a different instructor."
Junior,5,I like the size of the campus as it's easy to navigate. The academics are great and it's been a positive experience. I can't recommend any changes at this point.
Sophomore,5,Love everything about this college!  It has brought me to make new friends and has great teachers who really care about helping their students succeed.  It has helped me decide what I want to do with my career.
Junior,5,"The University of Idaho is a very diverse campus that has a lot to offer for everyone. U of I is located in Moscow Idaho which is the perfect college town. It has both a home-like feeling, while also having things to do. Moscow has the best restaurants and small things to do, it is also located only 8 miles from Pullman Washington, which is another University town. I love the University of Idaho for its amazing programs. U of I has a wild selection of programs and majors that can satisfy almost anyone! The University of Idaho also has greek life which is an amazing opportunity for students to get involved not only on campus but also in the community. There are also very many clubs and other organizations at the University of Idaho that make U of I so diverse."
Alum,5,Great experience. Meet lot of good friends. Friendly community. Amazing professor. Quite and very focus campus.
Freshman,5,The University of Idaho is a great school that has good academics along with good social life. All the professors are helpful when you are struggling and the resident areas along with Greek life are all good.
Freshman,5,"It is a great place to get an education. The professors are very helpful, it is a very diverse campus, and it has many excellent research opportunities. It has helped many students to enter into good careers and make a good living. I have really enjoyed my time at the university of Idaho."
Freshman,5,University Of Idaho has a great campus and is an amazing school classes are small so you will be able to talk to the instructor.
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student from a community college and coming into a four year university was the best choice I made especially attending the University of Idaho. The thing I would like to see change would just be food. Other than that, this is a great university and a great experience!"
Niche User,5,"The thing I have loved the most about University of Idaho so far is the welcoming feeling, and the overall atmosphere.  To me it feels like the quintessential college campus."
Junior,5,I love the family-like environment at the University of Idaho. Greek life was the best decision I've ever made. I've been able to succeed as a student as well as making life-long friends and connections.
Niche User,5,I have visited the University of Idaho many times because of family members that attend. I plan to attend school there in the fall.
Sophomore,5,"This university is truly the perfect size. It has excellent Greek Life, and many academic opportunities if you want to pursue them. The school spirit is high. However, some things are run down as it is an old institution. I think anyone can make this place their home though."
Niche User,5,"I liked that it was a small town.  And when we visited, people were very helpful.  I could find my way around easily and the professor took time to talk to us for an hour!"
Niche User,5,"I love the Campus here. Everyone on campus is so friendly, and the band is outstanding. I went to the University for their Future Vandal Game Day, and it was the best experience I have ever had. I highly recommend the University for your future college."
Senior,4,My professors have been really good at helping me do my course load online this semester. I work as  a CNA and work has been so crazy so it helps that my professors with their online classes have been very accommodating to me.
Senior,4,"The University community has always been amazingly friendly and helpful. There a ton of activities that are held on campus, and lots of ways to get help for your classes."
Sophomore,4,They have been super flexible with hybrid learning and trying to accommodate everyone. It's more difficult in the larger classes to be online because you get a lot less interaction with your professor.
Senior,4,"Big research school; mostly engineering and agriculture.
Despite the typical underfunding of the Arts and English departments, the art scene is Moscow is really cool and small business based. It's the small quirky town Portland pretends to be.
At most 2 hours away from every amazing lake, river, and hiking opportunity North Idaho has to offer, as well as Canada.
Moscow is the cool small town art scene that makes it feel more like Washington or Oregon than any other part of Idaho. 
""Destination Campus"" it is gorgeous!
The diversity in student is there, students and professors from all over the world studying here full-time or just for an abroad experience. We have an annual India night and another Bangladesh night. 
It is small town North Idaho though so the surrounding and local area is mostly rural Idaho white people."
Sophomore,4,I like the campus and the student staff. Too much partying during the pandemic though. The food can get too repetitive because there aren't many options.
Sophomore,4,"I am taking classes online this semester because of the pandemic, and it has gone well for the most part! However, I am in a technology major, so my professors are already very good with technology. I'm not sure about other professors."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the campus size and most academic advisors are amazing. (Shout out to Paul Alderete!) If you want to succeed, you have every opportunity to do so.

However, as most campuses do, I feel the lines between right and wrong start to become blurred. The University of Idaho's policies try to be ""all-inclusive"" but in the process of doing so, shut the door to what is true. They promote BLM, yet will NOT allow any support of the simple fact that all lives matter."
Sophomore,4,"everyone is so nice, most dorms rooms in Wallace residence have bathrooms that you share with your roommates."
Sophomore,4,"with covid-19 most of our classes have been online, the class that I have online have been a great experience for me."
Freshman,4,"It's expensive, and a lot of parties are always going, but the teachers are good and will help and the dorms are nice. Huge library, quaint college town. Beautiful part of the country."
Sophomore,4,"I have been taking classes online over the summer, as well as for the last part of the Spring 2020 semester. The situation was definitely not anticipated so soon, but all of the faculty and professors worked hard to provide a quality learning environment. I felt productive and valued."
Junior,4,I have taken many online courses within this university and have loved the experience. My professors help me and always keep me on track remotely.
Sophomore,4,"My online experience began right after Spring Break when our president, Scott Green, announced we would not be returning. Transferring to an online platform was no issue considering I own and use a computer. But I missed the one on one interaction with both my peers and my professor. 
After some time and settling in I actually had a very good experience with classes online. My professors found fun and creative ways to host class through Zoom that made it both engaging and entertaining. This made me happy."
Sophomore,4,"University of Idaho is a welcoming, supportive college that wants every one of their students to succeed and it shows. The staff is always extremely supportive and accommodating to fit your needs so you can be successful as a student at their university. Everyone is so involved with helping you succeed from professors, counselors, even the President himself."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my teachers for the semester. The resources available are well equipped and easy to access. Help is easy to find. Campus is beautiful and there are many places to spend leisure time. I was never invited to the big parties, so I do not know their quality. It is a fairly anti-substance school, but there are ways around that."
Senior,4,I love taking online courses through U of I. Easy access and readability. Easy to follow lessons. Great teachers!
Niche User,4,The university of Idaho looks amazing. The campus and the staff at the school are all great and are always willing to help you learn the things you need to. The environment surrounding the school is amazing. Threre are a lot of trees and it almost feels like you're in the forest.
Senior,4,"I really enjoy the campus and the people of Moscow. I love the resources and events available to the students. I have had a couple of grumpy professors, but mostly the professors are very available and excited to talk to you about your problems. The classrooms are pretty nice and the food is pretty decent. Overall, I'm very glad I came here."
Freshman,4,"I've really enjoyed my time at the U of I so far. The people are great and there are a lot of great opportunities for hands-on learning, especially in natural resource fields. The food options could be better and the dorms could use updating, but I wouldn't change my experience here. It's been great."
Senior,4,The university staff is helpful and supportive of the student's needs.  The online program is easy to work with and the instructors are supportive and make themselves available to assist students.
Alum,4,"The University of Idaho was an outstanding, affordable college. It is in a very small town that helps connect the community to the University. There is a wide variety of fraternities and sororities to help you build a connection with your classmates. There is a variety of athletics, but not very competitive. Housing is cheap, but there aren't many quality options."
Senior,4,Professors are really good at answering emails and working with students' needs. The campus is a good size and there is a helpful online map that allows you to locate buildings with ease.
Junior,4,It's a very outdoorsy campus with lots of recreational activities. The campus is wide open and spacious providing lots of fresh air. The professors and advisors are extremely helpful and are always willing to go the extra mile to help.
Freshman,4,"I have loved my experience at University of Idaho. I have had great classes and very caring professors. If you are struggling with a class they are always there to help you do your best. The student body is very inclusive and everyone is here to learn. It is an amazing community and the campus itself makes it even more enjoyable. There are many beautiful spots to sit and study outside or even just sit and relax. I can not complain about University of Idaho at all. I love the campus, student/ student life, and the faculty and staff of the school."
Freshman,4,"Great student involvement, the academics are great, professors actually care about student success, and the quality of the athletics is quickly improving."
Freshman,4,"It is a great place to live and go to school. It has a lot of opportunities to work and find extracurricular activities that fit you. The people are friendly and most of the teachers care about you and your situation and are willing to work with you to try and get the best outcome. They are all nice, but if there was one thing I wish would change is teachers showing political view points in class. I have one professor that I think of when saying this, so its not all of the professors, but he has been known to say to the class that we are stupid if we think anything else."
Freshman,4,"I really have loved my classes and the professors I had were amazing. I did have a student teacher who was very sweet and trying her hardest, but English wasn't her first language, and although she spoke English better than I could speak her native tongue, it led to some miscommunications where the class wasn't sure what was happening and had to ask for clarification. My RA is fabulous and very funny and I literally have the sweetest roommate. There are so many student resources on campus, it's actually pretty cool. There is a rec center with all kinds of exercise equipment and a rock wall, and its free for students."
Freshman,4,"This university is on the smaller side compared to many other universities, which I am a fan of because you can see the same people walking to class and form a community in a very short time. Class sizes vary from small to large (25-150) it just depends on what level of class you take."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus and the way the whole environment makes me feel. The staff are approachable, the students are friendly, and it just feels like a great place to be."
Niche User,4,It has a great party scene it is probably the best in Idaho colleges and the schooling is good but not the best
Junior,4,"My experience at UI has been mainly rooted in the Art Department and while I can't speak for all areas, my professors and peers are some of the most passionate makers of our generation and I am forever thankful for them."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful area, fantastic people, great teachers. There are plenty of other great programs but in my experience, it does seem to have a focus on Engineering, Agriculture, and Business."
Alum,4,"Like most things, you'll get out of it what you put into it! I enjoyed my time at UI but would certainly do some things differently; additionally, I completed my degree between 2003-2011, so much has changed in the years since. I still think having to use the Polya Lab for Math 143 was possibly the worst thing to ever happen to me academically... it just did not address my learning style whatsoever, and I hated not having the option to take a fully live course."
Sophomore,4,"This university has a gorgeous campus with a wide array of opportunities! As an animal science major, I've really enjoyed all of the research opportunities and research experience I've been able to accomplish thus far!"
Freshman,4,The dorms are somewhat like prison cells. It would be great to see a change in the halls. Maybe more decorations or something that brings life into the dorms.
Freshman,4,"The food is abysmal, but other than that, it is a quality university with a godlike music program headed by the illustrious Dan Bukvich and Leonard Garrison for freshmen."
Freshman,4,"I have made some fantastic friends and learned so much already, and it's only the fourth week of school! I can't wait to see what the next four years hold as I pursue my degree!"
Junior,4,"I love the University of Idaho. My favorite part is completing on the basketball team. It is amazing how many people from different backgrounds that I have connected with. I would like to see improvements in athletics, the city of Moscow, and enrollment."
Senior,4,"This kind of question is one that I find too difficult and ambiguous to really give a written answer to, as it's something I tend to know more by feel, than by word."
Senior,4,The class sizes are usually very reasonable and most teachers are very good about providing additional outside of class time to work with them one on one. The tutoring and additional services are excellent.
Junior,4,"I LOVE the University of Idaho. The only reason I'm giving it a 4/5 stars is because there is always room for improvement. I love the campus - it's small, but also big. It's beautiful to look at. The relationship I have with my professors only gets better as I get further and further into my major. I think that is possible because it is a small campus and my class sizes are between 20 and 30 students. I don't think you'd get the same experience at a different university."
Junior,4,"It has a very small town feel which is rare for a college town. This means it is easy to get one on one time with professors. Grocery stores, fast food, etc. are within walking distance. Beautiful in the fall and spring, but very heavy snowfall."
Senior,4,"The University of Idaho has a unique atmosphere as it has a very inclusive campus. Everything from downtown restaurants to campus buildings and the university rec center is all within walking distance. I am currently studying architecture and have the program enlightening, fun and challenging. I canâ€™t speak for other majors but with the challenges of architecture there also comes great rewards of self achievement and learning. Professors are fantastic with their own degrees of expertise. Studio and other classes are hands on and the professors are very invested into the students. 

With it being my fifth year coming up this fall I can say that the university offers a wide range of living options from Greek life to on-campus dormitories and apartments so there is a comfortable living situation for all who attend."
Freshman,4,The University of Idaho has an incredibly beautiful campus that makes you want to walk to class each day. The diversity of the classes make them unique and interesting and the professors are always available to help their students. The small town of Moscow provides a welcoming feeling of community which helps with those who are so far from home.
Junior,4,I enjoy the fact that it is a small campus and the area in general. I wish that when it comes to labs it was not so cheap and we had more equipment. I feel like U of I is pretty good though.
Niche User,4,"I am a high school senior over at Boise Senior High, but I have visited the University of Idaho twice to look around the school, this is the school I want to get my degree at. The people up there seem really friendly, I had all my questions answered effectively, all the staff up there were super polite and helpful to me, and I got the chance to talk to a few of the students who seemed very nice and openminded. I can't wait till I can become a part of the vandal family in August!"
Sophomore,4,this school keeps students involved as much as they can! Professors and TAs are always there for help and support.
Freshman,4,University of Idaho has great perks because of its size!  All of the professors know you by name and and want to help. The campus is beautiful and there are lots of opportunities to get involved. Moscow is a quaint college town and has fun restaurants for dinner as well as cute coffee shops to study in.  Everyone at the university is welcoming and campus feels like home.
Senior,4,"This institution has given me opportunities that I would never have considered achievable being a first generation student of a very low-income family. Through the support and financial assistance from the diversity and college assistant migrant program along with various other scholarships within the College of Art and Architecture,  I have been able to travel overseas multiple times to increase my understanding of architectural design. I am very grateful for the passionate and talented professors my college has to offer."
Freshman,4,"I really like the campus, despite it being a small town with very rural vibes, it doesn't seem all that small and condensed thanks to the campus life."
Freshman,4,"I like that there is a lot of diversity here at the University of Idaho. I like that everyone is very friendly and most of the professors are excellent teachers. This school makes any student, no matter how far away from home, feel welcome. The school is very involved with the community and the students."
Freshman,4,"I love that the teachers in the music program genuinely care about how you are doing in classes. Not only in the music programs but as well as core classes, i feel like the more the teachers seem to care the better the students do in the class."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy going to the University of Idaho not only is it one of the best engineering schools in Idaho, but it also has a beautiful campus boasting two arboretums. Also the location of the University has it so there are several major cites in both Idaho and Washington relatively close by. If I could change one thing it would be the requirement for freshmen to have a meal plan and live on campus as it really adds a hefty cost that students might not expect."
Niche User,4,"The University of Idaho has a great staff and wonderful campus. Everyone is super nice and their dual credit and willingness to work with high school students is amazing. Unfortunately their communication is slightly lacking, otherwise I would give a full five stars."
Junior,4,I like the community of professors who really want students to succeed. I think that the way the different majors interact could be more streamlined. I also believe that parking is a big problem here. They don't have enough and they sell more parking passes then spaces available.
Sophomore,4,I love the school culture and the campus is beautiful. Smaller class sizes really let you get to know your prof and be able to ask questions.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Idaho is a beautiful campus, very safe, and provides a lot of opportunities for involvement. The academics are average, and just like with any school, there are the good and bad professors. Athletics are where the school lacks."
Freshman,4,"The university is fantastic, my only negative is that I wish that they would update the housing on campus! Very out of date :("
Sophomore,4,"Choosing to study at the University of Idaho has been one of my best decisions. Many of the professors are great and kbow their subject. The campus is beautiful and the dorm life majes it easy to make friends, especially your freshman year. The town could offer more for students, especially those under 21, but between school clubs and those who love the outdoors, there is a lot to do in the area. I would recommend this school to anyone studying in Idaho or any neighboring states."
Freshman,4,"Being able to feel safe at any time of the day on campus. Everything is convenient for me, having access to everything. University of Idaho offers many clubs and actives for students. Its a great way to get involved."
Sophomore,2,"There is simply no substitute for in-class learning. Most professors here haven't figured out how to adapt to online classes, and for good reason, because online learning sucks."
Senior,2,"University of Idaho has a beautiful campus, but very poor management to go along with it. I had to constantly seek out professors, administration, the registrar, and many other people because they simply would not email me back, call me back, or ever help me with anything. The school as a whole is ran like a disaster, and the poor financial decisions on the part of the university shows that they know nothing about what their school is known for. The research and education aspects are the most important part. But then they raise tuition and use our money to build a basketball arena for one of the worst basketball teams in the entire country. Do not trust them with your time or your money, as they are incapable of handling either."
Graduate Student,2,"Just a poor experience overall with stuff, professors, etc. I was excited about this school at first, but was disappointed pretty soon afterwards. The law school building is pretty small, there is not enough room for studying."
Senior,2,"Not much to do. Nobody cares about sports programs. Overall, not very impressed. Wish I would've went somewhere else."
College Junior,2,Not sure about our rate of crime or problems but the fact that if something were to happen there's almost never a security guard around or they do not seem equipped at all.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life inhibits the ability of student governance as it is so pervasive within the University of Idaho. Having Greek life makes it feel like a neccessity when it detracts from other organizations and residence groups.
College Sophomore,2,I really don't know anything about Greek Life first hand.
College Junior,2,They're finally remodeling this summer.
College Junior,2,"Our football team is decent. Basketball, women's soccer and tennis are exceptional!"
College Freshman,2,"I don't like living in the dorms at all. RHA is kind of weird, the building kind of sucks, it's always loud and freezing, except in September and May, when it's burning. Things break and stop working. It's not hell but I definitely don't recommend it."
College Sophomore,2,"Very little to do. Most things are closed and unless you are going to a house party or exploring the shut-down town, sleep or Netflix is pretty much it."
College Sophomore,2,People generally are similar in their viewpoints and worldview. It is also predominantly white.
College Sophomore,2,"I do not like the small town feel. People are generally conservative and seem rather apathetic about the world beyond. Many students are here for engineering, in the hopes of making a lot of money after graduation, but not all of them enjoy it."
College Sophomore,2,"The Facilities are well funded and diverse, but only a small part of the student population actually uses them."
College Junior,2,"The only saving grace for me that kept me here as long as it did was the low cost and the marching band. The college of art and architecture here could not be more mediocre, I feel like I'm paying thousands of dollars for a junior-high-level arts and crafts class. The town of Moscow is very nice, small, safe, cheap, with lots of cool little local businesses, and it's not too hard to find a job here. Really, if the art/graphic design degree program wasn't so unbelievably terrible, I'd stay."
College Sophomore,2,"Required to eat and pay for bobs....which is worse than prison food

Everywhere else is ridiculously expensive

Dennys all nighter is pretty amazing, just incredibly expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms:

Known Asbestos in building

62 square feet shared with another person for the entire year...

Showers that are a breeding ground for tinea versacolor and have not been updated since original installation."
College Freshman,2,The school should really do more to help the students find off campus housing.
College Freshman,2,Bob's is really gross and I got sick a lot.
College Freshman,2,"Interacting with people is great! But when it comes down to a bathroom with no fan, a room with no air conditioning (when it get's steamy in the dorms) and on top of that the $500+ a month I'm spending on a 20x10 room all adds up to spending extra money on air fresheners, and extra box fans."
College Junior,2,"Financial aid has made improvements in the last few years, but I have had some extreme difficulty getting my aid applications processed.  Last year, in order to get my summer aid paid out, I had to physically go to the office every single day for a week until the clerk finally sat down and figured out the problem.

It is also difficult to get problems solved via email, and it's rare for someone to either answer the phone or call back."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is frowned upon, at least to the students I'm around regularly. They are usually rude and annoying and take all of the parking spots at my specific building even though they have separate parking for themselves."
College Freshman,2,"Girls wear booty shorts and Uggs during the winter. I was the only one I saw at school with dyed purple hair last semester, but when I came back from break, everyone else had purple hair too. So I have deducted that most people are followers."
College Senior,2,"Though people try to push it aside it is a growing issue, we have programs like police escorts etc but not many students know or use these programs."
College Senior,2,As one not in the greek system I can't give a full review.
College Freshman,2,"For what you pay to eat at Bob's, the food there is very sub par. If you can, try to get a low meal-plan to save money and have better opportunities to eat better food elsewhere."
College Student,2,"The rooms are way too small, for everyone."
College Student,2,"Night life can be ok, some times, but other times its just best to keep with your studies."
College Student,2,"I had some really bad apartments. I am afraid to move from what I have now. lol,"
College Student,2,"Not very many choices at all. You start eating here, and everything starts tasting the same, the food is very dull, even off campus, but we are getting some new ones in here!!! Hopefully soon!!"
College Student,2,"I have gotten kicked off a computer that said for scanner use, and I was not needing the scanner yet, so they had me move, there were lots open with scanners for some one else to use, but all the computers without scanners were taken. They like rules her to keep things in order."
College Student,2,"Lots of people have sex with various genders cause they are often times bored. They do drink, and campus cops write tickets that cost a bit to fight, you get caught with pot its over seven hundred dollars to pay the ticket, and not sure how much underage drinking costs, but I am sure its not cheap. The scene is bad, do to the authorities giving out punishments and huge costs to the students that follow them for their life."
College Student,2,"The food, is just cookies and snacks that are over the price students should pay. For the cost of what you buy, it should be so much better. I bought a bag of skittles from the near by store, and one of my fillings broke in half cause they were a bit hard, so their inventory stays there there, cause they don't sell enough."
College Senior,2,The new gun laws is a disservice to those who wish to carry as administration has purposely made it inconvenient.
College Senior,2,"Not much to do but party, and that's sad and affects the students grades"
College Senior,2,"I had my practicum over a year ago and the supervisor who was training me at his state agency, got fired and I never got to finish my practicum so I won't graduate for a year longer."
Recent Alumnus,2,"This is probably the thing that most people on campus complain about. The main dining hall on campus is frankly bad. The quality of the food is not very good, and the menus are not always the most creative or healthy. And really, nearly everything on campus is quite expensive. I know this firsthand, as I worked in campus dining here for two years. The best thing about campus dining is that you can use your flex dollars at every dining location on campus and that meal plans can be very flexible, providing fewer weekly meals at the dining hall and more flex dollars. My personal favorite places to eat on campus are Einsteins and the Chinese place in the Commons. (Also, the Jamba Juice here is terrible)"
College Sophomore,2,not much to do unless you have a car
College Freshman,2,"The police are extremely persistent. They dress up like us and try and blend in to catch people drinking. They will even hide in the bushes and jump out and chase people. It is absolutely ridiculous. I understand their presence is necessary, but not to this extent. They really just make it more difficult for people to make it home safely."
College Junior,2,Getting enough aid to just pay tuition is hard.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is dreadful, at least if you're a Greek member.  Lots are designated by a color code based on who is ""allowed"" to use them, and those that need parking can register for a pass based on their designation.  For those who live in fraternities/sororities, that is the purple code.  Purple lots have been removed and cut back a lot over the past two years, reducing drastically where we can park (at least conveniently).  There are areas one can park near campus, but they can be a hassle to make use of.  This situation isn't helped by the outrageous price hiking for parking passes each year, which have been steadily creeping up each year for no clear reason."
College Junior,2,The computer labs are always busy. Especially in the engineering buildings.
College Junior,2,It's a very boring school so not much to talk about.
College Junior,2,There are not that many things to do in town. Very boring.
College Freshman,2,"The fall is beautiful but I personally have never been a fan of cold weather or snow, so during the winter I don't enjoy the weather very much. Come spring time it gets much better and the campus really comes alive during the spring."
College Freshman,2,The weather is very cold and there is lots of snow
College Freshman,2,"During the winters, the weather is ugly."
College Freshman,2,"There are only a few options, which are expensive."
College Freshman,2,There's quite a bit of drugs and alcohol here.
College Freshman,2,There is not a ton to do. It's pretty boring.
College Freshman,2,The wireless network is slow and in places gone.
College Sophomore,2,"Most people who make friends are stuck in little cliques, very similar to high school. Greek students stick with their ""kind"" and often times students who aren't a part of the Greek community are ignored."
College Sophomore,2,Many men on campus are only into partying and it is hard to find one who isn't interested in getting you in bed.
College Freshman,2,I am more than qualified to receive a lot of the scholarships that the school offers however do not receive much which sucks because I am paying for my school all on my own and due to this I was forced to take out private loans as a freshmen when I have been doing everything I can to get financial aid but have received very little.
College Freshman,2,"There are like 3 or 4 places I go with very unhealthy options. It's not helping my freshman 15 that has turned into sophomore additional 10. I have gained so much weight at school and when I come home for breaks I have to kill myself to work some of it off just for more to be added back on when I go back. Being vegetarian or vegan must be extremely difficult since everything seems to be processed and fast food chain-like. And then to have other dietary concerns would be awful like gluten free or lactose free. I can't imagine having those restraints. But maybe it would be good to lose weight, cause there would be nothing to eat!"
College Freshman,2,"From what I've seen, it's all about the looks. "
College Junior,2,It was alright mostly frats when underage and bars when over 21. Don't really spend time in town on the weekends anymore...got better things to do.
College Junior,2,To much greek life... they all look the same. Bros& hoes as my buddy refers to them not much difference between each group.
College Freshman,2,"Unless you are in the Greek system, the University is kind of boring. The resources are great but they do not offer a lot of variety in classes. The main focus is usually agriculture or psychology."
College Senior,2,"Campus transportation basically consists of handicap rides, carpooling for commuter students, taxis and security transportation for night time pickups. We are located in a small town so there isnt a very elaborate transportation system. I am not sure what prices are, but i am sure the pickup times are few and far between!"
Senior,1,"The university is entirely unready for any sort of online engagement. The majority of professors can barely operate a computer in the first place, let alone anything that requires the internet."
Freshman,1,The professors and administrators seem out of touch with the student population. For the most part the people are fun and outgoing.
Freshman,1,"My experience here has not been the best. The admin seems out of touch as well as the professors. The people are great, but the school staff not so much. I ended up transferring to an out of state school."
Senior,1,A liberal brainwashing academy where you talk about how men are the problem in the world and if your a man and try to argue your blown off because your a man.. DON'T GO HERE. ANYWHERE ELSE WOUOD BE BETTER.
College Sophomore,1,"I was in a sorority my first year, and it was absolutely the worst experience of my life.  I joined because I hoped it would benefit my studies and community service, but literally all they care about are the parties and their social status."
College Freshman,1,"Everyone dislikes the football team; the coach is awful, the team isn't great, and way too much of our tuition goes toward paying for it. There was an instance where two football players stole from the campus store, which basically means they stole from the university itself, and were only given a slap on the wrist. For the amount of money all the students have to pay for this team, they really don't show it. I've never met a person who doesn't dislike our football program."
College Sophomore,1,"Really? Ask me about Engineering life... oh wait, there isn't one."
College Sophomore,1,I know nothing about the athletics.
College Sophomore,1,It's expensive. Living on campus doubled my overall cost of going to school.
College Freshman,1,I do not like Greek Life
College Freshman,1,Bobs is extremely over-priced for the quality of food they have.
College Freshman,1,"A friend of mine had to break the ""freshman must live on campus unless if with family"" rule in order to escape the absolute hell hole that people call ""the tower."" I had to rescue him and give him my home to live because the conditions were so bad he almost changed his major once and even almost dropped out of college. From what I've heard, the LLCs are the best place to live on campus, and from what I've seen, I would agree."
College Sophomore,1,I am not a snow weather type of person so the winter months are hard on me.
College Sophomore,1,"Campus dining is the worst. Food is almost always soggy, tasteless, hard, and greasy. Often times, food would be undercooked, or not prepared very well. HUGE waste of money."
College Freshman,1,"We have about a month or two of hot weather, like really hot. Hot as in you are always sweating fans in your face don't help and trying to sleep is miserable unless you want to pay a high cost for air conditioning. And then winter comes with a full force of inches upon inches of snow that freeze and turn campus into a huge ice skating rink. Last year I ran my best friends car into a parked car because of the ice and snow mixture frozen to the roads. That didn't really help my ""broke college student"" budget. "
College Freshman,1,It always seems that the Greeks think that they are the best.
College Freshman,1,"Not very many options, and the options there are are not healthy. The dining hall is inconveniently located."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not a wide variety of options, as it is a small town. You have the typical Mexican restaurants and some pizza joints. I really miss Indian and Thai food - you can't find those here.  I'm sorry to say that there is nothing really for vegetarians."
College Freshman,1,"They don't enforce drug policies at all; it's one thing this college should definitely enforce, considering that it is know as a party school. I'm also really grossed out by smokers who blow smoke in my face, and by the people in Greek Housing who can't stop talking about how this guy was drunk or that girl was drunk."
College Freshman,1,"Personally, I hate snow, and rain, and hail. During the winter time, it's really cold, but some of the sidewalks are heated, so it's not as bad to get to class, but it's still really wet. And then in the summer, it gets too hot for me. Another thing is that it is windy quite a bit, though sometimes, the wind is a good thing."
College Student,1,"Make sure you get a permit to park on campus, but even with permit, parking is a nightmare. Since Moscow is such a small town, you're really better off with a bike, because the campus is extremely bike friendly with wide pathways and plenty of bike racks. Biking is actually faster in most cases then driving due to traffic and parking issues!"
College Sophomore,1,"There are obviously plenty of rules about no alcohol or drugs on campus, but they tend to slip through especially in terms of campus housing. There are repercussions if you get caught, although, I'm not even sure what they are because people don't get caught as often as they should. There is a campus police office in the Commons so if someone has a problem or if you have a problem with people drinking in your dorm/frat/sorority/LLC, you can always report it. I would say just don't do anything illegal- obey the law and don't underage drink, don't do drugs, don't steal stuff, don't cause a riot, and then you won't have to worry about getting in trouble."
College Sophomore,1,"Winters are horrible here, especially since we are in the Palouse there are barely any trees so the wind is always blowing and it gets a lot colder. However, it can also get really hot here. When school starts in the fall it is scorching and if you live in the dorms it is unbearable because there is no A/C. The end of fall and spring is my favorite in this area because it is the perfect temperature and the sun is always shining."
College Sophomore,1,U of I is all about Greek Life which is somewhat disappointing. There is a strong separation between the 'Greeks' and everyone else. The greeks call people who are not in greek life GDI's (God damn independent) which brings me back to high school where there were cliques. It's all about partying and who can drink the most when you are involved in greek life at U of I.
College Junior,1,"It is ALWAYS windy... so when it rains, it rains sideways. When it snows, it snows sideways. When its cold its freezing."
College Junior,1,The permits are very expensive and they are still far from anywhere on campus. Parking is strictly enforced and if you park somewhere your not supposed to for more than 5 minutes you will have a ticket. The campus is definitely not car friendly but it is kind of walking friendly.
College Freshman,1,It sucks. The parking office is ran by Hitler Youth.
College Freshman,1,"It is crazy cold, and snowy from like November, until May. It snowed finals week last year."
College Freshman,1,The Greek life is terrible and there is hazing. Its just terrible and not fun at all.
College Junior,1,Parking at the university is ridiculous. They overcharge for parking areas that are almost completely removed from campus. They also give out more passes than there are spots so its quite impossible to find good spots also.
College Sophomore,1,Although i come from a well-off home I have good grades and was promised financial aid for having good grades. I still have yet to get much help financially from the University because everything is need-based.
College Sophomore,1,"Bad Teams, No Student Participation â€“ From what I noticed, the football team does horribly. Lots of students turn out for the football games, but for every other sporting event, be it basketball or soccer or whatever, nobody comes to show support!"
College Sophomore,1,The University sells hundreds more passes then they have spaces. If you want to find a parking space you either have to come to class before 730 am or be late to class to catch people leaving campus and steal their spots. I'm not impressed.
College Freshman,1,Barely Anything There â€“ Honestly Off-Campus Housing is hard to find close.
College Freshman,1,"Most Are Very Social, but Not Motivated â€“ The way I see it is there are a ton of people hear who still treat college like its high school and just do enough to get by and its sad to see all that money and potential being wasted in some cases."
College Senior,1,"When I first came to campus as a freshman, there were a few areas with free parking, which was very convenient for students looking to park temporarily to meet with a professor or counselor. However, free parking no longer exists anywhere on campus. Even the metered parking, which used to expire at 5pm, has been extended to 10pm due to the college's poor financials. Parking passes for the semester are over $300 now, and prices are raised each semester. The school sells far more passes than it has spots for. Even if you purchase a pass, you're not guaranteed parking, which is incredibly dishonest."
College Junior,1,"We Say No â€“ At the U of I the drug scene is not really big, although it depends on who you hang out with. If people are doing drugs, they're usually just smoking. Drinking is a much more popular activity."
College Senior,1,"Bland and Overpriced â€“ On-Campus food is tasteless and expensive. The only decent food item on campus is the breakfsast burritos, but even then their quality depends heavily on the individual making them. Making matters worse, there is no consistency to when breakfast burritos will be available. Go off-campus for food."
College Freshman,1,"There is tension in most classes because of the closed-minded people from small towns in Idaho that don't understand the importance of acceptance. There is even an extreme conservative group advocating for heterosexual relationships, saying they deserve a month of dedication just like homosexuals do."
College Sophomore,1,No matter the weather professors still expect you to be in class..and there is attendance penalties.

Niche User,5,I believe that this is a great place for students to develop their concepts. They will teach you the tools and technique required in order to pursue and idea
Sophomore,5,"I like the structure of the program here; you don't have to choose a specific major. You may try different things in different departments (for example, I can take photography and painting at the same time) so there's more freedom to try things and see what works best for your own artistic practice."
Junior,5,Very diverse school that pushes the limits with their students to help each individual better their skills to become professional artists.
Freshman,5,"a very promising school, you are constantly surrounded by peers who care about your well being as well as a focus on how to help you improve. A wonderful place to build connections as well as find yourself as an artist"
Freshman,5,Classes are overall great in pushing students to go beyond their boundaries in artistic mediums and subjects.
Freshman,5,I really love my school. I have made so many friends from so many different cultures. I learn what I love. I love the city and everything about Chicago. It's so much fun and there are many opportunities in there.
Graduate Student,5,"I really appreciate the multidisciplinary environment that they foster, It creates an inclusive atmosphere that really benefits all involved."
Niche User,5,"Great instructors lead to amazing personal and artistic growth. Being in the middle of Chicago, with full museum access, leaves you surrounded by masters of all areas and plenty of inspiration--not every university can give you everyday free access to the world's 3rd largest art museum.  Course loads can be focused or as broad as the student like, and the credit / no-credit grading system allows for exploration regardless of your path or skill level."
Freshman,5,"My experience so far has been great. I really enjoy the classes and the size of the classes are not to packed. I would like to see more classes for animation and on character development for things like comic books and video games. I came here from a very small town in Texas, where in my high school art was not considered a class or any kind of future to have. I have gotten supportive comments on my style of art, and it makes me feel good."
Freshman,5,"It was honestly the BEST college ever! It's a memory and quite the story that will remain in my heart forever. You were devoured by creativity walking down those hallways every day. In the mornings, you were welcomed with smiles from your fellow students and teachers, it was so uplifting. I am so proud when I say I went to ""The Art Institute of Chicago"". I took so much knowledge of what i learned from there with me, and use the skills in my every day life. The professors were so understanding and so positive, paying special attention to every single student in their class."
Sophomore,5,"The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) is a fantastic school that genuinely cares about the success of their students. The faculty and students are an empowering group of independent artists who I genuinely enjoy learning from and working with. This school pushes young artists to explore new ideas, mediums, and places to broaden their views of what an artist can do and what art can become. SAIC is a rigorous school. For students who are willing to work hard and take risks to better their artistic practice, SAIC will be a rewarding experience as it has been for me."
Sophomore,5,"It's a really nice, diverse school, and you get what you pay for if you take advantage of all of the high quality resources and opportunities available to you. The people here make up a very friendly and accepting community."
Sophomore,5,"it's one best schools i've ever been to. plus the academics are very strong, and the instructors are very nice. the campus is very diverse and you always get to see new people."
Freshman,5,"Truly America's most influential art and design school. The School Of The Art Institute Of Chicago is distinct in the way that it provides undergraduate students an interdisciplinary curriculum and the necessary freedom to develop as artists, designers, and scholars. At the same time, students are able to strive for a level of rigor, investigation, and cultural relevance that makes SAIC truly special. I believe that the interdisciplinary curriculum will challenge and allow freedom in experimentation therefore, students translate the most complex ideas into tangible forms of paintings, sculptures, films, performances, books, installations, inventions, buildings, community projects, and more often than not, a combination of the above. Few schools in the world provide such broad range of possibilities."
Niche User,5,SAIC is an amazing art school with an incredible amount of opportunities and great staff. It has great dorms and great food and a wonderful urban campus.
Sophomore,5,"It's a great school to explore your interests in art. There are classes all over, and everyone is welcome to explore in different fields for their own practice. 
The faculties and staffs are supportive and approachable."
Sophomore,5,"They are accommodating to every student's individual needs. They supply what I need to grow artistically, as well as for my well being. They have amazing resources for equipment, as well as counseling. The advising department is amazing."
Freshman,5,Absolutely amazing experience. The professors create a wonderful learning environment and help every student excel and work to evolve their potential.
Freshman,5,It is amazing! It is a very inclusive and nurturing environment. I have nothing but good things to say. It truly has fostered growth in me and every other student.
Junior,5,"This school allows you to explore your creative potential with no barriers, no judgment. Professors are well known artists all over the world; you are learning from people who have been in the field for many years. The degree is well recognized because some of the most famous artists have been taught at the school. Professors are kind and open to all ideas. Most other schools just give you assignments, this school gives you a blueprint for creativity and helps apply your knowledge to whichever field of work you decide to pursue, even one that might not necessarily be taught directly at the school."
Sophomore,5,"The School of the Art Institute of Chicago has a great undergrad program. A variety of courses are offered and many if not all of the instructors are willing to work side by side with their students to help them learn about the art scene, especially in Chicago. One can make many connections while attending this school which is very beneficial when it comes to the art world."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the open atmosphere and the ability to pursue many different areas at the same time. They make it easy to jump from department to department while still practicing other areas of art.
Graduate Student,5,SAIC is an awesome school for visual arts. I enjoy the visiting artist component of the school. This is where professional artist present to students their works and experiences in the art world.
College Junior,5,I love being here and all artist should come! #1
College Freshman,5,"There is no Greek Life whatsoever, which I love."
College Junior,5,You have to keep up with your work or else it can get a bit overwhelming near the end of a semester.
College Junior,5,"People do party but it's never obscene. For the most part, people go off campus to party."
College Junior,5,"SAIC is one of the top art schools in America and it's easy to see why. SAIC, in comparison to other art schools like Parsons, Pratt or SCAD, definitely has a more conceptually based curriculum rather than a more core artistic skills curriculum, just a forewarning. This does not mean that core artistically skilled people won't excel here or vice versa, it just means that the classes here don't teach you how to make art, they teach you how to experiment and try new art forms."
College Junior,5,"The professors are all practicing artists who take a tremendous amount of pride in their job(s). The teachers are always willing to help you and give you advice about your work. Since SAIC is on a pass/fail grading system, teachers urge you to take risks and even if a project isn't a success, teachers understand the effort that went into your work and will not fail you, but rather allow your failure to be a learning experience."
College Junior,5,"It's pretty safe in the Loop. SAIC provides late night shuttles from education buildings to dorms and train stations. Sexual assault is taken very seriously. Every student is educated about sexual assault and safety during orientation and optional seminars throughout the semester. Overall, SAIC is a safe environment filled with respectful people."
College Junior,5,"Student housing is amazing at SAIC. Conveniently located (near food, shopping, classes) apartment-style housing; not just freshman live in dorms- there's really no stigma towards upper class men who still live in dorms. Clean rooms each with a bathroom and little kitchen."
College Junior,5,"I'm a transfer student from a big state college and coming to SAIC was the best decision I've ever made. If you want to be surrounded by passionate students and teachers and study/create in a welcoming environment, this is the school for you!"
College Sophomore,5,"I know graduating from this school can lead you into a successful art career. Although an art career itself is pretty difficult to pursue, this is one of the top schools to go to that aids in helping you follow that dream/goal."
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy all aspects of this school. I think it all depends on who teaches your class and how interactive the students are. I am finding myself to feel more comfortable and capable of perfecting my craft and my passion here.
College Sophomore,5,Some of the greatest artist and designers came from this school and they undersrand the hard work involved with achieving a great award such as a career in my purpose.
College Sophomore,5,I love the whole atmosphere of the campus and what it will garantee me after my graduation.
College Freshman,5,"The courses are interdisciplinary and promote experimenting, and the teachers know which direction to push you in, which is really helpful. It's good to discover something you like when you otherwise would probably never try it."
College Freshman,5,Security is around all the time.
College Freshman,5,I love the rooms! Very spacious and we have a bathroom and kitchenette. Space to store art and make art. What more could I want?
College Junior,5,"I love the university, and have definitely grown as an artist, writer, and person."
College Junior,5,The campus is very safe. You need a keycard to gain access to any of the buildings.
College Junior,5,"I've learned computer programming from the ground up. Futhermore, I have the freedom to explore various types of art while have advisors and professors that help me grow my practice."
College Freshman,5,24/7 accessible security. The main security issue at school that I have heard about is theft.
College Freshman,5,The professors are all very accessible and interesting to listen to
College Freshman,5,"I love the School of the Art Institute and am enjoying it very much. I find my classes interesting, and feel like I am actually gaining knowledge and skill sets relevant to my future career."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Challenging and thought provoking courses. Excellent, knowledgeable professors that are working in their field."
College Freshman,5,"SAIC is amazing!!! i have never felt so proud to do my art in my entire life! The staff makes you feel accepted and they really help you improve, expand, and hone in on your set of skills. Plus they aren't really strict on keeping your major, they let you change your mind in order to fit the kind of career that you want."
Recent Alumnus,5,We are one of the top programs for the arts in the states. Although at first I didn't understand why it was that well known. I slowly realized how amazing our facility and faculty were compared to many other programs out there. Through experiences of studying abroad and having chances of going into these different programs. I figured out how amazing SAIC was. I enjoy this school and its open mindedness towards the arts.
College Freshman,5,The Art Institute is a very well rounded school. The credit/no credit grading system is a great way for students to not stress over grades as heavily as they would at a normal university. Also there are no majors which allows students to pursue any interests that they have. The main reason behind my love for the school is i never have to make up my mind on what I'm going to pursue. Right now i am interested in abstract painting and drawing. But i am debating on changing to fashion and marketing next semester. The openness of the school is really what made me realize that this is where i need to go. The organization of the school is also like none other. The website is so easy to navigate and find what you need. The school also does a great job of making you feel wanted. At a normal university there are so many students and huge classrooms and the average class size for SAIC is about 24 students. They make everything personal and they really care for their students and they strive to help find a career for their students.
College Junior,5,"Extremely helpful with admissions, financial aid, class enrollment and pretty much every other department. The school reaches out to the student with deadlines and making sure every part of the process is done correctly and efficiently. Very passionate about their students and providing them with the best experience."
College Senior,5,Its great that theres studio space on the top floor of the dorms.
College Sophomore,5,"Located in downtown Chicago a couple blocks at most from campus buildings, the housing for The School Of The Art Institute Of Chicago is convenient, safe and has an overall social atmosphere. Dorms include a mini kitchen, full bathroom and lots of closet space. The buildings are kept clean by the staff and feature common areas with flatscreen tvs. Also included is a studio space, where students can not only work, but store their artwork."
College Freshman,5,"Honestly, our school has the best dorms.

First of all it is super clean. I think it is very important to have clean environment to live on and this school has very clean environment. The rooms are pretty big where each of us can have our own area where we don't get interrupt from each other. Also the security systems are good. There are always security guards who always check each floor. And because they are strict about coming into the building, strangers is not possible to come inside. Washing and drying machines are in 2 floors so, there are plenty of them. You don't have waiting time. they are all clean because there is genitor who always cleans them. Heater and air conditioner works well. There is computer room and printer. The printer does not work sometimes which is the worst part. Also there is some room where you can watch movies and spend time with people. And there is lounge every floor which is super nice. The very top of the dorm we have the huge studio. They even have a spray room. Most people do get what dorm they want and it is a easy process."
College Freshman,5,"You're in the city. You've got DePaul, UIC, UChicago, Roosevelt, Loyola, etc. There's also a ton of bars and nightclubs to go too, so take advantage of that!"
College Freshman,5,"It's Chicago! You've got all kinds of food, which is probably cheaper than the ridiculous prices of our school cafeterias! Feel free to try all types of food and make friends with people who like to eat what you wouldn't necessarily to eat."
College Freshman,5,"Great all around, except sports and greek life."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are mostly incredible, classes are interesting."
College Freshman,5,"Incredible! Tons of great options, range of prices, and totally convenient!"
College Junior,5,"Each focus has so many tools to get you where you need to, and to explore all the mediums that you can"
College Student,5,Very rigorous and challenging course to follow but it weeds out the good from the bet of potential gifted alumni
Sophomore,4,Love the location and the professors!  Definitely challenged me and I learned a lot. Was very overwhelmed at first.
Senior,4,"The best part about SAIC is the people: the faculty and the students. The artistically open and diverse environment facilitates intense intellectual and cultural exchanges. However, as it is a school with a pass/fail system and with no GPA, it is extremely easy to pass courses. What you get out of the school is what you put in."
Junior,4,"Photography Program is concept first, images second. This causes a problem for a lot of students, but also opens up new methods of thinking and considering art and practice. Given that the school's student body is almost entirely made up of those in a Studio practice, a formal education on history, social sciences, and many other important elements that make up conceptual art are not instructed. This, personally, caused problems for me since my practice is history-driven and relies on a very formal background and understanding of seemingly common-knowledge topics that many other students are unaware of"
Junior,4,"I love SAIC, I would like to see a decrease in tuition please. The tuition is the same price as Harvard. I know that art can be expensive but should it be as expensive as an Ivy-League school. Both are private schools, I understand, however, you have to think of what it means to become an artist and push forward in society. As graduate, I would have to worry about financial status and that can cause negativity towards the overall general mental health of students."
Niche User,4,"Diversity was perfect, You never felt like the odd one out when it came to the art and the choices to choose from. No matter what everyone was friendly and didn't judge. The vibe from the school was not as intimidating. Of course, it is a big, crowded city so it will be a bit wild on the streets as far as transportation but the campus buildings are close to each other, a perfect 5-minute walk between each other and the dorm rooms."
Niche User,4,"This school is aboslutly beautiful and it very connected to both the city life and the community within Chicago as well. You feel safe and right at home in the enviorment, and everyone there definitly seems happy to be there. The classes that are offered are very diverse and expansive, and the alumni there are increible as well. Great school overall!"
Sophomore,4,"I like the way that the program is structured, so that one doesn't have to choose a major and can try different things to benefit their artistic practice without the commitment. The downside is that it is expensive to attend (as most art schools are), and many students drop out the first year because of the lack of structure in the program."
Sophomore,4,"I've enjoyed my time so far at SAIC, it has a lot of nice resources and facilities. Course wise there are a lot of interesting options to choose from and a good range of different topics. The community as a whole is very politically correct which in most aspects is a good thing but the school itself is in this PC bubble that does not like to face the reality of some more pressing and realistic issues concerning student's futures. As a student, you definitely need to be focused and fully involved/ devoted to your practice if you want to make the most out of this institution."
Junior,4,"Coming for a small school district in the middle of no where, I enjoyed the range of mediums that the school teaches and offers. I also understand that the school tuition is high due to supplies cost being outrageous and being in the heart of Chicago, while still offering plenty of resources for students, such as dorms, health care, counseling and etc. I also love how open SAIC is to diversity and is a huge supporter of LGBT+ rights. My only critique of it, is that SAIC tries to push you to be an independent ""starving"" artist. I want a job after I graduate, but I have been fighting the system of becoming a solo artist. They also could push the need for more collaborations between departments."
Sophomore,4,"It's good, however, if you're entitled, lazy, or you just generally expect to be led by the hand through your education without having to work for anything on your own you probably shouldn't come here."
Alum,4,"The quality of the training you receive is hit or miss. All professors are required to be working artists and hold a degree of prominence in their medium. This is definitely a benefit, but some professors regard their time in the studio or classroom as a necessary evil to supplement their income. Living in downtown Chicago is an education unto itself and offers a student of fine arts and architecture a wealth of opportunities outside of the college experience. This school is not for the faint of heart, but by standing your ground and believing your work, you will reap the benefits within your program of study."
Graduate Student,4,"There is a wealth of knowledge and incredible access to processes and machinery to help get started on your art/design journey. I also find it incredibly well located, in the heart of Chicago's Loop, meaning that there is nothing that you need that you can not find close by."
Senior,4,"Awesome arts school, but definitely would not recommend unless you are truly a creative and open person. The environment is very friendly, everyone is warm and open. Teachers are great. Facilities are nice, but very limited on space - given it is the city. No overcrowding issues, and there are always enough classrooms, but there is no extra space left for lounging or working - aside from the cafeteria space that is always packed. My main complaint would just be the lack of work space for students."
Freshman,4,"SAIC is a great school, with great faculty that know what they are doing. I am part of the Fashion Program and absolutely love it. The social life is a bit weird, and you kind of have to be 21 to go out on the weekends. But if you don't mind staying in or just hanging out with friends its great! Being in the heart of Chicago makes for a lot of fun adventures."
Sophomore,4,"By mid-May I will have been enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) for two full years. It's definitely not your typical college experience--certainly not what I anticipated--but it's certainly been a journey. It hasn't been perfect, and there's improvements that need to be done, but I'm constantly learning and expanding my creative horizon."
Sophomore,4,I am having a blast! Honestly though I am stressed out about the ludicrous cost. I really hope this was the right decision. Most students are white or students that are studying abroad. I have yet to see more POC.
Sophomore,4,"This school provides a wonderful education for my field of interest (art therapy), and has other incredible departments as well. I have had no issues with the school's well delivered education in my past two years (although, freshman classes can be tough, but I think that is common anywhere). An issue I have with this school is mainly with the options and prices of food in the cafeteria. The food is average and incredibly over-priced in my opinion. Another thing that is difficult with SAIC is student life. I feel, as many of my peers at this school do as well, that it can be hard to make connections due to a lack of student life and activities. That is personal, however. Other than that, great school and above wonderful education."
Freshman,4,"It is a great art school that student can have full freedom. But sometimes it seems like it goes too far which especially shows on the critics. But in gerneral, it is a greate school. I love it!"
Junior,4,"Incredibly progressive and inclusive, the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming, very expensive but many valuable courses are offered"
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far at SAIC has been very eye opening. I have learned new things that I didn't think I would ever learn in my life. I have been exposed to a numerous amount of opportunities. I have met some amazing people along the way, and overall I have had a great experience!"
Freshman,4,"The school has pushed me to make art I never thought I would be able to make. It pushes me to develop my concepts and think about things I would have never considered before coming here. The academic classes are also the perfect amount of rigorous and the overall workload is always reasonable. It pushes you to take advantage of opportunities. The resources are incredible. Here, you get what you give."
Freshman,4,"SAIC is interdisciplinary, which allows me to study across my many interests.  The professors treat me as their peer and have taught me more than I could have expected. The resources are great. The only problem is how expensive the school is."
Junior,4,"Being a transfer student from Parsons Paris to SAIC I came with a very fresh outlook to how the school functioned and the overall feeling of the school.  The ambiance of the school overall is very artistic, much less corporate than what Parsons was. Facilities are amazing. Teacher are great, though sometimes I miss that some professors are not fully invested in their work outside of school. I feel that SAIC is filled with authentic fine artists, less people that see school as a path to make money but as a way to ultimately learn and grow as artists. In a way, there is something very sensible that makes SAIC unique."
Freshman,4,This school is absolutely amazing and well up to standards. The courses are expansive and flexible and they have the facilities and resources to match. The only downside would be the cost. This school is way too expensive and not easily accessible to poorer students looking to get an amazing education.
Freshman,4,SAIC is a great place to go if you're interested in the fine arts. Commercial art is hardly ever welcome here. You are literally tied into the museum so you have free access to AIC and a discount to most museums in Chicago. It is easy to stay busy but it is also very easy to get distracted. So many of the people are unique and inspiring. The teachers are encouraging but can tell if you put no effort whatsoever into a piece. There is a constant dialogue encouraged among students and faculty and critiques happen quite frequently. The city can be a little dangerous but SAIC helps you stay safe for the most part. Art kids party weird.
Freshman,4,"I really liked that there's no majors and the pass/fail system. The people who doesn't try to succeed, does not get to pass. It's pretty simple. There a lot of high-tech equipments and opportunities. The dorms are pretty clean and nice, very close to the school. I recommend Jones Hall a lot, it's really quiet, closest to the school, and red line & blue line is right around the corner. The cafeteria food is decent imo, a bit overpriced."
Junior,4,Your experience depends on the teacher you get and the classmates you get. It can be a wonderful experience. Very expensive so be sure to dedicate yourself completely to each class to get your money's worth. Make as many connections as possible during your time there.
College Senior,4,I enjoy the school and my courses.  SAIC is an art school so the focus in art and design is great and beneficial to what I would like to accomplish after graduation.  This is the best school for me.
College Junior,4,Most grads that I've met become artists. So the value is in the community you build.
College Junior,4,I've had teachers that have fought in many different ways. Some loved going on field trips and others didn't invest in it at all. but no matter what type of teacher I had they were always respectful and at least moderately helpful.
College Freshman,4,Haven't been there yet but I've seen them online and they look great. I've read reviews online from past and current students who always speak about how great it is.
College Junior,4,"For the most part, SAIC is ethnically/racially diverse; they try their best to accepting of all backgrounds."
College Sophomore,4,"The same as any other college, some people party and do drugs, others don't. Everyone has fun with each other and usually is no drama."
College Sophomore,4,"Love living in the city, safe & close to everything."
College Freshman,4,Everyone on campus is kind and accepting and everyone seems to get along. The classes are challenging and like real life in their expectations.
College Freshman,4,The school is a wonderful and supportive environment and I love being able to interact with people that have similar interests and the classroom environments are engaging and accepting
College Sophomore,4,"I dont see many athletes attending. Students gifts are based or the quality of a design or other art related careers, but it will prepare some for sports in their liking."
College Sophomore,4,"I start school july 11 and i have been to 2 open houses. I have meet all the fasion teachers and they have really good personalities, they want to make sure we all succeed and they will be there to help us in any way"
College Freshman,4,"This school really isn't for everyone, but I feel that it is a good fit for me because I am open to new experiences as well as experimenting with different mediums. Some people come here just for one medium and are unwilling to try others, and those kinds of people will have a harder time."
College Freshman,4,Our school does its best to assure we all feel safe to attend school within the city.
College Sophomore,4,I love it here and I love my department. The problems we experience are met with students and faculty who push to fix them. I wish it cost less or there was more financial aid/scholarship opportunities for out of state people but also by department.
College Sophomore,4,SAIC has serious name recognition. People like to say they aren't confident in SAIC's ability to land them a job but ultimately it is the student's responsibility to work and look for a job with the help of the school's career services. I've made a lot of connections with professional artists (my professors and otherwise) as well as business people in the city and I'm only two years into school. You have to be working for it. There are hundreds of us at the school. You aren't going to have your future served to you on a silver platter.
College Sophomore,4,Our security staff is fantastic and 24 hours. Almost all of them are incredibly friendly and caring. When I was having serious roommate problems I was having a breakdown and one of the women saw how upset I was and went out of her way to comfort me and assure me while we waiting for campus life staff to arrive. I can never forget that and am forever grateful to her.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm very lucky to have most of my classes in a fantastic department with fantastic professors who care about their students and their work. If I wasn't within the fibers department, this school might drive me crazy. There are definitely some elitist people who have always gotten everything they want and thus act entitled. There could be better financial aid and there could be more diversity within the curriculum of all departments. People can be racist, ableist, transphobic, etc., but there are a lot of people fighting to change that and should be changing within the next semester."
College Sophomore,4,Most of the professors that I have encountered have been very helpful and knowledgable.
College Sophomore,4,There isn't much of a community but the dorm facilities are really great.
College Sophomore,4,"While SAIC has it's problem, the institution is doing its best do provide interdisciplinary art education, which is the most desired in current art industry. 

The fashion program in the school, which sadly isn't as famous as other fashion programs such as FIT or Parsons, is top notch. The professors will really push you to expand your ideas and construct a unique garment with an unconventional  silhouette and sufficiently researched concept."
College Sophomore,4,SAIC is a very good school.
College Student,4,"friendly peers and staff, welcoming, creative individuals. If I had to choose the school that I attend now I would because of its diversity and creativity."
College Sophomore,4,"They offer a variety of courses, but not all of them are worth the money spent for that credit. By this I mean that they offer yoga classes, and movie watching classes. Not very effective use of time or money. Plus, I doubt anyone would consider this experience for a job."
College Sophomore,4,"Well, the amount of effort you put into your work, can dictate your future. Although it also has to do with connections. Being in the art field is a crap shoot, as you are competing against current, former, and future art students for income and a stable career."
College Sophomore,4,It has been an amazing experience so far.
College Freshman,4,"It seems to be that alumni have a lot of career options, and the school definitely makes an effort to educate you on  the possibilties for your future."
College Freshman,4,"The courses that i've has so far have mostly provided me with many new skills. I've had some awesome professors as well who have been very helpful and attentive to individual questions. The variety of course options is great as well, and there's many i'm eager to take, however some are hard to get into due to small class sizes."
College Freshman,4,"So far my experience here has been wonderful. I've found that my teachers are for the most part very educated and easy to interact with and go to for help, and my classes have helped spark many new interests, as well as pushed me to explore mediums I never would've expressed interest in before. The interdisciplinary setup for this school is perfect for me as I have many interests and view my future goals as a mystery as of now, and would be very uncomfortable declaring a major and having to stick to that for my college career. I feel that SAIC is helping me evolve into a more well rounded person with stronger abilities not only in my processes but also my way of thinking, and I would pick this school again 100% of the time if given the choice to start over."
Recent Alumnus,4,I'm sure there are lots of places willing to hire a grad from SAIC
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors are very knowledgable about art and life
Recent Alumnus,4,Admissions made me feel comfortable
College Junior,4,There are a lot of resources for students to ensure they are safe and healthy.
College Junior,4,I have really loved most of my professors so far and I like the atmosphere of the classrooms. I feel that the professors really care about their students individual success and are always available to help you out with almost anything you are having trouble with. The classes are also all very interesting and diverse.
Freshman,2,The best thing about the school were the facilities and I felt that the workload prevented me from making the best use of them. The other students were pretentious and I felt extremely alienated. The work I saw upperclassmen producing was a joke considering how ‘prestigious’ and expensive this school is.
College Junior,2,There are student groups for activities such as dancing and yoga but it's an art school. There are no sports teams or facilities.
College Junior,2,It's an art school. They don't have that sort of thing except for clubs.
College Junior,2,"Originally I thought that the facilities, courses offered, professors and the overall prestige of the school would be worth the amount of money it costs. However, the amount of money cannot be justified and has caused a lot of regret. And once I realized it wasn't worth it, it was too late because the school's courses are so unique that the credits won't transfer anyways."
College Freshman,2,"Not great facilities and almost no teams (the few that exist are clubs), but theres virtually no demand because most people don't have time for sports."
College Junior,2,Need a lot more money for grad students
College Freshman,2,"We don't have sports, but we do have a work out room"
College Senior,2,Not many scholarships available through the school. For being such an expensive school there should be a whole lot more opportunities to make it affordable.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's in the middle of nowhere and there are just buildings around the area, so I would have to rate poorly on this one."
College Junior,2,"This is a great school if you're looking to become a fine artist. Not the school for me, and I still valued my time here."
College Sophomore,2,There is a major display of extremes in terms of diversity
College Sophomore,2,we dont really have sports teams although there is a rock climbing group
College Junior,2,Downtown shuts down really early.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's alright, but I wish that it was easier and they helped  me out through it more."
College Freshman,2,"No one here does sports i mean it's art school, sports aren't even offered. We have one gym in our dorms but a lot of people here are health nuts and get gym memberships somewhere outside of the dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"Chicago weather is really tough! Very cold in the winter, very hot in the summer, and lots and lots and crazy temperature jumps and drops."
College Student,2,There's not much for those under 21 years old.
College Student,2,The summers are hot and humid and the winters are brutal if your not well adjusted to the humidity and how that effects the temperature. 
College Freshman,2,"Security personnel at buildings require ID to enter but I never see ""campus police.""  There are Chicago PD officers around sometimes."
College Senior,2,Considering the buildings are not too far away from one another the block and a half walk isn't too bad too and fro classes. Chicago only has two seasons though and the when it's winter it is cold and rainy and isn't too pleasant. 
Alum,1,"As a Veteran of the Army, I was discriminated against. My transcripts were withheld intentionally so that  I could not get a job or admission into graduate school. Their actions were racially motivated. The school kids about alumni and the school and the faculty are white collar criminals and the school should be shut down."
Alum,1,The single greatest mistake of my life. Zero stars. Racist bigots giving unqualified whites a leg up and discriminating against Africa-American Army Veterans.
Junior,1,"RUN! After a year of classes with two scholarships and perfect academics, atop maxing out all grants, loans, and working while in school, a $2000 (now like $5500) balance prevented me from continuing coursework!  I emailed the Dean, Headmaster, and everyone that could help. Not even a ""sorry"". Nothing.

-My credit is ruined
-My otherwise flawless academic career is useless because they won't send official transcripts allowing me to transfer until I pay a ridiculous collection agency (not even part of the federal program). 
-I can't pay the balance due because I can't get a job, because I don't have a degree, because I don't have $5k to pay the balance.  

What started as means for a better life for myself has paralyzed my ability to survive. It's a horrible reality."
Junior,1,"SAIC preaches for diversity, but there isn't much real diversity. About all the teachers I had at SAIC were white except for one asian professor I had. About all the security guards who weren't in administrative position were POC except for maybe couple of them. 
The school is feeding off of rich white students, and international students who pay out of pocket."
Recent Alumnus,1,We don't any sports teams but we do have a fitness place
College Junior,1,"This is an art school, so there are no major athletic teams."
College Junior,1,"People here do not care whatsoever about ""greek"" life."
College Junior,1,Does not exist at art school.
College Sophomore,1,No one drives to school. No one parks downtown. Don't do it.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have one. I don't care.
College Freshman,1,I do not do anything
College Junior,1,"Kinda uptight, too many young people to worry about."
College Junior,1,"Super cold in the winter, really humid in the summer"
College Junior,1,"No sports programs, its an art school"
College Junior,1,We don't athletics except for the groups students put together
College Freshman,1,I'm from Southern California and now living in Chicago -- it's bloody cold.  The wind kills you.
College Freshman,1,"I've had a ton of issues with network and slow computer.  The school requires all students to have a particular size and spec of Mac laptops, but we pay for them with tuition fees (somewhat reduced rate) with loaded software but not everything you want."
College Freshman,1,No Greek presence at this school.
College Sophomore,1,So expensive because we are downtown and we do not have a parking lot!  Street parking is ridiculously high!  There is not one free parking spot anywhere.
College Senior,1,"Being an art school there is not much devoted in term of sports. There are a couple of gyms in the dorms, but they are very limited and students that don't live in the dorms do not have access to them."

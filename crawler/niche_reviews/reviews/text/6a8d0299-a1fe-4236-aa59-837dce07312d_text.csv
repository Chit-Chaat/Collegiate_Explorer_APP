Alum,5,"I didn't take online classes, but so much of class was a mixture of offline and online - some professors uploaded their lectures. So much communication was online. As a University, I always got the sense that Berkeley listened to feedback - and was always trying to improve."
Alum,5,"The most wonderful, enriching, and enlivening four years of my life. I look back at my time at Berkeley with so much fondness - the chill of the Bay Area air, walking down Telegraph, the (amazing) food, drinking hot tea in cafes at night, going to football games, exploring San Francisco, and just laying on Memorial Glade. My classes challenged me - and altered my perception to this day. And I'm still in touch with many of my professors. I loved my time there, and I can't recommend Berkeley enough."
Freshman,5,"The professors are extremely approachable and teach the content in an incredibly informational, yet engaging way."
Niche User,5,Online experience just as good as in class since the teachers seem to have no issues with technological savvyness.
Niche User,5,It was an amazing campus to visit with lots of history and culture as well as enthusiastic students and great majors. Gives a lot of opportunities
Senior,5,"Using Zoom and B-courses online for classes, I have more time to explore volunteer opportunities in the medicine field before I apply for medical school."
Alum,5,I think overall the professors did a great job for making courses accessible online as well as providing students with the help they needed.
Alum,5,"Very challenging experience overall, but students are always very motivated and passionate. In terms of academics, there isn't any hand-holding from faculty and every course (in STEM at least) is incredibly competitive. However, that really forces you to self-teach and stay on top of your academics. In terms of ROI, it really depends on what you make of it - there are lots of opportunities. The campus population is diverse, however there tends to be more orgs which have more of one specific race or gender.  What I was most dissatisfied with is probably the dorm/housing as cost is extremely high for lower quality housing."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus itself, its passionate students, and the highly knowledgeable professors and staff."
Senior,5,"I took some classes online after COVID became widespread. UC Berkeley put a lot of effort into transitioning there classes to online instruction and I feel like we barley skipped a beat. Professors were still available for office hours, there were still plenty of TA office hours and other support mechanisms in place, and the ability to review some lectures on my own time and to participate with another group during live discussion sections made the best use of the online dynamic that I could imagine."
Sophomore,5,"Berkeley has an amazing diversity of students along with a variety of classes. Especially as a cs major, the exclusive lab classes and engineering experiences makes me prepared for industry interviews as long as critical thinking skills. Though on the downslide, the downtown area lacks security and safety."
Sophomore,5,"Almost all my classes were online, but the professors and gsis did their best to keep thr quality of classes up high such as holding virtual lab classes or more online office hours. However, there were restrictions as discussions were hold over zoom which led fellow students to be disincentivised to actively participate."
Sophomore,5,"I love love love this institution, there are so many opportunities to take part in at first it may seem overwhelming but everyone seems to find their rhythm. The dorms were very much not luxurious but I made some of the best memories in my life in the unit 3 buildings. Everyone is super friendly and has such cool experiences to share!"
Junior,5,"I  have never been so excited to begin a new chapter in my life. As a transfer student, I kept my goals realistic and could have only dreamed about being accepted into one of the world's greatest universities. Go Bears!"
Junior,5,"My professors have been extremely helpful with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. They often reach out to me to explain things further, or to answer any questions before I even ask them!"
Senior,5,"I've loved attending UC Berkeley. There is a certain feeling about being on a campus with such significant history that makes you feel important. I love the area and the people, and the professors are incredible (for the most part)."
Freshman,5,"Great school, and I’m excited to be a part of it. Has great school culture and welcoming freshman has been great."
Freshman,5,Professors hold regular office hours to chat with students individually and in groups. Very helpful for learning and building connections.
Freshman,5,"Excellent school. Very good academics and decent athletics. School culture is great. Highly ranked, number 1 in my degree, with great proximity to Silicon Valley."
Junior,5,excellent college experience. the campus and the location are ideal. a very new and different experience.
Junior,5,excellent college experience. the campus and the location is ideal. a very new and different experience.
Alum,5,"Specifically regarding UC Berkeley's College of Letters and Science, the Economics department and International Area Studies have really talented, innovative and renown professors active in the field. I've also met a number of GSI's (graduate student instructors) who really knew what they were doing, adding valuable support during my academic experience. One of the best takeaways from my college experience was the Political Economy major where I was able to put together a personalized program of studies with a chosen concentration and mix of courses. This allowed me to have interdisciplinary training in economics, development studies, sociology, history, etc. A drawback would be that while upper division courses and graduate classes provide a high level of academics, the lower division coursework and prerequisite classes are large in size, too broad and unnecessarily competitive."
Senior,5,I took classes online once COVID-19 hit. The professors were accomodating in the classes I took for Spring 2020 semester.
Alum,5,"I only took one lecture course online but the lab was still in person. It was actually preferable to in person classes and the platform for watching lectures, completing assignments, and taking tests was very easy to understand and use."
Alum,5,"Most of my classes utilized Canvas (online learning platform) to share readings, resources, and miscellaneous opportunities. Course capture really helped me pull through those heavy semesters. Most lectures, at least in large classes, are recorded and posted online. An amazing resource if you can't make lecture or if you want to review notes. The online resources are pretty on point. Most professors have their own website or a reliable way of contacting them online."
Senior,5,"I took classes online during the coronavirus pandemic (and I took one class online before that). I am happy with my experience of online classes. I never felt alone in my studies, and the professors provided ample resources for me to learn."
Freshman,5,"How often do individuals come across the roads of their dream? How often do humans conglomerate to become the best in the world? Should I watch the air bender? Go to Berkeley, and the answer will be yes"
Freshman,5,It is incredible and diverse up here. But where can I get to the parties? Much be in real person! The rest is a bunch of mumbo jumbo
Junior,5,So far so good. It is online so I am not on campus yet. I am enjoying my experience so far and hoping covid finishes soon so I can get online.
Junior,5,It has been very very good and I am pleased with it. I wish I could take all my classes online but still do research!
Senior,5,"Due to Covid-19, many universities had to switch to a fully online model. I will say there were some difficulties, but the transition to such was very efficient and generous from my professors of the industrial engineering department. Not only did they put extra effort into more office hours and availability, they introduced projects and collaborations that allowed us to work with our fellow students and even prominent companies. The ability to make a course malleable and flow well with the changes brought on by this pandemic has given me a greater appreciation for Berkeley and my professors."
Sophomore,5,"Due to the Coronavirus situation, all classes were moved online starting in mid-March.  The professors handled the transition very smoothly and professionally, and I was still able to gain the knowledge necessary to succeed in my classes."
Sophomore,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at UC Berkeley.  Although courses are very challenging, every course I have taken has definitely been beneficial to my field of study."
Sophomore,5,The professors and staff at Berkeley aim to make our learning experience at Berkeley a successful one. I have had the best learning experience.
Sophomore,5,University of California Berkeley's rigorous courseload and diverse student body make it a great place to learn and live.
Senior,5,I loved the campus. I loved the amount of resources and opportunities there are for students. The professors are incredible and the graduate student instructors will go out of their way to help students understand.
Freshman,5,"The transition was smooth, and I didn't lose any lecture or discussion time. In fact, I had to move out of my dorm room mid semester so I missed some of my lectures, lab, and discussion, but was able to catch up on them when I had time because it was all recorded. That was a relief. It's been pretty stressful, but the professors and TAs have been very accommodating at Berkeley."
Freshman,5,"Classes are very demanding and the students are exceptional. It could have been intimidating, but I felt inspired by them, and it motivated me to push myself and dig deeper. As a CS major, I got worked my freshman year and it was painful, but I learned a lot and developed a better study ethic. Dorm food really sucked."
Junior,5,"I love UC Berkeley. I have never regretted my choice since coming here — though I had initial qualms about coming to Berkeley because of its competitive and academically driven reputation, I have seriously come to love this school in so many aspects. It drives you, builds up good character... The people are truly what make up this campus, and it is truly up to you how much you want to get from this school. If you choose to come here, your experience can be as rewarding as you want, as long as you put in the effort. I also love the campus. Campus is beautiful; I don't know why other people talk down on it so much. Our buildings have so much personality — each one has its own unique quirks. And Berkeley is truly such a college town!"
Niche User,5,"UC Berkeley is a school that many people in my family have graduated from, they had a wide variety of courses that anyone can take. The campus is absolutely gorgeous with its big range of diversity; it is an overall amazing school that anyone with the right portfolio should apply to."
Sophomore,5,One of the best schools in the country. Negative stereotypes are largely false and the school has a truly unique culture and spirit. Great balance of academic and fun stuff and opportunities here are limitless. So many great professors in so many departments and plenty of research opportunities.
Sophomore,5,"Diverse and unique! Beautiful campus with lots of history, lots of spirited and passionate professors."
Junior,5,"The University of California Berkeley is unlike any other public university that offers seemingly countless opportunities for academic, professional, and social growth. The faculty at UC Berkeley include many of the brightest and most innovative in their fields - this is particularly true of STEM. Within STEM majors faculty include several nobel laureates and countless pioneers."
Freshman,5,"The amount of support is incredible, and the available resources are also plentiful. The community of Civil Engineers is really tight and helpful too."
Niche User,5,"Safer lighting at night, especially if you are walking alone in the streets late at night. Otherwise, the school is a great place for current and future students alike. Great buildings, and excellent dorms and student services."
Alum,5,"I loved going to Berkeley It is a University full of intelligent, critical thinkers focused on social justice and change. They have some of the best professors and academics in the entire country. Tuition is affordable for in state residents and they have an abundance of student programs for those who have financial needs. The campus is beautiful and nestled at the foot of the Berkeley hills.  The city of Berkeley is laid back and close to major cities like Oakland and San Francisco."
Junior,5,I love Cal. It has changed my life for the better in every way. The campus is beautiful. The courses are vigorous and inspirational. The student body is active and engaged and ready to change the world. The professors and graduate students are wonderful and I cannot say enough how amazing this school is.
Junior,5,"Amazing variety of classes and majors. Professors are very professional and helpful. The amount of support they give to undocumented students is very helpful to me. In addition, this university has a lot of resources to assure students are being helped. Whether with housing, financially, medical health."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed the progressive environment, the friendly competition, and open communication. I would like to see the bioengineering department provide more organized and informative classes."
Graduate Student,5,My experience was great. A great program for architects called MAAD with diverse and open minded people. Job opportunities at Silicon Valley.
Alum,5,"I have bittersweet memories of Berkeley. From late nights studying and stressing over finals because everyone is competitive and teachers curve the tests. A typical A becomes a B when everyone scores really well on exams. However, I found a group of friends that accept me with all my quirks and loud personality. It was truly an international school as I met people from all over the world with upbringing and perspectives."
Sophomore,5,"i love berkeley ! there are many amazing professors and opportunities to work under them as a research apprentice which has been a very valuable resource for me. i do, however, wish that they would be more liberal with financial aid distribution as it is a very expensive institution with even more expensive residential expenses that i feel are not accurately taken into account when distributing financial aid."
Niche User,5,I like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!vI like the campus!I like the campus!vI like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!vI like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!I like the campus!
Freshman,5,"UC Berkeley is definitely an experience that you make it to be! It is so easy to feel lost in such a large school but take the time to make connections, meet new people, and talk to others and it'll be a worthwhile experience!"
Alum,5,I loved the University so much. It was a great experience for a four-year undergraduate out of high school. I enjoy the student organizations and the rigor of the classes. It was an eye-opening experience and definitely one of the top-rated universities in the world.
Junior,5,"Being Latina and a first generation student I was ecstatic to attend UC Berkeley last fall due to the diverse student population. It is great to see a community of students that look just like me and studying alongside them in the classroom. Although this school is mostly progressive, I would like to see more diversity in terms of a political spectrum. Being a political science myself i love to see inclusion even though our society today is very mixed in terms of ideologies. Overall UC Berkeley has been the University of my dreams and I am glad I am able to attend the Number one Public University in the United States."
Niche User,5,It is a very welcoming campus and is very clean. The faculty is very caring and sweet. The people there are very helpful and I enjoy visiting the campus. The campus is always clean and looks to be taken care of. There are a lot of places to go around the college and many places to eat and visit.
Freshman,5,Pretty cool. Life on campus is lavish besides the work. The people are nice and local. The professors are down to earth and will help to be accountable. As long as you stay on your path Berkeley will see you off amazing.
Freshman,5,"I wouldn't want to be anywhere other than UC Berkeley. I originally wanted to go to an ivy, but I am so pleased that it didn't turn out that way. UC Berkeley is full of diversity, inclusion, love, passion, and intelligence. It's evident that each student worked extremely hard to get here and is continuing to do the hard work to stay here. I would applaud a Berkeley graduate over an ivy grad because of the heart of this school and the difficulty of the classes. It isn't that the classes are so difficult because the teachers want to be hard; the classes are taught by phenomenal professors who want us to do our very best. The community of the school is amazing too. From our world-acclaimed meme page to the bonding of ""go bears!"", Berkeley is a community like no other."
Junior,5,Best university in the world. So much life experience packed into one place. Ignore the naysayers. This is the campus of the future and starting block for the race to greatness!
Junior,4,"So far all classes have been online, although a hybrid program is being piloted next month for classes of smaller size. So far I have had only positive experiences, even with lab courses that would require hands-on experience (they are doing their best to compensate with virtual labs and videos)."
Junior,4,"There are a lot of resources but accessibility often depends on your major (larger departments being harder). I have only encountered courteous and knowledge staff so far, but I am also coming in as a transfer which isn't always mentioned or accounted for in classes or social events. Of course everything is different right now in this COVID-19 era, to which all of my staff has adjusted to just fine. Lectures and recordings are well done, high quality; there is some leniency when it comes to assignments and deadlines; teachers so try to engage even Zoom and encourage collaboration among students. There is definitely an air of competitiveness among the student population despite a lot of students suffering from depression, anxiety and imposter syndrome. Plenty of students are also very concerned with the P/NP option for the semester during the pandemic, and of course the lack of change in tuition amount (it has not been reduced basically). The campus is beautiful, the city is a bubble."
Freshman,4,"As expected, online learning is very different from what I have grown to know, but the community in Berkeley has allowed this transition to become so much smoother! The professors are so understanding and practical! The counselors and student ambassadors are very accommodating and helpful!"
Senior,4,"As a minority senior Transfer student from a 2-year college, I felt that 2 years in Berkeley were not enough to build a strong networking foundation for career development. However, I do reckon that UC Berkeley has provided a lot of opportunities and support throughout the semesters to guide us through."
Junior,4,"It has been pretty smooth and painless. In the beginning it started of bumpy but the challenges ironed themselves out pretty fast, repetition is really the perfect teacher."
Junior,4,"It has been amazing, I really love it so far looking forward to the next 2 years of life here. Now I can't say it has been perfect but most truly fulfilling adventures are not without hardships, because that's what makes the journey memorable."
Freshman,4,"Online school has also been easy to keep up with and I'm still learning effectively at home. Some professors are still figuring out formatting and technical issues, but it's very reasonable given the circumstances."
Senior,4,"Great academic program, lots of resources available to help students. Large number of students makes it easy to get lost in the crowd and fall behind if you're not self motivated."
Sophomore,4,"When the semester went online because of the Covid-19 pandemic, all of my classes were moved online. Teachers were generally understanding but the material remains rigorous and professors did not show much grading slack. They still expected a lot from their students but were also willing to help through Zoom office hours and such. In some of my courses, I found that online learning did actually help me participate more and ask questions but for most I miss being in the large lecture halls and the overall college experience."
Senior,4,"It’s obvious that intelligence is here in abundance (both students and professors) but with that also comes extreme competition and a difficult atmosphere to navigate as a freshman. Berkeley can be scary - no doubt- but once you find your group (i recommend getting involved - CLUBS, Study groups! something) it’s a great and inspiring place to be."
Senior,4,During these unprecedented times my professors showed flexibility and determination to ensure we had some access to resources and help that we needed while online
Freshman,4,I haven't taken any classes online yet but I am about to probably take an entire semester online. I have no doubts that Berkeley will be able to pull it off seamlessly.
Sophomore,4,"I have only been at the university for about a year, but so far I would say my experience is pretty good. I have formed a tight community and are exploring my passions. The campus is beautiful and it is filled with various forms of expression. No matter what you have an interest in, I am sure you can find a community that pursues it at Berkeley."
Sophomore,4,"The shift to online learning was a bit rough but professors were pretty understanding in prioritizing the student experience. Even though it wasn't ideal, the situation was handled efficiently and with great care for its students."
Senior,4,I like how this school provided an environment for me where I was forced to gain independence and grow from difficult times.
Freshman,4,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I took parts of my courses online. The GSIs were helpful during this time and they were available for anything, whether it be for academics or just someone to talk to. Although the courses here are challenging and grade deflation is a thing, I've had a good time during my time here."
Freshman,4,"I like that there is a lot of diversity at UC Berkeley. However, the clubs are quite selective and I would like the see that change."
Junior,4,"I have found the transition to Zoom easy, with little learning curves. I also feel like the quality of summer classes have improved greatly since instructors had time to prepare, as opposed to having to abruptly change plans during the spring semester."
Junior,4,"I love studying at UC Berkeley because I am able to surround myself with such a bright, driven community. Although the campus environment is not without problems, such as frequent safety issues and a housing crisis, I am lucky that the benefits I get from being a Cal student outweigh the negatives. Overall, Berkeley has a rigorous quality of education that is pricey but held to a standard, even if the professors can be unrelentingly strict and punitive at times. Overall, I appreciate being a student here because all of the hurdles that UC Berkeley throws at its students push them to become stronger and more resilient."
Alum,4,"It is a huge university and so it is hard to stand out and not get lost in the crowd. However, it has so many clubs, organizations, resources, and opportunities that many smaller schools do not have. Make sure to take advantage of this and to network."
Niche User,4,"If I were to rate this place, I would give it a 4 star liking record, it has a very good campus, a wonderul dorm experience and an excellent academic standing."
Graduate Student,4,"The UC Berkeley campus itself is one of my favorite aspects of the university- the landscape and the abundance of nature is what I love about the campus since it is easy to find an outdoor study space where you will be able to concentrate and enjoy nature, or if you wish to simply decompress between classes. Since UC Berkeley is such a large institution, it may be difficult to navigate the resources on campus; something I would change would be the accessibility of those resources for students. Students should be able to navigate the multiple available resources on campus in a simplified manner other than having to figure out which resources would be applicable to them."
Senior,4,"My experience at UC Berkeley has been good, and I am thankful for the opportunities I have had to gain research experience and learn from professors who are experts in the field. I am inspired by my fellow students' passion for their studies and for the things that they care about."
Alum,4,"lots of clubs to join and enhance your experience at Cal. Definitely try to talk to upper classmen, GSIs, and professors to help navigate your experience!"
Senior,4,"I am proud to go here, the prestigious chemistry, biology, and computer sciences, ethnic studies program, the groundbreaking research and the education that is provided. It is a historical university and I am proud to be a part of it. I do not like the lack of support and resources for BIPOC students, that the resources are mostly provided by student run organizations or underfunded recruitment and retention centers. I also do not like how some of the professors (mostly STEM) do not teach well because they are so focused on their research, but I have had many amazing professors."
Junior,4,"I did not willingly choose to take any online classes but due to COVID-19 and having to switch to online learning, I do think that many professors handled the transition gracefully and they were able to assist students in this stressful time. Many professors adjusted the lesson plans and standards for the class to make things easier and less stressful."
Sophomore,4,"Lots of resources, and very easy to find  a small community. State of the art resources and caring professors"
Senior,4,Berkeley is an amazing school! I find myself being challenged both in education and emotion (being far from home) but I can attest to Berkeley's myriad of interesting and empathetic students and staff.
Junior,4,"The administration is fairly competent in regards to meeting student's educational needs. However, advising is not where it should be in regards to the amount of letters and science students that are not given comparable advising to those in say the college of chemistry."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful and the professors are very helpful. You learn a lot and even if it is confusing or difficult, the professors are always ready to help in their office hours. It is very rigorous, but also very rewarding. There are many resources available to students for all sorts of needs and they have been very helpful. Another great thing about Cal is that communication with administration, professors, and anyone really, is encouraged. If you have a problem, almost always will you find someone to help you solve it. The surrounding area around campus, however, is not as wonderful. There are many food places which is really nice, but I would recommend going with a group of friends especially at night. There are nice resources such as Bear Walk to help you feel safe when you are alone at night, but it is always good to remain vigilant."
Sophomore,4,"My online experience, while not ideal, was still fairly good. Some of my professors held Zoom meetings, and it was admittedly harder to get in the academic mood while at home, but at the same time I felt more engaged in lectures. What was actually very helpful was office hours. Before it was harder to attend due to the location of office hours or time conflicts, but it was much easier to tune in and have my questions answered. For professors that did not hold Zoom meetings, they posted video lectures and it was nice to be able to watch in faster speeds yet still learn."
Sophomore,4,My first year at Berkeley was a great experience. I was able to join many clubs and activities while still maintaining a good academic standing at Berkeley.
Freshman,4,I really love the campus and general berkeley area! There is lots to do and its absolutely stunning. The weather is also very nice year around. Furthermore academics are hard but you will definitely learn!! I love hoe spirited the school is and how many traditions we have. It really unites the student body. If you are interested in Greek life its there for you but not so prominent that you have to join. I would recommend getting involved though because the rigorous academics can take a toll on some people and its important to have a positive support system. A lot of people get sucked into GPA competition and a lot of negativity.
Freshman,4,I don't like online learning but of all the other universities I have heard about Berkeley actually did a pretty good job. It is not ideal to learn remotely but the  professors were often very understanding and generous with grades.
Senior,4,"I think that Berkeley did it's best with adjusting to online format, but it really cannot compare to the in person experience of being a student. Teachers were all still very easy to reach, but I much prefer live lecture and classroom setting. I also miss being in that environment where all your peers are working hard and everyone is studying. Remote learning does not provide that atmosphere."
Freshman,4,"University of California, Berkeley has a great campus as well as amazing professors. Campus is always buzzing with a fast paced energy, with everyone on the go."
Niche User,4,"University of California - Berkeley was a very mind blowing school. It has a great campus with a great community of students and staff. It has many things to do there, such as joining a club, meeting new friends, and going to class! I love this school and can't wait to experience more of it next year! The school has beautiful trees and patches of grass to look at! And also beautiful buildings to study at! Recommended college!"
Freshman,4,I liked the variety of courses and clubs offered. I would like to see better student life and safety.
Freshman,4,"UC Berkeley has a commitment to education and research, and it's reflected in the rigor of its courses."
Niche User,4,"UC Berkeley, both the campus and the city, was an experience like no other. The courses were challenging and the people were unique and intellectual in ways that helped you grow as an individual. The housing situation is unfortunate, but many students get by and tap into resources available both on- and off-campus."
Freshman,4,"This school sits in the heart of urban life. Here, one finds world class professors conducting world class research. The students are boldly passionate and active. The competition is tremendous, demanding much from it students. Some ways that the university could improve is expanding its housing options so that all students can be guaranteed housing."
Senior,4,International community is not properly addressed. Many recourses like scholarships are not very accessible for international students.
Alum,4,"I'm not going to lie, it was hard to get through Berkeley. As a first-gen college student, I did not feel prepared compared to my peers. My high school didn't have APs. I never saw a lot of the material that was presented to me. But, I got through it and having that UC Berkeley degree made finding a job easier."
Senior,4,"Great faculty, difficulty signing up for required classes. Research professors before applying as some could have teaching methods that you're not interested in. Big on diversity and freedom of speech. Lovely city to reside in."
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed my first year at UC berkeley. I made some very supportive friends and living in the dorms provided me with a good community. The school overall is excellent. It's always trying to improve. What would help is if they would pay lecturers and GSIs more and also stop with the grade deflation.
Junior,4,"You are immersed in very academically driven student population that pushes you to learn more as motivation. Great professors, student groups and campus life."
Freshman,4,I enjoy attending UC Berkeley because of the diversity on campus. I like knowing that there are students who identity as I do and can connect with.
Freshman,4,"I am currently an out of state freshman at Berkeley over halfway through my second semester. I was wary of having high expectations of Berkeley and buying into the cultivated image of perfect inclusion, challenging and inspiring intellectualism, and care for social justice/activism.  Even though I tried to manage my expectations, they were disappointed. THAT BEING SAID, I'm glad I am a student at Berkeley. It is the best and the worst, wonderful and terrible, and for me, that feels like a fairly accurate representation of how the world is today. If you would describe yourself as an idealistic person, yes, come to Berkeley! But be prepared to hold onto your values tightly."
Niche User,4,"being that i am super passionate about environmental science, I love how in tune they are with environmental issues happening nowadays. First of all, all over the campus they have automatic solar powered trash cans that are divided into plastics/cans, composts and landfills. This shows that they are taking steps to help the environment by first using solar power instead of standard electricity for trash cans and promoting recycling. Also i love how it feel like a small forest with all of the trees all over campus. It is so peaceful."
Alum,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere on campus and felt like I had a good education. Most of the professors are very helpful if you make the effort to get to know them. Difficult courses that require a lot of hard work but doable. Would like to see more student support resources (housing, mental health, food insecurity, etc.)."
Freshman,4,It is a really cool place. There are cool things to do and cool places to go. The classes are super cool and the dorms are cool too. The coolest part is meeting cool people and getting to work with cool professors.
Freshman,4,"Overall Berkeley is an amazing school. It's not as stressful as everyone says it is, and if you join clubs there's always activities to go to. Being at such a large school has its benefits, and the school spirit here is great. Classes are impacted and housing is difficult to secure, but I still love Cal."
Freshman,4,Clean Campus. Engaged Student Life. Welcoming on Campus. Heavy Academics. Great Student resources. On-Campus housing could improve. Surrounding area could be improved upon.
Freshman,4,"Cal has a huge campus with many great restaurants in the area.  You can bike or walk on campus, with beautiful scenery and enormous libraries that you can study in 24 hours. Although the environment is very competitive academically, you can take your mind off studying joining one of the hundred of clubs and organizations on campus."
Freshman,4,"I am in love with the environment of Berkeley and how strong the community of students is. Although, they are much more pretentious and prone to the same ignorance that most universities inhabit behind closed doors."
Freshman,4,"The university has some of the most brilliant and amazing people. I always feel as though I am able to learn a lot more from my peers as I interact with more people. I genuinely believe, however, that the institution has created a political environment too strong for most to handle as they have continuously created strong political standpoints rather than encouraging students to focus primarily on others ways to work towards a change."
Freshman,4,"My first semester at Berkeley was much more than I had expected. Before entering, I was worried about the lack of student care that might result from the big size of the college; however, our school provides various opportunities for students to receive help and advice, not only from professors, but also from graduate students (mentors), college advisors, residence assistants, and so on. I am definitely looking forward to the remaining three years of my college life at Berkeley."
Freshman,4,"I have just completed my first semester at Cal, so I am still forming a more wholistic opinion about the school. However, so far, it has been alright. The campus has a lot of interesting classes, clubs, and events. Many of the students are kind and tend to look out for one another. The dorms are okay, they have their quirks, and as much as the students complain about them, they really aren't all that bad. The downtown area can be tricky to navigate because yes, there are a lot of homeless people, however, most of them are harmless. Occasionally, there are reports of harassment or stalking of students by either homeless men or people who are on drugs. Safety is a very concerning topic for most students, and for good reason. Nevertheless, I am excited for what is to come in my future semesters at Cal and to explore the campus academics and social scene."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the whole atmosphere of the University of California Berkeley. There is always a really positive vibe on campus and it is always buzzing with people, which makes me feel like I am never alone. The professors that I have experienced at Berkeley have mostly been of really high quality, and they often vary between subjects, which makes my experience really interesting. One thing I would like to see more is an increase in discussion groups for more classes. The lectures are very large, usually of at least 300 people, so having a more one-on-one experience with course material and a teacher I think would really help some people. There also isn't great safety as the area is not safe at night, so perhaps more initiative to deal with this issue would also improve the university."
Senior,4,"There are plenty of opportunities if you just look for them. Anything from clubs, student government, study abroad and research positions. Don't be afraid to do a little digging to find what's right for you."
Junior,2,"I would like to see the presence and mainly the amount of police decreased on campus, especially if there is no immediate threat or danger. Secondly, I would like to see better forms of communication of resources to incoming freshmen. College is daunting, especially for first generation students who come in with little to none background on campus life and how to succeed."
Sophomore,2,"Grade deflation is sure to impact your GPA in the worst possible way. Instead of wanting you to succeed, professors in prerequisite classes seem to want to weed you out instead, so that it is harder to declare your major. Berkeley promotes “diversity and inclusion” but does the absolute bare minimum to support their first gen, low income, students/students of color. Rather than protect marginalized identities, this institution allocates almost a million dollars to protect the white supremacists it invites to speak under the guise of “free speech”. The only way to survive this school is to find the people who want to see you thrive and make them your support system because there are others who will bask in your failures as a way to uplift themselves."
Sophomore,2,Double the size of the goddamn class. What the hell is the point of paying so much money when I can't learn what I really want to?
Senior,2,"As a non-traditional student I found this  university to be grossly overrated. I transferred from community college in Sacramento, and honestly didn't find the curriculum challenging; my professors at the community college did a far better job of that! It has been disheartening to see the blatant classicism, racism, ageism, elitism and apathy in a place that I thought was ""liberal"". Their financial aid is a joke-even entering as a first generation, low income single parent that was supposed to have a ""fully funded package"" that was purported to be sufficient for the 2 years it would take me to complete my degree, I have had to work 3 jobs, and take out loans upwards of 50K! Family housing is infested with ants that come in from the ceiling, light switches and even the bath tub water inlet! Financial aid is often delayed by as much as an entire semester!"
Freshman,2,"Overrated. Good Academic reputation, but everyone is rude and full of themselves--professors included. Nothing is clean or nice. The school is both broke in terms of money and broken in terms of bad facilities. Also, not very diverse--just a lot of cliquey asian people. Groups are too exclusive and not welcoming--including greek life."
Niche User,2,"Everyone there is kinda pretentious. Okay not everyone, but they're a small outspoken group that'll get on your nerves fast. Campus is ugly too."
Freshman,2,"I thought I would enjoy it here at Berkeley more. Most say that I'll learn to love it, but until that day comes, I'm not really enjoying it here. Though there are some very nice and genuine people, most are so competitive, ambitious, and just fake. You can't really approach just anyone. The school is prestigious, but sometimes that seems to fade away. Nevertheless, people here are amazingly talented. I just wished it had a better environment, instead of everyone having to always try to beat one another."
Alum,2,School was very challenging and very competitive. I feel that faculty are somewhat disconnected with students. Faculty seem mostly focused on their personal research and less on their teaching. Students seem less focused on learning material than they are on trying to get good scores. I don't feel like it is easy to make meaningful relationships with others because of the environment.
Senior,2,"It was a great tour, the people were great. The overall aspect of Berkeley is just ugly. I was hoping for something more extravagant considering that the University of California Berkeley is one of the best public universities in the countries. In my opinion I would not attend."
College Sophomore,2,"I believe that safety and security on campus are an extremely prominent issue on our campus, given the large population of homeless people in Berkeley. Students are constantly being sexually and physically assaulted by visitors of the campus."
College Freshman,2,"The surrounding area is usually shady and makes me feel somewhat unsafe if I'm alone, especially at night."
College Senior,2,"dorm fee is really expensive and food quality is not that good. If you have enough money to pay the dorm fee, it is very comfortable because you don't have to get anything by yourself. everything is set. However, you should share with bunch of people. If you think that you're enjoying your private life, I really don't recommend dorm life and my rating will be accurate."
College Freshman,2,"Way over priced! I was in Unit 2 in a triple and it was very tight for the amount it costed. I get that rent in the bay area is expensive but I think I'd be better off renting a room off of craigslist or something. The elevators would be out a lot, but I was on a lower level so I always used the stairs. The bathrooms were kind of shabby, I'm very appreciative of the people who kept for them but young adults are messy! Also on my floor there was definitely favorite showers and showers you did not want to use (i.e. one had no flow, another didn't drain). Sometimes people had sex in the showers, some guy recorded me showering once but UCPD handled my report well and the guy was removed from UC housing. He still was able to attend school though? 

My floor had laundry on it (yay) and the building had no air conditioning so we (my roommates and I) would leave our window open most of the early months. It was loud outside at night so we used ear plugs while we slept. 

The underground communal space is nice, good study spaces and a little workout room with one working treadmill and some really nice ellipticals.

I liked being on southside close to Telegraph but I know some people didn't like being near that area.

Also there are compost bins in the rooms make sure to empty them if you use them! The guys in the room next door didn't for months and when they opened it a swarm of fruit flies came out..."
College Sophomore,2,"Housing is extremely expensive and there is an evident lack thereof. Housing is the only qualm I have with the school quite honestly. Most people get apartments the second year to evade the steep price. Also, many are not assured priority housing after their first year, making things more difficult and competitive. There are plans next year to place students in housing located on a completely different campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Many of the technical classes I have taken are way too large, and some of the professors seem uninterested to engage with their students. Overall, the courses cover a wide scope of information which is helpful. Class styles also seem very catered to one individual type of learning, depending on the style the professors likes to teach from."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have a negative perception of Greek life because of the implications involved with rushing, the commitment, and the overall lack of professionalism, even amongst the ""pre-professional"" fraternities. I would prefer to join a club and have more freedom and respect."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a tremendous amount of pressure put on each student to succeed, especially amongst impacted majors where each student is pitted against their peers in order to achieve the GPA requirement or be able to register for essential classes. The student culture is also not very supportive; many claim ""friendly"" competition, but in the long run, their ability to achieve their goals come above the needs of other students - similar to a free for all race. In many of the classes I have taken, the class sizes are so ridiculously large that it is impossible to receive enough quality time with the professor to cultivate knowledge and assess if class/major choices are the right ones."
College Freshman,2,I found everything good except for how cramped it was!
College Senior,2,More must be done about the sexual assault problems
College Senior,2,I hear awful stories about racists and sexist behaviour.
Recent Alumnus,2,The school can do better.
Recent Alumnus,2,It doesn't allow students to broaden their social circles.
College Sophomore,2,Yes the UCPD has been increasing but that has not stopped from the crime rates and sexual assaults from happening.
College Freshman,2,The worst thing so far about the dorms is being paired up with an awful set of roommates and the RA never sets down the ground rules for our floor.
College Junior,2,We need more diversity on campus!!!
College Freshman,2,"Many sexual assaults have occurred near campus, as well as a suicide a few feet away from the dorm. There have also been a few professors this past year who have been charged with sexual assault towards their students. I feel relatively safe walking in a group, but feel unsafe walking alone if I am off campus in the day and night time."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are extremely small. The carpets are not that clean and the heater is always on even when it is hot outside. Th ceiling is very low and there is small closet space. The bathroom only has two stalls with warm water and one of the toilets was broken for half the year. The closeness to campus is the only benefit. However, this area is also surrounded by homeless people and always smells like drugs, hence making it unsafe."
College Freshman,2,"I live in a converted triple with hardly any space to breathe and pay $13,000+ for it. There is barely ANY ceiling space at all if you have a top bunk. My Unit needs to be demolished and rebuilt because the rooms are ridiculously small."
College Junior,2,I have heard stories of people being held at gunpoint and others of being followed by suspicious people on the street.
College Junior,2,"For the most part, the campus is safe. But at night and around certain areas of the city, you definitely need to be aware of your surroundings."
College Freshman,2,"There's pretty little space, and it costs a fortune. Most people just live in the dorms for their freshman year and then never go back."
College Sophomore,2,People are so weird here. Very Liberal environment
Recent Alumnus,2,The main objection I have to campus housing is that it is too expensive. I have chosen to live with my family instead.
College Freshman,2,"Campus climate here is hardly recognized but it's very important that administration sees how excluded students, especially students of color, feel in this environment and the harms of such toxic people and policies."
College Freshman,2,I do not want Parent Plus loans. Stop trying to give me it.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a high variety of greek life, and therefore very variable"
College Freshman,2,I qualify for a grant but never received anything
College Senior,2,Bay Area real estate. Enough said.
College Freshman,2,"When you're competing against a huge population that Berkeley hosts, you're naturally going to compete immense competition."
College Freshman,2,"If you go here, understand the food will be pretty mediocre. Pray that you don't have to deal with Foothill everyday."
College Freshman,2,One of the most expensive dorm options on college campuses. Almost impossible to list off all the things wrong with this aspect of Cal
College Sophomore,2,Very expensive. Landlord's market on all fronts.
College Freshman,2,They don't meet your need if you're out of state
College Freshman,2,Housing tends to be pretty overpriced since you'd have to pay a hefty amount just to get an old and run-down apartment. Landlords and rental agencies can be a pain to deal with and there's fierce competition for housing.
College Freshman,2,Recent protests have made using public transportation and walking in the street difficult and possibly unsafe.
College Junior,2,High prices for small apartments
College Freshman,2,UC Berkeley doesn't give anywhere near enough financial aid to out of state students.
College Sophomore,2,Football team can be better.
College Sophomore,2,It can be packed at times.
College Freshman,2,"Although there are plenty of options for dining at Cal, the overall freshness and quality of the food is not too great."
College Freshman,2,Really expensive to live off or on campus. Greek life is a good option because living in houses is generally cheaper than dorms or apartments
College Freshman,2,As an international student there are minimal opportunities.
College Junior,2,The city is terrible for crime and I don't know anyone (except some males) that feel safe after dark.
College Junior,2,"I don't drink or use drugs so big social gatherings are not what I partake in. I hang out with a group of friends to socialize, other than parties the night life consists of panhandlers and not waking the hobos."
College Sophomore,2,"Okay, there are just way too many dangerous and hobo people around. It's a real culture schock for a lot of people, but most of them are very harmless."
College Senior,2,"Too expensive. If you want to find a cheap apartment, it's either far from campus, dirty and looks like it's going to collapse at any minute, or you might have to cramp in a number people to lower costs."
College Senior,2,"There are a lot of crazy homeless people on the Southside. So if you are walking home at night, it's better to do it as a group or with a friend. If not, I strongly recommend using BearWalk."
College Sophomore,2,Finding a decent place to stay for a reasonable price is difficult. Start your search early (March).
College Junior,2,"The dining halls have absolutely horrendous hours. The food is bland, redundant, and very often ill-suited to special diets (vegan, kosher, etc.). Foothill has the only decent menu, but it is very out of the way for most students."
College Junior,2,"Not worth the cost, and if you are unlucky enough to live in a dorm without a kitchen you are condemned to eating bland, redundant, poorly served dining hall food. The dorms share the smoking ban, so they are very inconvenient for smokers of any type. Nowhere to wash dishes, and no chance of escaping an awful roommate."
Niche User,1,"this university is facist, anyone who isnt leftist has no rights, they are supperssed, bullied, and no conservative speaker is allowed to speak or everyone starts rioting"
Niche User,1,"THERE IS NO FREE SPEECH ON CAMPUS ANYONE WHO ISNT LEFTIST IS SUPRESSED AND BULLIED, THE FIRST AMENDMENT DOES NOT EXIST HERE."
Freshman,1,"If you want to have any fun in college AND have a career after graduating, don't go here. There is a major stress culture and everyone is so competitive. The school is full of pretentious people trying to flex on you that they are in some consulting club or are EECS or are regents. I really regret coming here. The Berkeley name is not nearly as respected as some private schools, even though Berkeley students work way harder. Please, learn from my mistake and don't go here. You'll be so much happier going to a school where everyone (from the students to the administration) is less concerned with ""looking good"" and actually concerned about being good."
Alum,1,"YOU MUST KNOW PROS AND CONS.
You either love it or feel suicidal. No average experience. 

Pro
- Brand name
- Ambitious students
- Choose easy science major, graduate with good GPA and brand name. 

Con
-  Hopeless bureaucracy. 
Daily appts are full at 9:01AM within a minute, often give wrong info but no one takes responsibility, and CalCentral still has miserable systemic glitches. 
(Like dropping you off from class, give you wrong registration date, wrong graduation year and etc.)

- Berkeley GPA has been historically 0.3~0.5 lower than Ivy leagues, even in this age of GPA inflation. Never go to this school if you plan to go to graduate school. 

- Overpopulated compared to 2013. 
They've accepted too many students to deal with financial crisis.
The cafes are libraries are always full, and you literally have to write your name on signing sheet and wait for 20 mins to enter the weight lifting room."
Freshman,1,"Berkeley is very appealing, as a name, area, promise, etc. I talked with several community members of the city who were all very angered that the UC seemed to be bullying the town and overstepping its boundaries. I got a lot of, ""it used to be a cool, happening place"". It's been gentrified over and over and the hippies there now are treated like shit. While the students are very capable people, they were content enough to put the name on their resumes and continue through the world as a shitty person. I get the appeal, I really do, and I wish it were actually like that. I couldn't justify my time and money spent at a place where poor mental health, competition, lack of sustainability, and lack of active compassion for each other were the norm. I see it for what it has become. I don't have to sacrifice my health and aspirations for debt and disrespect."
Niche User,1,"The campus is dirty, overcrowded, and impersonal. There is nothing special about Berkeley in terms of the teaching. It is the competition among the students that makes a degree from here worth anything. Most of the UC staff I encountered were unapproachable and seemed bothered. All the facilities are run down and soiled. Everyone here is at each other's throats because of the overpopulation, lack of resources, and unethical competition. You will have to fight for every inch at UC Berkeley and some.

Imagine a Walmart grand opening on Black Friday..That is what Berkeley feels like. 

I can not imagine dropping my 18 year old kid off here for 4 years. 

Berkeley is one of the worst campuses I have ever attended in my entire academic career.  There are many public universities that put Berkeley to shame."
Sophomore,1,"My school isn't really a school persay. It's more of a place where you can never go to class, study on your own, and do better than the people who waste their time walking to class. The lectures are WAY too big to get any personalized attention, and you have to play the lottery to get a good GSI or you are pretty much screwed. Office hours are cool but most of the time they don't line up for you if you wanna go to your other classes.  The breadth classes are jokes and a waste of time, most people never go to class and just show up for the midterms. It's hard to delve into the material when you have 500 people in your lecture. You literally pay for the name here. A ""world-renowned research university"" is a bit of a stretch if you are an undergrad because all of the good research opportunities are application based and have a lower acceptance than getting into the school itself. I will relish the day I leave this school and the disgusting and uncleanly city that surrounds it."
College Sophomore,1,Greek Life is a big topic in the beginning of the school year and I feel like you need to know people in order to socialize and get into parties. Most of the Frats are really big on trying to maintain their popularity and not really focus on the bigger picture.
College Sophomore,1,"Given that Berkeley is right next to Oakland, which is not the safest neighborhood, it is more dangerous than other universities. Recently, there have been many muggings by out-of-towners. Some students were even held at gunpoint and forced to hand over everything they had on them. Walking around campus alone at night is not the best idea. We do have a Bear Walk service where someone will come and walk you to your destination, but it takes way too long for the person to actually get to you. Last time I called Bear Walk it took about an hour, which is why I don't use the service anymore. 

I feel especially unsafe because I am a girl. Often times, I'll be catcalled from across the street and if I don't respond, the person will yell rude comments at me. 

Berkeley has many homeless people because of People's Park. Many of them are friendly or will not approach you, but many of them are crazy and scary. 

I'd rather go to school somewhere else. I do not like Berkeley's neighborhood at all."
College Freshman,1,Greek life keeps sexism and rape culture alive on campus.
College Senior,1,I hate it here. This school took away my passion for learning but I am determined to graduate and continue my studies elsewhere.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The expensiveness of the Bay Area housing market is well-known, and people know it. We live in a three-bedroom, and the rent is $2,000 a month."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Apartments are way to expensive for horrible amenities. Students are in need of housing all the time, so landlords can charge whatever they want and still rent it out. It is very competitive to obtain a place."
Recent Alumnus,1,Never overpay for anything if you are waiting for fianncial aid to come in! They will take forever to reimburse you!
College Freshman,1,No offers since the school has no money.
College Freshman,1,The food is honestly gross. You will probably end up spending most of your points on coffee
College Junior,1,"Super expensive, pretty hard to find decent housing close to campus"
College Junior,1,They sure make a ton of money. I guess that's why they are eager to raise our tuition.
College Junior,1,I have found dealing with financial aid a total pain
College Freshman,1,"Berkeley, although it has its views of the Bay, is quite a dangerous area and I don't feel safe here at all. However, San Francisco is nearby and there are some better parts of town the farther away from Berkeley."
College Junior,1,"I do not qualify for much aid at all, only about a thousand dollars, so my dealings with the school are just to take out loans which are disbursed in a somewhat timely manner. However, students who receive a lot of aid often report problems of having their funds disbursed when needed."
Recent Alumnus,1,UC Berkeley is the worst college ever!
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is a hot mess on cocaine in Berkeley.  It is hard as hell just to find a parking space, and it costs an arm and a leg."
College Freshman,1,"Every year, I have problems with financial aid. My first year I wasn't registered for the first weeks of class because there was a glitch in the system and my financial aid didn't come through."
College Freshman,1,Nearly no money was given to me by the University.
College Sophomore,1,Some places are old and dirty and they are too expensive! It is stupid how they charge for parking garages!
College Sophomore,1,I thought it would be much better to be honest. oh well
College Freshman,1,"Five words: do not drive around here. You will not find a place, and in the off-chance that you do, it will cost your kidney."
College Senior,1,"Expensive rent, lack of parking, sketchy landlords, at least near campus. If you have a car or are willing to bus, consider looking in areas further from campus. It's typically cheaper, and the landlords are more trustworthy."
College Sophomore,1,"It is very important to remember that Berkeley is a city; therefore, parking is outrageous.  Parking spots are so rare, and the rates are ridiculous.  Parking cops are quick to write a ticket if the driver goes over his or her time."
College Freshman,1,I'm from SoCal and this weather sucks in compairison to SoCal! 
College Junior,1,The parking at any of the UC campuses is pretty bad. You're better off walking or biking. 
College Freshman,1,"The Financial Aid Office is very unorganized and unprofessional and unfortunately have a hard time of answering your questions, they don't know what they are doing. Multiple times, they lost very important papers of mine and it took three months for them to get back to me and for me to receive any aid."
College Junior,1,"I am not interested in this at all.
People are usually from very wealthy and elitist backgrounds.
I'm Scandinavian/Jewish and there is a lot of anti-semitism in the Greek houses.
One person who is a Greek student told me ""Gosh, you're 6'0 tall, blonde and blue-eyed. You don't even look like a Jew.""

Not interested in them nor is anyone else I know."
College Junior,1,"Berkeley is as expensive as Paris or London.
The typical 2-bedroom apartment is $2,000/month NOT including utilities.
Terrible options.  Everyone I know is either living with at least 4 other people to cut the rent or living on a couch, on a living room floor, or with their parents. Everyone I know at UC Berkeley has taken out at least $10,000 in loans.
The closer you are to UC Berkeley, the more expensive everything is.
I live in Albany (about a 20 minute ride by car from the car) and our three bedroom apartment is $2,000/month."
College Freshman,1,"People enter the dorms drunk, throwing up in the restroom. By the way both men and women share it so you can imagine the horror."
College Freshman,1,"Always cold, never have I seen a good warm day."
College Freshman,1,Housing is terrible. The rooms are extremely small and the buildings are ugly. 
College Freshman,1,"The libraries are large and contain tons of books, but they are all kind of run down like the rest of campus. Everything is old and nothing is ever replaced or renovated for some reason It's not maintained very well. The study spots are all overcrowded and dirty.

The gym is also overcrowded and not very good. Other universities have much better gyms and resources for students.

Berkeley students often don't realize how bad they have it because they haven't experienced other universities."
College Freshman,1,"Berkeley is a concrete filled, run-down city that has a grungy, hippy like vibe. The residents are incredibly ugly and weird. The town is filled with hobos everywhere and everywhere you go smells like weed, due to the high concentration of smoke shops surrounded the campus.

Some people like it and think its more ""real,"" but personally I hate it. Make sure you actually visit and make sure you like it before coming here or else it will suck. UCLA has a much better atmosphere."
College Freshman,1,"Permits are extremely expensive and impossible to get, especially if you're a freshman. Don't count on having a car."
College Sophomore,1,Parking is so bad. You have to live over 2 miles away to get a campus permit and the lots are on the outskirts/off of campus
College Junior,1,We're located in Berkeley. It's easier to find someone that does smoke weed than someone who doesn't.
College Freshman,1,"I feel unsafe leaving my dorm or walking around campus. There are homeless people everywhere. Since Berkeley is close in proximity to Oakland, one of the most dangerous cities in the US, you are TOLD not to be alone at all times. One of my friends was actually attacked in broad daylight walking down Telegraph Avenue. She suffered several fractures and a concussion. Yet, UC Berkeley did not notify students about this incident. I've been in areas of South Side LA and Compton and have felt safer than I do in this neighborhood."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking sucks. Generally it's restricted to 2-hour limit parking and the enforcement is really strict. Come by one minute late and you'll find a $64 parking ticket on your car. I recommend not driving in Berkeley at all. The bus system works really well and in fact, most areas you can probably walk to. Especially if you're a student at UC Berkeley, you have no need for a car."
College Sophomore,1,"The parking at UC Berkeley is terrible. All parking is metered with a 2 hour limit and there is no designated student parking lot. It is a really busy city, so unless you carry change for the meters and are a pro at parallel parking, I would not advise bringing cars to campus. The public transport, however, is awesome."
College Sophomore,1,There's almost no financial aid for students who are perceived to be int he Middle Class.
College Junior,1,They always take forever to respond to emails. They confuse you quite often when you meet with them in person. The lines are often long and they have terrible chocolate candies in the waiting area. I have not met someone on this campus who has had a great experience with the financial aid processes at this school.
College Senior,1,"I am not aware of any designated student parking lots at this campus. If you have to park near campus, spots fill up quick and the Berkeley parking patrol is very strict."
College Sophomore,1,No parking spots.  Most parking spots are expensive
College Freshman,1,It's pretty commonly known on campus that one in four women will be sexually assaulted in four years at Berkeley. Not the safest campus in any way.
College Junior,1,"Nightmare for sure. In residential areas I believe you technically need to buy an area-specific permit to park and you need to get it out by a certain time. Apartments charge for parking spaces, and so do garages."
College Freshman,1,"Parking in Berkeley is a nightmare. If you want to a park on campus, prepare to paid several hundred dollars per semester to get a permit. Off campus might be a little more flexible but still a nightmare. There are a lot of street parking with meters but those are always taken. You can park in garages around campus but those are extremely expensive. There are also a lot of pedestrian and cyclists in Berkeley, which makes it extremely difficult to drive. Everything in Berkeley is close to each other so walking is the best option. If you don't want to walk, public transportation is the next best option."
College Freshman,1,"Off campus housing is very expensive in Berkeley. The prices are truly outrageous. Though it may be cheaper than the dorms at Cal, it still is difficult to find a quality apartment worth its price. Most of the time you will have to find at least 3 people to live with just to pay rent. Good thing is that the apartments are close to campus."
College Freshman,1,"In Berkeley it is hard for anyone to find parking. This is definitely a school where bikes and pedestrians rule. People just don't drive their cars to school. Not only is parking a pain, but it's expensive too."
College Senior,1,"It is almost impossible to find parking around the campus. If you have to bring your car (most people don't), you'll either have to park many streets away or buy a parking spot (I had a roommate that paid upwards of $3,000). It's expensive and ultimately not worth it because you can walk almost everywhere or take the bus. If you really need a car you can sign up for Zip Car. The meter fairies are evil and strict, you won't be able to get out of a ticket."
College Senior,1,To park on campus costs over $600 per semester and it is not easy to find street parking. If you do find street parking the meter maids are really aggressive. Parking in an apartment complex is usually $100-$200 a month. Not worth bringing a car to this school.
College Sophomore,1,Don't bring a car...the bus system is free for students and BART is really convenient.
College Freshman,1,"Permits for students on campus are far too expensive, there is no overnight parking in the actual structures next to or on campus, and the overall design is not friendly for drivers."
College Sophomore,1,Cost a lot to have a permit and there is only street parking. No one really has a car unless their apartment complex gives them parking. Parking enforcement is really brutal. You need a permit to park in most neighborhoods.

Freshman,5,I have enjoyed my time at Aurora University. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The community is great and you can make many friends. I recommend students to attend Aurora University as it is a great place to study and pursue a degree.
Freshman,5,I took all of my classes online. The professors made it easy and enjoyable to learn through zoom. They helped us access our homework and exams online. They are very patient with students and support them.
Freshman,5,I took all my classes online this year due to COVID and it was an easy transition. The professors were really prepared with the remote learning process.
Freshman,5,"Overall, Aurora University is a very good school and really tries to get the students involved with each other."
Graduate Student,5,I loved the small campus and the friendly staff. All of my professors were very helpful and encouraging. The classes were fun and informative.
Graduate Student,5,AU did a wonderful job of transitioning to online courses due to Covid-19. We had no issues with Zoom and were able to carry on as usual. All of the professors and staff were helpful and accommodating during this time.
Senior,5,So far it is a good experience. I’m doing nursing classes all online. So far they try to help you the best they can.
Senior,5,I love Aurora University! They gave me the opportunity to follow one of my long term goal. Currently working on remote learning.
Junior,5,Easy registration for classes. Clear and concise requirements. Easy to use programs. Advisors are quick to responding. Professors are extremely knowledgeable.
Junior,5,I am taking my classes online and think it is a great way to stay home and go to school for reasonable prices.
Junior,5,"All my classes are online and I am fully confident in doing well here for a cheaper, great experience."
Senior,5,Aurora University is a small school which I love because you are able to get close to the professors and build strong relationships with them. The professors are always there to help when needed.
Alum,5,The use of an online platform for class discussion/assignments was very easy to navigate. It was also a great way to keep track of your grades.
Alum,5,I loved the smaller class sizes and how knowledgeable the professors are in the subjects they teach. Many of them have plenty of years of experience in their designated fields.
Senior,5,The school helped me break out of my shell. Even when I would visit as a high schooler students at the time would say hi and talk to me about college life and give me advice. Now I'm a senior with a lot more confidence in the classroom with the help of the amazing professors wanting to help me and outside the classroom where I can help the other students break out that shell like I did!
Senior,5,"Aurora University stands out from other schools because it is truly a student-focused community.  Every turn,  you have a collection of individuals cheering and encouraging you both academically and personally! As soon as I stepped onto campus, I knew AU was special! Everyone I met was so inviting and wanted to help. The people in this community push you to be a better person and to accomplish what you thought were only dreams! If you want a school that provides you with an army of people that will encourage you and help you through the rough patches, AU is for you!"
Graduate Student,5,"Attending Aurora University was the best decision I ever made. I have never felt like a number and no other university would have helped me grow professionally like AU did. For these reasons, I decided to return to AU for my MBA. I would recommend this institution to anyone looking for a college that cares about its students."
Graduate Student,5,"I am so impressed with the transition AU made to remote learning. This began during the second semester of my senior year, which was a very critical time for me. My professors cared a lot about how we all were handling the transition and they gave us time to adjust while still teaching us valuable course material. Even now as a grad student, I am still learning everything I would learn on campus."
Freshman,5,There are a lot of opportunities to not only for a career but also to make friends and see where you want to be in life
Junior,5,"For a transfer student, it has been a great experience. All the proffesors have been so helpful and open to dialogue if needed."
Graduate Student,5,"I like how fast and friendly the admissions staff was helping me figure out a plan of action. They gave me a simple accurate email on what I needed from my undergrad, and my plan to execute so I can enter the graduate program ASAP. Very responsive on the phone as well as email."
Junior,5,Aurora University is an amazing school. Due to its size it gives you the ability to have quality interactions and relationship with student and staff!
Niche User,5,"I am currently a high school senior that will be attending Aurora University in Fall of 2021. Aurora University have helped me with the college transition process since my junior year, and Aurora University is very supportive"
Sophomore,5,"I love the small classes at Aurora University. It is easier to get to know everyone who you have class with as well as the professor. Everyone is also very friendly and welcoming, you never feel left out as there are a variety of clubs and activities that you can join and meet new people."
Freshman,5,"It is a very welcoming campus, and makes it easier for freshman or transfers feel more comfortable and not overwhelming."
Sophomore,5,"This school offers a wide variety of opportunities to grow and succeed. This school is not only structured to help the students to succeed but to also maintain their wellbeing, which is not found within many universities."
Niche User,5,"The campus is very nice, with lots of space for every student to walk. The dorms are in excellent condition including the single / double rooms. Of you are in sports the have an excellent weight room and the cafeterias have variety of foods."
Freshman,5,Aurora was a really nice campus when I went on my visit. I'm going there to play baseball and the facilities were all really nice. The guys on the team seemed ike somewhere anyone would want to be.
Senior,5,The teachers here care a lot about the student's passions and future. The classes are fun and it's always exciting to learn here.
Freshman,5,"This campus may be small but the students here have a huge heart and a wonderful personality. The professors here are amazing willing to work with you on everything, they are genuinely helping you achieve all your goals.  I hope you choose to come here!!!!!"
Niche User,5,I have yet to attend AU yet but attend to start next fall. I have visited many times and the one thing that continued to stick out to me as how dedicated the staff is to helping their students no matter the problem. This is a huge reason why I chose to enroll at AU.
Freshman,5,I have truly enjoyed my experience at AU.  I did not think that I was meant for college before starting but have found my place there and have excelled in what I have done so far.  I look forward to the next 3 years and cannot wait to see what's in store!
Alum,5,"I visited several universities before making my decision and the staff at AU really made my experience there stand out in a good way, so that's where I went. I wouldn't trade it for anything. The professors really put in the time and effort to show us that they really cared about us as students and also cared about us being successful after we graduated. There are plenty of student organizations to join--both academic as well as social, sports team if you want to play, art, music, whatever you want to do. I always felt like a person and not a number. I ditched class one day because I was tired and my professor actually contacted me to make sure everything was OK. I did an internship during my senior year, and then they hired me right when I graduated. And, the campus is absolutely beautiful!  Most buildings are new and kept up very well."
Junior,5,"Currently attending this school. The teacher are always ready to teach you and answer questions you might have, always striving to do better and focusing on delivering the material in a condition the student will understand."
Freshman,5,Aurora University is located in a residential area that makes you feel as welcome as the university. The opportunities to become involved in the school and with fellow peers begin even before classes start.
Senior,5,I like that I can go to teachers when in need of help and it is easy to work with other students. I love the location of the school and the vibe it gives off.
Graduate Student,5,"I am a first year graduate student at AU, transferring over from Benedictine University. So far it has been a very smooth process, with a lot of assistance from advisers and financial aid. Everyone at AU is very friendly and willing to help. Great experience so far."
Junior,5,"I am enrolled as an online student. Online students are encouraged to take advantage of everything offered at the school. The professors are wonderful and very engaged. Through online discussion, I feel like I really know all of my classmates"
Sophomore,5,"I personally enjoy the atmosphere that revolves around a small school and education. Aurora University is an affordable choice of a 4-year university. Being the 2nd largest city in Illinois, there are full of things to do around the school and it is full of commuters who would happily help you figure out what to do when you're away from campus. The education itself is better than I expected and there are a wide array of majors and minors to choose from as well."
Senior,5,"It is a pretty small school. It is good if you are trying to get good grades and are just focused on graduating. It's not a party school at all it gets boring, but the professors care about you it's a small school you get to know everyone around."
Sophomore,5,"The Aurora University campus is large enough to allow for several opportunities with staff to compliment it, but also small enough to not overwhelm someone nervous. The classroom sizes range from 10-25 so the professors are able to get a good amount of one-to-one instruction as well as large class discussions."
Freshman,5,I really love this school so much its really the best option for students. I love how this school has the option of living on-campus or either off-campus. I also love the fact that this school has different options of majors for students available.
Sophomore,5,This school is a small and private school. This university is great if you like your professor to know you by name and care about you as a student. overall get experience and best decision to go there
Freshman,5,The setting makes you feel very at home and everyone is very inviting to the aurora community. The team of peer advisors and academic advisors are always reaching out to make sure they are doing their best to help you adjust to the new college student life. Professors for the most part are understanding and will do the best to their capabilities to help you in the way you need. upper class students are very accepting as well and are willing to help when they can. campus life is also very nice. there is a vast list of activities and clubs to become a part of and if there isn't anything you like you can start your own club. the sports programs are very well supported as well as the music and theatre programs.
Niche User,5,It's a nice campus and everyone is so nice and helpful. They offer a lot of majors and they also offer double majors which is great because you will still graduate on time and pay the same amount.
Senior,5,"This college offers a variety of minors and majors! It has an amazing social work program. There are tons of extra curricular activities. The professors care about students, and class sizes are awesome!"
Freshman,5,"Aurora University is a great college with great professors that are always very helpful. As a student, it is very easy to accustom to and it's very easy to commute here or to stay on campus. One thing I would change about this university would be to have more parking access due to there being more students than what the parking lot has to offer."
Senior,5,"I absolutely LOVE Aurora University. Everyone I met with at AU from start to finish has helped me achieve my goals. Now I am graduating in 5 months, and I have incredible knowledge on my career path. Professors from AU even helped me get an internship right away! Best school to go to!"
Niche User,5,I liked how open all the professors are to any questions you may have. The classes are small so it is very easy to communicate with your professor.
Sophomore,5,"As a dedicated student athlete, I absolutely love Aurora University! I have had a great experience with professors who are always willing to take extra time out of their day and work with you whenever you need it. Campus is beautiful and people are very friendly!"
Junior,5,I love the small class size and campus.  Every thing is close and people are friendly. Teacher are willing to help as long as you reach out to them.  The resource center has people who will look over your paper and tutoring.
Freshman,5,"AU wasn’t my 1st option school.. or even my 10th. Actually, I was so anti-AU that I was considering every other school, even super religious ones (which is interesting b/c I'm not very religious). AU didn't fit my perception of what college is supposed to be like; a big school in warm weather & far away from home. Well, PLOT TWIST! I chose AU b/c it's affordable. After my 1st week of classes, I let really myself experience the school -- w/o any judgements. The moment I started identifying all the positives at AU was the moment I started to love this university. The campus is gorgeous & well maintained, the staff goes above & beyond to help students, the community is so welcoming, & student-life is thriving. Everyone here is truly amazing! After having completed 1 semester here & getting involved in all that my schedule prevails, I have no regrets on choosing this university as the one to complete my degree at. I love the atmosphere, the education offered, & all the opportunities! :)"
Freshman,5,"Williams Bay (George Williams) campus is beautiful.  GWC experience class allows entering Freshman to not only bond with small group of students, but also engage in what the area has available outside of campus limits.  Beautiful resort town, nestled in a quiet village."
Graduate Student,5,"I truly love this college, not just have the typical reasons. The scenerie surrounding George Williams College of Aurora University are breathtaking. The professors have been great as well. The Social Work program is truly top notch. This place has it all, take a good look and discover the next step in your education."
Freshman,5,Aurora is a very exceptional institution for learning. Their very helpful and make sure every student reaches there goals educational and in life.
Freshman,5,I have found it to be very rewarding. The classes are good and the professors are all professionals. Great resources for all students.
Freshman,5,I love Aurora University. It is a very small school so professors know you as a person not just another name. All of my professors are more then willing to help me when I need help. They all are really helpful with advice in what you should study or what classes would benefit you.
Senior,5,"I really love all of my teachers and I really feel they push you to strive to be your best! I also enjoy the atmosphere Aurora University has, the school is very small and I like that you basically know everyone who shares your major. I definitely prefer the small classroom sizes they have."
Junior,5,I like the small campus and the student to professor ratio. The college has a phenomenal nursing program with the highest NCLEX pass rate in the area.
Sophomore,5,The staff and faculty are very nice and helpful. They are very approachable. The professors are very knowledgeable.
Senior,4,"Good professors, helpful staff, campus has good resources, finding a parking spot can be difficult and stressful"
Senior,4,"D/t COVID-19, spring classes were given online and professors were able to adapt well to the change, but for many students it was hard to keep up with coursework the same way as in-person classes"
Junior,4,The staff are wonderful at communicating. Vast course selection and easy registration. The Adult Completion program is a great fast tracked option for working adults!
Junior,4,"Aurora University has an excellent Education program which is what made me want to be enrolled into the school. I am a peoples person so i love to help any and everyone in any way i possibly can, which is why i want to be a early childhood education teacher and also help student with special needs."
Senior,4,I finished my Junior year up online and it was hard but at the same time interesting. It was hard because it was a big change that I have never done but interesting to see how the university handled the situation and made the best of it to keep us safe and informed.
Senior,4,"It was an adjustment but it wasn't very long before I got the hang of it. Also, it gave me more time for studying and time management."
Senior,4,"Although I have not elected to take any online classes at AU, the pandemic unfortunately forced that option upon me. I was pretty upset, to say the least but my professors really helped me turn it around! They were incredibly supportive and did everything in their power to aid me in my studies. They wanted me to know that even though the circumstances have changed, their level of support and guidance has not! Online is still not my favorite, but I can say the transition was better than I expected."
Junior,4,The only online classes I ever took were this past semester when corona moved classes to be online. All of my professors worked very hard to work with the students and help each student succeed.
Junior,4,"Aurora University is a very small campus, therefore your professors really make sure that they get to know each one of their students. You can build connections with everyone in your classes and get to know each other very well. The worst thing about Aurora University is honestly the food and it is not that bad."
Freshman,4,"Aurora University is a great school, professor and staff are always very helpful. There are lots of clubs and programs to get involved in, and there is lots of good resources for students: free tutoring center, great library, counselling center, health center (can provide flu shots or over counter medication)and multiple printers on campus (free printing), all included into tuition.  The only problem is sometimes it can be difficult to find parking on campus, even now with a new parking garage. I don't personally live on campus but I have heard mixed things about dorm living, many people like it and some do not like it at all.  It is a small school which works very well for me, it is easy to develop  connections with peers and professors."
Junior,4,Academics are great. I know I picked the right school academically  due to amazing and knowledgeable professors. I enjoy the student life and different events that go on on campus.
Freshman,4,"AU is fairly small with a low number of students per classroom. Being a small school is super beneficial because it allows the student to participate and interact more with others as well with the professors. Apart from having amazing faculty there's a lot of opportunity here at AU. I recommend this university to anyone interested in size, cost, and the nursing program- it is said to be very good. However, it is extremely difficult to find a parking spot, so this is a huge area that AU needs to work on."
Senior,4,"As a commuter student, I’ve had a really good experience here. The staff of professors are amazing and dedicated people. My biggest complaint was that there is not enough parking to accommodate students and staff, however recently a parking garage was built on campus so this has made finding parking much easier and less of a hassle. Overall a really wonderful school and a beautiful campus."
Sophomore,4,What I like about Aurora University is that there is plenty of clubs to be a part of but I noticed that you can not be involved in all of them because that takes up a lot of time but it is possible if desired. I would like to see a change in intramural sports because most of the time there are no shows even though they set up these event times for us to participate in the evenings.
Freshman,4,Admission advisers are super helpful and friendly! I am currently in the enrollment process and they have made it easy for me to apply and turn in all the necessary paperwork. I also like the fact that the school is very diverse!
Niche User,4,So far I have only spoke to administration but they have been nothing but helpful. They are always willing to help and send me links. they have helped me figure out other scholarship opportunities.
Senior,4,My experience was actually good because I transferred here. I actually felt safe until we had a shooting that was close by and they didn’t send out anything til about 30 minutes after we heard all the emergency vehicles. The campus is really clean and the professors really want you to success and get to know their students. They all want us to succeed and go above and beyond.
Senior,4,"Very great professor, and academic resources are great. It feels safe and the food is tolerable, the administration people are very polite love to talk with you."
Sophomore,4,Aurora University is a great school for academics. If you are looking for a party school this is not the school for you. AU is focused on creating individuals who are going to have successful careers and be career focused individuals. AU has a small campus which is great espically during the winter.
Sophomore,4,Small campus but nice professors and staff. Dorms are okay and Aurora has a lot of things to do for fun or just restaurants. Most things are at a reasonable driving distance. You make friends very quickly too.
Junior,4,"Overall I think Aurora is a great school, the online program works great for me because I can complete assignments around my work schedule. My only issue is the financial aid department, Aurora is a private university so the tuition is expensive and loans don’t cover everything. The people who work in those department hasn’t been of any service and they are very rude and dismissive."
Freshman,4,"For it to be my first year of college, I am liking it very much. It's not too big, classes have a fair amount of people. There are many areas to do you homework or get some coffee and lunch. The only thing that I could complain about the school is parking spaces so far. But, Aurora University is trying to make more. They try to fit students needs a lot and I love that."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Aurora University thus far has been nothing short of good. Instructors at the school are committed to having their students succeed, and prepare them for life after college. The campus has so much to offer for your comfort and success. For incoming freshman make sure you chose a college that feels like a true second home."
Freshman,4,"Aurora University has been a good school so far, a little expensive like any other school. Softball has been a fun time and the athletic programs are very respected here. Dorm life has been okay, the rooms are nice and the people are friendly. I haven't had any other complaints other than the food options here are not that great. I need different food options as well as more hours that I am able to get food. The dining hall food is not that great and the spot (the other food spot on campus) is expensive. Other than that, the environment is great."
Graduate Student,4,"I like the flexible scheduling and online options. I enjoy having a diverse student body to share perspectives with. I do wish that some of the professors were better prepared for some of the courses. Sometimes they use PowerPoints that were created by other professors that they don't understand and aren't able to explain well. Overall, I have had a good experience with Aurora and feel prepared to enter the workforce"
Graduate Student,4,I am just starting my MBA at Aurora University but they are a very affordable school with many options for working professionals such as myself.
Junior,4,Something that I like is that most classes are small only about 25-30 people or sometimes even less. Things that could change could be having more than one counselor per major for advising.
Niche User,4,"The school is promising for those in a budget. As a student looking at attending college, Aurora seems to benefit many students."
Senior,4,I would like to change the parking. There is limited parking for students. I enjoyed the professors and their knowledge of the material.
Junior,4,I have really enjoyed my time at Aurora University. There is not much I would change besides there being more parking. I have had a great experience.
Freshman,4,"The academic experience is amazing, I highly enjoy all of my classes. Although the party scene is not that great, but every now and again there are some fun parties. There is also lot that the school does for its students, by providing free tutoring and also bringing in a lot of entertainment. The school is small so you will most likely see the same people in your classes, which is nice to have study groups with those people."
Sophomore,4,"The first thing you notice about Aurora University is how stunning the campus looks. Everything looks gorgeous and your classmates are even better. They're 100% focused and determined to succeed and they are the type of people every college student should surround themselves with. Professors are always willing to help and stay late if needed and the classrooms are relatively small compared to bigger campuses. The only aspect I wish was better was the food, but I feel this is an issue at any college campus."
Sophomore,4,"I love the school and the education provided. The professors are great and very personally with everyone that shows even the slightest amount of interest, so I highly recommend AU."
Niche User,4,So far I have been very impressed by Aurora's ability to improve and change for their students. Each time I visit campus something has been improved or new plans have been revealed to renovate or remodel the buildings on campus.
Freshman,4,"I truly believe that there mission statement ""discover what matters and built your life around "" applies through out the whole campus in each student and professor."
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at AU. I currently play on the womens soccer team. I love AU it’s a small but not too small University! Everyone is absolutely welcoming & always open to new ideas!
Senior,4,Aurora University is a small campus to where you can easily get to your classes and the teachers there help you 24/7.
Sophomore,4,Aurora University is a good university.  The professors are knowledgeable about their subjects and teach in a way that is easy to learn.  The professors challenge the students to achieve achademic greatness.  As a student athlete the college and professors have treated me well with how busy I am with practice and lifts.  The areas that Aurora University could be better is the food in the cafeteria and the dry campus.  This can be fixed to allow Aurora University to expand.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Aurora University is that there is a very warm and welcoming atmosphere.  It is not only the administration, but the community surrounding the University as well.  It is small and quaint, so sometimes there are people walking their dogs or kids playing in their yards, it feels like home.  Something that I would like to see change is the parking situation.  It is nearly impossible to find parking if you get there any later than 10 am, and it can be very stressful"
Freshman,4,"Love the small campus and how the professors seem to really care about their students and what they teach. Greek life is really lacking, it's almost as bad as the food. Community bathrooms in the dorms and limited suites/singles available. Parking during the day is difficult if you leave M-F between 8 and 3. The university is in the middle of neighborhoods, so parties can be difficult."
Freshman,4,"After you GE courses, the classes involving your major have a small ratio of students to Professors.  The campus is very nice and although the school has over 4,000 students, it doesn't take very long to know many of your fellow students.
The only downside is the food service program.  It is run by Sodexo, a very large food services company.  The foods choices are too processed.  There needs to be a lot more fresh fruit and vegetable, along with main courses without all the sauces and gravies."
Freshman,4,Really nice and friendly staff. I really liked the spacious dorms and dinning area. They also have a variety of majors and programs to choose from.
Freshman,4,I liked the buildings and they have some really good resources in the library for the students. Also tutors and additional help is free.
Graduate Student,4,"Aurora University does have great programs and decent activities to do, especially trips to plays and other activities for free. It is not really a party school, so this school is more for those who are serious about studying."
Niche User,4,Admission Counselors are super friendly and help a lot by telling you about the school and all questions you have!
Freshman,4,"A week before school started all of the freshmen came for the welcome weekend and it was a lot of fun getting to know my fellow classmates. We were all put in groups and a junior/senior AU student and in my group we were all education majors. I took a year off from school so I was worried that I would not do well but all of my teachers are great and understanding. Although I do not like my schedule that much because 3 days during the week I have my first class from 8-9 then my second class from 1:15-2:20, then another class from 2:35-3:40. But I am just trying to make the most out of my free time and get my homework done in that time. So far I have joined 4 clubs on campus and 3 of them are volunteer work. The 4th club is called Educators Rising and it is perfect for all education majors such as myself. It has been pretty great so far and can not wait to do more on campus."
College Junior,4,"A little expensive, but a lovely place to stay,"
College Junior,4,I love my school. It is actually an extension of a larger university so the class sizes are small. The teachers are very engaging and make the classes interesting. I love that there is a lot of discussion in the classes - it really is active learning rather than just listening to lectures. The school is on a beautiful property that just makes you feel good to be there. I would definitely choose this school again or recommend it to others.
College Sophomore,4,"The Alumni hall and athletic facilities are really nice, and the gym just got redone o thats super nice."
College Sophomore,4,"So far school is fun. School does come harder for me than most just because I have to work a bit harder at classes then most. I'm  having fun so far. College gives me an opportunity to engage in adult behaviors such as getting a job, time management, getting along with people, and learning how to use my money."
College Senior,4,It's a small school with small classes.
College Freshman,4,It shows that your degree is very important
College Freshman,4,I don't see any problems with the safety
College Freshman,4,They seem to be comfortable
College Freshman,4,I enjoy them being around
College Freshman,4,I enjoy everything about the sports
College Senior,4,Greek life is small but very fun on campus.
College Junior,4,Love the size and feeling on campus.
College Junior,4,"We have 24/7 Campus Safety, it is a great resource"
College Junior,4,Very sports related. 80% of the school participates in athletics.
Niche User,2,Some of the professors don't care if you understand a subject or not. If you ask them to help they tell you is self explanatory and move on. This needs to be addressed with all the professors that they are there for one reason and it's to help the students succeed.
Junior,2,I like that everyone is focused on their school work however I do not like that it doesnt feel like it’s a university. The campus is boring.
Freshman,2,"I'm an incoming freshman and I recently went to the orientation which was very impressive and extremely organized; however, I had a major issue while registering for classes... I took AP Chemistry during high school with plans on getting credit for college general chemistry so I could take Organic as a freshman. Aurora is refusing to give me credit for general chemistry (which is unheard of -- the whole point of AP classes are to get college credit for the respective entry level class). This 3-star rating is solely based on my experience at orientation."
Sophomore,2,"I thought this was a great fit for me before classes started but when they did, I realized many of the people are odd and stuck up. If you are a commuter, don't bother going here because you won't make friends. Most of the professors suck and don't know what they're talking about. The advisors all tell you different things which is very irritating. Multiple times I have seen students walking around with NO SHOES on. I wish I would've chose anywhere but here for my college education."
College Senior,2,"Drugs are common, especially at all the parties."
College Senior,2,"Internships are somewhat hard to come by, if you have ""connects'"" and know the right people, youll be fine."
College Senior,2,"Campus is small, dorms are small very pricey. Dorm rules are very strict"
College Freshman,2,"I walked into Aurora University with high hopes, and positive vibes. All of these feelings were soon shattered by disappointment. I'm i the process of transferring because my experience was one I will never forget. I hope AU will be where they want to be one day."
College Freshman,2,Aurora University athletics are not really prevalent on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Aurora University has the potential to be great, but will never reach that level. Their lack of full time professors hinders them from having steady and meaningful relationships with their students. More times then not students are unmotivated because thats the environment Aurora University promotes. Instability and unprofessional are two words that sum up the administration and different academic majors it offers overall. It's the unfortunate sad truth."
College Sophomore,2,"most students don't know what is happening on campus because it isn't advertised as well as it could be, or should be. For example, my women's golf team is going to Nationals for the second time in a row and second time ever in school history so it is a big deal and most people don't even know we have a women's golf team."
Recent Alumnus,2,There is no one on one counseling sessions for new students.
College Sophomore,2,"Minimum choices for housing, dorms are over crowded. One of my friends is an RA who was told that she would have her own room as a perk for her work and lo and behold she has been landed with a roommate. It's definitely turned a lot of potential people away from the school. Additionally there are few places for people to lounge. Finding parking even when you live on campus is an absolute nightmare. Save yourself the stress and get an off campus apartment."
College Sophomore,2,There are very few students so there really are not too many parties.
College Junior,2,Very few fraternities are on campus. So only a couple have representation.
College Sophomore,2,"It's crappy, the people living there are disgusting, and the communal showers are primitive."
College Senior,2,I honestly don't know anything about the athletics at Aurora University.
College Sophomore,2,Small campus so easy to get caught having a dorm party.
College Sophomore,2,There is not campus funded transportation. You will have to find a bus stop or a taxi to use public transportation.
College Sophomore,2,It is not popular at all.
College Freshman,2,not that much going on on campus.
College Sophomore,2,You really need a car.  They do have a small shuttle bus but that takes students to group activities.
College Freshman,2,"Well, we're in Illinois, so it snows a lot which sucks, so it's a lot colder when walking to classes, thankfully its a small campus so it's not too terrible. During the warmer months, there are a lot of students hanging out on the quad, or playing a sport on the quad."
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do at this school! Yeah they have events that tries to rope students in, but not many people go; and if they do have an event, it's at 10 at night, when most people are sleeping,especially when they have class the next day. It's a zero tolerance school, so there are no parties on campus. The school has one place for students to hangout, and theres not much to do there either."
College Sophomore,2,The school decided to take out one of our biggest parking lots to build a building for the elementary students that share the campus with us. This lot was also an overnight parking lot so a lot of residence find themselves parking in front of people houses blocks away from campus. A parking permit is a complete waste of money at Aurora because there are never any spots to be had.
College Senior,2,Greek life is not a huge part of our campus. There is not a huge presence unless it is greek week. Students who are not a part of the greek system are indifferent to the greek system. There are no major problems resulting from the greek system in place. 
College Junior,2,"Cost of a permit is cheap, but finding parking is a joke. Even the residential areas fill up bumper to bumper. Sometimes parking is 5+ blocks away, and poorly lit."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Some teachers are great, but others can make your life difficult because they do not know what they are talking about, nor are they research-based."
College Junior,2,If you dont get there early it's very hard to find a parking spot.
College Sophomore,2,The cafeteria food is alright sometimes. The Spartan Spot is a better choice it has more options. La Carte is if you want to get a snack because you have to go to class.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is sometimes a little difficult, some spots are very far from the campus and can add a bit of time getting to class. Many students have to park down the nearby streets but I have found a spot every day."
College Sophomore,2,"It is the Midwest, so there's snow and rain. Not long ago it was flooded on the way to AU and I could not even make it to class, I had to return home."
College Freshman,2,"Network works well, but it really sucks in dorms. Constantly trying to fix it cause even more network problems"
College Freshman,2,There is a $25 dollar a year cost to park on campus but that isn't bad.  Parking fills up fast.
College Junior,2,There is a good variety of food options within 10-15 minutes of campus but the food made available on campus is just okay. I haven't had too many of their hot foods that are made to order but they're cold lunches leave something to be desired.
College Freshman,2,"I always make sure I am on top of financial aid.  It is the existance or neglect part of school, so it is the most important area to always check on."
College Junior,2,Aurora University is predominately White and Latino. I am the only African American in my class sometimes.
College Junior,2,Not any bars or clubs walking distance from the school. You would need a car to drive the few miles into the downtown area where you would find night life.
College Senior,2,Not very efficient. Although I received a decent amount of financial aid. The process to get the aid however required frequent calls and follow ups with the advisors to get everything processed correctly.
College Senior,2,If you are over 21 the only fun is going off campus to the bars or something. For under 21 bonfires are fun.
Junior,1,This is a horrible university.  The professors are terrible and the education is third rate.  Avoid at all costs.
College Freshman,1,Greek life for the most part is nonexistent
Recent Alumnus,1,It's not surrounded by a local community.
College Sophomore,1,There's minimal parking at school so many of us end up parking in the neighborhood which upsets the community. The solution is obviously to build a parking structure or limit who can bring their cars to campus (like the freshmen). The only problem with this is that the community doesn't want a parking structure and AU doesn't want to deal with the backlash of limiting vehicle privileges.
College Freshman,1,Our Greek life is very small. There is one group per gender and per race.
College Freshman,1,"We do not have enough parking for all the students that go here. Students have to park in the residential area, for which of not careful, they can get tickets for. Although the parking pass fee is reasonable ($25), it gets to be a waste of money just because half the time students are not able to even use the parking area."
College Freshman,1,"The food here sucks! There are only two places to eat, the third option is a cart that is part of the commuter plan, and it's probably the most decent place to get a good snack. The cafeteria food is questionable, and there's not too much variety. There is no fresh cut fruit available, you must purchase separately with""points"". As far as ""the spot"" goes, the food is bad quality, and the people who work there aren't always friendly. I would never eat any kind of ""meat"" from there, because once it made me gag. Everything else is pretty much fried, and there are not many healthy options"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Aurora University is crazy about just about everything. Mandatory attendance at classes, strict no drinking rules, and lots of other pointless rules galore at AU."
Recent Alumnus,1,"You need a car to get around the Aurora area. Unless you plan to strictly stay on campus, you need a car."
College Freshman,1,I hate the food on campus its usually the same things every week. Not alot of variety and most of the time the food is poorly prepared and hard or cold.
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing around Aurora that is interesting. Nor are there any other colleges around to make things interesting but on the positive note it does make you focus on studies
College Senior,1,"I can generally find a spot after driving around for a bit.  However, if you're there in the morning (before lunch) plan to come 15-20 minutes early."
College Senior,1,Transporation Stinks – this is mostly a commuter school if you dont have a car or a friend to take you you are having a problem
College Student,1,"Horrible Here, Do Not Go Here. I'm transferring after my freshmen year because my time at AU is nothing but a bust. I am a commuting student and the majority of the school is. A little percentage of students live on campus. On the weekends there is little to nothing to do. The majority of kids sit in their dorms and some goes to off campus parties which get busted 90% of the time. And the off campus parties are at one or two houses a week, which is on a Saturday. I met a few decent people, but I can't wait to move on to a different school. The location of this school is one of the worst and inconvenient towns in all of Illinois."
College Student,1,"Very Little Off Campus – This school is mainly a commuting school, remember that. I am also  commuting student but I know kids in the dorms. This college is in between a residential area so there is few chances to get off campus housing and the campus security and Aurora police know where the parties are at and bust them 95% of the time."
College Junior,1,"There is only parking lot space for about half of the students that require it.  The rest park on the streets surrounding campus and the police give frequent tickets.  It costs $25 to get a parking pass for the whole year but I'm lucky if I can ever find a spot Mon-Fri.  Also when it snows they plow the main lines of the lots so then your car is packed in, then they come ask you to move your car to plow the rest, it was very annoying!!  You pretty much need a car too because there are a lot of off-campus classes."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Both my husband and I mistakenly went to Aurora University.  I graduated (no thanks to them...a LOT of problems along the way), but they have completely screwed my husband over.  They NEVER give you any information about what you have to do for the program...such as due dates, what steps to take to make sure you're all set, etc.  Student responsibility is one thing, Aurora U is just negligent.  They don't care about helping students complete the program and they do not help anyone with program requirements.
They actually had my husband registered for a class and then said he couldn't actually do it because he didn't fill out 1 piece of paperwork correctly...they had a whole year to tell him this, but never told him until he was in the actual class.  They took our money for the class, but won't let him actually do the coursework.  
AVOID AUROR U AT ALL COSTS.  They don't care if you don't finish, because then while the program is taking you extra time, they're collecting more money from you."
College Senior,1,"Could Be Much Better – They don't care about your problems, they just want your money. The workers in fa are very nice, however."
College Senior,1,"Strictness at AU Sucks – AU has dumb campus rules. It all starts with the parking because everyone whether you are an on-campus student or computer, you pay the same for a parking permit. They do not monitor how many permits they give out so most of the time you pay to park where non parking permit people do (streets around campus). They also restrict what lots you can park in. The commuters get to park wherever they want where on-campus students have to park in the two most inconvenient lots."
College Sophomore,1,There Aren't Any – I am unaware of any alternative transportation options.

Freshman,5,"My online classes at Cascadia were great. The professors made sure that all students were doing well and being prepared. Professors offered great instructions to help us, students, throughout the course work and lectures. I am so grateful I had such amazing professors and peers at Cascadia College."
Freshman,5,Cascadia is a very welcoming college with many great people. You can tell that the teachers there really care about the students and how they do academically. Cascadia also has a great amount of diversity. Never have I ever met such amazing groups of people that have helped me grow so much. It really was an honor to be given a chance to attend Cascadia community college as a running start student. I am so thankful to get the opportunities to go to college while still in High School to help me get a head start in life. I love that to have a chance to take college classes at a community college to help prepare me for university classes wherever I go to finish my bachelors and masters at.
Freshman,5,Cascadia College is one of the best institutions that I have ever visited. The campus and diverse environment makes Cascadia unique. It is a student-centered college with best quality of academics and student life. I really enjoy Cascadia College and encourage others to experience it.
Sophomore,5,"I've had somewhat of a lackluster experience with the math teachers here, but they're not bad, and this is a great place to go to for computer science-y stuff. Their BA in mobile has great, fleshed out support, and since the school shares campuses with UW Bothell, you can use all their utilities as if you were a student there.  Don't plan on driving though. They're trying to fix the parking issue, but they're not there yet, and it really is a big issue. Bussing is way better. Also, definitely commuter college vibes with neat events. The tutoring center is pretty nice."
Freshman,5,Cascadia creates a supportive sense of community. There is alwasy ativities and ways to get involved.
Freshman,5,Everybody is really nice and the professors are really flexible and work with you. They have many activities and clubs for students to engage with one another. They also have tutors who are there to help.
Sophomore,5,"I started at Cascadia Community through Running Start in high school. I wasn't a fan of high school due to everyone not caring about being there to learn, so I was glad to join the college and be around people that actually showed up to class to learn for their futures. I can't wait to see how it continues to grow over the years to come!"
Alum,5,I liked how the professors treated me like I was a person and not just a student.  It was a friendly campus and I always felt like I was part of the community even though I was still in high school.
Niche User,5,"I had a good experience at Cascadia College mainly because I didn't know what direction I wanted to go in yet in terms of a major or career, but having the different course options in their integrated studies degree, I was able to try out different things to find out what I liked. I saved a lot of money going to a community college first and then transferring to a university."
Freshman,5,I like it because it not too big of a school; they also offer so many classes with multiple proffesors. I love the amount of support I receive from my academic counselor. This is my 3rd quarter and I am seriously thinking about staying and get my AA deg here.
Alum,5,"I loved the small community aspect of Cascadia. All the professors were really nice and willing to help all the time. I enjoyed the occasion events that were held on campus, they were a lot of fun to attend."
Niche User,5,"I love Cascadia Community College. Everyone is so friendly and kind. As an immigrant, CCC welcomes me and I am so happy that I could be part of this college. I love all the activities that the CAB runs, truly makes my day. But with that I also love the TPT in the toilet, genius idea. But also I love the resources they CCC provides me as a student, Bock Learning Center, events, movie nights, Cafe, free WiFi. I could go on and on about how much I love this college. CCC welcomes me and I donâ€™t feel discriminated based on the color of my skin. Last thing, the professors, all my professors are amazing and fabulous. They truly care about the students and are willing to help. With that I am going to wrap it up and say that thank you so much CCC for giving me everything!!!"
Freshman,5,"It is such a welcoming and accepting place that, from what I have experienced so far, is very student friendly and everyone there is always trying their level best to ensure that you have a very positive, benefical learning and college experience."
Sophomore,5,Cascadia College is a great college for those who are interested in broadening their horizons and expanding their viewpoints on a variety of topics. Cascadia's environment is student first and continues to exceed standards in academics and faculty. There are many club and services offered to enhance the college experience as well!
Freshman,5,Cascadia is a lovely local college that offers many resources to it's students. Learning is truly valued at Cascadia and most classes set you up to really learn the content. There is a strong sense of community and collaboration here that is very distinct.
Niche User,5,"I really enjoyed my time at Cascadia college. The professors are a hit or miss like in many other places but I definitely found most of them to be great. Cascadia has a great student body and they have many small events throughout the year where you can meet new people or grab some free goodies. The school overall has many resources like free tutoring (online and in person), little scratch paper and pencils in every study room for the students, animal petting de-stress events, and more. The professors and counselors are also very easy to get a hold of (:"
Sophomore,5,The college tries to help out the students as much as possible with announcement boards all around campus alerting the students of places nearby that are hiring. Along with event notifications for the students to partake in.
Sophomore,5,Cascadia has many amenities for students. They offer a lot of help in the student learning center. Cascadia student government also sets up plenty of fun activities for other students to distress from all the hard work!
Freshman,5,"I like how small and peaceful the campus is. It's neat, and the staff is very friendly. I have only taken two classes so far, but both professors I've gotten are great at communicating with their students and very understanding towards students who are falling behind due to life problems, etc."
Freshman,5,As being a Running Start student I was afraid to attend college at such a young age but with welcoming arms Cascadia felt like home. Cascadia is very organized in plaining events for students as well as incoming students.  Their academic advisors are great in helping you plan your future and there are many opportunities to learn about writing your personal essay as well as many  transfer fairs. I would recommend this college to anyone who wants to invest in there future!
Niche User,5,"I would like to see the Kodiak Korner changed a bit, if you are a running start student it is hard to get your questions answered. The people in there are also somewhat rude and bad at answering questions. They made me feel really stupid for having a question that I needed answered very badly. I liked my English 101 prof though."
Freshman,5,"I really love Cascadia so far. I'm currently a freshman at the school and I've loved all the cool classes offered, how helpful they are, and all the events on campus. It's been really fun going to school here and I hope to continue to be able to. You should be prepared for taking three classes if you plan to be a full time student and get your associate's in two years. There are two coffee shops on campus and a number of food trucks come through, my personal favorite being beanfish. There are three main buildings to the college. Parking can be really difficult, taking up to half an hour on some days. Fridays are the easiest days to park on. Overall, I love the campus and all the people there."
Freshman,5,"At Cascadia, I fell in love with the campus and much I love being there. It feels like a 4 year university by how much care they give to students and the amount of respect you get as a student. The classes are unique and useful, and the teachers are great. Before class I love to just sit in a study and look out the big windows at beautiful view of the pnw that surrounds the campus. "
College Sophomore,5,"I am a running start student second year. Cascadia has been awesome. A mix of teachers, some great others are a mixed bag. Either way there is a small class size, you have close interaction with teachers which is very beneficial. Very nice campus, everything is kept up and a lot of new buildings. The new ARC is very nice. Numerous study areas all around campus. Only thing that sucks is parking. If you are taking a class starting anywhere from 12:30pm-2:00pm, be prepared to come maybe 5-25 minutes late to class. Also parking passes per quarter are $90-$160.  I think they are building a new lot, heard some things about that. You get other shared resources from UW Bothell which shares the same campus. You get access to the best library in the country. New workout center. School is great. Just slightly higher tuition then Edmonds CC or something, which isn't as nice. Other community colleges feel dirty and a bit sketchy.

Another con is a lot of prerequisite classes, every running start student I know (thru placement test) got placement to Math 085, so you need to take 4 math classes before Calc1. 

I planned to transfer to UW Bothell for CSSE, things look pretty good if you make sure you take all the right classes and get great grades. Don't rely 100% on advisors, their time is limited. Talk to whatever transfer school you want to go to so you don't waste time and money."
College Senior,5,The library is incredible since its shared with all the University of Washington libraries and resources.
College Senior,5,"Their really good with printing here, you start with about $26 a quarter so unless you print a lot of material, you'll be fine on printing"
College Junior,5,there's a lot of different options for almost anything we need for classes. all available easily.
College Freshman,5,"I am able to work, volunteer, and go to school with time for other things when going to Cascadia. I really like it."
College Sophomore,5,"If you discuss it with the staff, you can get it sorted out."
College Sophomore,5,"If you go to the effort of looking around, you can find everything you need."
College Sophomore,5,"It's a relatively new college to everything is nice, clean and new."
College Junior,5,i have not find myself very cooperative in the school student body. This is because i see less brochures and know less about applying for these programs. I know for sure this school is very diverse.
College Junior,5,it is fair according to me. The WiFi is very fast and every student as access to it. They provide copy papers at every computer station. so if a student need to print something he/she need not to worry about providing their own papers.
College Junior,5,"They really provide lot of resources for student to benefit from. We have a English center helpful for students who finding difficulties in their English classes, as well as math. There were break rooms in the building helpful enough for students to do their works."
College Junior,5,"I just started at this school, so far things are going so well except for the financial office. They make me waited in the waiting room knowing they are not assisting anyone. But this school provide good academic resources for me in pursuing my education."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are very engaging. They are clearly knowledgeable in their subject, they are quick to respond to students and appear to be more flexible, and have a more personal interest in the success of their students. It is a little strange at first, as I was prepared for a very hands off experience when it came to college. "
College Senior,5,"The student body of Cascadia Community College is about as diverse as it gets, and the school is very supporting of that diversity."
College Sophomore,5,The library circulation assistants are very helpful and great!
College Junior,5,"There is a reason that Cascadia is so highly regarded. For being a community college, I have encountered a well trained and open-minded staff. Like anything else, you get out what is put in."
College Sophomore,5,"I have not used Career Services much yet, but hope to."
Alum,4,Good school for people seeking to transfer after earning an associate degree. Good professor and small class size.
Alum,4,Good school for people seeking to transfer after earning an associate degree. Good professor and small class size.
Sophomore,4,"Small Community college. Perfect for international because they have the opportunity to learn English faster. good professor overall, hut the downside is that some classes are offered one a year during specific quarter reducing chances to get in the class or get stuck with one professor."
Sophomore,4,"It is an amazing school. There are great people and great teachers for it being a community college. I feel so comfortable being at school and there are many easy-to-study areas. The technology at the school is more advanced than expected too. The only thing I would change is the parking. The morning classes are easy to find a parking spot. But if you have an 11 am, 1 pm and 3 pm class, good luck finding parking."
Freshman,4,"I've enjoyed the classes that I've taken, along with my program and advisors. I do wish that there was a stronger sense of community on campus, particularly for older students, but other than that I would recommend Cascadia."
Alum,4,"It was an absolute hit and miss between quality, engaging and amazing professors and dry, awful and unorganized professors with no in between. Depending on the teacher, your class and grade can go up or down. I would say most teachers I had were truly amazing but the bad ones were so very awful. Class content-wise, they were really good classes and I actually learned a lot. I will say there was a definite screw towards liberal ideology and if you had differing opinions you won't feel comfortable expressing them there. The campus is pretty cute with a public food garden, a couple of cafes and a subway with a huge library. It has a nice grass field and a wooded area with a cemetery up the hill which is cool. The nice thing about sharing a campus with UW Bothel is the resources like the library, sports and UW bookstore."
Sophomore,4,"For a college, it has a very safe campus with 24/7 security, as it shares campus with the University of Washington in Bothell. That is something I liked because it gives you the feeling of what life is like to be around a university."
Freshman,4,"Great campus, leadership is very involved. Many clubs and events offered throughout the year. Academic and persoanl assistance offered to all students."
Freshman,4,Counselors are wonderful at helping you make an education plan for when you trasnfer. Their classes get full fast and not alot of options for science students. small campus but shared with UW
Freshman,4,"Cascadia Community College has many enthusiastic and caring professors, great clubs and a close-knit community. It is also locate right in downtown Bothell, walking distance from many small shops, galleries, restaurants and cafes!"
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed the way Cascadia was concerned for the environment, and they made huge efforts to show that in the 2 and a half years I spent there.  The class sizes were small, never more than 30 students, and I felt that my instructors knew me.  Campus is within walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants affordable for students!"
Freshman,4,I like how welcoming all the students are. While starting over at the bottom of the food chain being a freshman making new friends and having to navigate through hallways is a little challenging. The one really thing about Cascadia is hands down the people.
Freshman,4,"The teachers are very supportive, and knowledgable in what they are teaching. I have always found answers to my questions. The campus is small, so it is easy to get around between classes. You will have trouble finding parking, and it passes can be quite expensive. Other transportation is highly reccomended."
Sophomore,4,"I think the classes offered are great. There are a wide variety of options and degrees to choose from. Many great teachers that teach both on campus and online. It is a bit similar to high school, in that, many professors take attendance and participation is a major part of your grade rather than just the work but again, depends on the professor."
Junior,4,I think Cascadia College is a good college that feels more like a precursor before an individual enters one of the more prestigious Universities like UW. The campus itself isn't very interesting and comes off as plain.
Sophomore,4,"It's a simple but well-organized institution, with people from diverse ages and backgrounds. I'm enjoying my first quarter at Cascadia so far."
Sophomore,4,"A good community college where people are friendly and there's a lot to do, bot in class as well as out."
Alum,4,"After being at Cascadia College for nearly 5 years, taking some breaks and less classes on some quarters, I have watched the college grow and know that it will continue to grow. Sharing the campus with University of Washington Bothell has allowed me access to great resources such as the library and online research database. Since the bachelorâ€™s degrees have been added, the impact of their work is seen on campus and the city of Bothell. Cascadia college had phenomenal chemistry and biology departments where the professors were clearly invested in their students, making sure that we are not simply memorizing out of a textbook, but thinking critically on how this might apply to our future studies and careers. Through them, my love for science has grown immensely and I wish for more students to have the same relationships with their professors as I have."
Junior,4,Overall my experience at Cascadia has been really well.  The professors have been really great the the administration staff are really awesome! They do their best to really help you out to the best of their ability and if they they don't know the answer they try their hardest to find it! 10/10 would recommend if you plan on taking some classes.
Alum,4,"If you like a small campus with dedicated professors and access to plenty of extremely helpful resources Cascadia College is right for you. Although Cascadia is small, the population is growing and with that comes more campus activities and options for students to become involved with the school and meet their fellows. With top of the line instructors and academic resources for everyone, Cascadia College offers a unique experience perfect for Running Start students, those wishing to eventually transfer to a four year university, and returning adult students."
Sophomore,4,"Cascadia has provided me with a fairly good education with passionate people in a fairly good campus environment. With the exception of some difficult advising, I find most of the faculty to be incredibly helpful, kind, and interested in their work."
Niche User,4,"Cascadia was a great place to start my college experience. It's affordable, it's beautiful, the teachers are impassioned and willing to help, there are lots of resources available... I could go on. It was a great experience for me, and I appreciate just how many resources were available to help me."
Freshman,4,"Cascadia is a beautiful campus with excellent class choices and teachers. There is plenty of space to study in the library, which is shared with the University of Washington Bothell. The science programs are wonderful and there are many resources to assist you with your education, including tutoring centers, supplemental instruction study groups and professor office hours. All the facilities are very nice since the school is not very old."
Sophomore,4,I am a Running Start student at Cascadia. Almost all of my professors have been wonderful -- extremely willing to help students succeed and passionate about their subject. However I carefully pick my professors each quarter so I can't speak for all of them. Cascadia also has a good selection of food but it is overpriced.
Sophomore,4,Most of the instructors are awesome ans super helpful. There is a large variety of classes offered. There is always something going on around campus.
Alum,4,"It was a very nice place to attend college to easily transition to a University. I received an Associate Degree with a ""Direct Transfer Agreement"" and had no issues transferring to a University as Junior. Small class sizes make learning easy, however, the large amount of group work they do is just not for me!"
College Freshman,4,Professors are helpful and easy going. Attentive to their students.
College Senior,4,This school is very academic focused and wants their students to succeed they are just working out some kinks because they are so young.
College Junior,4,The school was great. You can get help from everywhere.
College Junior,4,"For a community college, Cascadia is one of the best. Since it is on the same campus as UW Bothell, I get almost all of the same resources as someone going to UW. As for classes, all of my profs. have been very helpful and willing to help me individually if needed. One on one time with teachers is really easy to get here since the class sizes are about 30 kids. Some things that have been a bit rough is the textbook process. A couple of times, I have wasted money by buying a book beforehand and then day of class the teacher tells us we don't need it. Or we will only use a couple pages out of the book the whole quarter."
College Freshman,4,Class times were great. Several classes for one subject were offered so you had options. It's easy to consolidate your classes just as long as you sign up as soon as possible.
College Freshman,4,It's a two year school so there's nothing special about their degrees in general termsâ€”however they would be perfect transfer degrees to UW. Haven't really seen much about employment recruiters or internship recruiters except for one day where we had sort of an event where people where offering internships.
College Freshman,4,Not a lot of variety with courses. Classes are the perfect number of studentsâ€”ranging from 20-30 depending on how popular the class is. Several styles of classes are offered such as integrated learning or combined classes.
College Freshman,4,Professors are greatâ€”really knowledgable and passionate about their subject areas. They really challenge the students and seek to make sure that we really grow and learn.
College Freshman,4,"I loves this school. It was the perfect transition school, especially for those who are hoping to transfer to UW, since Cascadia was already connected to UW Bothell and shared the same resources."
College Junior,4,"So far I'm quite enjoying my experience at Cascadia, and it's quite nice when your school shares a campus with another as to mingle the students."
College Junior,4,I appreciate the amount of communication the school has had with me so far. I had to do part of my registration process from Europe and it was not easy but they helped to make sure I had everything I needed for the start of the school year. My professors have also been helpful and clear so far regarding assignments and expectations.
College Senior,4,"I really like Cascadia because it has a smaller campus making it easy to find your classes, especially on the first day. For the most part, every professor I have had has been personable and really cares about your education and success in the classroom. They make sure you know all of your options for projects and sometimes even give you time in class to sort yourself out.  Group work is essential to every class and is unavoidable, so if you don't like working in groups... well you're out of luck because Cascadia requires it. However, professors almost always let you score your group members after projects, so if someone slacks off and you're stuck with the rest of the work, make sure to let your professor know and they will grade accordingly. I have never had a difficult time achieving good grades at Cascadia because there are so many resources available to help you."
College Freshman,4,My experience entering college for the first time has been fairly straight forward. Cascadia has a great system down to help incoming freshmen make the transition smooth. I have been able to meet with my adviser with any questions I have and received help in planning my college career.
College Junior,4,cascadia is a great college.  my classes are very interesting and i am learning a lot.
Recent Alumnus,4,The school has many different resources.
College Senior,4,"Compared to other community colleges in the Area, it's pretty good. The library is nice and everybody there is helpful. The athletic center is being built currently. Everything seems to meet standards but nothing is exceptional quality-wise."
College Senior,4,"It was very unique and valuable experiences that I underwent. Even it was tough, it made me to become better person and prepared for next education step."
College Senior,4,"Cascadia community college is an equal opportunity institution and does not discriminate on the basis or face, color, religion, gender or sex, disability age , or any genetic information."
College Senior,4,"The class is small, and you will feel more attention from others than huge universities. 

I would recommend to international students like myself. 

Cascadia shares University of Washington Bothell's library, so it's really convenient for research and utilizing the school system."
College Sophomore,4,"Courses and professors both help students learn a lot. Class sizes are very reasonable, so it's easy to get a moment to speak with a professor in class."
College Sophomore,4,Classes are structured well. Teachers are often reasonable with their work load and want to help. The class registration process is easy; it is simple to find and register for classes. Several out-of-classroom resources are available for academic help.
College Sophomore,4,"Finding the classes to fit my schedule has not been a problem, and I have often been able to get all of my classes on the same days so I can easily schedule other non-academic responsibilities."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many resources for getting help outside of the classroom for homework, essays, and other subject matter. The library is very extensive and useful for research projects."
College Junior,4,Fun. been doing lots of different stuff. professors are the best I swear.
College Junior,4,"Iv been going to the library a lot and its clean, neat, easy, big, and fun. love it."
College Junior,4,They give you lots of options on what might be best and try to help you pick the best ones for you.
College Junior,4,"their are a lot of different people. their are lots of awesome people, and yet their are those rare, really off kids, y'know? but over all were awesome and unique. deffianly"
College Junior,4,This school is awesome in that its attached to the bigger 4 year university of Washington Bothell. so we get to use their perks which is awesome.
College Junior,4,Some classes are only offered at said times. but mostly there are a range so I'm able to schedule a nice fitting one.
College Junior,4,"Its community college. it is good. cheep. and I'm able to defiantly learn a lot from these nice professors, too!"
College Freshman,4,"There are math help centers, writing centers, a great university library, and good study hours."
College Freshman,4,"At first, I had a professor that did not give me good feedback and took awhile to get back to me by email but this quarter I have amazing teachers."
College Sophomore,4,Very good but not enough engineering classes
College Junior,4,"I think the student body is great. People participate in events, activities, ect. There's always a lot of people in the library studying, doing homework, chatting quietly with each other.  "
College Senior,2,"It isn't very pleasant when you find there's only one class for a subject, and you can't take it because you have another class at the same time.

The college is new, so there aren't many classes compared to other schools."
College Senior,2,Getting scholarships in community college is uneasy for international students. Even though they have a program they offer very small amount of money.
College Senior,2,"Online class wasn't helpful for me. There was A LOT OF homeworks, and very short deadline is given. In addition, when the website does not work, you need to email all the works to your classmates and instructor."
College Freshman,2,"There's really nothing that pertains to my major or intended career that's offered at Cascadia. No job opportunities, etc. Have never spoken with any alumni because I don't know if there's a network for that..."
College Sophomore,2,"They changed the class schedule as they want. The Worst. I have to drop important classes and I think my graduation time is delayed because of this. Class size is great, I like the small class around 20 students. Teachers are ok. Workload is quite heavy. Advising , Transfer and Career center totally useless, I went there a lot and they always gives vague answer. They can't even advise about major or career recommendation, moreover about school transfer and in the end I have to look the answer myself."
College Junior,2,"Career Center Helpfully or Unhelpfull â€“ I'm still in my first years of getting my associates degree, all though if i was a graduate looking around at the career center at Cascadia Community college it would be very unhelpful. There isn't a real clear direction on where you would look to find help with post-grad services."
College Senior,1,They send out no information on financial aid and have very little assistance for students who aren't living in poverty.

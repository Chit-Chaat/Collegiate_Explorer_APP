Alum,5,"I loved attending the University of Pittsburgh for my undergraduate education. I was involved in a very difficult and demanding nursing curriculum but the education was great and prepared me very well for the profession. Even with a difficult major the sense of community at Pitt was always positive and with plenty of activities to choose from and on top of that, the school is located to the city of Pittsburgh! The school gives you a Pitt ID that gives you free access to the bus system which really encourages students to explore the city and opportunity to explore neighborhoods, restaurants, museums (also free with ID). Overall my professors were phenomenal and passionate about teaching us students. Choosing Pitt for college was one of the best decisions I ever made!"
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes online from the University of Pittsburgh, so I cannot comment on the quality of online learning."
Alum,5,"I transferred my junior year from another Pittsburgh school that was much more expensive.  I believe I received a superior education at Pitt than where I previously attended, for a fraction of the cost.  I am proud of my degree from Pitt and highly recommend the school!"
Alum,5,"The University of Pittsburgh is a great institution that provides you with one of the most well rounded education and experience possible. Located in the heart of Oakland, Pitt dominates the neighborhood so the entire area feels like your campus."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Pittsburgh is a wonderful college. The campus is among the most beautiful I've seen on the east coast. The school culture is very upbeat, especially when sports are successful. All professors are extremely helpful and love to see when their students succeed. There are plenty of on campus resources available to students. There is no shortage of clubs or activities that students can join to meet new people doing the things they enjoy doing."
Junior,5,Most professors love the topic they're teaching and are willing to go out of their way to help you. The campus is also beautiful.
Sophomore,5,Great people and teachers who are prompt at answering questions on email and are all nice when you speak with them.
Sophomore,5,Though it wasn't the preferred method to learn from during the latter half of the spring semester it was a great experience and most of the information that needed to come across to the student from the professor was easy to understand and could be watched multiple times in order to better understand it.
Freshman,5,"I haven't taken any online courses yet, but I have heard from others that the professors do their best to accommodate students with online learning. I'm registering for courses this semester and everyone has been very helpful in guiding me with an online schedule!"
Freshman,5,"I love Pitt! The people here are very nice and the academics are pretty challenging and rigorous depending on your major. The administration is pretty helpful also, even right now during the pandemic. Even if you have trouble reaching people there is always someone willing to help you out."
Alum,5,"The institution has great traditions which span the academic, social, and athletic experiences.  Importantly, Pitt can connect its undergraduate and graduate programs to assist a student's career aspirations.  Physically, a beautify campus in a great town."
Alum,5,I took a few online classes while pursuing my MBA. These classes were well done and afforded me the flexibility I needed during those semesters.
Alum,5,"Founded in 1787, Pitt has a long tradition of excellence. The University of Pittsburgh is also ranked among the nation’s top 20 public colleges and universities in the 2020 U.S. News & World Report Best Colleges rankings. Pitt is a state-related (not public) university which means that still maintain full autonomy. Pitt is over 75% white (as is Pittsburgh) but still feels very diverse and has a high number of international students. Pitt is know for its top ranked medical, business, engineering, and law schools. Pitt alums are very loyal and commonly seek to help other Pitt alums."
Alum,5,I was able to take online classes while caring for my family. It was convenient and a great experience.
Senior,5,"I did not take any online classes, except for classes that were transitioned to online during COVID-19.  My teachers were very good in transitioning to online learning."
Senior,5,My overall experience at the University of Pittsburgh was very great.  I was greatly able to get a pre-med education that allowed me to be accepted to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
Sophomore,5,"I was not comfortable with online learning at first, but I got used to it in the end. I think online learning is easier than learning in the campus. Because we get to watch professor's recording over and over again."
Sophomore,5,"My semester switched to online learning due to Covid19 and I was taking 13 credits. It was manageable and all of my professors were relentlessly helping students as much as possible. Online resources were fine, for example, the office of disability services was able to continue meetings with students over the phone to ensure success in every student/"
Sophomore,5,"The University of Pittsburgh gave me the best year of my life so far. I had many highs and lows, I made so many different friends, joined clubs and sororities, and grew emotionally as well as educationally. This university has a very strong community feeling and feels small even though its rather large. The central Pittsburgh location is awesome and never boring. Also, as a student you have sooooo many campus resources (gym, career center, pharmacy, doctors, Starbucks, discounts, library, grocery stores, etc.) and dining halls are even improving. Definitely recommend applying and visiting!!!"
Senior,5,Since being forced to finish out the semester online the professors used online to the best of their abilities but I was still able to properly comprehend my classes and efficiently ace my exams.
Junior,5,"In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, I think that the University of Pittsburgh did a great job of adapting to an online learning experience. I was still able to have discussions and my professors were just as enthusiastic about their courses as they were before the pandemic. Pitt did a great job with the transition.

I have never taken an online course, however, and do not know about that experience."
Junior,5,"The University of Pittsburgh is a perfect school for those want a balanced college experience. Many of my friends and I challenge ourselves with rigorous courses, yet we still find time throughout the week to have fun, go out to eat, and explore different parts of the city. The social life at Pitt is great and there is no shortage of things that you can do in Pittsburgh if you want to get out of Oakland. The classes are challenging but very manageable and also extremely interesting. I have also had the opportunity to take a graduate-level course, and I was the only undergraduate. Moreover, I have enrolled in many small seminars in which there are no more than twenty five students. I recently took a class on Policy, Race, and Power that had around sixteen students in the class. In sum, the University of Pittsburgh is an amazing place for the curious intellectual who also likes to have a balanced life. I would recommend it to anyone."
Sophomore,5,teachers were very willing to adapt to this situation and were easy to contact. rarely ever were there issues with them.
Sophomore,5,very accepting of everyone and provides good resources. great environment and is not too small or too big. i highly recommend it to any student looking for a mix of city and campus life.
Graduate Student,5,University of Pittsburgh offers great resources and a great program for OT. There are so many local resources in the area to use.
Graduate Student,5,"I have not taken any online classes. However, the user interface of all university of Pittsburgh interactions has been excellent. The University and Program Director keeps us updated and in the loop through online interaction."
Freshman,5,"The University of Pittsburgh is located right in the heart of an amazing city. Pitt has amazing academics and professors in a wide variety of fields. There is always something to do and be involved with-- whether its research, extracurriculars, sports, or social life. I just finished my first year at Pitt, and despite the switch to online learning due to COVID-19, it was a great year academically and socially."
Senior,5,"Great school in an amazing city. You will never get bored at Pitt whether its going to sporting events, attending a school event, or attending one of the city events."
Sophomore,5,"While all online classes have their own difficulties, the professors did a great job minimizing the negative consequences of the transition to learning online."
Sophomore,5,"Pitt is such an amazing place to go to school. Professors are personable and available to help you, and there’s no shortage of things to do in the area."
Alum,5,"Pitt provided me with a high quality education in a safe and fun urban environment. I loved the accessibility of the faculty, campus, and downtown. To prove how much I love it, I am doing it again and attending Pitt Law in the fall! There is no other school that I would like to call home."
Freshman,5,"As a pre-medical student, this university offers so many opportunities to motivated students. The faculty and staff of all related departments are phenomenal and passionate to teach and help students. As it is in the city, you experience new things!"
Freshman,5,The University of Pittsburgh is a great option for students looking for a good education in a city school. Pitt has great academics with amazing professors who make a difficult class a little easier by having many office hours and explaining topics well.
Freshman,5,"Pitt is a great university because of the balance between academics and social life. The majority of people have a similar outlook where academics come first and their social life comes second. The only downside to Pitt is that it is difficult to take classes at several schools. For example, if I am in SHRS and want to minor in Spanish, I would still need to fulfill the Gen Eds of the Dietrich School."
Junior,5,really loved coming to Pitt and meeting new people. the campus is immersed with the city itself. stronger stem field than most people would think
Junior,5,I love Pitt! All of the students are very laid-back and the professors are enthusiastic and want you to succeed!
Alum,5,Loved everything about my time spent at Pitt. Pittsburgh is also a great city to work after graduating.
Sophomore,5,I love Pitt! I do think there should be more aid to middle class students. There is not much I would change.
Alum,5,Pitt was located in a very cool city and had a lot of great teachers. I ended up being extremely glad I went there.
Sophomore,5,"Pitt is an excellent university which combines high-quality academics and an incredibly warm community.  The university is located in Oakland, in the heart of Pittsburgh and a short (free) bus ride away from the bustling downtown containing the cultural district and another short bus ride from the quaint communities of squirrel hill and shadyside filled with cute coffee shops. The campus itself has a wide selection of fast casual restaurant chains and practically contains the Carnegie Museums of Natural History and Art. Pitt is also right next to Schenley Park in which you can go for a reflective nature walk and be one with the trees of Pittsburgh.

tldr: Pitt is an amazing school!"
Alum,5,"Fantastic academics, campus and city experience were unmatched, and athletic experience rounded out a university experience that I will be forever grateful for."
Freshman,5,"University of Pittsburgh have an urban campus that encourages you to develop independence and an appreciation of cultural diversity. At the same time campus is a traditional campus with plenty of green spaces, including two nearby parks. The residence halls featuring online network access, study and recreation lounges, fitness centers, coffee carts, and special academic communities.
 Pittsburgh is full of great entertainment, shops, restaurants, theaters, galleries, museums, sports teams and more. Through  extensive programs and services, UPitt   provide plenty of opportunities for you to forge new friendships, take part engaging in fun and dynamic activities and feel at home in your new surroundings."
Alum,5,"This is the perfect school for undergraduate. Its in a city thats not too small and is safer compared to other cities. The academics are pretty good and challenging. The off campus options have gotten better, housing isn't great but apartments are cheappp."
Freshman,5,The University of Pittsburgh has been extremely accommodating to me even before I applied. The campus is gorgeous and diverse. Pitts academics are very good and I am sure that the professors will equip for my future success.
Sophomore,5,"I like my classes at the University of Pittsburgh most- despite large class sizes, my professors make themselves available to students and care deeply about our academic success. Also, I have been impressed by many of my professors' work in their respective fields and am glad I have had the opportunity to learn from knowledgeable professionals. The size of the school is far from overwhelming, as many clubs and student organizations are small enough that I was able to not feel lost in a crowd, even though I started as a transfer student in a spring semester. Pitt overall has exceeded my expectations."
Senior,5,This university has prepared me well to apply to medical schools. I loved the course diversity and many on campus activities.
Niche User,5,"Our son and daughter both received full time job offers, after completing internships, by the spring of their senior year. Pitt graduates are well prepared for the work force. The city has a lot to offer if your student is motivated. It is a great size - not too big or too small."
Freshman,5,"I loved everything about it and will recommend to everyone. The campus right in the city is absolutely amazing. It is very pretty during any time of the year. Everyone I have met here, students and faculty, are all very nice and willing to help."
Niche User,5,everyone was so nice and very helpful when i visited the school. the students all seemed happy to be there which definitely shows the energy of the school.
Niche User,5,its a wonderful school and campus. THe people are super nice and its a wonderful place to learn medicine.
Niche User,5,I love the University of Pittsburgh! All of the off campus food and things to do drew me to the University. Hail to Pitt!
Sophomore,5,"The absolute best thing about a large school, especially a large semi-urban campus, is that there are hundreds of opportunities to find your niche. I find the people who are less happy here tend to be the people who didn't go to the activity fair or join clubs or apply/audition for things, or didn't join an academic community, or didn't talk to people in their classes or on their floor, etc. Take advantage of the vast pool of resources and potential friend groups that Pitt affords you. I'm happier here than I could possibly be anywhere else, because I've fallen in with ""my people,"" I love the campus and city, and I am treated with respect by my professors and mentors. Also, the student health center, at least the counseling center, is really really good."
Freshman,5,The college tours was amazing . They showed us different parts of the college and told us how a typical day would be like at Pitt and since then I fell in love with it.
Niche User,5,"The University of Pittsburgh is one the best schools out there! It's in the perfect location where you stay in the city feel, but are able to go out to the suburbs as well. The atmosphere is very welcoming as well."
Niche User,5,"Urban campus that also has a small city feel so your don't feel completely lost. Wonderful small restaurants, however, the campus is food is not good."
Niche User,5,"I am a current Senior right now and I have committed to the University of Pittsburgh! I love it there. I attended one of their campus visits in the summer. When I first arrived at the hotel my family and I were staying, I was not impressed with the school. However, the day after I was very impressed. It was absolutely beautiful. At the campus, you do not feel like you are in a big city. Adam Kauffman, who is one of the administrators for the Office of Admissions team, treats you very well and makes you feel very welcome at the school. The campus is absolutely walkable, has so many opportunities, so many activities to do in and out of school, so many clubs, etc. This school is definitely worth your education as well. They are in the top 25 in the nation for research. This school has everything a student is looking for."
Alum,5,"For me, the best part of Pitt was the wide range of research being conducted and the ability of undergraduates to become heavily involved in labs. If you are interested in biological/medical sciences and research, Pitt is a great place to attend. Professors are often experts in their field and typically have a very good understanding of the material (especially in niche upper-level courses).

The campus itself is beautiful, though the surrounding area of Oakland is a bit of a slum and suffers from absent landlords. Transit is also excellent should you move a bit farther from campus. And of course, sports are a pretty large part of the Pitt experience. 

Overall, it is a large university that will be what you make of it. Pitt was a great fit for me since I was looking for research experience, good academics, and still have a typical college experience of attending football/basketball games and meeting lots of people."
Niche User,5,great school                                                                        oh i love this school it is great
Freshman,5,The University of Pittsburgh is a great school with a lot of great people. The University is also located in the city so its a nice place to walk around and do things. The teachers there are also great.
Graduate Student,5,I am currently participating in their online Doctoral program in Nursing and the design of the program has been made convenient  for a working professional mother.
Freshman,4,"I love the University of Pittsburgh! The campus is amazing, a quick ride to downtown, with tons of things to do. You get a free bus pass with tuition, which makes it easy to get anywhere you are trying to go. The professors are amazing, the classes are extremely informative, and student life helps prepare you for the future with lots of clubs and extra learning opportunities."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Pittsburgh has implemented a very good plan to continue delivering outstanding education through online classes. Using Zoom and Canvas, students have easy access to professors and class information."
Sophomore,4,"Pitt was the best choice of my life.  School has a wide range of diversity, extensive student activities, and a culture that promotes freedom of expression.  The people that attend here are usually genuine and care for others.  Highly recommend.  Only reason I did not give 5 stars is the on campus food is below average."
Sophomore,4,I have taken classes online and the professors make them very manageable.  Zoom classes are not ideal but the university has tried to make them as similar to a real class as possible.
Sophomore,4,The academics are amazing and professors care about student well-being along with teaching. The campus is absolutely beautiful for a city-campus. Athletics add school spirit and fun!
Sophomore,4,Professors are putting in extra work to ensure that students are keeping up with online work and actually gaining something from this experience.
Junior,4,"Overall, I am enjoying my time at the University of Pittsburgh. I was happy with my school until this fall during the COVID-19 outbreak. I think the school is trying very hard to keep us safe by enforcing masks, providing us with information on how to keep ourselves safe, and giving out masks to each student. My only problem is that I am now going to be learning all online and am having no reduction in my tuition. This is very upsetting to me due to the fact I am paying so much money to not be able to be in the classroom. I also often feel unsafe walking around the campus and South Oakland at night time by myself."
Junior,4,I did take classes online in the spring after school shut down. I think my professors did a great job at moving the courses online and making sure that the amount of work they were giving us was manageable for the additional stress of the global pandemic. I will be taking most classes online this fall and am hoping that everything runs smoothly like it did in the spring. The problem i have with online learning is that I often feel as though I have to teach myself everything instead of being taught by a professor.
Junior,4,During COVID-19 the professors did the best they could to switch to online instruction. Zoom can be difficult to learn off of for some students.
Alum,4,This institution leads with its professors .  Access is easy and assistance with one's work load is available.  The place sets you up for the real world.
Alum,4,"I had a great undergrad experience at University of Pittsburgh, as it is very well-regarded for academic excellence. This campus is unique in the way that it is set in the heart of the city."
Alum,4,"It was a great experience, overall. There's something for everyone! Safety while navigating the campus was a concern, perhaps more security would be beneficial."
Senior,4,"I loved the atmosphere of this university, you get the best of both worlds with the city life of Pittsburgh and the suburb life with the numerous parks around the college campus."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently in the nursing school. I'm also a out of state student. The tuition is crazy high without the grant. Food was really nice, since we have the best dinning hall in the state. Pittsburgh is a good place for learning. It's quiet and slow living."
Sophomore,4,"The transition to online was a little scary and awkward because I didn’t know what was going on with my classes, but it wasn’t that bad. I felt less stressed and busy doing things online. My experience with some of the classes actually got better, but some of them worse. A lot of the changes was a case by case basis, my online physic class gave me more opportunities to ask questions which significantly helped my learning but my chemistry class was an absolute mess, lectures would never be posted consistently so it made my schedule inconsistent and made the class harder. Long story story short the online experience with the class depended greatly on the professor"
Sophomore,4,"Pitt has been an amazing school, the academics are great and there is a lot of frequent events going on. Pitt also has a lot of opportunities and resource that lead to successful careers, after less then a week on campus I went to Google Pittsburgh.
The campus is pretty but the food is not great and a constant struggle. I really wish Pitt had their own small grocery store, I know there is Forbes street Market but it’s small and doesn’t have much, I would like a real store. I also would like to see more food stands like kosher to go, it’s good food and I can grab it and go. 
Pitt could improve with their communication to students, emails to panther or res life can take forever to get a response. It is also hard to find information on things like dorms for example online."
Senior,4,I was born and raised in Pittsburgh and love the atmosphere. You would assume since it is  a large university you would just be another number but in actuality almost all my professors know my name and I have access to several resources in order to receive help.
Sophomore,4,Most of my professors were really nice people and were always willing to help. The campus offers a lot of resources to assist you with your academics and daily life.
Junior,4,"The online platforms were a difficult and quick adjustment, but they were as good as they could've been at adapting."
Junior,4,This is a school where I feel comfortable being me and at home. The only reason I gave it 4 was because I do sometimes feel (as with all colleges) that it is more about money than the students.
Senior,4,"Pitt has been an incredible experience for me so far. As a rising senior, I've been proud to participate in a few of the may clubs, connect with alumni, and use the resources Pitt provides. I feel prepared to find a job and I know that Pitt has the credibility to give me an edge against other candidates. I do with Pitt's administration was more transparent with decision making, but I feel like overall they do a decent job of listening to their students. Pitt is pretty expensive and I'll be paying for it for a while, and tuition does keep going up every year. Overall, my professors have been very passionate and for the most part I've enjoyed my classes. Oakland is a great compromise between a college town and living downtown, it's closed off enough that Pitt feels like a defined area, but the rest of Pittsburgh is easily accessible."
Senior,4,"In general, I think professors adapted well to the transition. However, I think more guidance from the administration to make things more consistent would have been helpful."
Freshman,4,The University of Pittsburgh is a very intriguing and safe school. There are many clubs and other organizations to be a part which is why the students have great pride for the school. The university has a great science and arts program which has easily landed many of my alumni friends a job in the past. There are various museums and also Heinz stadium which are located in Pittsburgh. These are interesting and fun attractions not far from the campus.
Freshman,4,"The online learning experience was as you would expect it to be. Pitt responded very quickly and effectively to the COVID-19 situation, extending spring break by a week to give time to professors and students to prepare for online learning. Professors were typically very understanding of the situation and will work with you if you have any issues."
Sophomore,4,"I like the campus and see how many activities have for the students, i like my professors what i would like to improve is the food and the activities time because they do must during morning and i can not enjoy because i have classes. I love Pitt, Hail to Pitt"
Senior,4,As with any sudden change it is hard to adapt. Pitt adapted fastly and created a plan so that the semester did not get pushed back. For the timing we had the tech was great.
Junior,4,I like the variety of courses offered at the University of Pittsburgh. I would like to see more research and undergraduate work opportunities provided to students in their field of study in order to help them gain work experience and increase their chances in applying to the graduate school of their choice.
Niche User,4,"I've enjoyed my time at Pitt so much, that I'm going back there for my second degree! Pitt has a little bit of everything for everyone: a vibrant campus in the middle of a city, plenty of clubs and activities, and lots to do off campus as well. I'm glad I went to Pitt, and I'm so happy I get to go back and earn my second degree there."
Freshman,4,"I just finished my freshman year at this university, and I can proudly say that I enjoyed every minute I had at the University of Pittsburgh. I have made so many wonderful friends, experienced many new things, and learned so much from my professors. Although I thoroughly enjoyed this past year, there are some things that I hope the university could improve on. Firstly, there are many professors that do not display student's grades online on the website they are provided. I hope that in years to come professors will take advantage of this system, it would help students keep up with their grades in an easier manner. Secondly, similar to most other universities, there are professors who seem to either not too happy to be teaching during class or are ver rude when approached by students. This type of interaction really strays students from approaching professors with questions they may have and can lead students to be unsuccessful in class. I wish that professors consider this. H2P!!!"
Freshman,4,"I don't enjoy half the professors in my first year nor how the first year program is set up for engineering but beyond the first year I love the smaller class sizes and the professors, as well as the campus."
Senior,4,"Great school environment. Class selection can sometimes be difficult due to the number of students, but overall I was always able to find something to fit my requirements and schedule. I like the campus overall and how spread out it is and how pretty the buildings are especially in the spring."
Alum,4,"Pitt is a great school academically - I had great professors in all my core classes and believe I received a very good education. Pitt is centered in a nice location, there's always lots to do on campus, free access to museums, concerts in the park, an endless amount of student clubs. However, there are things about Pitt that could use improvement. Many buildings in Oakland are older and have landlords that rip off students bc they know they need housing (our drywall ceiling collapsed senior year and others have mice/rat issues). Oakland houses need more trashcans and recycling, because bins are often overflowing. The on campus food should be improved, especially for vegetarians or people with other dietary restrictions. Luckily, Pitt has some good off campus vegetarian options like HelloBistro & Roots. Student safety has decreased with more break ins into off campus housing - blue lights should be extended into ALL areas where Pitt houses students not just on campus."
Senior,4,"In the engineering school, I love the vast amount of resources to help with Co-ops, internships, study abroad, research, and fellowships. I do not know of an engineering student in their 3rd or 4th year that has not done at least of the opportunities I listed. I think the diversity could be better, I am 99% sure I am the only black female computer engineering student in my year. In the computer engineering program, I love how ready the professors are to help me with my academics, my professional life, and my future after undergrad. I also love the variety of student organizations and clubs that I can join as well as the ease in creating a new space on campus for people who need/want them."
Freshman,4,When I visited the university I fell in love with the city and how connected everyone is to each other. The campus feels how you would expect college to feel and you have the ability to go anywhere at an efficient time.
Niche User,4,Great atmosphere and spirit here! There is also a lot of history about this school that is apparent all around campus! Would recommend anyone to look into Pitt!
Sophomore,4,"Not only does this school have great academic programs, but it also a great community to become apart of. The university offers its students many opportunities for jobs after graduation and during school."
Niche User,4,More diversity to the campus and student life. Not many activities that are open to all different varieties of students. Professors are extremely well and easy to be in class
Junior,4,"School is very inclusive and supportive of your dreams and endeavors. Though there isn't as much diversity as I was looking for, the communities here are very open to anyone and the minority community is a tight knit crew that supports each other and actively is trying to advocate for the black, latino, and other minority groups."
Freshman,4,"I finished up my first semester at the University of Pittsburgh and am overall pretty happy with my decision. The academics are great and are only on the rise, ranking in the top 25 public universities for the first time this year. The one downside to this school is the food. Get a very dinning dollar heavy meal plan and be prepared to spend a decent amount of money at the restaurants on Forbes avenue. Also, the party scene takes a little getting used to but if you have your group of friends, this shouldn't be an issue. Overall, great school."
Senior,4,I have been at Pitt for 4+ years now and have loved almost every second of it. The professors are kind and always willing to help students understand the information in their courses either during the office hours or even by private appointments. I have had multiple brain injuries prior to coming to this school but was able to receive the help I needed in order to maintain my student life as well as my personal. The only problem I have come across at Pitt is the cost to simply attend the school. I come from a divorced family and have been mostly independent in my time at Pitt and for my final year here I find myself unable to get another loan to help cover my costs. My mother lost her job right before my final year and was no longer able to help me with financial aid and as a full time student I cannot work full time as well to cover my costs. I would love to finish my wonderful experience at Pitt but have one last hurdle to get over.
Junior,4,Pitt has so much to offer on campus. Through opportunities to connect to potential employers to attending sporting events Pitt is it.
Junior,4,"The environment is beautiful, there are great food options, overall quality of life is great. I wish there were more gyms and that the winter break was a bit longer."
Sophomore,4,"The campus itself is a very unique layout, with many of the classes being held in the Cathedral of Learning. As a Division One school, they ensure that athletes are able to pursue their degree as well as participate in sports."
Junior,4,In my opinion Pitt offers above average academics and extra-circular activities including club sports and organizations. There are so many friendly professors and students that will make you feel involved.
Senior,4,The university of Pittsburgh has provided me with countless opportunities to grow and develop over the past 4 years!
Freshman,4,"The whole staff at the school has been immensely helpful with all of the difficult situations that I have had... father becoming disabled and passing away, etc. The professors are all very accommodation and want to see you succeed."
Niche User,4,"I enjoy the campus environment, the city really provides activities for any kind of person, and if someone wants to take advantage of the location it is super easy!"
Freshman,4,"The education is the reason I came to Pittsburgh. The people, teachers and students are engaged, active learners and constantly asking questions on how to improve themselves. 
The city itself is learn-able and adaptable. There are events hosted around campus all the time, and the access to public transportation and historical sites is incredible. 
However, the food and dorm life on Pitt's campus is not a highlight. The dining halls face consistent health code violations, and the options are limited, not accommodating to people with food allergies. The dorms are chosen by lottery, and often are squished with people and sub-par facilities within the dorms. 
Yet, the dorms are not where I spend most of my time. I am constantly out and about, finding new study rooms and searching for teachers or students to talk and engage with. The passion for education and future careers is why I chose the University of Pittsburgh."
Freshman,4,"The campus itself is beautiful, as well as the people. Throughout my time here I've made many friends, all who possess a unique personality that makes me thankful to call them friends. The professors here at Pitt are also truly amazing. Each one of my professors keeps me engaged in the subject. One particular professor I respect is my Arabic professor, Dr. Myriam Abdel-Malek. She teaches supposedly the hardest language for English speakers to learn, but while the material may be difficult, the class itself is very engaging, making me want to learn more and more of the language. I am excited to see my proficiency in the language by the end of my time here at Pitt."
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere, and there is always a faculty member available to support you. I would recommend attending this university because of the opportunities inside and around the campus, and the location, being in a thriving city with cultural districts and thousands of possibilities!"
Senior,4,"A fantastic school that has been on the up and up. As a business student, they are continuously making improvements and ensuring students have access to opportunity."
Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman, but I'm enjoying it. I study psychology and art history, and while those aren't the main focuses of the school, the classes a good and Deitrich is strong. I wish there were more classes available during the spring semester in my majors. I also wish I could get more financial aid."
Niche User,4,"Like the campus and the city during my visiting the campus back in 08/2019.  The tour and information session are were very well organized and had excellent presentations. The stuff and students are very nice and friendly.  Like its academics, especially interested in the 8 year medical program."
Niche User,4,I loved it! My experience was one to remember. The environment and activity on the campus is something to look forward to each day. The sports are always fun to watch and the professors are very invested in watching the students be successful.
Sophomore,4,"Although Pitt has a large student body, it feels like a small school. It's rare that I walk across campus without at least seeing one friendly face. The overall community is amazing and full of diverse cultural backgrounds and a variety of personalities and ideas. The academics are unbeatable and the athletics are incredible. There are so many opportunities within and around the school. There is no better school or city to study in."
Junior,4,"I really love the campus and the classes offered at Pitt. I also love that there is a wide range of class sizes at Pitt as well. If I could change something, it would be that the new professors are screened better and are watched closely because some of the professors could really use some work."
Junior,4,"The University of Pittsburgh is a great place to go to school. Students are living in a growing and diverse city, but also get the opportunity to be on a campus and truly have that college experience."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the University of Pittsburgh is an amazing school. If you are deciding on whether to major in engineering or pre-medicine, this is definitely the school for you. Pittsburgh also is a cool place to hang out and explore. It is such a historical city so I would enjoy it."
Senior,4,I am currently a student at Pitt and I love the urban campus and the unique campus environment that comes from that. the academics are great and some of the worlds best in certain studies making me proud to be part of that.
Sophomore,4,"Teachers really care and want you to learn, the community is great, but wish there was a little more school spirit, which can be hard to attain at a city university."
Freshman,2,"Although some of my professors are very good, some are not and are dumping a lot of busy work onto us , with daily homework assignments that are sometimes taking me hours on end to complete. I have difficulty with learning online, taking all of my classes from my dorm was not the freshman experience I had hoped for. I lack social interactions and it has become extremely difficult for me to make friends. My mental health is suffering horribly from this new change and I really am not enjoying my freshman year at all."
Junior,2,I don't really feel welcome there. It's hard to fit in with everyone since I'm a transfer student. I do have a few friends but they're all in different majors so I don't see them as much.
Junior,2,All of my classes transitioned online during the pandemic. I do not feel that the quality of instruction I received online was at all comparable or equal to in-person instruction and that tuition for this semester should have been heavily decreased to reflect this.
Niche User,2,I liked going to school here I just found it incredibly difficult to find a tutor or obtain disability status.
Alum,2,"The campus is unique in that it is mixed in with regular city buildings, and is near a few other universities. It seems like a great school for students pursuing engineering or medicine, but the arts programs could be better.

I majored in a foreign language; we were put in an old engineering building, and I had no support from the staff and faculty. Career Services told me that since I didn't want to pursue a career in government or teaching, I should drop out and attend trade school.

The general education classes were rough because the class sizes were massive (between 100 and 300 students). One math professor, who was head of the department at the time, told the class on Ash Wednesday that she didn't see enough students participating and spent the lecture explaining why we should be Christians.

The school has a solid athletics department, but the athletes are treated like superstars and got away with anything.

Overall, it was ok, but is definitely better for the sciences."
Sophomore,2,The main campus is a busy environment. There were some teachers that really cared and others that turned it into sink or swim conditions.
Niche User,2,The University of Pittsburgh is located in an amazing area- the booming hub of Oakland! Any time spent there will enhance your experience within the City of Pittsburgh.
Graduate Student,2,"The program I am in (Library Science) is mostly ignored by the administration. Our building is drafty. The program is being revamped, which means that a lot of professors are retiring or leaving, and students are left with a limited number of classes to select. There are constantly problems with transcripts being misplaced, students being promised tuition remission and then not receiving it, and students never hearing back from professors or administrators they attempt to contact. The graduate student groups are poorly organized and receive little guidance. When a mistake is made with paperwork, it takes a long time to get it corrected and the school will not admit it was their mistake. The required classes are often redundant, and valid electives are not made clear (and sometimes not listed at all). There is almost no communication regarding funding and even in a small program it is easy to be overlooked and ignored when you have a problem."
Niche User,2,"While Pittsburgh is the city that holds all of my heart, sadly I feel as if the beauty of the city isn't portrayed in the culture/ society/ demographic of the university."
College Sophomore,2,"There is Greek life on campus, but you do not have to join Greek to have a social life. I am not Greek and after being on campus a year, nothing draws me to join Greek at Pitt."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Greek life events are definitely not the safest place for women to venture, especially if they are by themselves or have had to much to drink. Sexual assault is a problem at universities around the country, and university administrators do not like acknowledging this fact because it gives their universities bad publicity. Pitt is not the worst when it comes to addressing sexual assault on campus but there are definitely steps the administration could take to enhance their dealings with sexual assault and violence."
College Sophomore,2,"Tiny, outdated rooms, for an outrageous price. I'm now staying in a furnished 1bd apartment for less than I paid for a room in towers. Ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,Good for parties but be careful of which ones you attend because some are just down right unsafe. They think they're cool but they're really not.
College Senior,2,I don't like greek life. I believe it promotes bad values and breaks rules.
College Sophomore,2,"While living on campus was convenient to most of Oakland, the security levels were annoying BECAUSE they were so necessary. Signing yourself in and every guest in and out was a hassle and walking up 19 floors of steps of towers was terrible when the elevators were busy. The guards were nice, the bathrooms were cleaned and the view was beautiful. People were loud, however, and no one ever seemed to know what was going on."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not interact with them, and when I do, they seem like the worst. However, they do seem to enjoy what they do and on gam day, most people can be seen repping my school and carrying around a very suspicious bottle of Gatorade."
College Sophomore,2,My school does not have great comradery or a sense of one-ness. The campus is mixed into the expanding city and everyone is either disrespectful to the people around them or just plain ignorant. The classes and professors within my field of study are amazing and I have felt as though this is the right school for me based solely on academics and not on my withering social life.
College Sophomore,2,There is no school spirit at Pitt. It's likely because our school is mediocre at sports.
College Sophomore,2,Any level of sexual assault on campus is one that we should strive to eliminate.
College Freshman,2,"The neighborhood of South Oakland, which is where many students move off campus, is generally unsafe. A lot of my friends have been robbed there. However, if you are walking home alone in South Oakland at night, you can call a SafeRider, which is a free resource for all students that will take you anywhere on campus from 7 pm until 5 am."
College Freshman,2,"Well, I mean they did invite Milo Yiannopolous to speak, and they said it was ""free speech."" Do with that what you will."
College Freshman,2,"If you want a ""career"" then this is the place for you."
College Freshman,2,"The athletics are suffocating.  They have large posters glorifying their athletes, and the research departments (with equally successful students) get nothing but general accolades."
College Freshman,2,"Ok, so the University of Pittsburgh is really good at delivering a product: the ""cosmopolitan,"" ""experienced,"" ""diverse,"" ""creative,"" ""global-thinking"" students.  However, this comes at a cost.  Like most large universities, Pitt brainwashes its students into seeking this carefully marketed ideal of what a successful student is.  Their goal is to get you onto an educational track and force feed you propaganda, like PathFinders (who openly and blatantly lie and sugar-coat the entire school), students with ""H2P"" instagram accounts, and other means.  If you like a school that is willing to baby you into the real world under the guise of opportunity, or a school that smothers creativity and indivuality, then Pitt is it. H2P."
College Senior,2,"For my personal preference, class sizes are way too large. Most professors are not accessible outside of class other than for 1-2 hours a week for office hours which are usually difficult to make with other classes and a work schedule. Academically, nothing is personalized. Professors create exams and projects that can be graded quickly using scrantron or will have TAs grade and look for one specific answer for an open ended type of question."
College Freshman,2,It's just like high school all over again.
College Junior,2,There just isn't much of a greek life here. It's not a big part of campus life.
College Senior,2,"Many gen eds I took were interesting, but many were taught directly to a syllabus where as long as you checked off a bunch of boxes, you got an A.  This was frustrating because even if I had a good idea, it had to conform to someone else's conception of what a good idea looks like.

My actual major's classes were terribly taught.  There were no practical skills taught because professors thought they distracted from learning material, so most students came out vastly underprepared for the real world.  Additionally, the material itself was often old, with no teaching of important contemporary topics because of the view that teaching undergrads is pointless."
College Senior,2,"Pitt is overwhelmingly white, and there are a few black students.  Asians are quite underrepresented, and I can't recall ever seeing a Hispanic student in any of my classes, including giant gen eds."
College Senior,2,"If you want to work anywhere outside of Pittsburgh, a Pitt degree in anything outside of health sciences is virtually useless.  Most computer science recruiters at career fairs want average Java programmers (because they'll search for anything more advanced at Carnegie Mellon), and the only tech companies I've seen are past their heyday, like HP and IBM.  Startup activity is virtually nonexistent because, again, the best computer science department in the world is right next door.  There's also this overwhelming feeling that most professors do not care about what's happening outside of academia, so your career support network from professors is virtually nonexistent.  Additionally, career services doesn't do much to help you other than by Googling things you probably did on your own."
College Senior,2,"Most of my professors viewed undergrads as too stupid to teach anything remotely advanced, so I never once felt like my major was challenging.  If I spent a lot of time on an assignment, it was due to busywork and not because the material was actually hard.  We received a single elective per semester that met a requirement, so it was impossible to graduate on time without starting really early, getting special permission to take another class, or spending a ton of money to take summer classes.  Most of my electives were over 50 people because the department couldn't afford to offer extra sections.  The funding situation was so bad, graduate students were being shoved into easy undergraduate courses.  Many also refused to use computers, and if they had to, they would have you shove your work into other peoples' code.

People say Pitt is ""what you make of it"", but that is an absolutely terrible reason to spend so much money on a Pitt degree.  I'd recommend picking a better school that cares more about its students."
College Senior,2,"I wouldn't choose Pitt if I had to do it again.  Everything was based on making the school look as good as possible without actually improving things.  For example, the CS department claims a 100% employment rate even though many students are underemployed, and the career services department holds a lot of workshops that aren't actually that helpful.  Freshman programs are ubiquitous and keep freshmen happy so they don't transfer, and once you're retained as a student, the university could not care less about you.

My department, statistics, was chronically underfunded and we had a single elective per semester.  My advisor practically laughed when I asked for internship advice because none of the professors in the department had any industry connections.  The curriculum was horribly outdated and professors treated undergrads like they were too stupid to work with real data or learn material beyond standard linear regression.  I once had a semester where three classes were teaching the same material at the same time.

However my other major, math, had very helpful advisors and the classes tended to be far more rigorous and interesting.  There were far more younger professors, some of whom were incredibly knowledgable.  Despite this, few math majors were able to find internships.  I noticed that this was a recurring thing at Pitt.  Most departments had one of two attitudes:  industry is only important if it makes their numbers look better, or industry is worthless and you're a loser if you don't want to be an academic.

Overall, if you're fine with spending a ton of money on a subpar education with professors who don't care about you and an administration that views you as a number instead of a person, go to Pitt.  Otherwise, pick a cheaper school or spend the same amount of money for a better education out of state."
College Freshman,2,I hate the idea of Greek life.
College Freshman,2,The school is alright. The traffic and noise are annoying. I didn't feel that people were very friendly. College sucks when you have no friends.
College Senior,2,"I never enjoyed my stays in on-campus housing. The beds gave me back pain, I felt claustrophobic at times, and it was always noisy near me."
College Freshman,2,I don't think Greek life has a huge effect on campus.  I personally am not interested in that way of life and that's one of the reasons I chose Pitt.
College Freshman,2,"The registration process is done on an outdated web program that is confusing to use. You will frequently be unable to get into classes. Classes are large and the workload can be overwhelming since professors don't really have time to help out each student individually, and a lot of classes don't have tutoring available."
College Freshman,2,"Classes are huge, and often are taught by TAs. I think maybe two or three of the professors I've had would recognize me by name. Office hours are sometimes just for two hours once a week, so if you happen to have a class during that time, good luck. The professors try hard, but a lot of them are overburdened and some do not have phds, or the highest degree in their field."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, given the chance to redo my college decision, I would not choose Pitt again. For some people this school might be a good choice, but for me the school is just too big. Classes are enormous, and teachers aren't really able to form meaningful relationships with students. It's difficult to get into the classes you need/want, especially as a freshman, and the humanities are not taken seriously at Pitt."
College Junior,2,Hardly any companies come to our career fair. It stinks.
College Junior,2,Athletics can be fun. Teams consistently disappoint. Clubs and intramural sports are pretty popular at university of Pittsburgh.
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not big at the University of Pittsburgh, and the only reason non-Greeks care about Greek life is to get into parties, which for girls are easy to get into."
College Freshman,2,"Social scene is pretty bad, unless you belong to a great student group. People on campus (both staff and students) seem to be kind of miserable. Campus itself is BEAUTIFUL, the perfect mix of city and campus. Food is not that great, professors are average, some of the faculty is upset about school's direction. It does get better and better each year and it should be ranked higher because some programs are fantastic, but a lot of people are miserable here. The division between smart people and those that are not-so-smart is very noticeable. Definitely not a good school for LGBTQIA+ members... students are generally not good people. Feels like another year of high school; avoid this institution."
Recent Alumnus,2,"DON'T GO TO FRATS. All you will get is a hangover and tinnitus, and, if you're really unlucky, a disease). Instead, find a group of friends you share interests in common with or a campus org, make friends with them and go to THEIR parties. Trust me, there is more fun to be had around a friends circle than a fraternity, plus they tend to have decent booze since they aren't *trying* to get trashed. If the party is BYOB, just have an older friend get a handle, split the receipt, and dump half of it in a thermos. No need to rely on frat boys."
Recent Alumnus,2,This is one of the most expensive state schools in the country and they still manage to hike up our tuition!!! They built Nordy Hall for no godforsaken reason while tons of students don't get adequate mental health services and don't get the classes they need so they fall behind while the administration packs us full of more freshmen to pay off the debts they've incurred. They also have a bad rep when it comes to demonstrations and protests although they've been a bit better recently. There are so many projects to work on. Tunnels? How about tunnels so we don't freeze in the current spate of subzero winters? No we need to build yet another dorm. Rant over.
College Sophomore,2,Options are limited and most of them are not good.  The quality and value of the meal plan is horrible.
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid is the worst part of Pitt, I spent most of my first semester on the phone with the office because my loan would no go through, or something on their end was wrong. It was a complete headache. I wish the school would allow for more aid to be awarded because of the high cost of tuition. Unless you are extremely smart, getting a scholarship is almost impossible. However, if you want to receive any aid, it's best to apply as soon as possible with all the information needed. After you submit your application, call to make sure they received it."
College Freshman,2,I got 2200 on my SAT and was still not eligible for aid. That's stupid.
College Sophomore,2,Does not offer enough financial aid.
College Senior,2,"My family and I have applied for countless scholarships to provide myself with the best education and school there is. Unfortunately, financial aid did not provide my family with any support. This really puts a damper on my schooling due to the fact that my dad has been paralyzed and retired and my mom has been trying to work over three jobs to support my sister and I who will both be in college at the same time."
College Freshman,2,I've heard a lot of horror stories.
College Freshman,2,"I am a Pittsburgh student, and I almost got no scholarships. After multiple talks with the financial aid office, I finally was able to get slightly less than what I need. It was horrible to go through, and I still don't have enough. I heard more out of state students receive more coverage, and when I asked financial aid, they claimed they didn't give me more because I was in Pittsburgh and could have the Pittsburgh Promise, which is financial for Pittsburgh students who attend public school. I didn't receive it since I went to a Pennsylvania state school, and it still took convincing to receive financial aid."
College Freshman,2,"We often find ourselves hungry and not feeling anything on or near campus. Also, the food places close very early."
College Freshman,2,"South Oakland, where most of the off campus housing is, is not a good or safe place to live. The houses themselves always smell and look dirty. They're not nice at all, yet the landlords charge outrageous rents because they know that all of the 40000 college students want off campus housing. It is very close to the school and public transportation, so in that regard it is good."
College Junior,2,"let's just put this out here... Pitt is 84% white, so only 16% of the student population is a minority. Most students come from areas where the population if maybe 95% + white and think that PITT is incredibly diverse, but to me it's just the opposite. It's odd being a minority here. Some people treat it as nothing and that's great, but others treat and act as if im some sacred piece of meat.They put me on this minority shelf, even though I grew up in America speaking English and listening to the backstreet boys and watching Lizzie McGuire like any other kid. But, I may just be naive to how people haven't experienced diversity as much as other may have."
College Freshman,2,i did not get the amount of financial aid i needed and deserved
College Freshman,2,The scholarship process it a bit too selective and will not give merit scholarships that easily
College Senior,2,"Landlords around Oakland suck, and housing conditions are subpar. BUT everyone is stuck in the same shitty off-campus housing! It's just a part of going to Pitt, unless you live in LAGA or the Lofts, you'll be in the same boat as everyone else, paying $550/month for a dump. But that's Oakland, and we love it"
College Sophomore,2,"The best & expensive places are often chains and nothing over the moon.  Lots of mediocrity, and lots of the same types of restaurants.  If you want diversity in food, do not look to Pittsburgh"
College Sophomore,2,Land management companies do a really good job of screwing college students over.
Graduate Student,1,"While a necessary evil, online learning provided me with zero takeaways from the Spring Semester of 2020.  The lack of a structured lifestyle combined with a host of technical difficulties proved fatal for my learning."
Junior,1,Not much to say considering that my professors decided to not teach online after the pandemic. They simply told us that we must learn the content on our own and that they'd upload their presentations online for us to view and study.
Alum,1,"This is not applicable,  I did not partake in any online learning during my time at the University of Pittsburgh."
College Freshman,1,"I've never wanted to leave a place as bad as I do now.  Classes are fine, too large mostly and the system of Pitt itself seems focused on forcing students into noncreative ""tracks"" with limited opportunity to explore any other options or interests."
College Freshman,1,"Another key component to fulfilling the ""successful"" Pitt student image."
College Freshman,1,"Pitt is the absolute worst place on earth unless you're straight, white and conservative."
College Freshman,1,The students accepted to this school that live in on-campus housing are rowdy and unintelligent.
College Freshman,1,All anyone cares about is sports.
College Freshman,1,"Pitt is the absolute worst place on earth. To begin, there is almost no diversity in every regard. Racially, the school is mostly white people from the hick suburbs of Pittsburgh or the weird small towns of Pennsylvania who think the city if Pittsburgh is large and booming. Much of the student population, especially greek life members, are very unwelcoming to students of color and view them as ""other people"" from themselves. There is also very little diversity in academics, as Pitt's primary focus academically is medicine and related science. The only reason Pitt is a nationally ranked school is it's science programs. Pitt pays very little attention to liberal arts and if you want to study anything that can fall into the category of art you will receive the lowest standard of education possible at this school. This on top of the horrible, poor atmosphere of Oakland and the boringness of Pittsburgh itself make Pitt arguably one of the worst places on this earth."
College Freshman,1,"DO NOT COME HERE FOR GREEK LIFE. Yes there are greeks but a) they are seen as total douches, b) most, if not all, greek housing is off campus and c) you can find plenty of better parties elsewhere. Not worth the time, commitment, or hazing"
College Freshman,1,"People party starting on thursday, usually at the frats or sports parties. The only enjoyable parties I've been to have been for student organizations, the others are pretty boring, with sleazy frat guys and bad music."
College Freshman,1,"It's great if you want to drink in a grimy frat basement. If you're underage and don't have a fake, there's not a lot of events on campus besides the typical overcrowded parties that usually get busted."
College Freshman,1,"Pitt is not a diverse school. People may think that it is because they come from even less diverse places, generally suburbs in Pennsylvania, so to them any city area seems ""diverse"". The vast majority of students are white, middle class people from Jersey, Long Island, or ""Outside Philly"". We have a significant amount of international students, but they're essentially all from China, so not much diversity there."
College Junior,1,Not many parties. When there are parties they are easily busted and extremely crowded
College Sophomore,1,International students do not qualify for any kind of aids or scholarship
College Freshman,1,"It's honestly pretty disgusting. There are very few options and no variety in the dining hall, Market Central. The thought of going to Market actually makes me feel sick sometimes. Also, everything closes really early."
College Sophomore,1,"Oakland has all of 5 bars and they're pretty heavily segregated PITT/CMU.  Students sometimes interact, but typically don't.  There's a few neighborhoods in the area that are accessible by bus.  Those have significant student populations where students mix better, but volume and excessive drinking are a problem."
College Junior,1,"The amount of money that tuition is, there should be more access to scholarships for students or more access to financial aid because I think it's not as fair for the school to tell you whether or not you need financial help when in reality everyone does."
College Senior,1,"Pitt is an overwhelmingly white, middle-class, brown-haired, jeans-wearing, Columbia-sporting, hockey-watching, STEM-studying school. This rating conflicts with most of the ratings on this page, so let me account for that. Most students at Pitt are from suburbs of Philadelphia or small towns in middle Pennsylvania or small towns in the outskirts of Pittsburgh or small towns in eastern Ohio. They generally come from these middle-American backgrounds where 98% of the population is white. At Pitt, 80% of the population is white people like them. But from their perspective that's a 1000% increase in the amount of non-white peers they are exposed to in their daily lives. So that, I think, is where all this ""wow Pitt is so diverse"" nonsense comes from. If you come from a background of even moderate diversity, Pitt students get very samey and predictable very fast."
College Senior,1,"Most people at Pitt LOVE each other! Maybe that's because we all have the same interests in common: hockey, engineering, weight lifting, and (above all) BEER! We are all generically attractive, well-built white people of German and/or English heritage who like to drink a lot and shout at the top of our lungs three nights a week. If this description fits you too, come on in! The water's fine."
College Freshman,1,My family is not wealthy by any means and I received no aid.
College Freshman,1,I hate Pittsburgh winters. It's slushy and gross and sometimes harshly cold.
College Sophomore,1,There have been many many drug busts and sexual assaults. Police officers walk in to look at students partying inside the frat houses but will not break the party up half the time. There is no support for students who are assaulted by fraternity brothers or at their parties.
College Sophomore,1,you do not want to have to drive to class each day
College Freshman,1,"The cost for a parking pass is outrageous so I did not purchase one.  The cost to park on the streets or in a parking garage is also very expensive.  The streets of Pittsburgh are very busy, so it can be very difficult to find spots close to where you are going."
College Junior,1,"I think my actual problem was through my parents and tax forms, not necessarily for the school. I would give anyone the advice to make sure you get to know the people from the financial aid office
"
College Junior,1,"Don't bring a car if you don't have to. There is a decent amount of on street parking, but it gets taken pretty quickly. Parking garages are another choice, but they can get kinda pricey and can be a little out of the way. Overall, parking is either difficult to find or expensive. "
College Junior,1,"Campus dining is terrible here. I am from New York, and nothing in pittsburgh competes. It would be very nice if they would open up some healthier food places around campus."
College Junior,1,I don't find the financial aid staff that helpful. It has been far too difficult for me to get help regarding scholarships or financial aid. 
College Sophomore,1,Parking is a nightmare. There is no way to find a parking spot. ever.
College Student,1,"Parking on campus is very difficult and can be a nightmare, especially when moving in and out. There is no need for a student to have a car on campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,"It sucks for most of the time because of the amount of rainy days. It rains more than the sun shines, especially in the winter. Classes never get cancelled unless the city mandates it which makes it really hard to get to class"
College Senior,1,I would give the weather in Johnstown an F except that every once in a while the sky is gorgeous and the breezes are gentle. The rest of the time the weather is SNOW and COLD and SNOW and COLD... Then again my friends and I experienced a hurricane party and a blizzard party in a 12 hour span. How many other students can claim that?!
College Senior,1,"There are never any spots, the prices are outrageous, and I know quite a few people who have been ticketed for no reason. I have a car, but I never take it to campus. It's just to get me home and back."
College Sophomore,1,Frats and sororities tend to be looked down upon by most. We are a city campus up north.... what do you expect.
College Senior,1,"The off campus apartments around campus (South Oakland, North Oakland) are very old, and on average in pretty poor condition.  Most students start looking for apartments on craigslist and on signs around these areas just after Christmas break.  Good (relative term) apartments go very fast, and if you wait too long, you will be stuck in an awful apartment.  Landlords are slums and will try to charge you for every single thing wrong with the building even if it was there before you moved in.  Apartments are also expensive (400-500 a month plus utilities) if you have a few roommates, singles are even more expensive.  However, most students have no choice but to move off campus since housing is only guaranteed at Pitt for 3 years."
College Junior,1,"There really isn't a need to have your car on campus since there are shuttles and you can take a ride on any city bus for free. If you do decide to bring your car out, a permit is going to cost around $25 and it can be either easy or difficult to find an off campus parking spot depending on the day and time of day. However, it is near impossible to find a convenient parking spot on campus unless it is very early or very late. $0.25 will get you about 8 minutes of parking at a meter and they are enforced heavily."
College Sophomore,1,"Costs are reasonable for permits, but finding a spot during the school year is next to impossible. They over-permit the area and there are a ton of random regulations the parking authority seems to pull out of thin air. Make sure you brush up on your parking law knowledge!"
College Freshman,1,"It is really difficult to get financial aid.  I have a 4.5 GPA and 1250 SAT (math and reading), as well as tons of extracurricular activities and did not qualify for any aid from the University."
College Senior,1,"The parking in Oakland is bad, during business hours. After 6PM the parking meters end, you may park for evening classes easier than in the day. The meter maids go home after 5:40PM."
College Senior,1,"The weather doesn't follow usual patterns. Some days its a nice sunny day in the 70's and the next it could be snowing and freezing outside. Most of the days the weather is very gloomy and damp, but there are some days when it's just absolutely beautiful outside and it almost makes all the other gloomy days worth it. Almost"
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is extremely limited and unpredictable. Garage passes have ridiculously long waiting lists and meter parking is hit-or-miss. The city did, finally, change the meters to accept credit cards now, which is great if you don't have any change. It is however, as a commuter, better to ride the bus into Oakland if possible. I commute from Cranberry (40 min drive) so I have to allow an extra half hour to hunt for parking and walk to class from across campus in order to be on-time."
College Junior,1,"Weather in Pittsburgh alternates between terrible and great, and the great is limited mainly to summer."
College Senior,1,"Parking is a nightmare. Garages/lots are exorbitantly expensive. Street permits are reasonably priced ($25 for each calendar year), but it is near impossible to find a spot (especially in the winter months).  Pittsburgh Parking Authority also gives tickets for random reasons, so expect to get several parking tickets if you park on the street (even if you are parked legally, they'll make up a reason to ticket you)."
College Junior,1,Leave your car at home. You really won't need it here and parking is lacking and expensive. Students can ride all public transit for free.
College Student,1,I live on campus and did not bring my car because it is very hard to find a parking spot in the area and permits are expensive
College Junior,1,"With the proximity to other colleges and universities and all of the hospitals and museums in Oakland, parking is very scarce. Having a car on campus may be more trouble than it is worth, walking is recommended."
College Sophomore,1,parking on campus was one of the worst experiences i have ever had. on street parking is practically impossible to find during the day. the university does offer parking passes but those are expensive. there are parking garages but again you need a pass for most which is generally going to be expensive. so if you want to park at the university of Pittsburgh prepare to spend money and take a lot of time looking for a spot.
College Senior,1,"A Hassle – My parents and I sent in all the forms and they kept sending them back asking for separate pieces of information until they had probably 7 copies of all the forms necessary. Only then did they decide that it was ""complete"". By then there were no funds left and I received no money from the school in my senior year after my mother and brother also started college, despite my being a deans list student. Now I am scrambling to find loans."
College Freshman,1,"I received no financial aid through the university. It's very populated, and has so many different people from different parts of the world that it's hard for everyone to receive money. I suggest applying for scholarships and for the FAFSA so that it's possible to have other opportunities to receive financial aid."
College Freshman,1,"It's not uncommon to have to drive around the same block 3 or 4 times in a row, waiting for a space to open up. Most available parking is metered parking or garages. And most of the residential streets off-campus have permit-only parking."
College Freshman,1,"NO NEED! There is absolutely NO NEED to join a frat or sorority!
Most people aren't so don't feel like you have to!"
College Sophomore,1,"Not A Party School – If you are underage, regardless if you have a fake or not.. theres really a limited amount of things to do. Your first week of freshman year is the most fun you'll have. You'll think the parties are great because you went to a few frats, which later you'll find out are actually mad lame. There will be a few house parties in South O, but good luck getting any beer, the keg's kicked. As the year goes on and it gets colder, there will be less and less to do on the weekends. You'll spend more nights trying to hear of something to do than actually doing it. If you don't drink much and didn't party in high school, chances are you'll think its amazing. But if you are looking to party 3 nights a week, don't waste your application money. Apply somewhere else. The party scene is so bad I'm actually sending out transfer applications."
College Freshman,1,No Need for a Car – There are few places to park and if you find a spot most likely it will be expensive. You don't need a car though because the city buses will take you anywhere you want to go if you have your student ID with you.
College Senior,1,"Transfer Students Get Jobbed. Really, I could not obtain any type of academics based relief despite transferring in with a 3.8 and maintaining a 3.6 once I arrived? Kids who I have well outperformed since becoming a collegian are able to keep grants with a 3.0, but I cannot gain one as an Honor Student? As expensive as it is to attend this college - even for an in-state student such as myself (our tuition has spiked 2k in two years and students at many other state Universities throughout the U.S. pay half of what I do for a similar in-state education)I cannot get academic-based relief? I am in the poorest percentage of kids her and will walk out of here owing over $6k for each semester spent here."
College Senior,1,"Unfortunate Amount of Segregation – White students mainly hang out with white students, black students with black students, Asian with Asian, gay with gay, etc.  There are a few clubs with nice mixtures, but for the most part you see large groups of similar looking/acting people together.  I know that Pitt has black and Asian students, but I have seen very few in my classes--perhaps classes are voluntarily segregated too?  Economic background doesn't seem like much of a factor--most students come from the middle class.  On the plus side, I have never actually seen someone harassed for his/her race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious, or political beliefs."
Recent Alumnus,1,Don't Bother With a Car – Parking at Pitt is pretty awful. The lots accessible to students are far away from campus. Parking permits are also very expensive. You definitely don't need a car at Pitt. Taking the Bus is free and everything you'd need is accessible from the dorms.
College Sophomore,1,"parking passes are $367 per semester and you can only use certain garages at certain times.  A lot of the time, these garages are pretty far away on the outskirts of campus.  Its inconvenient, but if you are commuting from far away, it is worth it."
College Freshman,1,"Dont Even Bother – There is almost no reason to have a car at the University of Pittsburgh. Students get free public transportation and the campus is compact enough for walking anyway. If you do have a car you'll pay huge costs of permits and even if you buy a permit you're not guaranteed a spot. Basically, there's no need for a car and if you have one it will be more of a bother than a help."
College Freshman,1,"I don't know if everyone has this problem, but there are so many gimmicks just to apply for scholarships and so much paper work and individual information that needs to be filled out that there is no way real people actually get financial help (I swear the students that win scholarships in the newsletters i receive are all imaginary people). I have made accounts with so many scholarship sites, filled out my FAFSA, filled out survey after survey, written essays, sent in resumes and for absolutely nothing in return. The entire process is frustrating and tedious and usually gets me no where. In summary, my school is no different than when i search for scholarships myself, it just adds to the headache of the whole process."

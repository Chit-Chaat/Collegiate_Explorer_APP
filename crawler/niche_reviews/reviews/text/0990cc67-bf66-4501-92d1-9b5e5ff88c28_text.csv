Alum,5,"The classes I took online were adequate. However, I found Calculus very difficult to take both online and in person. This class was only taken online due to COVID-19, so I'm sure I would have fared better overall had the class been taken in person."
Freshman,5,"I love Converse. It's a very diverse and inclusive school, and though it offers plenty of sports and extracurricular activities, education remains its focus."
Sophomore,5,I love Converse College because the traditions feel so intimate with the college and student. Another amazing part about Converse is the honor code. I know a lot of schools have one but the students here take it seriously and this makes me feel safe around campus because I know we are all going to respect each other and their belongings.
Sophomore,5,My professors were very supportive during this change and it made it easier for the difficult experience.
Junior,5,"I love the smaller more personal college life. Gives you the opportunity to not feel list. I think we should have sororities one campus and more campus life activities, even in conjunction with other colleges in the area."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the campus. The professors are all genuinely nice people and do their best to help you succeed.
Freshman,5,Converse is a beautiful small campus. It has a very vintage look. They are discussing becoming Co-ed which personally I hope they don't. The teachers are nice and the dorms are cozy. The food and dinning hall are just wonderful. The classes are small and so its easy to get to know your professors. They help you every step of the way. Financial aid department will help you if there seems to be any issues. The athletic department is small but very good. My favorite is the art classes.
Niche User,5,"All about the students and student experience and education. While visiting I enjoyed the campus and the number of activities held. Even though it is a smaller school compared to large schools, the campus was very spacious and did not feel like a small school any the less."
Sophomore,5,"The personal atmosphere, the
Director of Education is always available to students. The courses are available in the morning, evening, and online. The class sizes are not overcrowded."

The teachers are willing to help and provide for you by offering resources for internships, jobs, gallery openings, and many more things. The campus and surrounding facilities are well-kept and their employees are always willing to help. The campus safety and honor systems make Converse a safe place for all. For example, I can leave my MacBook anywhere and know that it will still be there. 
The application process is also very easy due to the advisors and admissions counselors who are quick to respond to questions. In fact, I was accepted here the day I applied. 
Lastly, Converse hosts many events for the local community and students to enjoy. Theatre performances, festivals, sports events, and more are always going on around Converse. 
Do not worry about coming to Converse College. No matter who you are, Converse will make room and time for you to grow."
Freshman,5,I love the diversity and the acceptance of Converse. The students and faculty are so kind and patient with you.
Freshman,5,"The people are extremely nice. The atmosphere is very welcoming. The only thing I would change is to update some of the dorms, maybe make them more modern."
Freshman,5,I enjoy converse and my first year there was absolutely wonderful. the professors are great and the food is okay most of the time.
Sophomore,5,"I transfred in my spring semseter of Freshmen year and has been the greates experince of my life so far. I have met some of my closests friends here so far. The proffesors are willing to listen to anything that you have to say, and are willing to help if you ask. Now also there will be negatives with any school that you chose. There will be people that will get on your nerves and people that will have differnent views on ceartin things but people will need to learn how to deal with these things in life. Converese has been very a very opening up for me broanding  my views on many things."
Freshman,5,My experience at Converse has been extraordinary. Converse is an all womens  school and the women there have taught me how to be a strong women. I have made wonderful bonds with many of them and I have fallen in love with the campus. The teachers are very friendly and will always be there to help.
Freshman,5,"I really like Converse college the people that work there are very nice and if you need something fixed, or found the workers and students help out. They have an honeor code that everyone goes by for the most part."
Freshman,5,converse is a wonderful school with wonderful staff members. They have a huge variety when it comes to academics. The campus itself is breath taking. It is beautiful at all times of the year.
Alum,5,Converse was an overall excellent experience. The professors truly invest in their students. The small class size allows you to form strong bonds with your sisters as well as your professors.
Sophomore,5,"Converse college is a small, welcoming community. It is one of those schools that is small enough for all of the students to know each other's names, and for professors to remember past students. Classes are small which gives students the chance to speak with their professors and connect with them."
Alum,5,"Converse was a great school. The professors were always there to help. The students were friendly, most of the time and everyone was in it for the win. If someone was slacking off classmates would be there to help that person get back on track. There was always something going on at Converse. The only thing I would change would be to connect more with other colleges around the area."
Freshman,5,"Very nice women's college in Spartanburg, SC with helpful advisers and many traditions that make going here a fun experience."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year at Converse College, I am an athlete for the softball team. The academics here are challenging but i like a good challenge. The only thing i can complain about is the food isn't the best here I would for there to be a better selection. Other than that my first year experience has been great so far."
Freshman,5,"Small campus, friendly staff, and a great student-faculty ratio! I really have enjoyed my time here so far and I am very pleased with the education I've been receiving so far. It is the only college in my state to offer my major, and is very close to my home. All students are taken care of efficiently at this exceptional women's college."
Freshman,5,"Converse College has a very good grasp on building a respectful and dependable community, possibly one of the important factors that is keeping my head above water in my first year of college. Something minuscule I would change would just be the quality and selection of food."
Sophomore,5,Love this college so much!!! Sisterhood and acceptance by everyone. Admissions team is amazing. Everyone coming from here seems to love it. Plenty of involvement and they really help you get into the college life.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman, and i am a member of the softball team, and i absolutely love it. My coaches are great they are by far the best coaches i have ever had. And as far the school goes, all of my professors are great they provide tutoring and help out in any way they possibly can.  And at our school we go by something called the ""Honor Code"" that is where we have to pledge our initials when we turn in tests or assignments saying we did not cheat or copy. As a student it makes you feel like you are really trusted, which is a great feeling becoming an adult. As a athlete we are required to go to study hall each week. Freshman are required 8 hours a week and its very helpful. So my short experience at Converse College has been amazing and i am more then sure that i chose the right school to attend and perfect team to be a part of. I love being a Valkyrie. GO VALKS!!!!"
College Freshman,5,Most people around the Spartanburg community knows all about the quality of a Converse education.
College Freshman,5,the campus safety staff keep us very safe on campus
College Freshman,5,Professors and other faculty are amazing to be around and work with
College Freshman,5,"I feel very safe on campus and can walk alone at night if I need to,"
College Freshman,5,"I don't really use these centers, but I am told that they are exceptional."
College Freshman,5,I love the class sizes a lot. I also really enjoy the variety of courses offered to the students.
College Freshman,5,I'm very antisocial and I don't talk to the people on my hall often.
College Freshman,5,It's an all women's college so there are no sororities or fraternities except for our fake fraternity.
College Freshman,5,"I am not a sports person, so I can't really judge our sports programs effectively."
College Freshman,5,Converse College is the best decision I have made in my life.
College Freshman,5,I feel perfectly safe here on campus and the campus safety officers and officials are very friendly. We take sexual assault and drinking very serious that we have programs and events that help prevent and educate us about the safety of drinking and being a victim of sexual assault. We have counselors on campus that we can talk to about certain problems or issues such as these.
College Freshman,5,I enjoy taking classes here and the professors are excellent. The classes are small which helps me because if I have a question about something then I can go to the professor for help without having to wait. Most of the time the professor responses back as soon as they get it. When I sit in class the lessons are easily instructed and I'm able to understand what to do and learn something new. Since we have a small class I get along with everyone and the professor knows us by name and is able to help anyone who is having trouble.
College Freshman,5,"I've always enjoyed going to Converse College because its a small, comfortable, all girls, private school. Converse has an amazing theater program that puts on traditional performances every year and we also have other events such as gallery exhibitions, club events, and other programs."
College Freshman,5,Campus security is constantly patrolling campus for unusual activity. The campus also has a wellness center that is very helpful at times.
College Freshman,5,I live in the newly renovated building on campus and it is extremely nice.
College Sophomore,5,Just opened a new athletic facility Fall 2014-it is state of the art
College Sophomore,5,Campus is close to many local as well as chain restaurants
College Freshman,5,There are tons of apartments around Converse College. They all have a great price.
College Freshman,5,The food options off campus is great. Their are a lot of options to choice from.
College Freshman,5,They are very careful about their rules. They always make sure no one is breaking them and if they are then they are punished for their actions.
College Freshman,5,Getting my scholarships was very easy abs they helped me get into a program so I could pay what I had left in monthly payments.
College Freshman,5,I like how they included everyone at the party's and how people from other colleges are welcome to come and have fun.
College Freshman,5,The food at Converse is very good. I really like that Converse has an innovation station where you can have your food prepared right in front of you.
College Freshman,5,"The campus at Converse College is very clean, nice, and welcoming. Every time I get up for my classes at Converse I always look forward to going to school and having a higher education."
College Junior,5,The campus security is very willing and capable to help and protect students.
College Sophomore,5,You can basically study anywhere on campus and just about everyone will respect your privacy or try to keep the volume at a minimum.
College Sophomore,5,It is amazing at Converse College because not do the professors truly care about your academic grades but they also care about your well-being. The faculty on campus are really nice and will try to answer any questions that you have or go find someone who could help. The classes are comfortably small and usually never go over 25 students per professor. Courses are extremely divers; they can go anywhere from learning about finite math to astronomy to photography.
College Sophomore,5,"Converse has had many LGBT campaigns, sexual/physical abuse awareness week, and few political debates could be attended. Students could care less about these topics, all we care about is the person inside. No one is criticized for being different but celebrated that they can be who they want in an environment they are welcomed. Straight, Gay, Black, White, Athletic, Non-Athletic, Short, or Tall everyone makes friends and treats everyone as those the lights are off; because everybody is the same in the dark."
College Sophomore,5,"This is a drug-free, alcohol-free campus, that means for cigarettes are smoked on campus you will be fined. You will not see drug for the most part, I  have not at all."
College Sophomore,5,"The school are more than willing to work with you to cover your cost in education. Talk to professors, and the people i CSCD is you have major problems, they can give advice. There is even a summer program for student endanger of losing there scholarship, or in need of more credits."
College Sophomore,5,"Spartanburg has a high crime rate, but if you do not research it, you would not know it. Campus Safety is taken seriously, and I have in heard of and incident happening to the student's recently. The campus is located in the best part of Spartanburg, where crime rate is low."
College Sophomore,5,The Psychology department is amazing. The professors are extremely helpful and they offer internships as well as help in finding job opportunities for each student.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are great. The registration process is simple with the assistance of the registrars office. The workload is bearable and the study options are great.
Sophomore,4,"I like that the campus was small, so it allowed for smaller classes, which made me feel comfortable."
Freshman,4,"Transitioning to online classes was difficult for me, but this was in no part the fault of the teachers. My teachers bent over backwards to ensure that each student was still able to receive the materials and tuition they needed to complete their courses."
Junior,4,I absolutely love the environment that you are surrounded by at Converse College. To be engulfed in a power group of women that all share the same goal of becoming successful and independent women who will take on a world were they are sometimes unappreciated. At Converse I have learned that I am in control of my future and what I put in is what I will get back. Converse has taught me that I can thrive in any and all situations when I put the vaules that a liberal arts all womens college has taught me.
Graduate Student,4,I loved the connection between the students and faculty! I feel like you were able to connect to your professors very well due to the small class sizes.
Freshman,4,"I really love it here, but like every school it has it's flaws. There is a problem with how secretive the administration is with campus problems, particularly involving racists remarks and actions. They are working on diversity on campus, but forget that African American isn't the only culture present on campus."
Junior,4,"The faculty is easily the most amazing thing about Converse College. It's not a big school, so class sizes usually don't exceed 30. This makes it so much easier to connect with professors, oftentimes creating bonds and mentorships. Not only are professors understanding and helpful, but they're also wonderful role models, and have done so much to build me up to be the best that I can possibly be."
Junior,4,"I love Converse. I am about to start my junior year and I would never consider leaving. Converse is a small women's college, you can tell. I love the female environment, it is both empowering and inspiring. The classes are small and the professors really care about you as a person. I love the traditions (there are a lot) and the events (also a lot.) I am never bored on campus. The dorms are relatively nice (except for a few of the older ones but I have tended to live in the nicer ones. There are more nice than not.) and I love the dining hall. This school isn't for everyone and that's okay, because it is the school for me."
Freshman,4,"Converse College is a really small, but great school in terms of education. I came here on athletic scholarships that enabled me to obtain a college education. The professors I've had are all wonderful, extremely helpful, and are always focused on a student-professor relationship. Since the class sizes are tiny, it is very easy to build a connection with them."
Freshman,4,"converse is a lovely community and i am so happy I came here, you forget that its all womens college, and honestly the only thing i can complain about is the wifi"
Sophomore,4,"I have yet to run into a bad professor, they all care about their students and most have impressive PhDs and are fun to listen to. The school's staff offers very good support and are willing to work with anyone who needs help. Some dorms need serious renovations, while others are in very good shape or practically brand new. As expected from a very small college, campus is pretty dry, but it's not impossible to find some frat parties going on at coed schools in the area every other weekend or so. Spartanburg isn't very exciting, but Greenville has a decent nightlife with plenty of bars and clubs, all about a half hour away."
Junior,4,A beautiful campus with dedicated academic staff and amazing culture. Could see improvement in student government and student life staff.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the Converse College experience. I am a transfer commuter student and have been able to plug into the school very well. Professors are great!
Sophomore,4,I like how the professors care about or education and want us to succeed. They have office hours but for the most part they are available upon request if needed outside of those hours. The colllege is hard but I know that is making me a better person and teaching me how to work hard. One thing I would changed would be the little prices of things liek lab fees and convocations.
College Freshman,4,"Professors will email you in a timely manner. Their office hours are great, if you can't meet during those times then just come by their office at any time or schedule a meeting, most professors live in their office."
College Freshman,4,"Call boxes are located throughout campus in case of an emergency. Campus safety drives around campus to make sure that everything is okay, they also have a phone number which makes them convenient."
College Freshman,4,The only Greek life that we have is honor society. We also have a Big Sis/Lil Sis program where the junior class adopts freshman.
College Freshman,4,Every Friday we wear purple to show our school spirit.
College Freshman,4,At Converse College not only will you receive a quality education at an affordable price. Professors want to make sure that you succeed and they are normally willing to meet with you at any time.
College Freshman,4,There are so many options to get into and different things to get into with your choices
College Freshman,4,Could be cleaner in some dorms but for the most part it is great
College Freshman,4,Athletes tend to stay in clicks
College Freshman,4,Although every school may have its problems Converse has very little
College Sophomore,4,The alumni network is extensive. They are always looking for students who have the same interests. Most students will complete a job/internship while in college that supports their futures. The services are always willing to help students find their right major and post-graduate job.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are unique and enjoy teaching their classes. They all have open door policies and care about the success of their students inside or outside of the classroom. They also work well with athletes when classes need to be missed with prior notice.
College Sophomore,4,Housing is nice on campus because everything is close to the dorms and there is parking for all the buildings. Most room have something unique about them which makes each student's experience different. Social atmosphere on  hallway depends on who else is living on the hall.
College Sophomore,4,The classes are small which gives students to have a relationship with professors. The classes are challenging but they really do prepare students for the future in whatever occupation they choose to follow. There are many campus activities that promote student leadership and involvement.
College Freshman,4,Each student has a student I.D. that we use to swipe for meals and get into dorms. Each I.D. card has a unique four digit pin to protect from anyone picking up a card and swiping into a hall. Each dorm requires non- Converse students to sign in and only two per student. There are several security stations out in the parking lots. Campus safety is constantly checking parking lots and driving around campus at night.
College Freshman,4,"I love the environment of the college. It's a tight- knit community with a small unique campus. The professors are very dedicated to learning and making sure you are on the right track for your career. If you are in the school of the arts things might be different. Converse College is a liberal arts college but the arts programs run on a different track, especially for music students. The School of Music is technically a a conservatory underneath a liberal arts college. So the classes are all music classes with general classes that the liberal arts side of the college requires. Remember that."
College Freshman,4,I was nervous at first but it didn't take me long to realize that college is amazing. You get to meet some of the best people in the world and learn from extremely smart and empowering professors. Its an experience that I will never forget.
College Freshman,4,Everyone here on campus is very respectful of each other;s heritages and backgrounds. We don't have many problems here because we are a pretty diverse community.
College Freshman,4,"Our career prospects and the value of a degree here at Converse is very important and the faculty here do everything in their power to make sure you find the right internships or jobs before and after you graduate. You tell them what field you're going into i.e. fine arts, mathematics, english, etc. and a resume and then they search the right internship or job that's right for you."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy living on campus because it helps me get to my classes on time, I can make new friends, and be able to go to events and club meetings."
College Freshman,4,Since we are an all girls school are athletics program are limited to what sport we can play against other schools however we have great teams and coaches working together to make the best of it. They practice early in the morning rain or shine snow or sleet and never give up when it comes to competing.
College Freshman,4,"I love the school, the professors are always helpful and there are a good number of activities to do outside of academics."
College Freshman,4,The student development center was put in place to help students find jobs and internships. They are also helping in creating and reviewing resumes and applications.
College Freshman,4,"I feel that being at this school has many benefits, including the office hours of professors and the many student development centers available. The staff is always friendly and ready to help."
College Freshman,4,"My favorite experience that I've had so far is talking to one of my professors. I never ever thought that I could just go to them just to talk; I thought they didn't care about their students. In all reality they do care about their students and never wants to see someone fail. I soon remembered that they're people too, and have been through what I'm currently going through My school is unique because it's an all women's college that inspires young women! They constantly remind us to strive to be the best and just because your a woman doesn't mean that you cannot do things other people do. If I could do it all over I would pick Converse College. Even though I think it's tough and challenging, it pushes me to work harder. After my first semester I struggled with my grades and was ashamed to take extra help. Now that I've talked with my professors and gone to tutoring, I saw a significant change. My grades went from F to C's in the short time span I had to get them up, and my GPA went up and now I'm eligible to play softball for the season!"
College Freshman,4,It feels like home and I've made amazing friends!
College Sophomore,4,Have an academic and athletic scholarship-and am able to work on campus
College Sophomore,4,Feel very safe here- campus security is very accommodating
College Sophomore,4,"Sub Connection and Valkyrie Station have really good food, salads etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Small campus community, everybody knows everybody"
College Freshman,4,"I believe that my college is strict, but I believe that the rules and regulations are put in place for a reason which is to keep every student safe."
College Freshman,4,The finacial aid process was smooth and the staff was very helpful with the process.
College Junior,4,I decided to attend Converse based on the fact that they offered a swim team. It's a well distinquished program and I like my coaches a lot. I have improved tremendously since my freshman year.
College Junior,4,I love going to my favorite local restraunts. Sometimes I resort to off-campus eating over on-campus eating.
College Junior,4,We have a very good honor code system in place. Our honor code is distinguished within the nation.
College Junior,4,"The selection of housing based on academic/grade status is fair. Overrall, each of the dorms and apartments are nice and I enjoy living on campus."
College Freshman,4,"I love the environment on campus, and everyone gets along fairly well. The campus housing has its ups and downs (ups like Pell and Heath, downs like Williams)."
College Sophomore,4,"Trains all freaking night and gun shots are common sounds, but being near Greenville in always beautiful."
College Freshman,4,"Campus Safety is always willing to pick you up from anywhere on or near campus if you don't feel safe walking on your own, and there are call boxes all over campus, and help with everything from accidentally hitting a squirrel to needing someone to kill a spider to letting you into your room when you leave your keys and your roommate locks the door."
College Sophomore,4,Campus safety has gotten SIGNIFICANTLY better in the last few years. They'll help you with anything from driving you across campus in the middle of the night to killing a particularly terrifying and aggressive spider of doom.
College Freshman,4,"Spartanburg has a great little scene, especially with seven colleges in the town. There are clubs, malls, and restaurants near the campus, and as long as you are looking, there is always something to do, even at the strangest times: Cookout and Waffle House are always great options."
College Freshman,4,"My favorite part about Converse is the faculty. The professors are excellent, reliable, and caring. They give each student individual attention, are excited about what they're teaching, and have good credentials. Class sizes are small which is also wonderful and creates a positive learning environment and opens people up to discussion."
College Freshman,4,"The people working at financial aid are very kind and accommodating. It took me a little while to get all of my financial aid in order, but that had more to do with the FAFSA than the school itself."
College Freshman,4,"Safety and security is important to Converse. The officers are always patrolling, day and night. There are also callboxes located in several places in case a student needs help or would just feel safer being escorted to their dorm via the campus safety car instead of walking. And because of it being a women's college, sexual assault occurs less often, but if it does, it's taken very seriously."
College Junior,4,"Everything about the academics is great. A few teachers are difficult, but for the most part, they are very clear about their expectations. The workload is manageable."
College Junior,4,Converse College is one of a few colleges that offer an undergraduate in my major which is Art Therapy. I believe that all of the seniors in my major have been able to secure internships. The curriculum is very engaging and enjoyable.
College Junior,4,The campus is very safe and secure. The faulty are considered about their students as individuals. The library is convenient and mostly helpful. We have a lot of traditions on campus which is pretty unique and interesting. There are plenty of places for students to hang out on campus. Even day students have a lounge where they can hang out and eat. There are always plenty of things to do on campus.
College Junior,4,"I do not eat off campus at the present. However, I know that there are many local and chain restaurants close by."
Sophomore,2,"I loved that it is a small school and very personal with the students, but it is not a diverse school."
College Freshman,2,Sometimes I felt that the tuition money was not necessarily money well spent.
College Freshman,2,There were a lot of bugs.  The elevator often didn't work.  The dormitories were old.
College Freshman,2,I found the professors to at times be unavailable.  I worked hard but sometimes didn't feel that my work really paid.  I had a very difficulty first semester with very little emotional support except from family
College Freshman,2,"The air does not work properly, and we have trouble with the hot water most of the time. We have bug problems, and the buildings are very old. Some of the buildings do not look safe, and sometimes we do not feel safe."
College Freshman,2,"As a freshman, I haven't had a lot of experience in career aspects yet."
College Sophomore,2,"Athletes are kind of absolute jerks, which is hilarious considering how little the student body as a whole cares about sports."
College Freshman,2,"I'm new to this school and area, so I don't know what it's like to get a place outside of Converse. But, I have noticed that most students, even juniors and seniors, tend to stay on campus. Aside from married or commuting students, most remain in the dorms. Maybe Converse just doesn't allow students to live elsewhere."
College Freshman,2,"Not many parties occur on campus, this being because it's an alcohol-free campus. A lot of students go to other school's, such as Upstate or Wofford for their party needs."
College Sophomore,2,Most off-campus living can cost just about the same as on-campus living plus the driving or early morning walks to campus. Converse College would rather have you live on campus so they can provide protection and be able to track your academics easier. Around the campus it can get pretty sketchy but on campus there is 24/7 security.
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, I don't really pay attention to athletics and I am not in the minority."
College Freshman,2,"As an average student the dining plan might not be too bad. However, I have a gluten and dairy allergy and the options are very limited. Especially if you want something tasteful. Also, we have flex dollars to spend at our on campus deli, but they don't have any gluten-free options either. Unless you want a salad."
College Sophomore,2,The wifi on campus is horrible! It is slow and unreliable. The year before I started you were allowed to bring your own internet hook up but now the entire campus is wifi. This spring semester (2013) the wifi was down for probably almost a week and it was the week before finals!
Recent Alumnus,2,There isn't that much to do especially if you dont have a car.
College Freshman,2,The weather in South Carolina is truely unpredictable. It is annoying but it is something you get used to once you have lived in South Carolina for so long. I expected the weather to be different from Charleston to Spartanburg but there isn't really much of a change expect it is alittle bit cooler and the chance of getting snow is higher which I like.
College Senior,2,"If your 21 there are plenty of bars to go to. There are also many local schools. Other than that, there isn't really interesting."
College Sophomore,2,Fan Support – A lot of students don't typically go to the sporting events or games on campus. We need more student involvement in this aspect.
College Sophomore,2,"I have had ups and downs. My freshman year was a letdown because Converse told me, as they did others, they had a major they did not have. I would not choose the school over again because the weekend life is not exciting. As far as academics, despite the lack of majors, the classes are pretty good. It is easy to get to know your professors. However, the lack of life on the weekends and Converse's strict policies on alcohol (even for students over 21) are not worth it if you even slightly like to have fun. 

Converse is unique in that you will know every student and get to know people very well. It also offers numerous leadership positions."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty Safe, but No Good Officers If Something Did Happen – Overall I feel like the campus is fairly safe. However, when one incident did happen where an unknown man came into the dorms, campus safety took 15 minutes. They always blame their slowness on someone hitting their head, but people can't possible hit their head every time something happens. There is no reason to take 15 minutes since the campus is so small...thank goodness nothing serious happened.  

The plus of campus safety is they do frequently ride around at night in the parking lots. I am just not sure if they would know how to react if something bad happened."
College Sophomore,2,"Being that Converse College is a small, private, all girls school, students find it difficult to find parties to go to. This most of the time leads students to attending College Nights at the local clubs. A favorite for arouind the area seems to be Wild Wings where a live DJ, dance floor and a bar are sure to keep one preoccupied. There are a couple other gathering spots such a PJ's and the new club ROME. ROME is being critized for its higher costs although. You would think with so many college kids in the Spartanburg area more club options would be available."
Sophomore,1,"A nightmare. Voice. Speak-up, use that voice to communicate, or stand-up for yourself. Expect the situation to be mishandled. Value. Confidential information was not kept confidential. The perpetrator found out that he/she was reported and who reported. Vision. Try to plan for success when you grades plummet in a required class. Instead of helping me on the homework, a professor kept hinting that I was stupid. The tutoring center looks like a it was made with little thought."
College Freshman,1,Greek life is non existent at my school.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a greek life. It would be great to have greek life so different etnicities can get involved
College Junior,1,It's not really an option to live on campus unless you are from the Spartanburg area.
College Junior,1,There is no party scene or night life on our campus.
College Junior,1,Laid Back – We really do not have many rules at Converse.  The main rule the officers try to enforce the most would be parking in the right area.
College Senior,1,Off campus housing is non existent at Converse. It is required for you to live at converse all 4 years unless your parents live within 30 miles. You can't even move off campus even if that is what you feel is best for you.
College Senior,1,"There are many computer labs on campus. Unfortunately you have a hard time finding a printer/ computer that works. Also, many times the best computer labs on campus are used for meetings for faculty."
College Sophomore,1,"Every student gets $75 of printing money a year. However, they only have one semi-reliable computer lab. They have a computer lab in every dorm, but in my dorm this year only 1 out of 5 computers actually worked. My freshman year, only 2 of the computers were fully functioning. The printer in the dorms are always out of ink and paper, and in my dorm this year, they took the printer completely out. 

The internet, expect in the senior apartments, is not wireless. You can get a router."
College Senior,1,Almost Nonexistent – I feel pretty safe on campus but that is only because Spartanburg is a safe city. Our campus saftey is horrible; you can spot them at the gas station down the street or even Waffle House at 3 a.m. when they are supposed to be covering campus. Our health center is a joke.
College Sophomore,1,"The parking SUCKS at converse. Converse needs to add more parking lots or a parking deck. I know the school is small, but a lot more students have cars than they think."
College Sophomore,1,"Is There Even a Movie Theatre? I don't really party, and I feel like there's never anything to do around here. I'm not sure if that's because I'm from a big city, but you definitely have to search for things to do."
College Sophomore,1,"The only ""off-campus housing"" I know of is directly across the street from the school.  It's not really off-campus when it's next door."
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing to do at night or during the day. All the events make you feel like you are back in preschool. Even the dances are not fun because they do not have boys, and the whole faculty is present babysitting you."
College Sophomore,1,The only transportation offered is on a golf cart between each building. They offer no off campus transportation except to two dances a year. They do not offer any options for students without cars.
College Sophomore,1,"NO GUYS – The girls are different, not your typical party girls. There are absolutely no guys on campus except professors, brothers, and boyfriends."
College Sophomore,1,In state its semi-easy to get academic scholarship... out of state not so much. You have to get an athletic scholarship or something because this school will wring your wallet if you don't.
College Sophomore,1,"We have an honor code. If you break the honor code you get 24 houred which means you have 24 hours to turn yourself in. Regardless of whether or not you turn yourself in it's a painful process in front of the Civitas board and they make you write a paper and find every way possible to fine you and get extra money. It's a dry campus and there are male visitation rules since it's an all girls school. There are no on campus parties, theres no alcohol allowed on campus, and it gets painfully boring if you dont go out to the colleges near by."
College Sophomore,1,"I've lived in two different buildings. Both are pretty crappy just because they are old and look like they've been around since when the school was built but it doesn't really matter because they are renovating every building so new freshmen have it nice. Once they redo everything it will be very inviting but the price you pay for tuition and the quality of the dorms is not worth it right now, but in two years it will be."
College Freshman,1,There is no off-campus housing available to us. We have to live on campus or at home if you live within the 35 mile range. I live at home and I want to live not on campus and not at home either. I think it would be nice if we could have our own housing outside of campus because it would be a lot cheaper than living on campus.

It was a straightforward process and the schools organization made it that much easier.
Sophomore,5,Due to the pandemic. we had to go online for classes. Teachers were very understanding of the situation. My professors were always there if I needed anything.
Sophomore,5,I love the small classroom ratios. I am able to have a relationship with my professors allowing me todo well in school. I feel more comfortable when I need with something. I also love the events that Curry has to make friends with other people. I was able to make close friends quickly and be comfortable with myself. Another thing that I love is the new science building. This is my favorite place to go when I have to study for a test or exam. I could even go into classrooms to study allowing me to focus more.
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID, students had to transfer to online learning. it was one of the best experiences for me. the professors were available and the assignment was very much educational and doable."
Graduate Student,5,"It was an amazing school, the amount of support and help from Professors to administrators was just absolutely amazing. This school has set the bar so high, that not even my Grad school can come close to compare what curry college does for its students."
Senior,5,"Campus is gorgeous. Professors are all very encouraging. I transferred in and it's been a positive experience. Not sure if all the programs get the credit they deserve, but certainly all are respected."
Freshman,5,They're very helpful and understanding towards my learning disorder (I have ADD). I also love the welcoming atmosphere and strive towards a hate speech free campus!
Freshman,5,"In all honesty, this college is very good and beneficial to people who work better in small classes. The small class size really helps out with getting to know both classmates and professors, so it is much easier to reach out and get the help you need from both. The professors are extremely reasonable with the workload and times you are able to visit them in their offices and email or call them."
Sophomore,5,"Curry College is one of the best liberal arts school in MA! If you're looking for a school with great support, education and fun activities come to Curry!"
Sophomore,5,"Personally, I have become to love Curry College at first I wasn't sue if it was going to be a good school for me but I love it. I am going into my second year and I am well aware of the do's and don'ts of college. I am ready for whatever my sophomore year will bring me."
Sophomore,5,"Im only a sophomore at Curry College but I love the school! The campus is on the smaller size which I like a lot but its very nice, the professors are excellent, caring and incredibly helpful!! The administration at Curry is also very helpful in all areas from human resources, to academic needs! I work on campus and the jobs they have available are fun and really enjoyable. I have never been excited to go to school before I came to curry, the atmosphere is everything anyone would wish for in a college!"
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed my first year at Curry College. I made a ton of new friends and really enjoyed my courses. The teachers are really great here. The classes are small so you really get to know the individuals in the room as well as the teachers get to know you as well. If you are looking for a quiet small school, Curry is for you."
Niche User,5,I love visiting Curry College. They made me feel really welcomed and answered all of my questions. I was honored that I got accepted into the school and can not wait to enter as a freshman.
Freshman,5,"Advisors, Admissions councelous and professors are all very nice and very helpful. They go above and beyond to make connections with every student in the class."
Freshman,5,Curry College is a pretty small environment which is what I prefer. The staff and students are really helpful when it comes to navigating around Campus or help with assignments.
Freshman,5,"Curry College has a beautiful campus, endless resources, and best of all, amazing staff members. It is exactly what parents and high school students imagine a college to be. The school inspires students to chase their dreams and help them along the way. It is a great place to attend if you are looking to make life-long connections with alumni, professors, and students."
Works Here,5,"curry college is great and is one of the best schools in mass, working here and being a legacy and a hopefully a future student of curry college, it is a great school."
Alum,5,"As a continuing education student pursuing a Bachelors in Nursing, it is a wonderful environment. The professors are well versed in their fields, the workload is tough though not unbearable. The interaction with staff and students to ensure success is excellent. love Curry College. I feel included, challenged, and like I am at the perfect school for me. Professors have relationships with their students and care about how you are doing both in and outside of the classroom. There is a very strong sense of community. There is always something to do. It's in a great location, being so close to Boston."
Freshman,5,"Curry College provides many activities outside of the classroom. On the weekend they have a shuttle to take you to places off campus. Curry College wants you to succeed. They have the Writing Center, and Student Life to help students."
Freshman,5,In my first year they have made me feel like I'm at home. The teachers are extremely nice and great to work with.  My younger sister is even thinking of coming here...everything has been great here
Senior,5,Great college learning a lot in my degree with plenty of knowledgeable professors in the study. It is accredited in my degree of Business Management. Have many concentration I am currently duel concentration in Finance and Human Resources but has a lot more than those two.
Freshman,5,"Curry College is the school that offers a welcoming environment, excellent academics, a variety of clubs and extracurriculars activities for students to participate in, and offers a residence life that most students love. "
Freshman,5,Curry is a very welcoming school. My professors have been really professional and easy to talk with about course material. It's a wonderful college and I feel very lucky to be apart of it!
College Freshman,5,Curry is all about involvement; there's so much to do here and you could even start your own club or recommend am intramural. We have bubble soccer
College Freshman,5,"I love Curry College. I feel included, challenged, and like I am at the perfect school for me. Professors have relationships with their students and care about how you are doing both in and outside of the classroom. There is a very strong sense of community. There is always something to do. It's in a great location, being so close to Boston."
College Freshman,5,"They have a lot of on campus jobs and internships that apply to majors, and they have access to other off campus internships."
College Freshman,5,"All of my professors have different way of doing things, but they care about their job and extending themselves to help students"
Recent Alumnus,5,Best 4 years of my life. I had planned on transferring to a larger school but just couldn't leave.
College Sophomore,5,"I have never had a school take a second look at me before, and Curry College did. I feel welcome at this school, and I feel like I fit in. I know I can be apart of something special here."
College Senior,5,"As a nursing student, I am extremely pleased with the program.  The professors are all passionate and willing to assist in helping you succeed."
College Junior,5,"As a continuing education student pursuing a Bachelors in Psychology, it is a wonderful environment. The professors are well versed in their fields, the workload is tough though not unbearable. The interaction with staff and students to ensure success is excellent."
College Junior,5,There are many great professors at Curry College.
College Sophomore,5,There are people of many different races and religions at Curry College and everyone is accepting of one another.
College Sophomore,5,"I decided to go to Curry College because of the great communications program that they had and all of the opportunities I would have when studying this major. The campus is beautiful and small, there is always someone to answer questions and to help you extra help with course work. The food is great at curry and I feel safe and happy in this environment."
College Sophomore,5,I'm at Curry College and the Communications program here is incredible. I have been very satisfied with my education so far and all of the opportunities I had already. All of my professors in the communications department have all been out in the field and have a lot of experience in what they are teaching students. I have learned so much already in my field and my professors are so welcoming and friendly. They are always looking to help and the connections they have for this department is great for networking and they are always helping students to network.
College Sophomore,5,"The fitness center at curry college is amazing, they have top of the line fitness equipment so you can work out any part of your body. also the fitness center is readily available at any time of the day."
College Freshman,5,I haven't had any problems with the computer labs at school
College Junior,5,"I have not once ever felt unsafe at Curry College, the campus is gated so you need to be signed in by a student to just get onto campus. Public safety is really easy to get a hold of."
College Senior,5,When i cam to Curry College the process was great and easy. I did not have a hard time through anything. They are very nice to deal with. My professor / advisor is a amazing woman.  She uses all her skills from her schooling to help us as students and giving good information. She makes it worth the time and effort at Curry college.
Sophomore,4,"decent, took some getting used to but teachers have done a pretty good job. its never easy going online so teachers have been a little more understanding of missing work...etc.  the hybrid system on campus is going well. curry has delt with covid very well"
Sophomore,4,I am currently a student at Curry College. Curry College is perfect for students who want to be in a safe community. It has a small classroom setting so it is perfect if you enjoy asking teachers for direct questions. It has a lot of different program and is very diverse.
Junior,4,"Curry College has become my home and I love it there. I love the professors, they really do care about who you are and they make sure you get the best educations."
Freshman,4,The food is better than most colleges I have been to. There are always a lot of options. The professors are always willing to help out in any means. Some of them even help with assignments in other classes. The people here are very nice and welcoming. I have yet to meet a mean person. The workers are also very nice. They are pretty funny and always ask how you are when you see them. There are tons of clubs to be apart of.
Sophomore,4,"Curry College is a small College located in Milton Massachusetts. I have finished my freshman year at Curry and I loved it. It's what you make of it and the friends you meet. Curry is very close to Boston to see Sport Games, go to the Boston commons, and much much more. The campus food is good but however could use better hours sometimes and a wider option of food. Athletic games are fun for the teams that are good on campus and the intramural are a great time"
Freshman,4,"I love the academics, and the professors are amazing. But the dorms are prone to mice in the cold, and temperature fluctuations. The food is good, but there isn’t a lot of variety."
Freshman,4,"Very Clean, Nice and very nice people who care about you as a person and want to see you do well in life!!"
Freshman,4,I am only a freshman but so far I like the college. I started out with a stressful roommate situation but it was resolved. I like my classes and all the help that is available if needed. I have met new friends and am on the baseball team. The campus is great. All in all so far so good.
Senior,4,Curry College is a small college which offers students many ways to get involved and grow as an student. The professors are great-they are always willing to help students that are struggling. I think one way that the college could improve would be to expand the college.
Niche User,4,Curry College offers a lot of extra help to the students within the institution. They get to know the students on another level to ensure they do well within the course or the school in general.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Curry College. I find that the classes are very interesting and small, which helps me to network better and learn easily. I feel like the campus is quite small so there isn't a ton to do. They have shuttles to Boston though, which is cool. Overall, I like it for someone who is looking for a small liberal arts school that accommodates everyone's needs."
Sophomore,4,"Curry is a nice small, private school. The only trouble I have had at this school was being able to pick classes. The teachers are very devoted to you. The schedules are nice. I even work here on campus. It is a very friendly environment. The food is not so great, but you will have that on any campus. I feel very safe here at Curry. I have my own room and I love it. The buildings are very nice and feel very homey."
Junior,4,"I love Curry College, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else! My experience has been wonderful here."
Alum,4,"Curry was a very small college and was very local to my hometown. Although it was local, I still lived on campus for four years. I was a nursing major and felt the professors had a strong interest to see be succeed and pass. My academic adviser privately tutored me on her own time, when I was having trouble with finding how to study appropriately for exams."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Curry College is mostly positive. It may be a bit pricey, yet it is worth the resources you are provided with. We have excellent services such as health, disability, ect. There are also many programs such as our PAL services."
Freshman,4,"I am a Freshmen at Curry College. I love the school and all it has to offer. The school has  great academics. I am always learning something new in a way that helps me learn. Most students live on campus their freshmen year but tend to commute after that. Some students are from out of state for the PAL Program, while a lot are from in state since it is on a nice campus."
Senior,4,"Very happy at Curry. Supported hugely by the PAL program and have made so many friends. It is small, but just right for me. Wish that the school would listen to the students more and not be so secretive about funds and such. If you aren't in the top few majors your department is really ignored. Especially the art department."
Sophomore,4,love curry college made tons of friends have great professors and always have fun on the weekends! The weekend life is either at the stu or any non freshman dorm.
College Sophomore,4,So far its been an welcoming experience
College Sophomore,4,There are a good amount of health and safety resources for students.
College Sophomore,4,Spending on where your classes are some buildings are better than others.
College Sophomore,4,I have had an overall great experience with courses and professors at my school. I had some really great professors that taught challenging courses really well ! I felt that the courses that I took were well rounded that will definitely prepare me for more challenging courses in the future. In addition I liked how some of my professors had a number of different eating styles which made the class material more interesting to learn about.
College Sophomore,4,"I feel that this school has provided me with the opportunities to be successful in the future while also inspiring me to become a physical therapist. Eager to begin volunteering or working in a physical therapy setting, one of my professors suggested that I look into becoming a physical therapist aide since it is a great way to begin to know the career, gain patient experience, and a way to become a strong applicant when applying to physical therapy programs. I interviewed with a physical therapy place and then became hired as a physical therapist aide,  a job that I enjoy very much. I feel that since I began working as a physical therapist aide, it really puts the field of physical therapy into perspective and teaches me about various injuries, disabilities, and diseases that I will most likely see when licensed as a physical therapist as well as seeing how the field truly helps others rehabilitate."
College Sophomore,4,I feel that campus police do a great job of working to keep the campus safe and secure. There is always campus police and campus security driving around campus throughout the day and night to ensure that my school is a safe environment for all students and faculty members.
College Sophomore,4,"I like the way my college has different levels of sports in terms of varsity competitive sports, club sports, intramural sports, and wellness credit sport classes. As a student everyone needs wellness credits to graduate and there are a number of sports and activities to choose from. This fall I am enrolled in a tennis class for one of my wellness credit requirements and really look forward to it !!!!"
College Sophomore,4,"Having recently finished my freshman year of college, I feel confident that I will gain the resources that I need to attend graduate school to become a physical therapist. The professors make student success their top priority and help students to achieve in what they intend on majoring in. For example my chemistry professor told me about job opportunities for students like me wanting to become a physical therapist, and I am now working as a physical therapist aide, and I feel that it is an awesome learning experience."
College Freshman,4,This campus is very safe
College Freshman,4,"Curry is a very encouraging school community with amazing people and surroundings. The food is pretty good compared to other schools, the people are the friendliest most ""get involved"" bunch around, and the locations is great; there's amazing opportunities to get off campus and explore. Anyone would feel right at home here."
College Junior,4,"Overall, I have had a great experience thus far."
College Sophomore,4,Professors at this institution are pretty good. Many of them have great life experience and can offer more to the student than what a textbook says.
College Freshman,4,"The professors seem to be very keen on making students feel and achieve success. You get a couple that are mean and do not care and don't teach well at all but you manage. Overall the professors like to help the students and make sure they pass. Courses are okay, some aren't challenging and others should not even be a core class but I don't make the rules. Class size is pretty good, low not that many which is nice."
College Freshman,4,The academics offered are sufficient to pretty much any degree. The professors are for the most part fair ad easy to learn from and helpful.
College Freshman,4,Lots of diversity at the colleg. Everyone is pretty accepting
College Freshman,4,The professors are very helpful. I have learned alot in my time there.
College Senior,4,there are lots of opportunities
College Senior,4,i really enjoy the small classes
College Senior,4,many opportunities for a variety of students
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus. Public safety and health services are easy to get to and it's easy to find someone there to talk to.
College Freshman,4,"Curry offers great opportunities for its students, with internships and the career development center."
College Freshman,4,I like the small class sizes. Teachers are friendly and care about their student. They are available during office hours.
College Freshman,4,I love my dorm. I get great with my roommates and neighbors. The bathrooms are clean. The RA's are helpful. I feel comfortable and safe in my building.
College Freshman,4,Awesome professors and classes very helpful
College Freshman,4,They value education and their programs and are trying to make it easier for students to achieve more.
College Freshman,4,"I love using the gym in the student center, even though I am not a varsity athlete. I use it almost everyday and feel very comfortable using the gym."
College Freshman,4,Fields and courts from what I have seen seem pretty nice.
College Freshman,4,"I've had little to no issues with this school so far. Some Professors are awesome, others not so much but overall it's a nice community and they all seem somewhat passionate about their jobs. The issues I've had come from the registrars office. Other than that my experience has been great so far."
College Freshman,4,"Most professors are great, and what you are learning is always helpful to you, some classes are very relaxed with work and others are moderate and a select few classes have a lot or almost too much work, mostly with chemistry and psychology. The library is a good place to study with different rooms and a second floor that is a quiet study space."
College Freshman,4,"There are buildings that are slightly older than others, and the quality of them is not as convient or good as the newer buildings, but they give a more comforting feeling of home and are cheaper to live in. Some of the dorms are closer to the academic buildings but they are usually the older halls. Some floors in halls have a weak sense of community because of the lacl of the RAs effort, but some floors having amazing communities."
College Freshman,4,"It is a division 3 school so it is not the best, but it can be good and there is many ways to be athletic without being dedicated to it"
College Freshman,4,Its an easy school to fall in love with and feel at home. Easy to make friends and get involved. Its on the expensive side but they are ways to make it less expensive and you get your moneys worth
College Freshman,4,Love this school it a great size! Small classes and great teachers also lots of fun clubs.
College Freshman,4,I love the athletics on campus both varsity& other
College Freshman,4,I was given recognition for my academic abilities
College Freshman,4,Knowing the right people has its perks
College Freshman,4,People are friendly and will do anything to help
College Sophomore,4,Curry provides good opportunities for the students-especially the nursing students.
College Sophomore,4,"Curry College spent a lot of money on their new student center and it shows-this is the nicest thing about the campus. The gym and dance studio are beautiful-the dining hall is also nice but a little on the small side. The bookstore and mail area are also quite upscale. The library could be (and should be) greatly improved-it's small (can be hard to find seats at peak times) and the hours are ridiculous (not open on Sundays, closes early most nights-even during finals) and you can tell it's old. The nice thing about Curry is that it provides multiple ""Cafe"" locations where students can use their colonel cash to get coffee and snacks when they're not near the Student Center."
College Freshman,4,"Curry is good at giving out scholarships and making the school affordable, or more affordable than most schools."
College Freshman,4,Sports is a big part of why most people come to Curry.  Other than sports and the Nursing program I don't see why anyone would ever come here.  Very boring and bland campus.  Beautiful but everyone complains all the time and goes home on the weekends.
College Senior,4,"I wish there were more online courses offered, other than that the courses for my major were great.  Although it can be difficult to find non-nursing courses that work with the nursing schedules"
Alum,2,"I would only recommend Curry if: 1. you are choosing nursing as your major & 2. if you are financially able to pay Curry's tuition (scholarships/grants that cover a MAJOR chunk of Curry's tuition for the next 4 years). I was an out-of-state undergrad in the nursing program and honestly wish I did more on Curry before deciding to go there four 4 years. The kids that go there are VERY cliquey and entitled, making it hard to branch out and make new friends once everyone has formed their own friend groups. The party scene is non-existent (especially if you're under 21 & can't get into bars in Boston). The amount you have to pay in tuition is without a doubt NOT worth spending four years as a full time student at Curry. The only thing that I liked about Curry was that their nursing program is excellent & had the opportunity to attend clinicals at Boston hospitals under the best clinical instructors."
Freshman,2,"Im going to be as honest as I can. I went as a freshman this fall. It started perfect. Everyone was nice and excited. That changed fast. The school started to become unenjoyable. I began asking the upperclassmen if it ever got better. They said no, and to get out while I can. Curry College is a glorified extension to high school. You may be getting a degree, but students bring drama pettiness and disregard for others. One of the dorms on campus, Mayflower set the fire alarm off over 7 times the first month.The fire trucks came wasting time. In most cases it was due to students smoking. Along with this, there were also over three people that had been expelled within first term, one the first weekend. Nobody wants to be there, but had either no other option, or no better option. I withdrew late October. I made it through 2 months, I had seen enough. I know what you're thinking; I just quit. Seems like I did, but trust me, now I am getting a better education and don’t hate my life."
Sophomore,2,"My overall experience so far has been overwhelming. Freshman year was excellent. I met new people and I liked the classes I took. Then sophomore year came around and it started to become high school. Drama had taken over and it no longer felt like college over, maybe because the school was so small. I think college is different for everyone but I think i am met for a bigger school that still allows me to excell in classes."
Freshman,2,"Overall an okay experience, food is terrible, limited choices with under cooked or unprepared foods. Prison food is probably better. No partying unless you know some upperclassmen or part of a sports team but always gets busted anyways.  Gotta hide like Anne Frank if you want to party. No school spirit at all. Some teachers care and some are just in it for the money. Didn’t even try in academics, and never studied for anything, no pressure at all depends on your major. Small selection for selection of course you wana take so your basically forced to take boring, waste of time classes.Friendly people but just another misserable, small, quiet high school. The gym is like a planet fitness. Really got screwed when I apllyed to transfer out because all my credits got declined because I was a specific major. Just a good school to be independent but a bad school for fun."
Freshman,2,"Curry is nothing but a headache, food is undercooked, portions are a disgrace, and you can’t get as much as you want. Not diverse at all. If you aren’t white your an outcast, if you don’t have money you are too. People aren’t friendly and very judgmental. The dorms are terrible only a few nice ones, updates are needed to all but new buildings. Campus is boring nothing go on because everyone goes home, can’t party or make a sound at night without consequences, anything to do with fun or partying gets shut down. Camp curry should be the name not curry college bc everyone treats you like children and not adults, education is alright but nothing transfers so your stuck here"
Freshman,2,"School isn't too great, it seems better than it really is. I already know numerous amounts of people already transferring because of how boring the school is. It's in the nice town of Milton and there is more stuff to do off campus but only involves spending more of your money. Unless you plan on  playing a sport here of you're in the nursing program, the school is impractical."
College Freshman,2,Never anything to do and the people are cliquey
College Freshman,2,Public safety are nice when you need them but the people who work in the building are mean. It is lacking but they have a strong sense in ticketing? Seems to have priorities backwards. Health wise the people are very nice very accommodating just sometimes they prescribe the wrong things and actually end up making you ten times worse than how you originally feel.
College Freshman,2,"The people act like they are in High School, the school itself spends way to much money on appearance and not enough for the students. Like food, amenities, courses ect. A ton of people leave on the weekends so the options to do stuff is limited but there is going to Boston and exploring that. Only problem is you have to go to one of the worst parts of Mass to get to Boston. Which I don't agree with."
College Freshman,2,The campus security need to step up their game at the front gate. They basically let everyone in.
College Freshman,2,"Depending where you are housed you can have a very nice dorm room or a tiny, smelly, shoe box in a basement somewhere."
College Freshman,2,"I'm thoroughly annoyed by my school. I'm a freshman at Curry(c.o.2019) and I'm paying $50,000 a year for a school that isn't even worth half that cost. I'm not feeling challenged in my classes, the food is not good, the social scene is bleak unless you're a partier, I could go on..."
College Freshman,2,It is every where. First week we had an over dose
College Freshman,2,I don't feel safe on campus. Security just lets everyone in even though there is a security gaurd poates at the entrance.
College Freshman,2,"I am considering transferring. Curry not only does not challenge me, but is boring and feels more like a sad high school then a college. I am very involved on campus, and even that does not make Curry feel anymore like ""home"" or a place where students are welcomed. The staff overall is very unlikely to help students, and small students are constantly made into larger, unsolvable errors just because the school does not want to put in the time or effort to fix them. There are some parts of school that are great; for example Jules and Otto, two people who work in the marketplace, are incredibly friendly and kind. But kindness doesn't change the fact that the food itself isn't good. In addition, the school's safety precautions go too far overboard and don't even help stop the constant thefts or other problems that students face. Students aren't able to have any fun without fear of getting caught, causing them to turn to much more dangerous off campus parties rather than having fun in the safety of campus. I'm a straight A student, and Curry not only doesn't challenge me, but isn't friendly, and won't even allow me to have a little bit of relatively safe           fun."
College Sophomore,2,Curry did not go out of their way to provide students with scholarship information
College Freshman,2,The only decent major that Curry is known for is their Nursing Program.  Other than that all the teachers teach us like we are in middle school and the some of the students don't seem as though they would be able to sit through a normal college level class anyways.  The acceptance rate is WAY too high for this school.
College Freshman,2,"The school claims they make it very easy to get around and get into Boston, but really they don't have many shuttles running into Boston and they only take you to the T stations at weird and random times.  They take you to the Mattapan T-station which is the scariest city surrounding Boston in my parents opinion.  My friends and I are not allowed to go there."
College Freshman,2,It's a lot cheaper to live off campus but you would be living in some scary areas that your parents may not allow you to live in.  The school does not help at all to help find housing so you are on your own.
College Freshman,2,It was an ongoing process... ridiculous.
Freshman,1,"Personally, I did not have a great time at Curry. I left after my first semester because the school made me very depressed. If you are into small schools with about 12 kids in each class then this school is for you. I will say that it was nice that Boston was only 10 miles away which was very convenient. The plus to the small school is the professors are always ready and willing to help. They will remember you and keep tabs on you and your academics. Also, many students live close to the school so a lot leave for the weekend. Hence why the nickname for this school is ""Camp Curry""."
Niche User,1,Well I was part of the  orentation to they had it on Martin Luther King day. Also the weather wasn’t smarted idea we couldn’t get a tour of the college. This lead me to be really lost finding the building where my classes where. Than when it came to purchasing books my mom did for me and told me. That when she checked online a used book was in curry library and when she went to buy the book the  woman told her the book  was out. Than when she went outside to call to buy book a  young man on phone  said  the book she needed is in store and she went to buy book. She told him to leave in front and this woman kept overpricing us on books and telling us used books weren’t available when they were. This has been numerous times she has did this. I don’t see why she  has  to lie about the used books being available and trying to overprice students. I was in Accounting major and switched majors. The Finiancial Accouting book had missing pages and I didn’t use at all.
Sophomore,1,"Curry College is a f---ing nightmare. The teachers there are as unintelligent as the students, and the campus is equivalent to a maximum security prison. I go to sleep crying every night, and honestly would rather just end it all than stay here. Its a very depressing school. DO NOT go here, it will be a huge mistake."
College Freshman,1,Lots of people try to get involved but little to no fan support for any sports
College Freshman,1,"The only freshman ""party"" options are to go off campus or go to Lombard basement, which is barely even a party and gets broken up asap anyway. (And they also found guns with ammunition in Lombard basement so that's a thing) As a freshman if you want a single you can be in Bell, but its crazy expensive and then you're separated from almost your entire class. Some RA's are great, but others are the absolute worst (shoutout to my awful RA who doesn't do anything). They only care about the rules when they are bored and then they run around at 2am just because they can. Rule enforcement is insanely strict and feels like your at a boarding school, starting with the check in's that almost no other schools do. When something goes wrong with a roommate, the Community Directors don't help and basically just tell you that you're screwed."
College Freshman,1,"Go Colonels! That's a lie. Our football team not only isn't great, but the school makes school spirit so non existent that no one cares about going to the games. I think more parents show up to the games than students. The hockey team has more students go to their games than the football games, and the hockey games are in this awful rink off campus. Sports overall here have no school support and the students sense that and therefore don't want to go to any of the games."
College Freshman,1,"We do not have Greek life, but you can see the overall positive effect and sense of community throughout campus because there is no Greek life"
College Freshman,1,"Its Horrible, I get Dominos more then eating at the stu."
Recent Alumnus,1,Curry College does not try to help its students.
Recent Alumnus,1,Girls and boys are equally hideous. Girls are fat and stuck up even though they are -1 in the world of 9s and 10s. Boys have acne and think they are awesome because they all play football.
Recent Alumnus,1,There have been four sexual assaults within the past week. The admin's way of fixing the problem? Handing out whistles.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no greek life at Curry College. There used to be and now there is not. Do not try to start any chapters because the faculty and adminstration will shut you down immediately.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Curry College is ten minutes from Mattapan, during orientation week of 2014 there were four shootings and murders in that town during the week. Students never get off the campus but those who know how to work the MBTA system will be able to get out of Mattapan quickly and find refuge in Boston or Harvard Square where the normal people are."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I would not wish this college experience on my worst enemy. Curry College is the worst college to ever be in existance. Not only are the people that make up Curry awful, ignorant, and lazy but the teachers are awful as well. Curry College will not let you see your grades because they feel the need to put useless holds on student's records. Curry College will also not allow you to take any classes that you wish to take ahead (to get ahead in your major and possibly finish earlier than the other students) they want everyone to go the same pace. Curry College is not challenging at all and I am planning on transferring next semester. Curry College is a waste of money."
College Freshman,1,Nothing is ever going on on campus.  Unless you live on south side with the upperclassmen there is nothing ever to do and no parties ever.  Sometimes there are random dances put on but no one really goes and they don't play good music.  They are just like high school dances all over again.
College Freshman,1,the first time offenders get a letter home and a warning but thats only for alcohol. for weed its one strike and you lose housing
College Senior,1,"Drinking Over Drugs – At Curry College, drinking is more of a popular scene, depending on the social crowd. Drugs is not really a big factor at Curry College because Curry makes it known about the risk and consequences if a student was to get caught."
College Junior,1,"Feels Like Prison – They are very strict with policies at school. Having a red cup with water, parking on the opposite side of campus, and having too many people in your room are a few of the things that can get you written up. Then with so many write ups it results in a housing probation. It is ridiculous because they say we are adults, yet they teach us like we are children."
College Freshman,1,The only nightlife is boston (which is hard to get too because of parking) or providence (Which is a nightmare getting to) Underage nightlife is limited to two clubs in providence

Senior,5,Holy Cross College has been an amazing place to grow in my academics and faith. At Holy Cross the class rooms are small which allows you to build relationships with professors and other students in your class. There is a strong student life and always things to do on and off campus.
Niche User,5,"Holy Cross has already become a home to me where I can thrive. I attended their summer theology institute, Saints and Scholars, and fell in love with the campus, faculty, administration, and mission of the college. Since then, Holy Cross has been a place where I can focus on my future and what God has in store for me. It has a great atmosphere and aesthetic of study, so I feel that I will succeed greatly here. I cannot wait for August to come so I can finally be home at last."
Senior,5,"Holy Cross College is a great school that focuses on teaching students about how to become an active person for their local community, and for the world. The small classes offer a better environment for personally working with professors, and the small campus community makes it a great place to make new friends and study together with classmates."
Sophomore,5,"It is a fantastic place to grow as a person. Students and staff are very friendly and ready to answer any questions. It is a small campus so the student to professor ratio is smaller, making it easier to ask the professor questions and get to know other students."
Junior,5,"I overall enjoyed and continue to enjoy all that Holy Cross College has to offer. It is a smaller college, but that is not synonymous with being a lesser college. We are a close knit family and everyone around campus (be it student, faculty, or staff) knows each other appreciates each other. Being a small campus allows Holy Cross to achieve an experience that even Notre Dame does not have. The students and Professors are able to develop a relationship with each other. People are known by name at Holy Cross and they are remembered. As a student there, I have grown to know so many unique individuals beyond my class mates or Professors. This is the point the Holy Cross drives at and hits home own. We are not just a college at Holy Cross, we are a close knit diverse family all striving to help each other. There is no other university like it!"
Sophomore,5,"Holy Cross for me is the best school. It offers everything I need for my major. Even if campus is a little small, thats a good thing by the time you graduate you know everyone. The professors work really hard to give the most one on one time that is possible. I couldn't ask for a better school!"
Freshman,5,Holy Cross is the most student oriented college you will ever find. Everything is personal and the staff are always willing to help someone in any kind of need.
Freshman,5,I love how it is small and gives yo a chance to get to know your professors and have more of a 1 on 1 learning environment.
Sophomore,5,"Being at Holy Cross for a year and a half, I can say I've had a really great experience. The staff is diverse, helpful, and prepared. It is very easy to find new friends because of the small community; also, having Saint Mary's and Notre Dame within a 5 minute walk is definitely a plus."
College Sophomore,5,"Holy Cross College is the best, there isn't any other college like it. It is like a big family with both professors and students making Holy Cross College one of the best places i've ever been"
College Freshman,5,"Very Diverse community, with people with all types of ethnic and social backgrounds."
College Freshman,5,The fact that there is small classroom sizes there is a very tight community between the student and teacher. The student to teacher ratio is excellent. They are very helpful whenever needed.
College Freshman,5,Holy Cross has many connections between internships and out of school experience.
College Freshman,5,"Holy Cross College. What I can say about this small- family oriented school is that it's great. Small classroom sizes, friendly teachers & staff. The multiple schools I applied too were all catholic/private schools, and have never felt so sure about my decision about coming to Holy Cross College. Going out of state has been the best decision, it has really helped me mature and grow in ways that I couldn't have if I stayed at home. I had many options but I knew that Holy Cross was the best option."
College Sophomore,5,There is a broad array of students that come to Holy Cross College that have different religious backgrounds. Students come from different regions of the U.S. and some from other countries. Everyone is very supportive and encouraged others to be themselves.
College Sophomore,5,"Holy Cross College is unique in that it is a relatively small college and once you attend here it feels  as if you are a part of a community or something bigger than just yourself. The college experience is different for everyone, but it truly depends on what the individual makes of it and I think that Holy Cross College does a great job of encouraging students to get involved."
College Freshman,5,Our teams rank regionally every year. Many of our students also play sports across the street at Notre Dame.
College Freshman,5,My experience so far has been far.My best experience have been outside of the class room. I have met people who have encouraged me to stay at school
College Freshman,5,we don't have greek life on campus but i have friends in greek life and I hear nothing but good things. they help charities and also have a good time on campus. They make school fun.
College Sophomore,5,"Not much goes wrong, very quiet and calm on campus"
Sophomore,4,"Holy Cross is a great, small, Catholic school with many great professors who are dedicated to their work and to their students. The small classes allow for a more personal relationship with professors, and everyone on campus knows one another, most of them by name. Because of their being a part of the tri-campus community, with Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College being within walking distance, Holy Cross is able to offer many additional academic and social opportunities to its students. The only downside to Holy Cross is that, because of its size, the number of programs offered is limited, and depending on the program is said to not always be of the best quality. I can say from experience though that HCC is definitely a great school for History majors, and professor Cortes, who is the chair of the History department, is an excellent teacher."
Freshman,4,I love Holy Cross. There is an open door policy to talk to professors whenever you need to. It’s a beautiful campus and it’s easy to make new friends on campus and at Notre Dame. Student life is great. You get to know everyone on campus and have access to almost everything at Notre Dame too.
Freshman,4,"Holy Cross is a great school. The campus is small but welcoming. It's very easy to navigate your classes. I am apart of an athletic team and having teammates to lean back on is very helpful. The professors are there to help when you need it. Small class size, able to ask questions in class versus if you go to a large school and you are in a lecture with 200 students. The tri-campus is very unique here as well. There are a lot of things to do around the city as well."
Freshman,4,"This college is very small. Think of it as another high school, everyone knows everyone even if just by face. This is definitely a PWI but it is a safe place for minorities. The professors want the students to succeed and they are dedicated to offering the help that is needed. The University of Notre Dame and Saint Marys College are part of a tri-campus with HCC so you can take classes at all three. Overall, this school could improve but it is relatively new, only starting off in 1996. It will only get better and better."
Freshman,4,I love the small school atmosphere and the close-knit relationships I have with my teachers. The school is made up of a lot of athletes so it is easy to find people like you and to have access to make yourself better. Comfortable home with opportunities to be able to expand in South Bend and at Notre Dame
Freshman,4,Holy Cross offers an incredible community of people to live and learn with. There are many advantages to the environment of this small liberal arts college.
College Freshman,4,"Overall this school is nicely put together. As previously stated the staff/ professors for the most part are truly passionate in their teachings. The student to professor ratio is convenient as professors have more opportunities to work one on one with students. The athletics is strong overall for how small the school is, and the dorm life is great. While there are a few flaws such as the cafe quality, and some interesting professors that don't seem to truly understand their own class, overall this school is great and I believe it will continue to have a good impact on me."
College Freshman,4,"While the internship program is not as strong here, we do get invited to go across the street to Notre Dame where there are boundless opportunities for internships and networking. I believe the value of a degree from this school is very strong due to the fact that Notre Dame is in the name, and it's right across the street, which provides Holy Cross students with more opportunities."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is not only a part of ""the college experience"" but it has also changed my perspective on life. Originally when I first arrived here I was not talking to anyone, however as I began to get to know people and open up I truly felt at home. The dorms are your typical average sized college dorms, however the cleaning staff is great. The showers and restrooms are always clean due to the hard work of the cleaning staff. Living on campus is also not only convenient because classes are so close by, but it has truly shaped me into a different person and made me a more responsible adult."
College Freshman,4,"While there aren't as many options due to the fact that this is a smaller school, the athletics for not being a top tier school are fairly decent. There is a strong student support for the basketball and soccer, and hockey is starting to grow more popular as well. Overall the athletics are great for what we have."
College Freshman,4,People here all want to graduate and do well. The school forces all students to complete an internship to help students get a foot in the door to their career they possibly want to get into
College Freshman,4,I am on the men's soccer program here at holy cross college and i have to say the facilities are amazing for how small the school is. Also all the teams here at the school are very competitive.
College Freshman,4,Not a big concern with drugs/ alcohol on campus.
College Freshman,4,"The 24 hour security is great, because they are always around to make sure the students are safe and if are in need of help they are always happy to help."
College Freshman,4,"On campus housing is very convenient, very close proximity to the school. Not really much of a struggle to get to class."
College Sophomore,4,"Holy Cross College is a dry campus, meaning that alcohol isn't allowed in the dorms. The same applies to any type of drug."
College Sophomore,4,"Back to the community aspect, intramural sports are a big aspect of student life. Students, faculty, and others look forward to them."
College Freshman,4,I'm having a good time but I wish things were different. I'm having a hard time making more friends and my financial aid is terrible.I'm taking more classes that are required versus classes that I enjoy.
College Freshman,4,The career center makes it very accessible to find jobs and internships.
College Junior,4,"My experience overall is great.  The professors know you on a professional first name basis and are very helpful.  The class sizes are perfect, which makes learning in the class a bit easier"
College Freshman,4,"I wish I lived at Edge, but North is nice."
College Freshman,4,"Playing basketball is a lot of fun. Our team could be doing a lot better, but we're getting there. Fan support is not as big as I'm used to, but it's a small school so you can't expect a whoooole lot."
College Freshman,4,In having fun playing basketball and hanging out with friends. School isn't bad. But my calc class was miserable and I got a D so I'm very unhappy about that because I learned nothing.
College Senior,4,Van Aukens are great college professors
College Senior,4,good experience but it didn't feel like a college experience. If I wanted more parents and babysitters I would of stayed home and went to college. And the dry campus thing is only promoting the alcohol problem at our school because everyone drinks and gets wasted and drives.
College Freshman,4,My experience has been awesome throughout the first semester. Class sizes are small and in the students favor of getting more help.
College Sophomore,4,Great RA's and other residence make it nice.
College Senior,4,I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know everybody.
College Senior,4,"Holy Cross College was a good fit for me because I needed the small learning environment. Throughout my years of college, I have realized that is what pushed me through and kept me on track as a student. I was also able to be a collegiate athlete which was a good incentive to come to Holy Cross."
College Senior,4,"Holy Cross College is an interesting school. First the school itself only has 600 students, making it one of the smallest institutions in the area; however, due to the school's proximity to both Saint Mary's College and the University of Notre Dame it has the feel of a much larger college or university. Moreover, Holy Cross students have access to the immense amount of resources at Notre Dame, this aspect of the school is what drew me here. The second aspect of Holy Cross that I enjoy is the student to teacher ratio. Due to the fact that the school has a tremendously small student population, students are often in extremely small classes, sometimes with less than five students, and are therefore, expected to interact with their professors. Through this expectation, I have been able to cultivate close relationships with my professors, and ultimately it has helped me to stay on track with my education. In summary, the greatest part of the college experience is being in large environment where you are challenged, while also being able to lean vast and new fields of information, and Holy Cross offers its students the opportunity to be a part of the larger Notre Dame community while simultaneously providing a close knit classroom experience that allows students to flourish."
College Senior,4,"The student - professor relationships here are tremendous. I always feel comfortable going and voicing my concerns to them. Also, the overall feel of family and community is overwhelming. It has been very easy to find friends and build relationships."
College Sophomore,4,Small but updated and community oriented
College Freshman,4,"Great scholarships, but should definitely make more academic scholarships available. nonetheless i've recieved the best and I'm grateful for it."
College Student,4,"I received two $2,000 scholarships from Holy Cross College and a grant. They're helping me out as much as they can. Financial aid is a big help also."
College Sophomore,4,Most pre-reqs can be over-ridden if you have a good enough reason to take the class. Burzycki really knows his stuff as an adviser and can get you your degree early if you declare your freshman year.
College Sophomore,4,Everyday Financial Trouble – I've always had trouble making money even when I did work and it's harder for me to pay for my books and earn more scholarships.
College Senior,4,Holy Cross gave me so many opportunities through the four pillars. Service Learning gave me the opportunity to go out into the community and help others. The Internship gave me the opportunity to get practical experience in a field I see myself working in. The Global Experience allowed me to travel internationally to do service abroad. My senior Capstone then allowed me to share my Holy Cross experience with my friends an family. These for experiences gave me countless opportunities that I could have not gotten anywhere else.
College Senior,4,"A Liberal Arts Education – Holy Cross College provides its students with a holistic Liberal Arts education.  Focusing on education of both the mind and the heart, students learn to become life-long learners so to apply basic wisdom and knowledge to a wide array of fields.

As a Senior at Holy Cross College, I have had the opportunity to travel abroad to West Africa, complete a professional internship with a non-profit organization, create personal relationships with my professors and colleagues, participate in volunteer work throughout the country, and excel in my classes.  Thanks to the personalized teaching style and small class size, many students, including myself, are able to double major, or increase our course loads to fit in a minor or two.  

This distinctly Catholic college is open to all who seek to receive a unique education of the whole person.  I highly recommend Holy Cross College!"
College Freshman,4,What I Love...You Should Get to Love – My overall experience at Holy Cross College is unbelievably fun! I love how everyone is so polite and cares about one another feelings. My favorite experience was the HoCro Hoedown we had for our fall festivities. We have nice things for the students but academics come first.
College Sophomore,4,"History Major – I love our history department at Holy Cross College. The professors are both proficient at history and are able to teach this knowledge to students effectively. Be prepared for small-scale lectures, book reviews, and research papers! I am able, at the end of each semester, to understand what I have learned as well as how it applies to the modern world."
Freshman,2,"very small, nonexistent party scene, food is okay, no school spirit, but SGA does plan some neat weekly events which were nice"
Works Here,2,"Not rigourous and every now and then, they lurch from one financial crisis to another..They are owned by Notre Dame now, but only because the waitlisted first year ND students go there. That scheme is not a long term solution. Only until the next accreditation  cycle. Then what happens? Do they close up without warning and leave students stranded?"
College Senior,2,On campus housing is a joke at holy cross and is not ideal. Off campus is the way to go if possible
College Sophomore,2,"Although it's a dry campus, everyone drinks casually within their dorms. Weed and Adderall are rampant. Quite a few kids partake in harder party drugs as well."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is pretty strict when it comes to drinking and curfew and other things. But I think because it is a catholic institution, the rules are a bit tighter. I think that the students are mixed between people who like the rules and people who would much rather do without a lot of them. I think they still assume it is college and the rules and policies would not be as strict."
College Sophomore,2,Underage drinking is not tolerated and the use of illegal drugs.
College Sophomore,2,Only a hand full of classes actually challenge students and engage them in learning. Most can be breezed through without a second thought. History is the saving grace of the school as it is actually nationally ranked.
College Sophomore,2,"If you're looking to be challenged and engaged in your learning, don't come here. If you want easy classes then this is your place."
College Junior,2,Small Isn't Always Better – The school is small but that gets in the way sometimes.  It's similar to high school in the fact that it's very clique-y and it's a small enough school to have an impact.
Freshman,1,"Holy Cross college is unorganized and treats it’s students like they are in high school. The dorms cost $16,000 a year when most of them don’t even have air conditioning. I was attending the school because they had a pre med track program that I was interested in, but they terminated the program without letting anyone know. I was then told by my counselor numerous times that I was not capable of becoming a doctor and was thrown into classes that have nothing to do with a biology degree. I know several business majors who have taken biology or human biology and other science classes and I haven’t even taken one science class yet. I was very excited to be attending this school, but after a whole year it was a waste of time."
College Sophomore,1,"This grade is one that the school can't necessarily help due to the financial constraints Holy Cross is under. If you are looking for grants or fellowships to pursue research or further your academic career, they simply don't have the money to give you. Unfortunately you will find that a severe lack of funding negatively affects many departments on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"They often don't work and when they do the IT staff will be sure to run an update that ruins that. You will constantly find yourself needing to login and reauthenticate your computer with the WiFi that is always going in and out. If you need to actually do work or get much of anything done, go over to Notre Dame. Avoid St. Mary's because they have their own issues technologically as well."
College Junior,1,Difficult and Inconsistent – It's difficult to get things done with your tuition and other things.  The people who deal with the money are uptight and rude.  The school has moral standards that they choose to uphold in certain situations and to completely ignore in others.  Hard to say I enjoyed the school itself.

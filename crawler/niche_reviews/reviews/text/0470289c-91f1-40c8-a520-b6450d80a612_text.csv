Freshman,5,My online classes are great.The professors are super understanding and the try to get back to you as fast as they can. I haven't had a problem with them yet.
Freshman,5,"I’m taking a hybrid class and my professor is great!! All students are required to wear masks, we are socially distanced in the classroom. Hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes are available for use in the classroom. Hand sanitizer is available in the hallway also."
Freshman,5,The curriculum is very interesting and informative. My professor is available to answer any questions and address any issues me and my classmates face. She makes sure we wear masks and are socially distanced. There is hand sanitizer and sanitizer wipes in the classroom to make sure we are taking necessary precautions. There are signs up all over the building regarding the mask mandate and the necessary precautions to take if a student or faculty member experiences symptoms. The library staff were helpful and friendly.
Sophomore,5,So far I have taken about 15 hours online at DBU. The online classes are just about as beneficial as the in-person classes. The professors make sure to always be accessible and always have instructions available if there is any confusion. I have enjoyed my online classes and will definitely be taking more in the future through DBU.
Sophomore,5,Online school is amazing! You get to be there live or watch your classes whenever you have time. You also get to go back to anything if you missed notes and it is just like being in person!
Sophomore,5,I love the people there and the small classes and professors are amazing! Everyone there is so friendly and caring and God is the center of the university!! It’s a great school!
Freshman,5,They will treat you with respect and they are very  fun. They love to help people and they want everyone to succeed.
Freshman,5,I love it. There campus is beautiful and there professors are very kind. Dallas Baptist University is a very good school to go to.

Freshman,5,"It's a very friendly and ambient environment, the upperclassmen are very kind and Christ-like. They will help you grow in Christ during your time there."
Freshman,5,Online classes are very well handled. Meetings are frequent and are treated as normal classes and the routine is largely unchanged.
Niche User,5,"This university literally has God's hand on it. The staff are so sweet and they genuinely care about you and your well being, as well as your walk with Christ!"
Freshman,5,I absolutely love my university! Being an out of stater at what feels like an all southern kid university has been an experience. I have met some of the greatest people of my entire life. My professors are sweet and genuine and really put in the work when you ask for help. DBU has allowed me to follow my dreams of becoming an educator at the number one education program in the state of Texas. I love DBU!
Freshman,5,"I have had an amazing experience at Dallas Baptist University! I feel like I can truly connect with my professors, as well as my peers. The campus is beautiful and I am in a constant state of feeling loved and safe! I would recommend it to everyone!"
Niche User,5,Such a great place there so welcoming and is like having a new family with you .Is honestly such a great environment for students
Freshman,5,"Excellent university whose focus is on developing Christian servant leaders in any profession. Everyone I’ve come in contact with is incredibly intentional, and wants to help you succeed (especially faculty and professors)."
Junior,5,"My experience with DBU has been excellent. Although the school is a tad bit pricey, I have enjoyed every minute of my time here on campus. I have grown closer to Christ and have met some of my best friends. Other than the cost of tuition I have no complaints whatsoever and recommend this school to all who want to get a closer relationship with the Lord."
Niche User,5,"I love Dallas Baptist!! I've been there a few times; once at the Patriot Preview and I was very happy with what I saw! The student life is very active, the chapel service was beautiful, and the campus is stunning. If there is one thing I could change, I would want the dorms to be a little more roomy. They are a little bit on the tight side. However, everything else is perfect! I would definitely love to go to college here."
Sophomore,5,"Dallas Baptist University is a great college. The campus and environment on campus is amazing. The organizations, professors, and faculty have been extremely high quality in everything that I have seen, experienced and heard. Many of the best teachers and professors I have studied under have been at Dallas Baptist University. Most of the students I have met and gotten to know have been some of the kindest and most genuine people I have had the honor to meet. The professors care about students here and push every student to their best, but also care about them as individuals."
Senior,5,I absolutely love my professors! The take the time to get to know you as a person and encourage and help you along every step of your college journey. I honestly feel like the real-life experience the professors bring into the classroom are equipping me to be successful in the real world when I graduate.
Senior,5,The campus is so beautiful and everyone from the staff to the students acre true believers which makes the school very different.
Sophomore,5,"Overall, great school! Have had a blast during my time here. Professors and staff challenge you in knowledge and in spirit. I was really able to grow spiritually this past year with the guidance of my professors and friends I met. It is easy to get connected if you are willing to put in the energy and go to events."
Freshman,5,Dallas Baptist is a great christian university. There you are allowed to freely connect with God and are constantly supported by all the students and staff. The campus is beautiful and peaceful as well. The professors are all great at what they do and they all genuinely care about their students.
Graduate Student,5,DBU is a great place to excel academically surrounded by people and professors who really care. The professors really invest in you and the material you learn is applicable to real life. The campus is gorgeous and I never see trash blowing in the wind. It has a very calming presence and I believe I'm getting the best education.
Freshman,5,"Dallas Baptist is an amazing school that is overflowing with Godly faculty and staff who will do anything to help you succeed. It has a beautiful small campus where you have a for sure sense of security. If you want to go to a school where there is no stress of a ""party scene"" then this is the place. DBU patriots find better ways of having fun."
Freshman,5,"Dallas Baptist University is a true God-centered university. With DBU's theme verse being Jeremiah 29:11, ""'For I know the plans I have for you', declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future'"" truly encourages its students to live life without fear knowing that God has greater plans in store for them. With its wonderful professors and small class sizes, student-led chapels, countless student life events, service-based Greek-life organizations, and beautiful landscaping, DBU is a place that students can call not only their university, but also their home. DBU encourages its student to go out into the world and serve our brothers and sisters in Christ not only as students, but also in our professions.  It is without a doubt a college worth attending because it not only offers an exceptional education, but also an enriched life in Jesus Christ."
Freshman,5,This is a Christ-centered university and a great environment to be in. Most professors are nice and reasonable teachers. Students attend mandatory chapels every Monday and Wednesday. One of the best parts about DBU is the campus.  There are lakes everywhere and the views from the top of the hill are stunning.
Freshman,5,I really like how the welcoming is and I like the structures of the classes. Is very nice the campus is like a dream come true. I like how they accept everybody no matter what religion they are and people including the professors are very polite and nice. I like The programs that DBU offers
Sophomore,5,Dallas baptist university is a great and the best university to attend to. If you are a believer of Christ you will love how much God is included in all they do and how great they're programs are. teachers are very caring for their students and all the staff is always willing to serve and help.
Freshman,5,It’s been an amazing experience so far. The professors have been awesome and are extremely passionate as well as knowledgeable. They love Christ and are prime role models for the students to follow.
Freshman,5,"I really like the programs that they have and the welcoming everything is like a dream come true. This is my chance to be a good professional teacher, the University is big and O don’t know everyone in there but the ones that I talk they seem  very nice and friendly also I like my classes."
Niche User,5,Campus is beautiful!! All of the students and professors are nice and very welcoming!! Dorms are huge and very nice!!
Freshman,5,Dallas Baptist University is an amazing school with incredible opportunities. The staff members care about you and want you to succeed. People are constantly praying for you and you always feel loved by everyone.
Niche User,5,Amazing God bless this school. I really think the expirience was a good one this is my dream school and I would love to be part of this amazing program
Senior,5,"Dallas Baptist is an amazing college. The campus is beautiful. They have awesome events, like the tree lighting in December on campus. Everyone is friendly and helpful. I love the small classroom sizes, and online classes. The professors are easy to access and very helpful. The only thing I would like to see is more diversity. The food is amazing the have chick-fil-a, moo-yah burger, starbucks, and a cafe on campus. I especially love the Barnes N Noble book store on campus. I always feel safe on campus, I go to evening classes so the campus is well lit. DBU seems to be its own little community, I have been to to other colleges and DBU is my favorite thus far."
Junior,5,This university really helped me grow as a person. I was able to work on campus while taking classes as well. I learned a lot about my degree as well as what it was like to actually work. They really equip their students for life outside of school.
Junior,5,"Dallas Baptist University is a wonderful school with a Christ-centered atmosphere. I am a part of the education program, and all of the professors and staff in this department are very friendly and invested in the lives and careers of the students."
Senior,5,"3 Reasons Why DBU is NOT For You.


1) 
DBU is not for you if you like to
drink & party all the time. There are strict rules against alcohol on campus, which is bad for some and great for others.


2) 
You're not serious about your faith.
DBU is very serious about Christianity.
I have friends who went to TCU & SMU, both are not
Christ-centered in overall campus environment.
DBU integrates Christianity into almost every aspect 
of the univ. 

For EX: Professors begin class with prayer, most of staff is very helpful 
in guiding you to grow in your faith. Chapel is required for all students.


3)
You like big classes you can miss.
DBU is famous for small class sizes 
are very personal. You dont get to be late without anyone noticing. 
Class attendance = mandatory but you dont get marked up for being late
(Cough..UNT..cough)


BUT...

If you're serious about ur faith and growing to be the best person you can be physically, mentally and spiritually
DBU would be a perfect school for you!"
Freshman,5,I love how welcoming everyone on campus is; students and staff. Walking around campus is very uplifting due to the smiles all around. The campus chapel is beautiful and definitely the best part.
Junior,5,The campus of Dallas Baptist University is beautiful and the people are so nice. Most of the professors are excellent and really care about each student. A major downside is that there isn't a football team and not a lot of students show up to the other sporting events. Doesn't seem like there's a lot of school pride.
Sophomore,5,"I love this school! The teachers really care about you. Sometimes school feels like ""camp"", but you will never feel more loved!"
Freshman,5,"My experience was amazing !! My professors were incredibly helpful , they treated me like family . I learned so many valuable lessons from them . I created wonderful friendships that will last lifelong . The entire staff and school makes you feel welcomed , wanted and loved !"
Senior,5,I love it here. Professors truly care about you as a human and take the time to get to know you outside of an academic stance.
Senior,5,The school is beautiful and the professors are very passionate about the courses they teach.  Being able to discuss our Christian views was great and overall this has been a great experience.  I've met some smart and talented people during my journey here.  If you have to take Literature make sure you take Professor Leigh Hickman she's the best I loved her class.
Junior,5,The professors are very involved and committed to seeing students succeed.  They are available through multiple outlets for questions or concerns.
Niche User,5,"My Experience with Dallas Baptist so far has been exceptional, I am going to attend the University in the fall to study and play soccer and I'm super excited! The campus is gorgeous with first class facilities, all the coaches that I've met are great as well as the professors and the all around feeling I get when I'm on campus is amazing. The students there have been super helpful to me with any questions I've had so far and seem like great people that I can't wait to be around for the next four years. All in all Dallas Baptist University is a lovely place with a great campus and even better people and I'm super excited I picked them to be the place I spend the next four years at."
Niche User,5,I went on a college and the campus was beautiful. It was also a sunny day that day so you could really see the beauty in the sunlight. The tour guides were very nice and gave us the full Dallas Baptist experience. And the fact that it’s religious and moral based lets me know that they are more than a college. I totally recommend going on a tour.
Junior,5,"It has such a positive atmosphere. Blessed to be here. My initial goal was nursing. But, after taking psychology classes based off of a Christian environment, I absolutely fell in love with this school."
Niche User,5,"Great environment that promotes spiritual growth. The faculty and staff are there for you. Everyone wants to see you succeed in your Christian walk, academics, and life."
Freshman,5,"Very beautiful campus . People are friendly EVERYWHERE ! And a very very very safe environment, security everywhere . And teachers make sure you get the help you need ."
Niche User,5,"While I visited Dallas Baptist University, the staff made me feel like it was already my home away from home. The campus is big, but the staff do not treat you like you are just a number. They want you succeed in every way possible. In my search for my perfect college I found that DBU is the best place not just for my academics but it is not so far away from home that I will get homesick. The bad apart attending such a big university is that it can get overwelming at times. A small town girl like myself is not used to the city life yet. But with the help of my fellow peers and teachers, I know that my home away from home can be perfect."
Niche User,5,"I went to a camp during the summer of 2017 for student athletes and I have to say I was really impressed with the school. Although I was just visiting for that week, I felt like I was a part of the school. I was staying in the dorms and actually walking around the campus, and sometimes wander off to walk around and admire the view. The buildings are just gorgeous and the fact that I got to get a taste of what my mother saw when she went to DBU. I would definitely  consider going here in the future."
Junior,5,"Dallas Baptist is an extremely Christain school. One should know this when applying to this campus. I grew up in the church and have practice the Christain religion my entire life. After 19 years, it is easy for one to naively think that they know all there is to know about something. That is kind of what I thought about Christainity. But of course, I was very wrong and if you decide to go to Dallas Baptist University you will gain an extraordinary ability to grow in your faith."
Junior,5,"Dallas Baptist University is a great school that has a lot to offer. First of all, it is one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen and not many campuses can compare to the beauty of their campus. They have a ton of high-quality programs that are well respected all around the world and their Professors are very kind and they are very willing to help answer any questions you have. On multiple occasions, I have been able to ask my Professors for clarification or help on a project and they have helped me succeed every time I needed help. The Student Life on campus is excellent as well. There are so many incredible people who love God and are very friendly towards everyone they meet. It makes for a great atmosphere and allows me to feel at home when I am on campus. It is an expensive school and there is not much around campus unless you drive a bit, but it is an excellent school and I am proud to be a student a Dallas Baptist University."
Senior,5,"Going to DBU has been one of the greatest decisions I ever made. I am receiving a great, Christ-centered education from faculty who really care about me. The students are friendly and it is unlike any college I have ever been to or heard about."
Junior,5,I transferred into DBU this past fall semester and so far it has been a great experience. I have made many friends that share my same values. There are many ways to get involved on campus and other programs.
Graduate Student,5,I have been blessed to receive three degrees from DBU.  My most memorable moment is seeing how Christ-centered the entire college is.
Sophomore,5,"DBU is Home! The people are so welcoming, the atmosphere is so relaxing, and the campus is gorgeous!! DBU is a Christ centered school, that desires and helps their student's strive to seek the Lord not just in school, but their future careers. Attending DBU allows me to gain a Christ Centered education that will one day advance my career in Christian Counseling!"
Sophomore,5,The campus is breathing taking. The professors are wonderful and willing to work with you on everything!
Graduate Student,5,"This was not my first choice for school, but I am so glad I came here! The campus is BEAUTIFUL, the teachers and staff are all so amazing and nice, and the whole atmosphere is great."
Junior,4,"I love Dallas Baptist University. For a private, non-party school, they have a ton of wholesome events that bring the student body together. Although I transferred into DBU, I can see the way the professors want you to succeed! I wish that the student body was more diverse in terms of ethnicity and socio-economic status, but I believe that over time that will come to pass! Overall, this is a great private university to get your undergrad/master's degree at."
Junior,4,"Although I am going into my first semester with DBU in 2021, I can tell that the online programs are organized and efficient at this university. Online can seem unappealing for hands-on learners (which I am), but to see the layout of the online classes offered, I feel at ease taking them. Also, there are a lot of tutoring opportunities for students at DBU, so if you are struggling with screen learning, there's always a person to help you out!"
Freshman,4,DBU looks amazing the gardening staff does a great job maintaining the campus. Some of the dorms and bathrooms need to be updated. The food has room for improvement. But the people are amazing and they care so much. You can't just help to smile.
Graduate Student,4,The atmosphere was conducive to learning; instructors care for students and encourage the best from the students; support staff are  stellar and professional
Graduate Student,4,The online experience was top-notched. The communication was fluid and timely. Courses directions and instructions were clear and executable.
Sophomore,4,I love DBU. The staff and faculty are so welcoming and want to help with anything that you need. The classes are hard but also help each individual gain more knowledge about the subjects. The school is very Christ-centered and incorporates that into each and every class. The only downside about DBU is how strict the school is. I feel that sometimes they treat us as kids rather than college adults. Other than that I have no complaints about DBU and would highly recommend it to incoming college students.
Senior,4,"they make you feel welcomed and at home. 

no engineering so the stem programs could use more revamping and harder course"
Senior,4,Online classes were as great as they are in lecture. I have taken three online courses and they were all great!
Freshman,4,"Haven't taken any classes yet, will start this fall. I am excited to start both classes on campus and classes online."
Freshman,4,"It's an overall great school, but it's very expensive. This may seem a little shallow, but the campus provided food is not good at all and the dorms aren't too great and are sometimes shared between 3 people"
Alum,4,"Stated above, ""High Christian Values aren't for everyone.""  This is true.  But, I am not Christian and attended.  I lived in the Dallas area and felt the very best education I could receive was from here.  I was right.  One of my undergraduate degrees was in Biblical Studies and I graduated in 2009.  My professors were very intellectual and promoted inquiry and critical thinking.  Teaching was presented fully and unbiased.  I had one professor tell us that the story of Noah's Ark and the flood is present in many religions, most before the time of Christianity and the Bible.  He told us if we are to follow a religion to think about it, understand the good and the bad, and know what we think.  It was not blindly.  We also delved into other religions, especially in our World Religions class.  If you want to learn to think critically, have excellent and knowledgeable instructors who are open to the growth of each student, and be kind no matter what one believes, this is the place."
Senior,4,I love dbu. High Christian values that aren't for everyone. A lot of people transfer but the school itself has the best professors you will ever meet. I have made so many personal connections and this school has changed me for the better.
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful and the staff is extremely helpful. Everyone is so friendly and personable. I loved attending chapel and worshiping with everyone on campus. The reason I chose to go to DBU is because of the baseball team, chapel, and their partnership with Baylor Medical for nursing students. DBU IS HOME!"
Sophomore,4,Tuition is really expensive. But if you're able to find the money i believe its worth it. The faculty seem to really care about your success.
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity of the different people on campus. I enjoy the size of the campus and you can recognize pretty much everyone even the people you do not personally know. I love how the professors actually try to get to know each of their students and you are not just a face in a crowd or a number on a list.
Niche User,4,I liked how clean the campus was. It was all very well organized and everyone was polite.The campus itself is very pretty and well collected. Doesn't seem like a party school which is a good thing for students so they can focus more on their academics.
Niche User,4,Dallas Baptist University is a very beautiful campus. It has a lot majors and minors to choose from.The student body is very nice and welcoming when you first visit.
Sophomore,4,"I love DBU and the community it attracts. I enjoy how Christ-centered this campus and how beautiful it is. I'm thankful for the professor who truly cares about their students. Our school President is truly so kind and pours his heart into the school. Our first day of moving onto campus, our school President was helping students move into their dorms. This school encourages loving the Lord, serving, and growing knowledge and friendships."
Freshman,4,"Very beautiful campus, great education, and amazing community. A lot of rules & definitely a Baptist university"
Niche User,4,"Loved this for my daughter! Beautiful campus but near city and interstate. Great financial aid. She loved her profs and the dorm. Good baseball :) Dislikes - she didnt finish because she didn't want to go into debt and we couldn't help her anymore. She only needed $2000/ semester. If they would have allowed her to live at home she probably could have done this. Also I had hoped that maybe her Department could find some kind of stipend for her to finish it out but they couldn't - they wanted to keep her though, just not bad enough. Also heard that a young lady was sexually accosted and it was hidden from the rest of the campus. I get that you don't want to cause a scare but the other young ladies at least needed to know about it so they knew to be more wary when they're out jogging in certain places. That said, light at night jogging alone is probably not a good idea ladies. Although maybe security has been increased since then this was a few years ago."
Freshman,4,"Dallas Baptist University is a truly unique place, not only in it's colonial-inspired aesthetic but also in its enriching atmosphere. The school itself offers a wonderful education with professors who actually care about their students. The emphasis on a Christ-centered life is the best quality of this campus because it's so hard to find a genuine Christian college. Really the only thing Dallas Baptist could improve on is it's acceptance rate, because if they keep growing at the rate their going it will become far too crowded on that hill."
Niche User,4,"Well I haven't visited the campus yet, but I have decided to attend next fall. I have heard amazing things about the school and the people and I cannot wait to experience it myself."
Graduate Student,4,"I have been a student at DBU since 2011. I have enjoyed my time there, and I am thankful for the staff and faculty that have supported my journey. My only complaint would be that most professors have been there too long, and there is nothing new to their lectures or teaching techniques. Many do not know how to use technology in the classroom, and have not updated their required books in twenty years."
Niche User,4,They are very informative and have a  Beautiful campus. The student life is great and close to a large city
Senior,4,Dallas Baptist university is really good private institution that makes you feel like part of the family. Dallas Baptist University is a Christ Center school that pushes you to get to Lord and to always put God first in all aspect of your life. One thing that i do not like about the university is the lack scholarship opportunities. Scholarships are very limited for the money that you pay.
Sophomore,4,"Overall a good Christian school. However, everyone looks the same. Not much diversity. Can seem like people are a little stuck up if you are different and fit into the picture perfect person. The professors are nice but if you do not have to stay on campus do not. It is not worth the money and does not let them trick you by saying you will lose the Christain leadership scholarship. It is basically a wash and pays just for the dorm and food."
Sophomore,4,"Honestly, this is one of the best schools I could have chosen to attend. It is a perfect balance in so many ways between academics, student life, campus scenery, and culture. A vast majority of the students and staff are wonderful people who make great lifelong friends and mentors. While the smaller campus size at DBU may not be for everyone, it more than makes up for it in every other aspect."
Junior,4,"I've found two major downsides to DBU. Cost, and space. Cost makes sense because it's a PRIVATE university, so it WILL be expensive. And housing space is low, which doesn't make much sense considering how much land DBU has. BUT, other than these two things (cost also including some wonky things with the rent pricing) DBU is an amazing school. All of my professors that I've had truly care about each of their students, make a point to learn your name, and want you to succeed, so they're willing to help you. The people here are wonderful and the campus is beautiful. The classes (most of them) are Christ-centered and many professors pray before and/or after class. I love this university and it's been a blessing receiving the quality education you get for the price you pay. Plus we have D1 Baseball in a D2 school and it's my favorite sport, so it's a really good past-time."
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus, it is a very beautiful campus. As soon as you walk on the campus you can feel the Holy Spirit radiating off of it. Everyone is very friendly, and you are able to make friends very quickly."
Niche User,4,"Everyone is very welcoming and as a senior in High School, my visit made me feel like I was home. I really love how everything is centered around Christ and how willing the professors are in putting an effort in your success. I really see Dallas Baptist as an amazing school."
Graduate Student,4,The majority of DBU professors work with students to ensure their knowledge and understanding of the material. Most all of the professors have had prior work experience or currently working in the field of study.
Sophomore,4,"From the moment I applied as a transfer student, DBU made the process very easy and welcoming. I am grateful for their support in that process as well as helping find grants and scholarships. I would like to see communication between staff and students to improve. There were so many changes in staff, that it made it hard to keep up with. At one point I was not aware that my advisor had retired."
Freshman,4,"After my first visit to DBU I knew I would love attending the school to get my degree. Its distance from home, student size, and Kinesiology program fit perfectly into what I wanted. The university has thousands of students yet it feels small enough to be like a community and just run into people you know constantly. In the few short months I've been here on campus I have made the best memories and have gained more insight and academic material than I expected."
Sophomore,4,Definitely a positive experience here so far. The professors are very personal. Some of the programs are not very good but for the most part they are good. The university definitely needs to put more of its money into the students education rather than into stupid programs or architecture.
Alum,4,Great university! I wouldn't be pursuing my masters and doctorate if I had not attended and graduated here. Private tuition costs make attending this university fairly hard to maintain. Would like to see affordability of attendance be a bit more realistic.
Alum,4,DBU is a great university. The teachers there are absolutely wonderful. The Christ-centered education makes school a lot more enjoyable and it helps you grow in your faith along with getting an top tier degree from a quality university.
Sophomore,4,"I have made some of the best friends I've ever had at DBU. The campus is very safe, and there's a lot to do in Dallas. The annual traditions like Mr. Big Chief and the Christmas Tree Lighting are really fun. Would recommend!"
Freshman,4,I am a freshman at Dallas Baptist University. My first semester there has been very enjoyable. The professors are very nice and they do well implementing Christian values and beliefs in their lectures. Something that I think would better the DBU experience is if they had more upbeat contemporary worship songs during chapel.
College Sophomore,4,It's pretty safe. The police our nice but ask qustions
College Sophomore,4,DBU's campus is amazing but people are people.
College Senior,4,Every semester the school has prospective employers to come out and have a job fair for students on campus. The school has the job fairs to help to stuent to successfully find gainful employment.
College Senior,4,Students at my school help to make the sporting events fun and support their fellow schoolmates.
College Senior,4,"I would choose my school again, because it is where I got my bachelor's from and it has helped me to become more knowledgeable of the Bible. My school works with my schedule which is great too."
College Freshman,4,Coaches are fair and also encourage athletes to preform their best and always use uplifting words.
College Freshman,4,"I am not sure about the courses and professors yet because I have not taken my classes yet. The variety of courses provided are great. The classes provided are diverse and the class style and sizes seem to be the right size for the amount of students attending DBU. The campus is beautiful, the students and staff are very helpful in lending a hand."
College Freshman,4,"I may not know too much about DBU but from what I know, students will prosper after graduating from this school. The school offers many job opportunities which helps the students experience real life jobs. The student career prospects seem very secure and leading to advancement. The value of a degree from this school is very beneficial because students learn quickly and excel in their subjects. The alumni at DBU are able to share great testimonies which I believe will change the lives of others who are experiencing similar hardships. The employers are very lenient when it comes to recruiting. The employers are always open to new recruitment. The quality of the career center and services are great! The staff is so helpful, not only with careers, but also supportive with signing up for classes. I am so blessed to have been able to get accepted into this school."
College Freshman,4,"The students at DBU are very active I sports. Baseball seems to be the main sport and they have great players. There are many different sports that many students participate in. Through the sports, the team players learn team work and bond like a family. The fan support is great. The school spirit is fun and loving because there is no judgment."
College Freshman,4,My registration process to DBU has been great. The staff at this school are very supportive and do the best they can to make the process go smoothly and quickly. I could not have asked for a better school to attend.
College Freshman,4,"Nightlife, is pretty chill. Sure, they have events here and there, but a lot of the fun stuff happens in the evening when everyone is ""done"" with homework/classes/work. Nighttime is when all the fun stuff is just ending. 

If you want a nightlife, you would definitely check out the city (which is right across the tollway, on the opposite side of Mountain Creek Lake). It'll give you lots of options as far as bars and clubs, and even more cool stuff. The only downer is that curfew is at 12am. If you're not back at 12, don't bother coming back at all, unless you want to get a firm disciplinary option."
College Freshman,4,"DBU provides an excellent educational experience. You never leave a class uneducated, you never feel isolated as a student, and your professors are just as involved in the class as you are."
College Freshman,4,"DBU consists of mostly white, Texan, undergraduate, christian students. 

They're still open and loving to all races, ethnics, nationalities, and religions.

No one is crazy judgmental when it comes to sexuality. They don't endorse homosexuality, but they are kind and respectful to all people, regardless of their life choices."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Dallas Baptist University are awesome! They really know how to keep their students fit! Also, since the school is built on a large hill, there a stairs built everywhere which is perfect for walking off the freshman 15 everywhere you go!"
College Sophomore,4,The professors are amazing.  They take an interest in their students.  The courses are not too difficult.
College Sophomore,4,DBU is becoming a more respected university every year.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy working out here.
College Sophomore,4,I think it's a great school.
College Junior,4,"I love the professors. They're top notch and what makes DBU great. The courses, for the most part, are pretty great too! The class sizes are mostly small so there's a lot of interaction which is great."
College Junior,4,"DBU does a lot to make sure its students graduate prepared for a job. They do this by requiring volunteer hours, hosting so many career fairs, and placing important people in your life."
College Junior,4,"I love living on campus! If I didn't, it'd be hard to have much of a social life. The dorms aren't the best, but they're also not the worst. The closets are super spacious which makes up for less than spacious rooms. The apartments are great! They've got an awesome kitchen with everything you could want in it - although they are a little small. There are two bathrooms which is nice though. And we have access to swimming pools and the gym, so that's grand. Townhomes are the next level up - they've got more space for more people. And the Brownstones are just plain beautiful. They're the most expensive because they're the nicest."
College Junior,4,"It's based on service. Each sorority has a place where they volunteer. There are also lots of Greek life activities which are really fun! We've got musicals, sporting events, concerts, and more."
Alum,2,"The education is excellent. But for a Christian university, their prices are sky high, and they offer little in the way of financial aid. With brand new buildings and monuments to their sports program, new stadiums, one wonders what they value. The student or the appearance of the campus?  As a Christian program, one would hope that they would value the students and getting as many students who want it a good education, when it is within their means. They are not currently doing that. I was treated with disrespect when I told them I didn't want student loans, they scoffed and laughed and asked how else I thought I would pay for their program."
Sophomore,2,"Very great place to learn spiritually, but Super expensive and a lot of mess up towards the student financial acccount"
College Sophomore,2,Random horrible roommates and crappy laundry rooms
College Freshman,2,I say it's bad because I had a professor that just flat out wasnt good. I have a lot of friends that can back me up too. He just wasn't a good teacher at all.
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty bad, I think it's dumb, but that's just my opinion they don't do anything big. They don't even have parties."
College Junior,2,No one goes to any of the games. The school is in desperate need of better facilities and a football team.
College Junior,2,"The professors are great and truly want to help, but that does not outweigh the plethora of bad qualities. Though DBU is a pretty campus, there is nothing around it. There is no social life on campus. The various housing on campus is lacking. We pay so much in housing payments that we should at least be able to have our own rooms rather than being forced to share a small room with 2 other people. Another downside to DBU layout is that there is always a fight for parking. The meal options on-campus are poor, especially at the cafeteria. DBUs ridiculous rule about mandatory chapel all four years and the chapel make up if one does not meet the high requirements is absolutely absurd. By attending a private university, one expects to pay a higher tuition for the quality. In this case, DBU does a poor job at helping those who are less fortunate find funds to attend the university. From what they promote, one would expect much more help. If one does not receive the Christian Leadership Scholarship, which one can only apply for once, there is not many more options for scholarship opportunities."
College Junior,2,"DBU is very isolated, so you have to drive a while to get somewhere, and the closest places to eat are chain food restaurants."
College Freshman,2,"DBU is stuck in between Fort Worth and Dallas. One has to drive 10-15min either way to hit food, as DBU is an isolated closed campus. I often end up in the UTA or SMU area for food."
College Freshman,2,"The male dorms are gross. The laundry rooms are always disgusting, at least one washing machine will be broken at all times, and there are constantly guys taking other guy's laundry out of the machine and either throwing it on the floor or just leaving it wet on top of the machine. Both of the guys dorms are roach infested, and so is one of the girl's dorms. Spence is the only decent to above par dorm on campus, but it is solely meant for girls."
College Junior,2,"You will end up eating the same thing over anf over again. Paying a lot of money for a very bad quality of food. Hope you have insurance, because there are possibilities of having food poisoning at least once a year."
College Junior,2,Continue to ask for information and have had to turn in information twice.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not good. There's never anything to do unless you drive to downtown Dallas, Austin, or most of the students get together and drive to the Choctaw casino in Oklahoma. Nothing close. Except for an outlet mall...or going to see a Texas Rangers game."
College Freshman,2,"I hope you don't want to eat on campus after 3 on Saturdays or at all on Sunday's. DBU is a small school, so I understand the limited options, but keep stuff open longer! I shouldn't have only the cafeteria to eat at on weekends."
College Freshman,2,Only income-based. Few schols. unless parents poor
College Freshman,2,"Everyone's the same, easy to make friends I guess."
College Freshman,2,DBU needs some more school spirit.
College Freshman,2,Not much goes down at DBU past 9 PM
College Senior,2,"Since our campus is on a hill, the wind is ridiculous and worse than anywhere else in the metroplex. Also whenever there is ice, it is extremely dangerous to leave campus due to all the hills."
College Senior,2,They shut down majority of the main parking lot for commuters and DO NOT tell them when they are going to do so. There are more and more students and less and less parking. It is becoming a real issue.
Freshman,1,"I attended DBU as a Freshman and quickly transferred out. The diversity was non-existent, the school activities were a joke, we were treated as children, the racism was BLATANT and for a Christian school, that's upsetting. We reported multiple racist incidents to staff with various amounts of physical proof and nothing was ever done. The students were snobby, fake and would crucify you for not participating in chapel but in the same breath, be passed around for the athletic teams. It was all very hypocritical. Me and my friends were racially profiled by security and threatened to be kicked out for taking a walk around campus at night. I had a professor compare my skin color to thier home appliances, purposely show my assignments to the class without my permission to mock my work and belittle me in class to the point OTHER students had to report them to the director of the department. DBU really messed with my mental and if anyone ever ask for my opinion on attending, it's stay away."
Freshman,1,I actually did not take any classes online myself but I had friends that did are their classes were anything but smooth learning. They had the same issue that alot of students have: you teach yourself.
Junior,1,"One word: Fowl. Disgusting male teachers in the science dept with sly sexist comments during lectures as well as pure neglect when it comes to advising. There are a few amazing teachers, but not enough to stay. They’re out for your money and don’t give a dang about their students. As a woman, I never felt heard. I was told I should stay in the kitchen because my grades were not great by a professor. Student workers seem to be pulling a push door. I came in a dedicated Christ follower, I left being scared to step back into church. I know Jesus loves me, but that was not reflected by a single staff member at DBU. (Minus a few) Hold on tight to your money, do not expect much from this university."
Senior,1,"I'm very unhappy at this school and I've been since day one. This place will cover up incidents to maintain their perfect image which is dangerous and dishonest. They will make the victim feel as though they're at fault. The upper administration and campus police are wolves in sheep's clothing and will cover up anything with a lie even though they're Christians. I attended a non religious based community college before going here and let me say this: they have a better grasp of morals than this evil place. Anyone who sees this review, this school is not what you think. Throwing baptist in the name is bait for naive newcomers. This school is especially not for minorities, but for conservatives with static perspectives. Please do your research and by leaving this review I'm doing my duty to help with that. I've met other black students who left here because they see and know what I see and know. I also see other people who give one star and they're not lying."
Freshman,1,"I will be giving you the most honest review of DBU you will ever hear. I personally hate it and will be transferring at the end of my first semester. I am a Christian, but let me tell you they are not playing about ""christ centered learning"" such as in my first week all five of my professors had some form of an antiabortion rant. I have so many horror stories I can't even list them all from a chapel speaker calling all hispanics ""rapists and drug dealers"" to an entire month's curriculum titled ""the evils of homosexuals."" Every single Christian conservative stereotype is evident here and I have heard some of the most ignorant and hateful things come out of the professors and students mouths. Every class is integrated with heavy religious undertones (even in something like math?!?) I feel like I am getting a theology degree by force. Simple as this, if you go to church every Sunday, are EXTREMELY conservative, and love Trump go to DBU, if not run away!"
Senior,1,"If you're looking for a good education without going bankrupt then DBU is not the place for you. The cashier's office and financial aid will screw you over and do everything in their power to make you pay for their mistakes. Some of the teachers truly do care about you and because of that I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 star but some of the worst teachers I've ever seen teach at DBU and make me think to myself ""I paid three credit hours for this???"" Chapels are a hit and miss because sometimes DBU gets crazy people to give crazy sermons. And a lot of the people are shallow and self obsessed hypocrites. This is the most expensive church camp you'll ever go to. Plus the food is terrible, Sodexo does all catering and runs every food outlet on campus even the CHIC FIL A (which is obviously a sin)."
Senior,1,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time here but the way this university handles certain situations, especially those having to do with TITLE IX situations. They always want to brush everything under a rug and treat victims like its their fault and not the predator because they're afraid of something ruining their ""perfect"" image. To me, that's  horrible, if you're a parent think about that how would you feel if your daughter is getting sexually harassed at work, she reports it to her higher ups and they do nothing.. instead they deny all reports and LIE, to cover up for that person who is at fault.. what a shame honestly. This and for a couple other reasons I would never recommend this university. This school cares more about their image and money than the wellbeing of their students."
College Junior,1,"DBU parties are non-existent, and I'm actually glad."
College Freshman,1,"It's a joke. Those who take part in Greek Life here are the most inauthentic people on campus. They think they are the s***, and are too oblivious to the fact that most people hate them. They don't party, but carry themselves as if they do. The Greek Life isn't even nationally recognized. It's just a bunch of sheltered Baptists who think they're B.A. by joining Greek Life, but have absolutely no clue as to what Greek Life actually looks like at a typical college."
College Freshman,1,"Nothing happens on campus. The craziest it will get will be people drinking in the town homes, but the groups that do this are highly exclusive. The campus is full of highly religious students who don't know how to have fun, even clean fun that doesn't involve alcohol or drugs. It's literally dead on the weekends, and a majority of people go home on the weekends."
College Freshman,1,"The caf rarely has food that is edible. Most of the time we'll walk in and opt for cereal as our meal as either we can't figure out what the food is that is being served or it just is simply gross. The utensils will always be dirty, and the cups and plates are regularly dirty as well. Once in a blue moon will there be something that one can eat multiple servings of."
College Junior,1,"You can not do anything in this school unless it benefits the staff. Your not allowed to have guys in your dorm past visitation hours, but we all know girls sneak guys in their windows if you live in thr first floor, or like I have experienced a dorm mate have a guy over at night."
College Freshman,1,Rushes categorized from cool to zeros.  Placed accordingly
College Freshman,1,This is Backpack U.   No on-campus social scene.
College Senior,1,"Well, its Dallas, you shouldn't expect to have good public transportation options. You honestly will need a car to survive."
College Junior,1,"This is no Greek housing. ""Greek life"" on campus is not like it is on other campuses. Most people that are involved are preppy. No one really cares about it. The guys in Greek life are the annoying kind of preppy that you would not want to associate with."
College Junior,1,"Doing anything on campus is prohibited. They will search your room if they think you are doing drugs. There is a good percentage of students that drink, some smoke. Nothing really beyond that."
College Junior,1,There is not enough dorm space. The dorms that they do have are very old and have mold in the walls and the water from the pipes smells bad. You might get sick from drinking it. Once you become a sophomore or higher you have to live in the on-campus apartments. They are also old and in terrible condition. They charge too much money and are a hassle to try to get enough people to live in the apartment. More often than not you will end up living with at least one person that you don't know and its stressful. The office in charge of it is not well-run or managed. Most offices on campus are like this because the majority of the staff are students and students make many mistakes.
College Junior,1,"The school is on a hill, so when the fall comes or winter, cars going up the hill, slide back."
College Freshman,1,Main campus parking get full to capacity during peak class hours.

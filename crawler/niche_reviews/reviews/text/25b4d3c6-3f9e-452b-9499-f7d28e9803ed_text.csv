Freshman,5,Even though it only my first year hear I will say the school has been very welcoming and helpful towards not only the freshman but with everyone that is in there school. They always want to make sure your in a good mindset and that we can do it. Even though classes can be stressful at times and sometimes paying tuition could be a bit confusing at first once you get the hang of things at St Jospehs you’ll enjoy it. It’s small I’m a nice neighborhood in downtown Brooklyn and overall if you are looking at colleges for really any major check this school out. :)
Freshman,5,Saint Jospehs is definitely a college everyone should look into in terms of academics and how resourceful they are. I am currently a freshman and already within the first week they made everyone feel welcomed and it’s such a nice environment to be in. It’s in a great neighborhood in downtown Brooklyn and overall getting use to college life for everyone it can take longer for others but in the end it is absolutely  worth it to come here.
Sophomore,5,"This year my first online experience with St. Joseph College and honestly this school is just so great in providing their student with assistance, academic or emotionally help to make online successful for every student. They are connect with me through out the online learning, so I don't give up."
Graduate Student,5,St. Joseph's College really cares about their students. They go above and beyond to ensure all students are taken care of.
Freshman,5,The professors here are amazing. They care deeply about the students. There are a variety of classes in each subject and the students there are extremely kind. You would feel very welcomed here.
Sophomore,5,It is a good school if you want to see something on campus you are able to try and get it on campus.
Senior,5,I would like to see more scholarships offered for academics for diverse and minority or unrepresented class. The main focus seems to be on sports.
Junior,5,I love the diversity and safety of the college. The professors are amazing and the environment is very pleasant.
Junior,5,Really great school! Small and the professors really care and connect with their students. My peers are all super friendly and the campus is small and it's easy to get around.
Alum,5,"Loved the family feel of the school. I wouldn't have traded this campus for the world. I was able to make friends who were commuters to the school, yet I stayed off campus at educational housing. The extracurricular activities as well as the academic classes were absolutely phenomenal. There were opportunities to grow as an individual as well as a community. I was even able to join a sorority. I played Volleyball, was committed to the sorority and was in plays and musicals while attending SJC. This gave me so many opportunities and opened so many doors to my future career path."
Niche User,5,Amazing area and located well in Brooklyn! Such a nice neighborhood and I feel safe when I'm around the campus and dorms.
Freshman,5,"St. Joseph's college is a very small school which gives me, personally, the advantage of knowing my professors and creating a teacher-student bond. The campus is very friendly. My fellow classmates are very supportive and helpful. My professors take the time to listen and answer all questions with joy and patience. The professors also, enthusiastically,  make sure that all students understand the learning concepts. Overall, an adjective that describes St.Joseph's College would be: boosterish."
College Junior,5,Our new Hill Center is amazing!
College Junior,5,"As I enter my Junior year, I can't believe that I am half way finished with my college career. Even though I am happy to be getting closer to my dream job as a teacher. It is also bittersweet to think that I will soon be leaving a place I have made my home. This year I am dedicating myself to become more involved in the college. So far I have been part of the orientation team, and I am president of the Child Study Club."
College Junior,5,I will obtain my career.
College Junior,5,All the things I want.
College Freshman,5,I feel secure. The security around campus does an excellent job in keeping us safe
College Freshman,5,"The class sizes are just like high school. I enjoy the fact that the professors can help students one on one, they are very helpful and have lots of pride in their profession"
College Freshman,5,While the workload in some classes are very heavy the professors are very flexible if something comes up and a work assignment is late.
College Freshman,5,The security on campus is very alert and they are very good at helping students.
College Junior,5,I feel comfortable attending. Everyone is so nice.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors are very fair. They give you outlines for the upcoming exams, two weeks prior. All you have to do is come to class everyday, take good notes, study them, and understand the full course lecture to do well on the exams and to do well in the class."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Women make up more an half the schools student theory and staff. However, the men on campus are nice and helpful. There are many different races and ethnicities, but many people have a Italian background. There are also many people with different sexual orientations. You will never feel left out at St. Joseph's because it's a big melting pot of different people who are very open minded and friendly."
Recent Alumnus,5,I have never came across a student or faculty member using alcohol or drugs on campus. I never heard of anyone getting kicked out because of drugs of alcohol. The host seminars that teach students alcohol and drug abuse. .
College Senior,5,I met some of my best friends at college. I wouldn't trade it for anything. I love going to school
College Freshman,5,"So far so good, i love all the classes i am taking"
College Junior,5,I've seen absolutely no drinking or use of drugs from any of the students of St. Joseph's College.  
College Junior,5,"St. Joseph's College is surrounded by cafes, delis, Asian restaurants, vegetarian restaurants, diners, and bagel shops, just to name a few. With DeKalb Avenue on one side leading to downtown Brooklyn, and Myrtle Avenue on the other taking you further into Fort Green/Clinton Hill (which is also Pratt Institute territory), I'm always finding more options for food. And, surprisingly (given that we're in NYC), it's often quite cheap."
College Junior,5,All computers work effiecient and face past.
College Senior,5,The academics at St Josephs college is very challenging.  The experience teachers will go out of their way to help student succeed.
College Senior,5,"St Joseph college takes academics very seriously and has an excellent reputation with employers as well as other colleges.  The curriculum is challenging but if you dedicate yourself, you will be prepared for the job market."

College Junior,5,The majors at St. Joe's offer a wide variety. There are several education majors being that it is predominantly an education school.
College Junior,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus. The campus security does a great job.
College Sophomore,5,"Everything you are taught seems to be aligned with the major so in that respect, I give them an A+."
College Sophomore,5,I would rate St. Joseph's college with an A+ because the professors there are all motivated in seeing you succeed.  Your education is their number one priority.  Kudos
College Freshman,5,The student on campus are all friendly and everyone is willing to help one another.
Recent Alumnus,5,The students at St. Joseph's College were too involved with their studies to partake in any drugs.
College Freshman,5,"This college is willing to get every student involved with the activities available. There's always something to do! Everyone is able to join a sport, a club, a study group and even off campus activities. There's something for everyone; whether they've been in an extra curricular activity in high school or not, students have the opportunity. This school is also willing to make it fun for students who need a stress reliever from classes."
College Sophomore,5,"The academics at St. Joseph's College are outstanding.  Most of the professors are fantastic.  They love their job, they are extremely knowledgeable and can answer any question a student may have for them.  Also, the professors are very enthusiastic about the subject they teach, which encourages me to want to learn about the topics myself.  The workload is that of any normal college.  It is a lot of work, but you get through it, and when the semester is over, it does not seem like so much."
Senior,4,St Joes is a small school located in the city. There is many different things to do around the school. The dorms are located in dumbo right by the promenade which has awesome views of the Brooklyn bridge and the city. Food choices near the school are endless but on campus food pricing for the quality of food isn't that good. One positive is that you can order almost anything you want at the on campus food location.  The professors at the school are very helpful and small class sizes make it so that you connect better with your professors. Athletics seems to be very promising the only negative is that outdoor sports use facilities not on campus so fans have to travel in order to watch games.
Sophomore,4,"My experience is just top of the world because this school is not small, it provide student with tremendous to grow and become your own future hero."
Freshman,4,"Really affordable and welcoming environment from the students. The honors program is not necessary as you can still graduate with honors without being in the program, only plus is the free credit which helps with saving money but it's already super affordable. I like the campus, but dorms are off campus, you can use the provided shuttle or take the train to go back. The dorms are in a good place in comparison to NY but stupid in terms of school vicinity. School food is alright, the lunchroom is small and the whole campus is just made of old homes. It's good enough but no one knows about this school. Plus there are security guards rather than access cards, so you could fake it and they'll let you in..."
Freshman,4,Academically best colleges and return on investment. Room and board of the campus is very pleasant with safe and sound environment. Professors are well experienced. St. Joseph's College offers online degree programs to make it as simple & convenient as possible to get your degree
Junior,4,St. Joseph's College is good college. There are multiple activities that you can do on campus. You stick with classmates within the major that you are studying.
Graduate Student,4,I just started my master's program at this school and I must admit that it has been a great experience so far. The student/ faculty atmosphere feels more intimate because it's a small school. The classes have been a pleasure to be in. The professors have been extremely helpful in making sure we learn the materials. I recommend this school to others.
Niche User,4,I am a incoming freshmen student and i really like the school size here as well as the hospitality here and much more.
Freshman,4,"The financial aid office and counselors could have been more helpful, but overall, my classes were engaging and I had a decent education."
Niche User,4,"I loved the athletic center, the nuring classrooms, and even loved all the people. There is security everywhere to keep the student safe. The dorms also offer a varsity of supplies such as a refrigerator and microwave that students do not need to bring. They offer various ways to transport from the dorms to the college, since the dorms are off campus."
Sophomore,4,I really liked the small class sizes. It makes you feel more one on one with the professor and if you need assistance with anything there is always someone there to help.
Senior,4,"The class sizes are really small. They encourage student involvement. The professors are always willing to help and are there for students. They offer a lot of scholarships, therefore making college more affordable. They tend to be very understanding of student situations as long as you are willing to reach out to them. There is really good security and I always feel safe while there. It is easy to get to. They have connections with a lot of outside resources."
Graduate Student,4,My time at St Joseph's College changed my world view. I have been very fortunate to have great professors who are invested ad know me personally. There are many benefits to a small school. You don't get lost if you are struggling and your successes are seen as well.  My classmates show a genuine desire to learn and excel rather than just pass classes and it inspires you to push your self further. The school also offers a large variety of activities for non academic involvement and the student services and wellness center are truly committed to empowering students. Overall I am happy with my choice of graduate school. I came from a larger institution for my undergraduate degrees and I was definitely lost there which made my education impersonal.
Freshman,4,"This school is really outstanding. the staff and professors are very friendly and helpful, they will find any possible way to make guests welcome and comfortable. Professors are very professional, and they make sure students are comprehending the topic that is being taught. The school sports are very active but not well known by other schools. Also, the way this school helps students to stay on track on the career you want to choose is very unique and very amazing better than any school I heard of. They will inform you immediately, about your reports or any school news."
Graduate Student,4,An excellent school with excellent professors. The only thing I would like to see changed is their SMAC papers that are required for each class & two team papers.
Freshman,4,I enjoy the fact that the school is small in size so it is pretty easy to get to know everyone. Other than that there are a ton of majors to choose from and there are many helpful people on staff. There is also a ton of sports teams to join.
College Junior,4,Professors make it seem like they will help you to obtain internships and gain real life experience
College Junior,4,"So far, my experience has been great"
College Junior,4,Being in New York City it is very easy to feel unsafe at times. The school makes you feel like you are always protected

College Sophomore,4,Classmates are friendly. Professors are very helpful. They are always have time to help me out with any questions.

College Junior,4,"I haven't had an internship yet, but I do plan on obtaining one. It's very helpful in the course of your career and my school is always willing to help those students seeking such opportunities. I have no major concerns about finding an internship because my school has various connections in multiple fields."
College Junior,4,It wasn't a completely difficult process getting into my program. My school was very helpful in aiding me throughout the process and helping me achieve its specific goals.
College Junior,4,"School safety is great at my school. The officers are not only helpful, but friendly. You will almost always find security posted throughout the buildings, making it a safe environment."
College Junior,4,Cultural diversity is one of the many reasons I wanted to attend this college. The population in itself is extremely diverse and accepting. Many of my friends are from all backgrounds and beliefs.
College Junior,4,"Athletics at my school are a huge factor in campus life, and everyone attends the games (both basketball and volleyball). Everyone shows great support. The sports facilities are great for everyone."
College Junior,4,"My school is a very close community, and we are all relatively friendly toward one another. There aren't many attractions directly around my school, but being located in New York, there is always something to see or do around the city."
College Junior,4,"The study spaces at my school are great. Its located in an old mansion, so you can always find vintage furniture and perfect reading nooks so you can study in peace."
College Junior,4,"I am only a freshman, but this college is already opening the prospect of internships as well as prepare me for the future career of my intended major, speech language pathology."
College Junior,4,"Many of my professors have been very helpful during the course of my classes, and really focus on each student while teaching the class as a whole. The class sizes are fairly small, which allows students to get any extra help need. Overall, I am pleased with the quality of my education along with the staff involved."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The financial aid advisors are helpful. They will make sure you get all the grants, scholarships, and loans you deserve."
Recent Alumnus,4,"If you have an academic scholarship, you must get at least all c's in your classes if you don't want to be put on academic probation. The professors are not out to get you. They nurture their students very well and provide detailed outlines on what is going to be on exams. All you have to do is show up to class so that you can get the notes and understand the lectures!"
Recent Alumnus,4,The political science classes are small but challenging. If you love debate and interested in learning more about the American political system then St. Joseph's Political Science Department and Major is right for you.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The school is small but that is a good thing because prospective students (out of state and in state) have a better chance at scholarships, which are always available at St. Joseph's College. The professors are always willing to help. They really care about the students and that is what make St. Joseph College in Brooklyn, more than just a College. It has a safe at home feel where you have older people looking out for you, which is very important when one is a out of state students."
College Senior,4,Financial aid is easy to obtain and as long as its done early it is not a problem.
College Senior,4,The teachers are always available and eager to help their students. They want us to do great.
College Senior,4,"Security is always circling the parking lot, making sure that those who are on campus are supposed to be there."
College Senior,4,"The cafeteria is a place to hang out, eat and do homework. The cafeteria offers gift cards and the food is relatively low in cost."
College Senior,4,The campus is small and everyone knows who you are and they really care about seeing you succeed.
College Senior,4,"You are not just a number in a stadium sized classroom. You are who you are, and the teachers really know who you are."
College Junior,4,Joining a fraternity has lead to increased opportunities for community service and also social opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,very helpful professors and staff
College Junior,4,"If you're a guy considering St. Joseph's College and is interested in the social scene, the girls do outnumber you about 3 to 1. There are some people in relationships but most are not. "
College Junior,4,I say it's great only because the school is in New York City. Greek society is not very influential in the school so frat parties are few and far between. 
College Junior,4,The campus is very strict with their rules on drinking on campus and other violations.
College Junior,4,"Considering the school's location in Brooklyn, NY, St.Joseph's College does experience a diverse student body and faculty.  "
College Junior,4,The computers at St. Joseph's College are pretty reliable. Normally one would find an available computer for use even during the busiest hours. 
College Junior,4,The area has many small restaurants and bars. Two blocks from the school is DeKalb Avenue which has an excellent variety of eateries full of diversity. 
College Junior,4,Office very helpful guided me the whole way
College Junior,4,"St. Joseph's College is a 20-minute walk from Brooklyn, NY, which itself is very diverse. My program is, at an estimate, 50% white/American, 25% black, and 25% miscellaneous. We have several international students and many speak at least one other language; lots of our class discussions revolve around people's backgrounds in various parts of the country and around the world."
College Junior,4,I received a very helpful financial aid package. I am still trying to get more information about grants and teaching opportunities.
College Junior,4,"Not many student discounts, conveinent, many choices."
College Junior,4,Transportation to St Josephs is easy for me as i Live and work close by.
Recent Alumnus,4,There's all sorts of guys and girls at the college.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There's a lot of shops outside campus and there's even a huge mall-like area a few blocks away, and there's always something going on in campus."
College Sophomore,2,"not really affects. 

there is no animosity towards greek students. no, there are no greek housing available. first of all, there is no dorm."
College Sophomore,2,"I am a sophomore at St. Joseph's College and I am an international student. The school itself (academically) is not bad and the infrastructure is somewhat decent. They got a new gym, which is cool. The library is fine with good resources however, I feel that they need to extend their time schedules. On Friday to Sunday, the library is only open up to 5pm. I feel that they extend the library time period during the weekends. 

Also, before joining the school, I was told that international students can find employment in-campus but later, I found out that it was only for non- international students only, which really made me frustrated. Also, there are hardly any international students in the school so the administrative were not helpful at all in helping international students obtain their important documents such as SSN. 

Also, the school doesn't have its own on-campus dorms. They are partnered with EHS, which is VERY expensive. The school doesn't have any meal plan nor many options in its overly priced cafetaria. 

I feel that this school is only good for child study and bio studies. Since, I am a business major, I feel that this school has a poor business department. 

THEREFORE LUCKILY I DON'T HAVE TO ENDURE THIS SCHOOL ANYMORE SINCE I AM TRANSFERRING TO A BETTER SCHOOL THAN THIS- BARUCH!!!

so yes, if your an international student, I would definitely NOT RECOMMEND YOU THIS SCHOOL. NOT AT ALL. you can hardly see yourself finding something important to do after u graduate. Instead consider a school with better alumini networks and programmes. 

Anyways, if you still want to pursue your education here then do as u feel. I can only wish you my best."
Recent Alumnus,2,College coordinators/supervisors do not notice the big picture of events happening in the school. Many programs start to overlap and at time they do not reflect their decisions upon feedback from the students.
Recent Alumnus,2,There are not many fraternities or sororities to choose from.
College Senior,2,This is a commuter school- not much to do here 
College Junior,2,Most people live at home
College Senior,2,"The Child Study major (with a required minor, mine is psychology) is a very rigorous course of study. It requires more credits than other majors to graduate and every semester requires observation and intern hours part-time, and your last 2 semesters is full-time student teaching along with your normal classes (obviously taken at night). On average its about 90 hours/ semester for 4 semesters and then 420 hours/ semester for your last two semesters before you graduate. The benefit of this is that you are a well prepared teacher who has 4 certifications (early childhood, special ed. early childhood, general ed. elementary and special ed. elementary and if you take 2 speech classes you also get your speech language certification). It is a lot of required work, a lot of hours, the most stress you will even have in your life all crashing down on you during the last two weeks of finals week, but its what make you a St. Josephs college student, youre the best of the best. So be prepared to work your best under pressure and work your butt off!"
College Freshman,2,"There are people from recognized minorities (Latinos, etc.) but if you're looking for a place where you can meet people from different background with different ways of thinking, there isn't exactly the college for you!"
College Sophomore,2,"Student life at St. Josephs has its days of being fun and also boring. There would be special guest speakers, performances, or fashion shows providing entertainment for the students. Its a commuting college which means no one wants to hangout after class, many people go home. There's a sorority but no frats because of an incident that occurred before I enrolled to st. Josephs. There's not that many groups, even if there was students wouldnt  even bother joining."
Recent Alumnus,2,THERE WAS ONLY A PART TIME NURSE ON CMAPUS ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK.
College Sophomore,2,"Throughout this school, there is no diversity. Most of the campus is white, with very few others of different race and ethnicity. Most come from the same political and financial background. Everyone around you are mostly in the same situation that you are."
College Freshman,2,"Its High School – If you want to be in high school all over again go to SJC. If you want to have the real college experience look into a university. Even though it's great that they baby their students at SJC for the first few semesters, it gets old!"
College Freshman,2,No Parties – No one goes out in Brookyln! Parties are in Manhattan! But transportation to the city is not bad (subway)
College Freshman,2,Dorm building is really nice but the SJC dorms are shoe boxes!
College Freshman,2,"ONLY Housing Is Off-Campus – The school is so small and urban(the campus is comprised of several mansions) that there is no on-campus housing. Only off-campus a couple miles away. The dorms are okay, but there are only two shuttles in the morning to/from school and two in the afternoon from/to school. Additionally, they're very expensive."
College Freshman,2,"It Is What You Make It – There aren't many majors offered or classes to choose from. Additionally, some of the teachers here seem a little off.

However, the teachers are very helpful and willing to do one on one work. It's a fostering environment for those who need it. All the classes are very small as far as colleges go."
Graduate Student,1,"WASNT HORRIBLE TO HONEST,I TOOK SUMMER CLASSES WHICH WAS FAIR GOOD AND THE WORK LOAD WAS OVERWHELMING ."
College Sophomore,1,"since i was an international student, they offer NO on-campus employment for experiences. they tend to advertise internships and stuffs but its mostly for domestic students. the school is not partnered with major organizations. if u want to get a job at a fire department or NYPD then carry on here. 

there is no campus recruiting here. you gotta drag yourself with the little or no worthy degree that you earn in this school.

transfer i suggest if your not doing bio or child study."
College Senior,1,There is no on campus housing 
College Junior,1,Parking is the worst  get here on time or else
College Junior,1,We need lower prices and better options
College Junior,1,"There is NEVER enough parking at SJC. Unless you get there SUPER early, you will not get a spot, and you will be forced to take the shuttle from the parking lot at the church, which is NEVER on time and frequently makes students late for class."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is horrific. There are three student parking lots that are small and do not accommodate the number of students on campus. You have to arrive an hour early to the school (which is inconvenient) to wait and fight for a parking spot, and hope you are not late to class. As a freshman, you have to park in a parking lot 2 miles away and take a shuttle bus to the campus that makes its rounds every ten minutes. In the main parking lot, the parking spaces extend all the way out to the highway and you have to walk about 3 football fields to get from your car to the campus (now imagine doing that at 9:30pm when you get out of class and you're by yourself!). Its simple ridiculous and not a well thought out parking scenario.v"
College Freshman,1,It's commuter school located in a dead neighborhood. Forget college parties...
College Sophomore,1,"I have to take public transportation and I dislike taking the train everyday, its really annoying. i have to travel for about an hour and it is just stressful. its far from convenient."
College Sophomore,1,I won't lie parking is a nightmare on campus and everyone fights for a spot because they don't want to park at the church.if you get there atleast 15-20 mins before tou class starts you have a good chance at finding a spot. It would be really helpful if we could make more space but if not then people have to deal with the tickets if they can't be responsable and park in an actual spot.
College Sophomore,1,Running Rampid – St. Joseph's College is not strict: there are no rules and there are no consequences.
College Junior,1,"Parking is a complete and utter nightmare. It is the number one complaint of any St. Joseph's student. The lot is simply not big enough and with enrollment growing in increasing numbers, there is simply not enough space for everyone to park. Ironic, because it is a commuter school.. There is an off-campus parking site at a church down the road and a shuttle that provides transportation, but it is a hassle and not quick enough. If you want to have some chance at even finding a spot in the main lot, your best bet is to arrive at school 2 hours before your first class."
College Freshman,1,"Bad Spirit and Bad Teams – I'll give it to other students that they try to have spirits and that our sports team are sort of up and coming. But as of right now, not many people attend the games, and from friends I have on teams, I hear coaches are not as professional as they should be. All our teams are Division 3. Additionally, we have like no facilities. We have an average gym for the athletes downstairs and the basketball court is tiny."
College Sophomore,1,"Saint Joseph's College does not have off-campus housing for students.  The school only offers housing on campus at the several dorm halls available.  Surrounding the campus is a neighborhood, but in the city five to ten minutes are apartments separate from the college."
College Junior,1,Eating at School – i prefer to go to the local cafe's then eating on campus.

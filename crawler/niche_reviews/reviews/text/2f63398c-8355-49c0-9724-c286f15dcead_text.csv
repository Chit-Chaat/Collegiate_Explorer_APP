Alum,5,The classes were very-well designed; the materials that were used in the classes were up to date.  Professors are very knowledgeable and responsive.
Alum,5,I was happy with the quality of the classes. I never had any problem to reach the professors or the school.
Junior,5,"I am about to start my third at Fort Hays State University. So far my experience has been amazing. I am a student-athlete at FHSU. With that being said, I travel many weekends during the fall semester. One thing that has impressed me the most is the understanding and support I get from the professors. They all are very flexible with my schedule and are open to using office hours to help me catch up on the topics covered in class. That is just one of many things that are impressive in this institution."
Sophomore,5,I answered this  above but I am a big fan learning the online learning. even though I am not a student on campus I still feel that I receive a quality education at a good price.
Freshman,5,The schools has been very helpful with getting me registered for classes in light of the epidemic and has made me feel very welcome.
Junior,5,"The online classes I've taken have been very informational and easy to follow along. I feel like, if anything, I've learned more by taking some classes online rather than in person. The professors are easy to reach out to and most of them create online discussions so the whole class can chat with each other and talk about the class material."
Junior,5,I've had nothing but great experiences with FHSU. The academic advisors are so helpful and truly want to see you succeed. The enrollment process is very straightforward and I've never had any issues getting into a class that I want to take.
Alum,5,The online courses here are incredible.  And online students are also afforded a lot of chances to fully participate in student life to the extent that can (such as travel abroad).
Senior,5,"I absolutely love the virtual college at FHSU! I was able to complete my bachelors degree online, all the way from Texas. I have no bad experiences and wouldn't change anything."
Senior,5,"FHSU is a great school because there is a balance of academics and fun. The school strives toward making sure there is something for everyone. You can join a student organizations, work on campus, attend many events the school hosts, and attend sports games. The students here also enjoy having fun outside of the the university, for example there is a mall, theater (only $4 a movie!), mini golf, bowling, great places to eat, and of course some fun bars (if your 21) so there is a spot for everyone. This university wants all of their students to feel apart of their school and try to make their experience worth while. FHSU is my favorite part about Hays, KS and I'm very happy with my decision to go to school here.  I even added another certificate and minor to my degree because I enjoy the education I am getting.  I would recommend FHSU to anyone."
Graduate Student,5,"Diverse student and also instructor body, well-designed programs, beautiful campus, virtual learning possibilities..."
Sophomore,5,Fhsu is extremely friendly and always makes me feel like home. Great campus and staff. The class sizes are fairly small which is amazing to me.
Junior,5,They are very friendly and very student oriented. They make sure that you have all of your classes in order and the advisors are outstanding. The advisors make sure you’re on the right track and when you aren’t they will get you there. The student life is great as long as you participate and the academics are phenomenal. You can fast track your degree or you can take all the time you need. I’ll be finished in 3 years and I’m super excited to graduate from such an outstanding college. I love the professors and the people. This is an amazing college and if you’re looking for a great place to go to school this is it.
Senior,5,"Working toward bachelors online. Great experience so far!easy to enroll, easy access to teachers when needed. Fast grading systems"
Junior,5,"It is a great place to further your academic career. The teachers are some of the most involved, caring individuals I have ever had the pleasure to meet."
Freshman,5,FHSU was perfect. I'm from a small town and Hays had the perfect small town feel and made me feel right at home. All of the professors were so friendly and helpful during my freshman year. There were so many ways to get involved on campus and I met so many amazing people. There are lots of things to do in Hays that are fun and cheap.
Freshman,5,Just going on a tour there I knew exactly that Fort Hays was the school that I wanted to attend after high school.
Sophomore,5,"I am taking online courses, everyone is so nice and helpful when I call or email. It is a bit hard doing online courses instead of having your teacher in front of you."
Senior,5,I love studying at Fort Hays! I am an online student and the professors are wonderful. The tuition is affordable which is amazing and I am able to fit school in around being a wife and mother to a three year old!
Junior,5,"I love that FHSU is small enough to know lots of people and see them around campus every day. Class sizes are small, so you get to know each other and get to know your professors."
Senior,5,The best choice in Kansas. It is a smaller campus but that just makes the teacher-student relationships more personal and less of a workout to and from classes. It is the cheapest university in Kansas and ranked one of the best. The atmosphere is amazing and the community is perfect. I would not have chosen a different place to spend my college years!
Alum,5,I loved attending Fort Hays State University. The professors were great. I was able to become super involved in various activities. I never felt limited in what I could do.
Senior,5,"This is the best school ever. The teachers are awesome, informative and very helpful. I truly enjoy learning about Psychology at this university."
Sophomore,5,Fort Hays State University is such a great campus. The professors there really care about your future and take time to get to know you. The atmosphere here is amazing. Everyone is friendly which was a big thing for me when choosing the  perfect college. I will never regret coming here.
Senior,5,"Although it is affordable, the quality of education is the same as any other university! Highly recommend."
Junior,5,"I love that Fort Hays offers such a wonderful online program. The instructors are still easily to contact and communicate with, even in the online environment. It is easy to succeed here."
Junior,5,"Fort Hays State University if a great college to go to! They make you feel like you are part of the tiger family. FHSU has the lowest tuition in the state of Kansas and is ranked fairly high on the national level. You are assigned an advisor which corresponds to your major. Your advisor will become your best friend. They help you decide on your future. Advisors are there to help you with any questions you have relating to your major or just general college or life questions. They are very one-on-one/personal. As so are the instructors at FHSU. Class sizing are relatively small (20-30 students in each class).

Fort Hays is growing every year if it isn't by student population it's by buildings. Every year it seems like there is a new and improved building in the works. Lastly, the campus is beautiful. The quad has so many trees which it makes it so pretty in the spring and the fall."
Niche User,5,Fort Hays is right to the point and direct with the process of admittance. More communication is needed.
Junior,5,Some degrees are totally online - great if you are employed. Price is good. There are some extras that you aren't told about up front that are required for online courses.
Graduate Student,5,great university. Very helpful staff and professors! I am an online graduate student and my experience has been really positive. i would recommend them for anyone doing online schooling. The format is easy to fololow and instructors are helpful in classes.
Sophomore,5,"Fort Hays has been my home for the past two years and it truly has became my favorite place. My family has always had a long tradition of attending FHSU, and when I was in 6th grade, I knew I was going to keep that tradition alive and attend as well. Fast forward to now and I can see how truly amazing this place is - the community and people are friendly, the athletics are really good for our region and D2 school, the opportunities available for students to get involved are outstanding from Greek life to intramurals to major-specific clubs. There is something for everyone to participate in at FHSU whether that be hanging with friends, being involved in SGA, or walking around campus. Fort Hays State University might not get 5 stars in all the categories below, but my experience and education have truly been 5 stars. Roll Tiges!"
Senior,5,I have nothing but good things to say about Fort Hays! As a military spouse finding an all inclusive online program was a must since I've moved twice since enrolling. Everything has been easy and their costs are low. Their education program is boasted to be one of the best but it's truly everything it's cracked up to be.
Alum,5,"I graduated from FHSU this December with a Bachelor of Science in Speech-Language Pathology. I loved that the faculty made student learning and success a priority. I appreciated how many leadership opportunities were available to me, even as a freshman. It was easy to get involved and make great friends. Entertainment was affordable too, with so many free on-campus events."
Senior,5,"Great school, and very accommodating and overall easy to get through your education. The teachers that I have had are very well educated and go out of their way to help you and make sure you are getting the help you are wanting to make sure you understand."
Senior,5,Fort Hays was a great choice and I have had a great learning experience there.  The community and school are perfect size - not too small and not too large.  Fort Hays State University has a great faculty to student ratio which allows students to be successful in classes.
Graduate Student,5,This was a wonderful school. The professors were always available and helpful. I appreciated the fact my Masters could be completed at my pace. I would definitely recommend this school to anyone who is considering online classes.
Freshman,5,It's a great school. All my teacher are caring and understanding. They are well qualified and always helping me succeed. Everybody is super friendly.
Niche User,5,"I went on a college visit to Fort Hays State University my Sophomore year of high school and it was amazing. I've wanted to go there ever since that day. Some of the things that I really liked about the college is the beautiful campus, the small class sizes, and how everyone I met there was eager to answer any questions I had about the college. Another thing that I like about FHSU is the fact that they have an accredited Nursing and Radiology program and those are the two careers that I'm considering to become. Overall, Fort Hays State University and the most beautiful and well ran college I've ever visited."
Freshman,5,I have visited Fort Hays many times. For soccer and a road trip. The overall feeling is amazing. You feel as if a new door has open to a bright future. I'm so excited to be a Tiger next year!
Niche User,5,I loved how involved the university is with the community. Going there they make everyone feel at home and comfortable within themselves. The people there are beyond amazing and help the university provide students with a growing education that will benefit them greatly in their futures.
Sophomore,5,Fort Hays offers a completely online Virtual College so that you can finish school from anywhere. You don't need to rearrange your work schedule since these classes are online. They have several degrees available through this program. The education is the same as on campus classes. I highly recommend it if you have a busy schedule.
Senior,5,"I've attended a few different colleges, but Fort Hays State University has been the best. The staff, its teachers, they are all so beyond helpful. They truly believe no question is a stupid question. When I send an email, they always respond within hours, I have even gotten an email at midnight. I have already recommended this University to my friends that are looking to continue their education. The teachers, they are amazing and are always there for you when you need it, plus they will randomly send you messages just to see how you are doing and ask if you have any questions."
Junior,5,I attend Fort Hays State Virtual College and I have been absolutely thrilled with the access to information and how willing advisers are to help you register for classes and guide you in the right direction in order to succeed.
Senior,5,I love Fort Hayes! Excellent instructors and they are very helpful! I've made straight A's for one year so far!! :-)
Freshman,5,"I like that Fort Hays State University has so many activities for students to participate in. The academics are incredible and the atmosphere is amazing. The only thing that I would probably change is the cafe food. But other than that, I really love FHSU!"
Freshman,5,Online great! Transfered in hours a little rough...............online site little clunky but responsI've team
Sophomore,5,"Fort Hays State University has changed my view on college for the better. Going into college I was nervous and unaware of campus and where my classes were. The first day was surprisingly a breeze and was an enjoyable first day of school. Fort Hays is a smaller school but still a big enough school to still get the college feeling.  Campus is beautiful and well kept, everyone is extremely helpful and friendly on campus.  My favorite part about Fort Hays State University is the teacher-student bond. All the classes I have taken so far have had around thirty students or less. In some big schools there can be up to one hundred students. All of my teachers know my name and meet with me every once in awhile to talk about my grades and how I'm doing this year. The bond at Fort Hays is clearly an advantage and something I value at my University. Fort Hays has truly shaped me into the person I am and the person I will be in the future. "
College Freshman,5,"Athletics at Fort Hays State University is a huge part to everyone. Although, as I am a women's soccer player, I do not think women's sports do not get enough fans at the games. I went to a softball game, and not a lot of people showed up. But when it comes to baseball and football, there are large student sections. If someone wins in a specific sport, people usually come up and congratulate them for their victory. On the campus signs, it shows what type of athletic event is coming up, to inform other students when to attend."
Junior,5,I believe FHSU is a great university! They take their students' educations very seriously. The fact that FHSU is cost efficient and also has a high graduation rate makes it a top university in my opinion. I think my university is doing everything right and I would not change anything. Except maybe parking. 
College Freshman,5,I am a Wildlife Biology degree right now but am considering changing to Radiology. I came to Fort Hays State University having a biology degree in mind because this school has a very good program for biology. But the more I consider my options and look into what else the school has to offer I have seen that the Radiology program is fantastic and has a very high rating on being able to get jobs after graduation.
College Freshman,5,"Fort Hays State University is small, quaint, and everyone here is very friendly. If I had to go back in time I would choose this school all over again, especially with the experience that I have had so far since it has been so positive."
College Sophomore,5,The faculty puts 100% effort into making sure the students are on the road to success. They keep up with the students and encourage them.
College Junior,5,Class sizes are perfect! Not too large but not too small
College Senior,5,"Campus is very secure we have police patrol 24/7, campus is a safe environment and individuals feel safe when one campus."
College Senior,5,"Fort Hays offers so many different degrees and students love the faculty and student ratio which is 17 to 1. 

There are multiple internships and study abroad offer each year that are beneficial and affordable to students. We have a great networking system and student go fair after they get a degree from FHSU."
College Senior,5,We have different types of residential halls for all types of students. Residential life is super involved on campus and they do a lot for our community. Students feel safe in out residential halls and love the experience they have.
College Senior,5,We have a total of both 9 men and women sports. Our school spirit is of the top our band performance at every single football game and students paint there bodies and we pack the stands. Its a great time when school comes together to enjoy the games.
College Senior,5,"We are a family oriented university, Fort Hays State is very affordable and I love the location and campus."
College Senior,5,"This school is reasonable, easy to navigate, clear, and helpful."
College Senior,5,"Fort Hays is very flexible, accommodating, and meets my needs as a graduate student."
Freshman,4,"Great place to start a new beginning, can’t wait to be a part of it. I really like how they push to get kids in the schools. I don’t like how the corona virus will be pulling us out of class."
Freshman,4,"I didn’t do any online classes yet. Great place to start a new beginning, can’t wait to be a part of it. I really like how they push to get kids in the schools. I don’t like how the corona virus will be pulling us out of class."
Junior,4,The Blackboard platform is very easy to use. Communication is excellent between teachers/students. The school makes studying online very easy. The online library ROCKS!!! All kinds of resources are available.
Junior,4,"It is easy to apply and enroll at Fort Hays. I can attend classes online. The teaching is excellent. Though I live in another state, I feel like I'm part of the class."
Sophomore,4,"I am an older mother returning to college and fort hayes has made it a smooth transition to college life, even thoug it is online I always have the help mi need readily available and never feel as though I am left behind because I do nit attend on the actual campus"
Senior,4,Same as above. Most instructors are pretty awesome. Some take a while to email back. But alot of group projects and those are horrible.
Junior,4,I love FHSU. Most of the professors want to watch their students succeed and they want to help in any way possible. FHSU administration is always ready and asking for ways that they can improve a student's life.
Freshman,4,I enjoyed how inviting the freshman orientation activities were. I also love how accommodating FHSU has been since COVID-19 disrupted the flow of the year.
Sophomore,4,"There are many resources for all needs of any students. The campus is the perfect size if you want a big feel, but you still get small sized classes."
Sophomore,4,Currently I am attending Fort Hays State University online. They have an extensive virtual campus. There options for online programs are very in depth and allow for students to earn degrees in various programs.
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at FHSU so far.  I have been here for 2 years and I'm happy with my choice. As a part of the radiology program, I have been challenged academically, but it has helped me exponentially."
Freshman,4,"I overall think Fort Hays State University is a very good college, but it does come out to be a little more expensive than I would have thought. You also have to take many extra courses in order to complete the Fort Hays State University criteria. College is very different from high school and some professors are a little more understanding than others. The diversity in Hays is not all that big as the college makes it seem when you schedule a tour of the campus. For the most part I feel like the people that work there are pretty helpful. The campus is close to the dorms so its a good thing so every individual can get their exercise. Also I do not recommend driving, because it is very hard to find parking on campus. The great thing is that there is a bus that goes around campus, so there is no excuse in not being able to get around campus."
Junior,4,"A few things that I like about Fort Hays State University are the activity boards they provide and how diverse they are. Every week they hold meetings for the university board of activities (UAB) where anyone is welcomed to join and add their ideas. Also, during finals week the school holds game days and provide snacks to help relieve stress as students study for their finals."
Senior,4,"I enjoy the virtual college. My experience overall is very good, but I choose classes carefully. Fort Hays has made it easy and rewarding to finish my degree."
Sophomore,4,"I attend Fort Hays State University as a student but also as an athlete. One of the biggest things that stood out to me about FHSU was the community support in all events. The city of Hays lives for FHSU sporting events and shows their support in many ways that welcomes students and makes them feel at home. The campus itself is very nice and continues to grow and improve. With endless opportunities I feel that I am always being challenged and given new opportunities to grow myself as well. Many people think of Hays as a pass by town on the highway but I could not imagine myself anywhere else, Hays is my home and I am proud of it."
Junior,4,The student organizations and small class sizes make for an amazing experience both in and out of class.
Freshman,4,Small classes with instructors who get to know you. Not impressed with online courses- on campus classes are much better.
Junior,4,The professors have been very helpful when I have needed assistance. The school has good academic programs and advisors.
Freshman,4,The professors are very nice and actually care whether you understand the material or not and want you to succeed in life.
Graduate Student,4,Fort Hays State University has  very affordable on-line masters degree programs that fit into your schedule!
Junior,4,"It is a very good campus, the professors love to have everyone in class and will always help you succeed. They love getting to know the students individually."
Freshman,4,"Fort Hays State University was an overall great campus.  I went there my freshman year and met a ton of new people.  Since I was apart of the women's basketball team, it lead to even more opportunities. Being on the basketball team lead to some challenges with missing quizzes or tests, but I worked with my professors to always make it up and it was never an issue.  Student life was also a positive environment.  I always saw someone I knew when I was walking to my classes and having some familiar faces was a good feeling.  Something that I would like to see change at Fort Hays State University is definitely the parking around the dorms.  Finding parking was always a pain for me, especially in the winter when walking in the cold became a struggle.  To fix this problem, more parking lots should be paved."
Freshman,4,"I really liked the campus and the teachers I had, but I didn't like that none of the drivers would stop at the crosswalks. It was pretty cool that one half of the campus has cats everywhere and the other has squirrels."
Freshman,4,"I have been attending fhsu persuing a degree in manufacturing technology. It is a 4 year degree much related to enginerring, but all hands on. The campus is great and everyone's attitude is over the top. I hope all consider fhsu even though it is a little out of the way in kansas, but has great benifits being in a small town environment."
Junior,4,I really enjoy FHSU. The professors do a great job of getting to known students. Fort Hays is very affordable but that does not stop them from providing a great education.
Freshman,4,I am still a student at Fort Hays State University and I enjoy this school very much. It is a medium sized college and the class sizes are small. I enjoy this because you have more of an opportunity to interact with the teachers.
Senior,4,"Fort Hays State University is a great college, especially for people who have lived in small towns their whole lives. It is a very diverse campus and I have had very few bad professors"
Niche User,4,"The social, on-campus friendliness experience is hyped-up. Most of the student body ends up transferring or dropping out - the graduation rate is low. Fantastic staff, especially the professors with their fantastic backgrounds. Equipment for student use is great. The directors board leaves much to be desired here, however. The party scene was once a glorious wake of celebration around Hays campus - It's not quite what it used to be. The dorms were a nightmare - depending which you were in, however they ARE remodeling them. Student life does an adequate job of involving new students in student life activities. Campus safety also leaves much to be desired, considering the number of attacks I alone have known to happen on campus. Diversity is one of the most prominent features of this university. Students literally come from all over the globe to attend FHSU especially for it's affordable tuition, which I might add, for a university, is a BARGAIN."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great campus. It is not too big, and not too small. The small class sizes make it so much easier to excel in class rather than sitting through a lecture hall full of hundreds of students."
Senior,4,Great school for the price. Teachers that I have had want and are willing to help students succeed. On-Campus housing and dining could be improved. Lots of majors at FHSU. Medium sized town has most stores you would need.
Niche User,4,Fun community with tons of free resources and activities. Very cost efficient and you'll have a great time there!
Junior,4,"I absolutely love the school. The small setting, dedicated professors, and professional yet challenging learning environment makes it very comfortable to continue my college experience."
Junior,4,there are plenty of internationals to get to know. the cafe closes to early and does not offer much diversity in food
Sophomore,4,"Fort Hays State University is a small community that is extremely involved in each students' lives. There is always something happening on campus. Here at Fort Hays I am able to have a very close relationship with each of my professors due to the small class sizes. One thing I would change about this university is to provide more recycling bins around campus. There are a few but I feel there should be just as many recycling bins as there are trash cans. I love it here at Fort Hays, the community is friendly and helpful. I would recommend this University to just about anyone."
Alum,4,"My college experience was excellent. I was fortunate to be a student athlete. Which gave me an experience that not every college student gets to experience. I was able to get a college education while allowing me the opportunity to compete for my university.  While in college I was able to join clubs that allowed me to further my education experience and establishing relationship that would last the test of time. It was an educational experience but I had fun, I lived, I found myself, and my voice."
Junior,4,"I am taking my courses through the virtual school.  Overall, it has been a good experience; however, it has been difficulty to receive quality advising for course enrollment through emal.  I also wish that the way the courses are taught/presented were a little more consistent."
College Freshman,4,"Fort Hays State University is a family-oriented school. We have each other's backs, and support each other in everything we do. If someone is struggling, someone will notice and help them through their rough time. It is a comfortable environment, and I feel safe around campus. I would not want to choose a different school all over again because I belong here, and I do not want to leave my second family."
College Freshman,4,"I have had a very positive experience here at Fort Hays State University. The professors have all been very kind and they seem to be very passionate about the subjects that they teach which makes the class more enjoyable to be in. They class sizes are small which is one of the things that I like most. It allows you to be able to get to know your professor better, know who is in your class as a whole and also allows for better one on one with your professor if you were to ever need help with any work."
College Freshman,4,"Fort Hays State University has really strived to be a safe place for all students who live on and off campus and made getting help an easy access. I have yet to encounter or hear of any campus crime this school year. I believe that one of those reasons is that here at Fort Hays we have good campus police and safety services, which help to make me feel very safe and at home while I am living here on campus."
College Freshman,4,"I was debating about going Greek this year because I wanted to be as involved as I could and help the community, although I was not able to due to another extra curricular activity that I am involved with. The Greek life here on campus is very welcoming, they are very kind and do a lot of good for the community around us."
College Freshman,4,"I have only been attending Fort Hays State University for about two weeks now but I have already seen the school spirit, and the school is very involved in cheering on the athletics here and they are ranked very high in the division and tend to do very well."
College Sophomore,4,Met lifelong friends my freshman year through living in the dorms
College Sophomore,4,All athletic events are well ran and fun to attend
College Sophomore,4,"So far my time at Fort Hays State University has been absolutely amazing. I learn new things and meet new people almost every day. Everyone, from faculty to student, is open and welcoming."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus police are always driving around which makes me know that the area will be safe. There  is sufficient lighting at night so students don't have to walk in the dark. The walk ways are open to make it easy to see many things, which helps boost the feeling of security."
College Sophomore,4,The internships set for students are set to surely help or benefit them in preparing them for the real world. The alumni network is really good where former students work directly  in the school or get involved with the school activities and provide support. The career centers are very helpful in getting the students to follow the right tracks to be successful in whatever they want to pursue
College Sophomore,4,"The students have sufficient room for their accommodation. The social atmosphere is great, the cost is affordable, and it is very convenient as compared to living off campus. The amenities are in abundance"
College Sophomore,4,The Greek Life has been a part of the school for a while and is involved in making/helping the community
College Sophomore,4,Many students are involved in the sports and have their schoolwork in check too. The students show a great turn out during the games to give support. The teams do fairly well in the competitions.
College Junior,4,The staff works hard to see us succeed
College Junior,4,"Its a great school based on community, education, and leadership! The faculty and staff make you feel right at home! Fort Hays State is also very affordable."
College Senior,4,"We have 3 sororities on campus and 5 fraternities, our Greek life is very involved on campus, currently 2 sororities have a house outside of campus but my school is working hard to move them on campus."
College Freshman,4,My overall experience at Fort Hays State University has been very welcoming without a doubt. This fall will be my first year attending Fort Hays and so far I have been helped throughout the whole entire enrollment process. Fort Hays State University was my first choice and up to this point I have no regrets.
College Sophomore,4,It's great if you know the right people.
College Freshman,4,"The security is available all the time, and easy to get ahold of."
College Freshman,4,"The class sizes are great, and professors are usually very helpful outside of class."
College Freshman,4,"The networking is great, and people are very helpful when trying to find jobs."
College Senior,4,I love that I can obtain my Bachelors degree virtually! I love the virtual program at FHSU!
College Freshman,4,"Safety and security on campus is something that our school tries really hard at achieving. Our campus security/policemen drive their police cars around campus the majority of the time making sure that everything is safe. If I would be walking from the library or a study session at night and didn't feel completely safe, I could call the campus police and they would escort me to where I needed to be. I feel pretty safe on campus. Compared to all the other colleges I have been around and heard about, this one is really as safe as you could get."
College Freshman,4,"The student career prospects and the value of a degree from this school is very inviting. The fact of just knowing that when you graduate with whatever degree you obtain from this university, the faculty and staff will always want to help you find a job without complaining about it. My mom and grandpa went to college here back in the old days and to this day if they needed help with finding a job, they would help them in a heartbeat."
Alum,2,"My Freshman year, they forced us to live inside of the dorms and purchase a meal plan - I did not appreciate that very much because I worked full-time and part-time, which meant that I could never utilize the cafeteria that I was paying for. I tried to petition and request a refund for the cafeteria plan that I could not access, but the university denied me of that privilege. I felt trapped and depressed when I was at this university. The only thing that made me somewhat happy were my neighbors and how involved they were in my life."
College Junior,2,"A few bars around campus, but these ar mostly empty year round"
College Junior,2,"Cliquey house parties. Don't go if you're female, alone, or believe consent is necessary."
College Sophomore,2,"It's not the worse, greek life is becoming more popular, but our town is pretty small, and greek life just hasn't picked up steam. The university is creating a greek row and that might have more influence on how the greek houses get involved."
College Junior,2,"I don't see a lot of oeople going to athletics a lot. I don't strive to go, in fact I dread going."
College Freshman,2,The rooms are pretty small and depending on the RA you get is how strictly the rules are enforced. The parking for residential life is awful right now I'm hoping they get that fixed soon.
College Junior,2,Campus police do not appear to be actively involved with the students. I have never been informed of any preventive steps to address sexual assault on campus but I know sexual assaults are happening. Walking home alone at night makes me uneasy because the sidewalks are not well lit and there are no safety buttons in place if I need help.
College Junior,2,"Personally, I have not enjoyed my time at FHSU because I am too busy working so I can pay to go to school. While FHSU might be considered ""cheap"" it is very costly. I enjoy most of my professors but some appear to be arrogant and unapproachable. I love how FHSU treats incoming students like they are important. However, after school starts, students just become another number. There is a large variety of classes offered, which I appreciate, but there is not a variety of professors to teach those classes."
College Junior,2,"While housing is very close to campus, it is very expensive. People whose parents do not help them pay for school most definitely struggle to make ends meet. The campus police do a poor job of ensuring students safety."
College Junior,2,"Greek life at FHSU is odd to me. During recruitment, Greeks are very loving and excited to meet new people. However, after being initiated into Greek life, fellow Greeks expect you to change your morals, drop everything at last minutes notice, and be able to afford expensive bills."
College Junior,2,"Athletes have a great opportunity to use the facilities on campus. However, their facilities are not available to the non-athlete students. The non-athlete students are allowed to use the wellness center on campus that is lacking a real squat rack and up to date equipment."
College Freshman,2,Good luck trying to eat something that's not fast food.
College Student,2,"Campus police are a pain. Whether it is you driving too fast through an unpopulated area, parking in the wrong spot, or parking too far over a line, they are going to get you."
College Sophomore,2,UPD is pathetic. Tickets for ridiculous reasons when parking is sad!
College Sophomore,2,"The only good place on campus to eat is in our student union, our actual cafiteria failed the health inspection twice last year, and a few have gotten sick from it. the food is not up to par and is kind of gross."
College Junior,2,"I have never been more frustrated then when ever school around us gets a snow day, but we are still sticking it out. It is a huge celebration, and rare occasion when we get school called off for weather."
College Junior,2,Our parking here is horrible! Definitely need more spots
College Sophomore,2,"I recommend living off campus, it is not worth all the money you pay to live in the dorms. In the dorm you have limited space and individuals can be noisy after quiet hours."
College Junior,2,"The process is a little confusing, and a big hassle, but you will get the aid you need.  Applying for scholarships was easier than I expected but they also have some wonky requirements for receiving aid.  Apply early and don't ignore any messages from the financial aid office."
College Freshman,2,"There is a small choice of restaurants from national food chains, which are open for a limited time around the lunch hour on campus. We do have a Starbucks on campus, but it is available during normal Starbucks hours and is the only one for over 50 miles."
College Junior,2,"For a college town, Hays is pretty stuck in it's ways. It is very hard for a new business to establish. We need more places for students to hang out, more restaurants, and better stores, to promote jobs and economic growth."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the students at FHSU are farm kids, mostly from rural Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, etc. Very conservative, and mostly all white. There are a lot of Asian students though, through the exchange program. They mostly keep to themselves."
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you want to go to a college bar or a house party, there is absolutely nothing to do on the weekends. Besides going to a movie at the movie theatre."
College Sophomore,2,"Trying to find a close parking spot to your classes is a nightmare. You're better off just walking from your dorm or your house, if you live close enough to the college."
College Junior,2,The cafe in the dorm is very gross.  There are not many food options and the food is very disgusting.  The union offers a lot of food options but it is expensive and is only open for a few hours during the day.
College Freshman,2,There aren't many options that I like.  I like healthy food and its all fast food junk near by.
College Senior,2,"There are quite a few apartments close to campus but are often occupied. They are also close to restaurants and stores. The streets need more lighting for people walking home after dark, but the area around campus is generally safe."
College Sophomore,2,The athletics are not really too grand. Students can get in free to all games which makes students more likely to go.
College Sophomore,2,Snow in May was the most ridiculous thing. It was not too bad it had the first cancellation due to weather in the last nine years this year.
College Sophomore,2,"In all honesty, there isn't much diversity at all at Fort Hays. The majority of the students who attend are white, and it's uncommon to see many people who are not."
College Student,2,If you are going into Computer Science in FHSU to get your CCNA (Cisco Certs) and go into networking then you will find the program sufficient. Steer clear of FHSU if you plan on going into just about anything else related to Computer Science. The C.S. program springs out of the math department rather than out of an engineering department so the main focus is to teach you Java & C++ then get you out the door.
College Student,2,"It's windy all the time. In the winter it's windy, dry, and cold. In the summer it's windy, dry, and hot. The fall and spring seasons are moderate in temperature but windy and dry as well. Class is rarely cancelled for snow, so bring boots and a heavy coat."
College Freshman,2,The wireless tends to be spotty and slow on campus. You have to relie on 3G most of the time. I use my personal computer and printer all the time.
College Freshman,2,"There are lot country, backwoods kind of guys and those who like to drink. The girls are not much different, a lot like to go out a party during the school week."
College Sophomore,2,financial aid office not very helpful with scholarships
College Sophomore,2,"Actually parking on campus can be a real challenge. Especially if someone is trying to park on campus late morning/early afternoon. There is three options. One is to get to campus at least 20-30 minutes early and drive around till you find one. Two is to come at the last minute, when other people are getting out of class and leaving. (But there is the risk of being late for class.) And three is just to park off campus."
College Junior,2,There is the access bus that is $1.50 for pick up and/or drop off. Hard to get a hold of but they do make appointments. Other than that walking works cause things are so close because the town is so small. Or driving but gas is expensive
College Junior,2,If you are the type for bars and clubbing there are a few of those that create quite a good nightlife scene. These are best during the months and weekends when school is in session. College town also means that there are lots of activities going on throughout the streets closest to campus and in the university apartments.
College Junior,2,A bus called the Access Bus is availble upon your request. It takes you were you need to go for just $1.
College Freshman,2,"Strictness Varies – The police force can be very strict about speeding, not yielding, etc... nothing different than any other small town in America."
Recent Alumnus,1,The Greek woman just stay drunk and want to lay around all night.
College Junior,1,"Not challenging, not competitive, no options, extremely conservative and close minded."
College Junior,1,The few students who are diverse (basically meaning anyone who isn't a heterosexual Christian from Kansas) arr basically forced to keep to themselves.
College Junior,1,Classes are ridiculously easy. Lab equipment is virtually unavailable.
College Junior,1,Left aft my first semester. And it was free.
College Freshman,1,The games suck. No one goes.
College Junior,1,"Our party scene is ""the worst"" because it does not positively impact the student experience. Students end up getting bad grades and flunking out the more they party."
College Sophomore,1,I really don' t know a lot about the nightlife at my school because I don't participate in those activities.
College Sophomore,1,Almost all the individuals on campus attend some function that includes alcohol weekly.
College Junior,1,I believe we only have transportation offered to and from Walmart for International Students. Our town is fairly small so the need for transportation is somewhat questionable. 
College Sophomore,1,"The food is not very optional, its not good in the cafeteria and in the union its extremely expensive for mediocre food"
College Junior,1,It seems like everyone here is looking out for themselves and not caring about anyone else. I have only a handful of true friends here.
College Junior,1,"Hard to figure out. Due to my parents income, I pay a lot of my classes with personal loans and out of pocket. Not very meany options for students who live on their own and do NOT get any help from parents or government."
College Junior,1,"Because I come from the Denver area where there are numerous amounts of dining options, I would say that there are minimal amounts here in Hays. Although it is a college town the options for eating out are very limited to fast food or a couple of very expensive restaurants which I can not say I have visited."
College Freshman,1,"It's Everywhere – Just like any other typical college drinking is what everyone does the minute classes are done on Friday, and sometimes even Thursday."
College Junior,1,"I know that there are a couple frat/sorority houses and that they occasionally do something on campus, but that's it. I can't even tell you where the houses are located."
College Student,1,"Snows a Lot – It snows a lot here, but classes never get cancelled. The Dean of the school lives on campus and he says ""If I can get there, so can you!"""
College Freshman,1,"Very Bad..Partiality and Race Discrimination Clearly Exists – The school is all about drugs and favors done by the chinese students to the teachers and professors. Fort Hays has a tie-up with some schools in China and most of them are given admission because of the amount of extra money they pay to Fort Hays. Registrar's office gives more emphasis to Chinese students with money that genuine deserving students with good grades. People don't even bother to reply back to emails sent by students who have good grades. Professors and teachers are not serious, never grade work on time and in a fairly manner and the school does not have any facilities. Campus life is boring and carrer opportunities are nil. In fact people finishing a degree from this school find it impossible to get a job. Check US news college rankings site and put in Fort Hays. The graduation percentage is posted as NA. Its true because most never graduate. Money is taken and the student is delibrately failed by the teachers. Students are discriminated based on race and gender."
College Freshman,1,"Bad Dorms, Can Collapse Any Time – The campus housing is the worst you'll find in Kansas. Hays itself is a small place with very less activity. Dorm rooms are outdated and maintenance is zero. Students find it very difficult to study due to constant fear of things breaking down. Dorm buildings can collapse anytime. The management is so conservative that its not bothered about student's safety or interests."
College Freshman,1,There are so many students on campus that the only time you can find a spot is in the afternoons. If you want one during class hours it will take at least 10 minutes to find one and if you leave at night there are no spots for miles.

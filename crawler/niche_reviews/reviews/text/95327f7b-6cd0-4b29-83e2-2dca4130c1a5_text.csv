They also have pitch which has pizza and wine specials on Tuesdays.  Downtown has plenty of restarunts to choose from!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"The dorms are very plain and already have furniture in them.  Plenty of bathroom space which is important considering Clarkson is predominately women.  Activities such as yoga and movie night available.  It is not in the best part of town so I would not consider walking anywhere at night but right on a busy street so the bus is available to get you where you need to go.  Close to Midtown, which is filled with restaurants and stores."

College Junior,1,"Hate It! You have to pay an outrageous amount for campus parking, and they ticket you anyways! I refused to pay and park in a neighborhood nearby but am concerned with upcoming winter weather how easy it will be to navigate my way thru the snow."
College Freshman,1,You pay for a expensive parking pass and yet there is never a spot available by 9am. There are not enough lots or space for parking near the school. It would help to have parking garages instead of single lots for the amount of people needing to park on campus & businesses near by

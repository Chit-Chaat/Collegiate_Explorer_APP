Sophomore,5,Professors have done a good job adjusting to online platform. They are very understanding and patient. Still receiving a great education
Sophomore,5,"Amazing place, amazing education, amazing culture. Food could be better. Professors are super thoughtful, considerate and helpful."
Sophomore,5,Professors adjusted well due to corona virus implications.  Smooth transition into online learning and happily signed up for more online classes following!
Sophomore,5,"Fantastic experience, professors truly care!  Job opportunities are readily available in the ""Nova Network"", strong sense of family, beautiful campus, incredible athletics"
Alum,5,N/A -  This section is not applicable to my experience - I was a full-time undergraduate student before COVID.
Alum,5,"Ample resources and facilities; caring, accessible professors who know their material, and an administration that sets high standards for both the academic curriculum and how it prepares students for professional life post-grad.  The sense of community is palpable, both on campus and after you graduate.  I was kind of annoyed with being forced to move off campus for senior year, but the school recently built senior dorms.  The Catholic aspect is in the background, but is not pushed."
Junior,5,Villanova's faculty has done the best they possibly could do in the unprecedented time of transitioning to online learning.
Junior,5,"Going to Villanova University was the best decision I have ever made. I have made my very best friends, joined new clubs and activities that I never even could picture myself doing in high school, and have the greatest professors and peers I could ask for."
Alum,5,"I took all of my classes on campus for Villanova University. While I have heard remarkable things about online Villanova graduate degree programs, I do not have any experience myself."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed attending Villanova University. From the rich diversity on campus to the array of extracurricular activities available to students, I felt both challenged and at home on campus. 

I was able to participate in various programs through the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Campus Ministry, the Center for Peace and Justice Education, etc. Basketball games, French Club, and missions trips were all integral aspects of my experience at Villanova. 

The academics at Villanova cannot be rivaled. Both of my undergraduate professors were attentive, understanding, challenging, and willing to engage with me as a student. I am still in contact with both of them ten years later and feel lucky to have been supported by them both through my academic career at Villanova. I appreciated being able to connect the passions I have in different academic areas all together!

I would highly recommend Villanova University to any interested student!"
Niche User,5,I unofficially visited Villanova University last summer.  I have also recently taken virtual tours there and joined some zooms.  The campus is beautiful and the buildings are amazing. Definitely a great environment!
Niche User,5,"Every professor was friendly and eager to help! The atmosphere is amazing there, and really feels connected and personal!"
Senior,5,"My experience at Villanova University has shaped me into the individual I am, both professionally and personallly. Villanova's academics, teachers and mentors, clubs and activities, and community spirit encouraged me (and made it comfortable for me) to go further out of my comfort zone and pushed me to become the best version of myself I could. I thoroughly loved my time at Villanova and everything I learned there inside of the classroom and out."
Freshman,5,"My freshman year at Villanova is coming to an end and it has been the best year of my life. Villanova is a place that once you get to know it, everyone calls it home. When we were forced to move out and switch to online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no one wanted to leave the place we've come to know and love (even though we knew it was necessary). It was so hard to leave Villanova early because of how great it is. Everyone is so nice and it is truly a community like no other. Before becoming a student, I heard a lot of people talk about the community at Villanova, but until you step on campus as a student you can't fully understand this community that everyone talks about, but I can tell you it something like no other."
Alum,5,"My dad is a Villanova alum and it is his pride and joy. He was extremely prepared for the business world after and continuously recognizes what the school did for him. He was in a fraternity and loved that as well. In fact his lifelong friends were his brothers. I adored the school when I visited as well and I cannot wait to be a student myself. The best part is probably the athletic events especially basketball, we are huge fans."
Alum,5,"As a recent graduate, I can firmly say that doing my undergrad at Villanova was the right choice. College is truly what you decide to make it. If you want to be challenged, seek those challenging courses and groups. Villanova offers those types of opportunities. I was able to challenge myself mentally and emotionally to figure out who I wanted to be and what I valued. Yes, the school in general is not diverse. You should know that coming in, but also understand that that could be a place where you can grow. I do not fit the average ""Nova"" stereotype, yet I found some of the greatest people and mentors that I am proud to know. Come time to find a job, the career center can be a hit or miss depending on the amount of effort you are willing to put in. Be committed and I can assure you that the investment will pay off greatly straight out of the gates (even when considering the average student debt)."
Sophomore,5,"Villanova University is not only a college, but it is a home. The welcoming community and sense of communal love from others is very unique to the school."
Graduate Student,5,"I absolutely love attending Villanova University. Not only is the campus one of the most beautiful that I've ever seen, my professors are amazing and the community care and feel is contagious."
Alum,5,Villanova is a great university. The teachers and students care very deeply about the community. My experience there prepared me for my professional career. I would recommend to anyone applying to undergrad or graduate school.
Junior,5,"The community and faculty are amazing! Everyone is willing and always seeking to help, encourage, love, and support others. It's an amazing environment and I am so thankful for my time and experience, especially transferring in my junior year. If I could do it all over again, I would have gone since freshmen year. Nonetheless, my experience was one to remember. Plus, with a stellar and fun basketball team to root for, it makes it all the more exciting!"
Junior,5,Amazing business school that puts great emphasis on professional development. The Big 4 accounting firms are always on campus recruiting for spring and summer internships.
Freshman,5,"I like that it is a homey campus, but it is difficult to get involved because you have to interview for most clubs."
Freshman,5,academics are amazing and the party scene is very fun. Many people call it villa-no-fun but that is not true
Junior,5,"One of the best parts of Villanova in my opinion is that it has a very welcoming and friendly environment. There are also plenty of clubs and opportunities to do community service, so it is not hard to get involved. Lastly, I think that the campus is beautiful and a fun place to be."
Freshman,5,It's an amazing experience being at Villanova University. The teachers and staff are so supportive and truly care about their students. The campus is beautiful and it is truly an honor to be attending Villanova University
Graduate Student,5,Villanova is an excellent school and I am proud to be a student. Campus is amazing and resources are excellent. Would like to see more diversity.
Freshman,5,"Very tight knit community where everyone looks out for one another, within weeks of being at Villanova I felt like I had a whole family of people who cared for me. Professors are very open and want to know each of you individually, they are so flexible and understanding and always willing to help! Before attending Villanova I thought it would be too small but for me itâ€™s proven to be perfect, athletics are on the rise and social life is never dull."
Niche User,5,The staff is super welcoming and the campus is absolutely amazing. I toured it this summer and everyone was very friendly and approachable.
Freshman,5,"I made the best decision coming here! As a current freshman nursing major, I can happily say (and reassure) the academics here are top notch and professors truly care about their students. Campus is a joy to be on, people here are very very nice, never have had a bad interaction with anyone. Diversity, as many people may know, is a weak point but we and the whole student body and faculty know that and are working hard to improve on it. This was my last choice college at first, and all my previous doubts and skeptical attitude were blown away. Community, friendliness, support, and a great time await here! Go Cats!!"
Freshman,5,I love it there. There's an amazing sense of community right from the start. The professors are great and the campus is beautiful. It's really fun to go to the sports games. It's also in a really safe neighborhood.
Niche User,5,"Villanova University is my top choice for colleges I look to attend in the fall of 2020. It is a beautiful campus with outstanding students and faculty. The church is magnificent and reminds me of my church where I currently live, giving the campus a ""homey"" feel. I love the dorms as they are spacious and modern. The curriculum focuses on the personal success of the individual, which I find extremely comforting and reassuring as I know the teachers will care for about my development as a person and professional. Overall, I hope to join the Wildcats as an incoming freshman."
Niche User,5,I loved my visit to Villanova University! I came on the Nursing preview day and was very impressed with the simulation labs and presentation of the many opportunities that Villanova has for their students.
Alum,5,"Community, school pride, tradition and course selections are amaing.
Financial aid needs to be improved & more options given to those in need. Perhaps more work/study programs."
Niche User,5,"Villanova has been a fantastic school for our daughter.  The atmosphere is high-spirited, friendly, supportive, welcoming, and challenging.  The faculty have been strong and the opportunities are endless."
Sophomore,5,"I love the community at Villanova. Everyone is so nice and supportive, especially the faculty. It made me feel really welcome."
Sophomore,5,"Everyone at Villanova University is outgoing and welcoming. The atmosphere at Villanova is friendly. The downside about Villanova is that there is a little bit of lack of diversity. Other than that, Villanova is a great institution!"
Junior,5,"Villanova University has the type of students who will hold the door open for you, even if they don't know you - in other words, it's a great feeling of community. It hits the sweet spot in terms of size, big enough for recognition academically on a national level but small enough that you get plenty of individualized instruction from professors. Everyone here genuinely wants you to succeed and its evident in how many free resources there are on campus to help you."
Freshman,5,Great sense of community.  Professors are really passionate and do an excellent job teaching the material.
Sophomore,5,Beautiful campus and wonderful community! The people make this place feel like home. Classes are relatively small and professors are available outside of class.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Villanova. The sense of community is apparent, and everyone is so involved. The school is actively preparing its students for the real world while having fun with sports like basketball. Students tend to be very well-rounded and kind. I love it here."
Niche User,5,Attending Villanova opens a whole new world of potential and a completely different understanding of family. The university holds a welcoming environment and supports further advancements in all of their students.
Sophomore,5,Love the feel of the campus. Safe town and lovely environment.  Curriculum is challenging and life changing.  Dorms could use some updating.
Niche User,5,Villanova is a great school. The overall school community is very warm and welcoming. Everyone is willing to help in any way they can :)
Freshman,5,"I love this school so far.  We have an excellent community full of loving and caring people which was ultimately why I chose to attend Villanova.  The professors are great and there are a lot of services that will ensure your academic success.  Beautiful campus, I just love it here."
Graduate Student,5,The online program has allowed me the flexibility to work and work on my Masters. The courses are expedited which allows students to earn their degree quickly.
Freshman,5,Beautiful location & campus.  Everyone is very friendly.   Sports are popular & there is great school spirit.  Academics are challenging and professors are professional & dedicated. we
Niche User,5,"I visited Villanova over the summer and was wowed by how friendly they were there. I got to talk to students at the Clay Center and it seems that their recruitment opportunities for finance students are outstanding. I'm really looking forward to becoming a Wildcat, but financial aid is still a question"
Sophomore,5,"The school spirit at Villanova is incredible.  From the basketball team to special olympics, there is a strong community that always comes together.  The scenery with the stone buildings are beautiful.  It is a medium sized school in the suburbs, but still close enough to Philadelphia to take a short train ride.  I love everything about it."
Sophomore,5,"I have had the most wonderful experience thus far at Villanova!  Faculty members are actively invested in your academic and personal success.  Classes are challenging in a productive way.  The entire campus is a supportive community that comes together for events such as Special Olympics and sports games.  Food and dorms are both better than I expected, and the campus and surrounding area are beautiful and very safe."
Sophomore,5,"I have found my home away from home at Villanova! The people, professors, and everyone in the area are so welcoming and kind. I love going to back to school!"
Junior,5,"Great school. Incredible professors.  Humanities department is one of the best in the country with professors who are engaging, knowledgeable and among the bests in their field."
Sophomore,5,"Villanova is a very welcoming school.  I felt like I was a part of something as soon as I stepped on campus.  However, the diversity can definitely be improved."
Sophomore,5,"Villanova is a wonderful, cultivating environment. The university encourages not only personal growth, but a strong sense of community."
Sophomore,5,"I've only been at Villanova for one year so far and I absolutely love it. I was so nervous when I first came to Nova; the school is far away from where I live in Illinois and I did not know anyone attending the school. I didn't know if I had made the right decision, but those feelings quickly went away as I began to meet some of the most amazing people I have ever met. Villanova is truly a close-knit community. I found myself surrounded by equally ambitious, driven, kind people. Along with all the amazing people I met, I had amazing professors at Villanova in the Villanova School of Business and outside of it through required courses like Ancients and Moderns that have helped me make connections outside of the school in the field I want to establish my career in. I could not imagine attending any other university; I found my home at Nova."
Junior,5,"I love Villanova so much. It truly lives out itâ€™s motto of caritas (Love), veritas (truth), and unitas (unity). As a community everyone is very inviting and there are so many so many different ways to get involved on campus. I currently participate in athletics and the baking club. What other school lets you cook in the dining hall? The professors are also great. Many of them are truly committed to your learning and will meet you based on your schedule instead what works best for them. The campus is also drop dead gorgeous. With just celebrating 175 yearâ€™s, Villanova doesnâ€™t look old. The campus is constantly being renovated over the summer months so each new year the students come back to the best college campus. The beautiful stone dorms and buildings are amazing to walk by to class. Villanova just completed a new walkway bridge and are in the process of building new apartments for seniors so that more students can stay on campus."
Alum,5,My alma mater has been the best experience of my life and the best investment I have made in education for my eldest son.
Junior,5,"My overall opinion of Villanova University is that it has truly earned its prestige. I chose Villanova University because I wanted a university where there was a strong sense of community and because of my experiences here, I know I have chosen the right college. Villanova's faculty and students put their best effort support each other. By the end of my freshman year, I had a multitude of encouraging mentors who I have appreciated as an extended support system. It is difficult for Computer Engineers to study abroad after your sophomore year. However, we are learning incredibly interesting and relevant skills by professors who are enthusiastic about the topics they teach. There are countless clubs of a wide variety that will fit everyone's interests, and if not, Villanova encourages students to begin clubs to suit more people. While the food isn't always great, I have come to Villanova to learn and grow professionally and personally, and I can attest that it is going wonderfully."
Freshman,5,The value and community in Nova are SOOOOOO good. Everyone really cares about each other and wants to change the world so how. Go Nova!!! Go Cats!!!
Freshman,5,"There's not too much diversity, but everyone is very nice and everyone accepts everyone else as part of nova nation! the campus is very nice and its great to be so close to philadelphia.  go cats!"
Sophomore,5,"I love being a part of the Villanova Community. I have found a home here among service organizations, Campus Ministry, Villanova Voices, and several other activities. While I agree that there are many valid criticisms about Villanova's lack of racial and socio-economic diversity, I also see how these issues inspire action among some groups of students. I am always impressed by the pride that students take in making this community as vibrant and inclusive as possible. The level of motivation and enthusiasm among Villanovans is inspiring.
Also- NATIONAL CHAMPIONS 2018!!!!!!! Thank you, and go cats \\V//"
Senior,4,"Villanova is a school filled with spirit and community, while pushing students to drive to become better academically and in extracurricular activities."
Senior,4,"Professors shifted to online learning with much effort and attempts to make the process as helpful for students, trying to aid in as many ways as possible."
Freshman,4,"Due to COVID-19, we were forced to make the shift to online classes. I found that my professors did an excellent job during this difficult transition, and were available to students."
Sophomore,4,I like how challenging the academics are at Villanova and how the faculty and staff push their students to the best of their abilities. I wish the school was more diverse and welcoming of their students.
Freshman,4,"Villanova is a great school with great people. I ended up making a great group of friends and felt very comfortable there. Think long and hard about whether or not this is a school you can afford though, because just like most private schools Villanova is very expensive. Basketball season is a ton of fun and everyone gets excited for it. The campus is beautiful and in my experience, my dorm was very nice, but thats not the case for everyone. All of my professors so far have been great teachers, and easy to talk to if you need it. Overall I say it is a fantastic school to attend if you are comfortable with the price"
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed Villanova very much. I had a good time on the campus, its very beautiful and the architecture is quite nice."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the whole community vibe here. People genuinely care about each other. Everyone is extremely likemindedâ€”with academics, sports, partying, friends etc. Once you find your spot, you will feel right at home. Thereâ€™s a lot to do on campus, but sometimes it can feel very cliquey or cult-y depending on what activities you do."
Senior,4,"Villanova is a wonderful campus that promotes diversity, community, and core values each person should strive to achieve. The community is great, and there are a lot of ways to get involved. However, too much of a focus has been placed on athletics. Athletes get special treatment (registering for classes before everyone, making professors move tests/class times, etc.) and this needs to change."
Sophomore,4,My first year at Villanova has been an enriching experience that has led me to gain new friends and a greater understanding of what I aspire to be when I have to enter the workplace. The campus scenery is beautiful and the university is constantly making changes to improve its appearance. I do hope that incoming freshmen next year will have better luck with financial aid as the university is the most generous when it comes to that.
Freshman,4,"Diversity factor is the one thing I was most afraid when I applied here however, the university most definitely takes this into consideration for their applicant pool. This year, I was surprised to see so many Asians on campus and was very pleased."
Sophomore,4,Villanova is a pretty good school that is becoming better and better every year. The school has good academics and a very pretty campus. Some things could be upgraded or improved upon.
Freshman,4,"There is something for everyone at Villanova. There are a vast amount of clubs, organizations, and sports opportunities for someone to become involved. The school community and pride are amazing. The classes are challenging but interesting and the faculty is very accessible. The only downside is the dorms could use some updating (compared to facilities at other schools I visited), but the University is working on that."
Junior,4,"Villanova is a great school academically but lacks in what many call the typical ""college experience"". Many have grown up in a bubble, which persists within the school. The school also lacks in diversity, which may be a culture shock to many who have grown up in a diverse environment. However, everyone is nice and class sizes are reasonable for personal attention from professors."
Sophomore,4,"While I am only a sophomore now at Villanova, I have had many experiences in only my first year. At times, it shows that the diversity on campus is lacking; however, there are many clubs and opportunities for students in a minority to see peers who look/are like them. Villanova is the 8th most expensive school in the country; however, there does seem to be a very good return on the investment. And I shouldn't even need to mention the 3x National Champions. Go Cats!"
Senior,4,Villanova is a great school. Professors really care about you as a student you just have to be willing to go meet with them. I would change and add more food places on campus
Freshman,4,"I am a Finance and MIS double major at Villanova's Business School and I have had an amazing experience so far. There are so many resources available and all the professors are always available to help and they all truly want you to succeed. Sometimes they help to put you in touch with recruiters from top companies and they even offer some interview prep advice. We also have peer tutors who are current students that counsel and help you. Honestly, the institutions in this school are set up in order to ensure that every student succeeds. It's a great school."
Freshman,4,Very competitive to get involved in clubs and other organizations. People are very nice always and it is not super cut-throat.
Sophomore,4,"Although there is somewhat of an academic challenge, you are a part of a network of people, who want to help and change the world for the better."
Freshman,4,"At first i disliked villanova- i was homesick and felt like there was no outlet for the stressful work (aka a struggle to party). But as the semester progressed, I met new friends, I managed my workload, and found it easier to go out at night. Villanova is not a top party school but the parties are fun, the students are friendly, and (if you manage to create a good schedule for yourself) the classes are interesting and the work is manageable (most of the time). Students do tend to be preppy, which I am not, but I do not feel discredited with having my own style. Love VU can't wait to go back."
Sophomore,4,"Villanova University has been great so far.  I am of the opinion that some professors take their courses too seriously, but I'm sure others would see that as a good thing.  I'd like to see Villanova shift its mindset toward its students.  Earlier this year, friends of mine were complaining about the scarcity of good private study spaces.  As a Sophomore and having been a Freshman last year, I found that it was difficult to find spots on campus where I could peacefully study with friends.  Also, something must be done about the food.  Dougherty Hall often has sparse selection and at some point in their service, they just completely run out of food.  I never waste a meal there, but the alternative, Belle Air Terrace, has palatable food."
Junior,4,"Villanova has great academics and the campus is beautiful. Surrounded by a quiet local town but still being close to the city is a big plus. Diversity could use improvement, but overall It's been a great experience."
Junior,4,"I am not religious and came only because I had a good amount of financial aid, but the school does not shove religion down one's face nor does it ignore other beliefs. It has a nice campus, great professors, and you'll have a good time with others."
Alum,4,"Great opportunities for those in the nursing and business school. That being said, they have a severe lack of focus on the College  Science. Very little research being done in the sciences, which is contrasted by constant renovations of other College buildings. As a biology major this was very frustrating. Overall a pretty friendly and welcome community. Good basketball team if you want that to be a part of your college career. Party scene is lacking if that is what you are looking for. There is no Greek row on campus so almost all night life happens off campus so get used to scrounging up pledge rides and paying for Ubers. Two of the three local campus bars also just closed down so it is unclear what that will lead to. Housing is fine. They have been expanding incoming freshman classes, but not expanding freshman dorms so most freshman now are forced into triples when in the past it was mostly doubles."
Sophomore,4,"Villanova is a wonderful blend of challenging courses and friendly support.  The classes you take are always geared towards preparing you for a professional career.  The workload can sometimes seem like much, but the student community is extremely open to helping.  There are several places on campus where students help with Mathematics and writing papers.  Plus the professors are always around for extra help.  Overall Villanova is perfect for students looking to challenge themselves and prepare for their career."
Alum,4,"I had incredible professors, intelligent classmates and met some of my favorite people that I will be friends with for the rest of my life. There is a really strong sense of ""community"" within the university that encourages deep, meaningful relationships. My major critique is that the student body is very homogenous - typically white from the Northeast in the upper-middle to upper class background. It is definitely something that allows for people to stay in a ""bubble,"" but Villanova provides a lot of different classes, service work and groups to introduce new ideas and opinions if you're interested. The social life wasn't similar to any of the major state universities - but basketball games are amazing, people like to go out and socialize and if Greek life is your thing it definitely has a presence (but if it's not your thing...it's definitely not a necessity to have social events to go to)."
Junior,4,"Great quality school, prepare to be burned out fast if you do not have plenty of money. There are plenty of opportunities to take advantage of because of the Alumni Association and the proximity to Philly."
Junior,4,The school definitely has good programs no matter what you major in. They are currently investing more money to improve the school which will allow for more activities. A downside of the school is that it struggles to create an inclusive community for students of color.
Niche User,4,"Villanova had a beautiful campus and the education is fantastic! As an intended business major, I was a little disappointed on how outdated the inside of the buildings were for a school that is so well known. I hope to see in the future some more renovations. Also on my tour they did not show us their sports complex which was disappointing since it is a major feature that draws so many prospective students to the school."
Freshman,4,"My first year here as an international student is not lonely as I expected. I got into the Learning Community Program that the university offers and it has been a meaningful experience, and also an easy way for me to connect and get to know the other freshmen coming here. This program is about first-year students choosing the same learning community in which they can live next to each other, go to the same classes, and that has made life in university much more comfortable and fun! The professors are great and kind, they always offer help when you have trouble understanding materials. The campus is beautiful, and there are many places you can stop by near Villanova. The spirit here is also fundamentally strong, can be manifested by the passion for basketball here, maybe because the school's team won the NCAA last year. Overall: Nova Nation!"
Freshman,4,I loved Villanova for the small community and individual learning experiences.  The school has great support for every sport and takes pride in their academics. This is truly a special place and I would recommend it to anyone.
College Senior,4,As far as I know there where no issues in this area during my time here.
College Senior,4,"I received my best fin aid/ scholarship packages from Villanova, and felt as if I had to put in little effort to do so. I had very high grades and very little money so they accommodated."
College Senior,4,"Villanova is great for graduate and undergraduate course work, there is alot to offer. Make sure you are aggressive with your advisors to make sure you get everything properly planned out for future careers. Also it is expensive as hell so make sure you have a scholarship."
College Sophomore,4,Students and Professors work very well together to make sure all students succeed. Everyone has been very friendly.
College Sophomore,4,I have not yet attempted to get an internship through Villanova.
College Sophomore,4,Professors are very passionate about the subject they are teaching and are experts. They want the best for their students.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus. I have never felt scared to walk alone at night or ant other time of the day.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is not a necessity on Villanova's campus.
College Sophomore,4,I believe that everyone supports each other when it comes to sports.
College Junior,4,The nursing courses are challenging for me. I'm definitely better at the bedside than taking tests. I have learned a lot and am excited to continue to do so. I really like my friends. Sometimes it's difficult to choose between C fiends and academics. The class sizes are great. I like the living situations. The nursing professors really care about me having success.
College Junior,4,"I love the school spirit, especially with the basketball team. It's amazing that everyone is excited for the games and come together to cheer them on. I also really like the nursing program. I am learning such valuable skills to be the best nurse I can be. I would choose my school again. I love my friends. I wish tuition and board weren't so expensive, though."
College Sophomore,4,"As all other colleges, there is drugs. Mostly alcohol and marijuana, but I have never seen anyone do a ""hard drug"", I know of some but it ain't that popular."
College Junior,4,Arming of public safety will increase protection.  I never feel unsafe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,The number of students who are enrolled in graduate school or have internships or full-time jobs upon graduation is immense.
College Sophomore,4,Some things can be improved but for the most part it's been a good experience.
College Sophomore,4,Don't like the fact that public safety will be armed.
College Sophomore,4,"I had a great freshmen year and although everything about the school is not perfect (certain campus facilities, lack of diversity, etc.) I feel as though the Villanova community is very interconnected and offers a strong support system."
College Sophomore,4,I genuinely feel as though all the professors are eager to see me succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"The quality of the courses are excellent. I get a great load of information out of my classes that are highly useful. So far, my professors have been very intriguing and have a passion for the subject they teach. Of course there are those professors who seem to hate life, and simply teach for the money, but then you find some who are very interested in their profession and have a desire to help students pass. The class sizes are usually great. Small classes are easier and help you connect with the students in the class, as well as with the professor."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, it's alright. There's a lot that can be improved throughout the school so I look forward to going back for my sophomore year and doing something about these things that can be improved."
College Senior,4,"Everyone gets jobs. Internships, not necessarily."
College Senior,4,"Quality of education is great. Teachers (in engineering at least) are either amazing or leave a lot to be desired. Thankfully, more of the former."
College Senior,4,"Public Safety is the butt of many jokes, but they do a good job keeping students safe and secure. The area is extremely wealthy and nothing really happens."
College Senior,4,I'm not an athlete. But the amount of energy on campus when Villanova won it all was electric.
College Junior,4,"As a Biology major, all my professors in science or math courses have been very knowledgeable and intelligent.  There is a wide variety of classes, but they require taking the intro courses first (naturally).  The science courses are very very challenging, but it is also very possible to do well or get A's, as the professors are very willing to help if needed."
College Junior,4,"I've never felt anything but safe and I routinely walk back from the library very late at night/early in the morning. No one I know has any type of issue with safety.  

I've always liked the Health Center, though I know not everyone does.  They've always treated me quickly and well, they give lots of free stuff (food, drinks, OTC painkillers, bandages, etc...), they have rooms with private bathrooms and TVs for you to stay in for free overnight if you are really sick or hurt for as long as you need (which I have used), and they can transfer you to a very close nearby hospital for anything serious very easily (as I have also needed to do).  All very good."
College Junior,4,"Tons of support for the basketball team.  Other sports have their fans and supporters too, but not like the basketball team does.  This is especially true during the Big East and National tournaments.

There are lots of places to play basketball, but there are always lots of people waiting to play.  The courts are, for the most part, very well constructed, but sometimes there just isn't enough space."
College Junior,4,"It has been a great experience so far.  Especially with the NCAA national championship, everyone on campus, even those not interested in sports, really seemed to come together.  The professors (or at least the ones I've taken) are very intelligent and willing to meet with you outside of class if you have any issues or difficulties."
College Freshman,4,"Campus is relatively safe, specially now, because Public Safety is being armed."
College Freshman,4,I've had an excellent time
Sophomore,2,It is very expensive and not as educational. it is harder to stay focused and it is hard for professors to teach well. this is new to everyone and the university is not helping us at all
Freshman,2,"I was so thrilled to go to my number one choice school. Everyone said how no matter who you are youâ€™ll fit right in. I have always Had a solid group of friends and coming to nova I thought itâ€™d be the same. It was not. The first month of school is when all friendships are made and if you donâ€™t meet people then, youâ€™re out of luck. Everyone is preppy, judgemental and too competitive. No one is All that  friendly, itâ€™s a mask during the tours. You have to interview for every club and the only way to get into almost anything is through connections. The dorm I lived in was wonderful and the food is great. The people are very phony though and want to party all the time even though the parties are not that great. If youâ€™re a rich, white brat, this is the place for you. If not, donâ€™t come. What you see on the tours is not the real Villanova."
Junior,2,"The professors and dorms are great and have so far been the best part of my experience. However, the lack of a party scene is very disconcerting. The worst part of Villanova, however, has to be the upper-level faculty. My entire time at Villanova I have felt completely invisible to the non-professor faculty in my college and the overall school. They donâ€™t do enough to care for individual students and makes you feel I cared for, impeding the fun Iâ€™ve had here, my courses I can take, and the overall student life."
Freshman,2,I wish to see the campus dinning halls to add more options maybe even common fast food places on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"It is pretty easy to tell that most people that attend this university are white, upper middle class/upper class, and christian. The attitude isn't bad towards people who don't fit in however. From my experience, everyone has been very accepting. There is a pretty large block of students that come here from Puerto Rico."
College Sophomore,2,"The housing needs A LOT of improvement. There is not enough space for the amount of students that now go to the university. I also feel as though seniors should be able to live on campus. I think it is unusual that South Campus, where freshmans reside, has the largest rooms on campus in comparison to the rest of the housing for upperclassmen. It is a huge downgrade going from a decent size room, to a very small room on Main Campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Though I lucked out freshman year and only have one roommate, many students ended up in forced triple rooms (meaning rooms built for two people that they are now cramming three students into). Furthermore, my sophomore year housing is very old, does not have air conditioning, and there is a great lack of cleanliness."
College Freshman,2,"majority of people are white, and crazy wealthy. like people have planes, multiple houses, crazy things. everyone here has money. however, they do not flaunt it. villanova is very accepting. most people are preppy to class, but dress like they are going to a bar on the weekends (most are). nobody really cares if you have money or nice cars or whatever, its just people do."
College Freshman,2,Tight dorms. Obnoxious RA's. Best to live off
College Freshman,2,"Freshman semester is pretty rough for guys, but at any school where you rush second semester this is to be expected. The main thing that I was taken aback by was the general hostility between students ""competing for grades"". I use this phrase lightly as nobody's grade will be harmed by another individual's success. Additionally, the student body lacks any diversity. For some people, this is a great thing. However, it did not allow me to branch out in the manner that I believed college would enable me to do. In part, this is due to my own lack of investigation. On the surface it is very obvious that almost all students are from a wealthy background. However, it was not until I arrived on campus that I determined that this is this school at its heart. It is more of an elitist institution and less like an educational environment. But hey, you can't win them all. So I'm chalking up the decision to attend this institution as an L, just make sure its a good fit before you make the same mistake I did."
College Senior,2,"I think they're racist, classist, and there are very few diversity greek organizations."
College Senior,2,"Not the type of students you want to be around if you want to be inspired and do something amazing in the world. Rich ignorant and white makes up of about 70% of the student population as well as faculty. The business school has great connections and can get you to wall street if that's where you want, but overall it's a place perfect for people with a culture materialism. Miserable location with nothing much around. Hard to have a life outside of school without a car."
College Freshman,2,Public safety can be annoying sometimes. Depends.
College Freshman,2,This is not the University's fault but instead Radnor Township. Throughout my time at Villanova I heard kids complain about Radnor all of the time. Radnor has strict rules and it is part of the reason the prices to go out and to have a house near campus is so expensive. They have strict laws that govern how many people can live in each house.
College Freshman,2,The Spit and Pit may initially seem like good options but the food ends up being disgusting after a month or two. The options that Villanova offers are very bland and obviously need to be rethought. It would be nice if the school had more options like Starbucks and chain restaurants on campus to give the students a change in taste. There are no good options to eat off campus for college students unless you would like to go a mile away into Bryn Mawr.
College Freshman,2,The campus housing is awful for freshman. The reason that the tours do not take you to the freshman campus is because 1) it is far and 2) it has the ugliest buildings on campus. The surrounding area does not allow many options for upperclassmen and students are forced to live on campus for atlas 2 years. Some students do better living off campus rather than on campus and it is hard to see why Villanova does not allow for students to do so.
College Sophomore,2,very expensive and far from cammpus
College Sophomore,2,Very stressful. Bursar's office is filled with evil people
College Freshman,2,"I don't know the details of the school's finances, but I really think they could do better with aid. I received a decent grant, but considering how much the school costs to begin with, it doesn't help all that much."
College Freshman,2,There is very little diversity here at villanova.
College Senior,2,Very difficult with low university endowment and high tuition and fees.
College Junior,2,Greek life at Villanova in recent years has been cracked down on by the university and local police.
College Junior,2,The off-campus housing is hard to get and very  expensive
College Senior,2,Administration very strict about underage drinking in dorms; difficult to get off campus without a car/under 21
College Senior,2,"Unless you are over 21, the party scene is pretty much non existent."
College Senior,2,"Most restaurants are outside the budget of off campus residents.  Fast food joints and convenience stores are commonplace, with grocery stores being the major option for better quality food."
College Freshman,2,Frequently sending emails just to get the awards and aid that I rightfully earned and deserved makes the process more complicated than it should be.
College Freshman,2,"People involved in Greek life isolate themselves from people not involved.  Even though it doesn't have a massive presence, those involved make it bigger than it appears."
College Junior,2,"Villanova is not very diverse, but they are trying to make the school a more diverse place."
College Sophomore,2,"It's hard to be any race other than Caucasian, people look at you differently because you don't look like the rest of them. It's hard to be poor when everyone else is wearing designer clothes and the latest fashions while you are barely paying for tuition."
College Freshman,2,They do not offer many scholarships. It is poor. There is just the presidents scholarship.
College Junior,2,"The nightlife at Villanova is not good. The people are great but the places to party are not good. The bars are raided by police and are overcrowded. The greek life housing is not on campus and not funded by the school so the courts are terrible. 

Once 21 the options get much better. Philly is a plus of the nightlife."
College Junior,2,"80 percent white! The diversity is not very good at Villanova in terms of religion or race. There are some international students, more than I expected, but not a lot. Being catholic I don't think people expect there to be a lot of religious diversity."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is not diverse at all, although in recent years we have become aware of this dearth and have made efforts to rectify it. It is much more diverse than it was 10 years ago."
College Sophomore,2,The only options are the bars (ID needed) and frats (trashy). Cabs are expensive and pledge rides are unreliable. The nightlife is poor.
College Sophomore,2,Villanova is predominantly white. The lack of diversity is a bit disappointing since I am a student of mixed heritage.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek Life is overly hyped up at Villanova. I am a member of a social sorority on campus and because there is no housing and overly monitored social scenes, the social aspect of being in a sorority is nothing special."
College Student,2,"Very strict, easy to get around it."
College Freshman,2,You pay way too much for some horrible dorms freshman and sophomore year.  Junior year is super nice though!
College Sophomore,2,"IMPORTANT: Diversity is defined by much more than the characteristics described in this review, however, based on what was given, the ""diversity"" in these terms is poor. A majority of the school is white, upper-class, Catholic, and heterosexual. Minorities are accepted, but often cluster together with others ""like them."" This leads to a picture that seems that it is almost segregated. However, people are extremely open to other beliefs and the campus and university itself is very accepting and tolerant."
College Sophomore,2,"The housing here is determine by class rank. so Freshman are furthest away from classes, sophomores are on main campus (where all the class buildings are located) and juniors have apartments (a little farther away from classes). The lottery for housing is VERY competitive. If you don't have a good registration time, or your roommate(s) don't, you'll probably live somewhere away from main campus."
College Freshman,2,It's pretty hard to get any scholarships or aid if you don't have a strong need for it
College Freshman,2,"Basically the only way to get anywhere around campus is with taxis. There is a shuttle that takes students to the KOP mall every friday and saturday, which is nice, but you have to make sure you catch one of its few departure times."
College Freshman,2,"I thought diversity didn't matter to me until I took a closer look and realized that it's sometimes called ""Vanillanova"" for a reason. Most students come from middle/upper-middle/upper class families and are primarily Anglo-Saxon. There are your groups of minorities, Asians, Indians, Blacks, and other foreigners, but they most stay within their groups."
College Freshman,2,"Transportation is pretty much limited to the trains. Freshman and sophomores aren't allowed cars on campus which is really annoying because nothing on the main line is in walking distance. The main line is better accessible by car anyway, and having to pay to take a train to different parts is irritating. Costs aren't too bad, but it adds up. The shuttle is fine, but it's a hassle to have to figure out the schedule."
College Freshman,2,"Drinking occurs pretty often especially anytime between ""thirsty Thursday"" into Sunday. With the presence of social events run by frats and sororities, and event sports games, many students feel the need to ""pre-game"" and usually end up going out afterwards and drinking there as well. There's not much anyone can really do since students are pretty good at hiding the drinking, but I feel as though it's pretty common to most college atmospheres."
College Freshman,2,"We equate Campus Safety with those awkward hookups you have on the weekend. You see them, and it's like the Monday after: you run. Nothing good ever comes out of Campus Safety. If they think you possibly may have been drinking, you'll get in trouble. You learn very quickly how to avoid them though."
College Sophomore,2,People in town suck always calling Radnor police to break up things. Stuffy upper middle class white people. Wont let the school build an ice rink or a bigger football stadium so we can advance out of D1 AA aka the joke league of NCAA football
College Sophomore,2,"There is only one off campus fast food place that is close enough to walk to. The quality is sub-par. The price is a little high. The only thing it has going for it is that it opens very late. If you want food off campus, you need to have a car. "
College Sophomore,2,The lectures are super hard and workload is too much.
College Sophomore,2,Its hard to maintain good grades and have a life. 
College Sophomore,2,The school is extremely white dominated. 
College Junior,2,"Villanova is pretty small, so parking is an issue. The cost of having a parking permit is fairly expensive. There are really only three places to find parking: two large lots along the main street which is far from classes and only close to two of the dorms, the on campus apartment parking spots, and main campus parking lot. There is parking available in the main lots, but since it is far away from most buildings, people prefer the main campus parking lot. This lot however has a limited number of spots and is usually occupied by faculty. "
College Freshman,2,"Public safety is easy to avoid if you're not an idiot. The problem arises with the RAs who are on-duty and walk around. They'll knock on your door if it's too loud and then if they find alcohol, you'll get written up. I assume it gets better when you're not a freshman though."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people drink and like to party. The school obviously dislikes this because it's Catholic. RA's are EXTREMELY annoying because they basically hover over the halls to make sure everyone is following the rules. It sucks because it makes students feel like they're at camp/being babysat. It's really easy to get written up, so a lot of students go off campus for their partying needs instead of dorm parties. You'll never see alcohol bottles lined up against a dorm wall or beer pong games in the dorms because of the RA's. You see plenty of that stuff at the parties held off-campus though, so it's not a terrible situation, but it is annoying. Drugs are somewhat present but nobody cares or notices if you do them or not. If you don't like to drink/party, you won't feel any pressure to do so. "
College Freshman,2,"The nightlife is a joke. Everyone on campus wants to go out, but Villanova's strict public safety officials and the county police make each night a legitimate risk. Cops raid bars and party, happily handing out underages. The RA's are also terrible, I know over 50 friends that have been written up in their first semester."
College Freshman,2,"Freshman aren't allowed to park on campus, even though there is a big parking lot right by the freshman dorms."
College Freshman,2,The majority of people on campus are white.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not many students receive much aid, but Villanova is aware of this and is trying to change it for incoming students."
Recent Alumnus,2,Everyone in my group of friends has been written up at least once this semester.
Senior,1,"DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU ARE A STUDENT OF A MARGINALIZED GROUP. Special emphasis on if you are a low income student or 1st generation. I had been forced into signing a contract with the bursar office, since I was seen as a ""high risk student"" in regards to being able to pay my bill since I had been paying for school on my own. I had almost been kicked out and forced to take a year off due to this. I had requested multiple meetings with the head of the school to avoid signing the contract I was forced to sign but he was unavailable and there was no one to help me. The following year, they had published me in their magazine about how brave it is for a 1st generation student to take all this responsibility on. If you rely on financial aid, The financial aid office never completes their paperwork on time. Meaning bursar office will bill you a 200$ late fee every 2 weeks for something you can not control. But don't fight it. Thats how I got forced to sign my contract. Just shut up and pay."
Sophomore,1,"Villanova is a complete disappointment. The teachers are comparable to a mid-tier Catholic high school and provide little support to the students.  The student body is completely homogenous - it's primarily white suburban kids from the northeast, most of whom came from Catholic schools.  Don't expect to find much diversity in though here.  For the same high tuition you can go to a multitude of excellent liberal arts colleges where the teaching is significantly better."
Sophomore,1,"The school is clearly overrated. The professors are extremely incompetent and have NO passion about teaching their students. It seems they don't care about our success but only their research. No wonder it was ranked so high, but definitely not for teaching. Go for Villanova if you want reputation, choose somewhere else if you want real QUALITY."
College Sophomore,1,Villanofun is in no way a good school to attend
College Sophomore,1,"I have never experienced such unqualified faculty, rude administration, and ignorant people. I can genuinely say I have never been to the financial aid office, bursars office, housing office, or any other form of administration without being screamed at. This school is run by greed and ignorance, and really rude people. They waited for me to put my deposit down before taking away my entire financial aid. They decided my mother's cancer treatments were an optional expense that should've been used for college instead. They literally won't give me my transcripts so I can transfer out of here. The teachers are uneducated and try to make up for their lack of knowledge by being unreasonable harsh. If i could do it over, I would have never stepped foot on this pretentious greedy campus run by idiots. Don't waste your time or money"
Recent Alumnus,1,Public Safety really cares about your safety so do not act drunk in front of them because they will send you to the hospital.
College Freshman,1,Public Safety goes out of their way to break up the most innocent get togethers on campus.
College Freshman,1,Villanova University gives out close to no merit scholarship. They only give out $1 Milllion (that is only 4 full rides to the school on merit). However they give out about $36 Million of financial aid.
College Freshman,1,"I am a very social student at Villanova University and I am in a fraternity. I go out every weekend and spend most nights with my friends. However, this school really is lacking. Public Safety is too strict on college students. All of the parties are at least 15 minutes off campus and you need to get pledge rides or an Uber to get to them. Also, if you are not in a fraternity you are required to pay to get into the parties. The houses that you go to for parties are always in other towns and frequently you have to get into a packed car with other college students and get to a party. The parties are not always fun because the kids here do not know how to have fun."
College Junior,1,"They don't call it ""Vanilla-nova"" for no reason. No diversity."
College Junior,1,It is almost impossible to receive any financial aid.
College Sophomore,1,"Villanova or ""Vanilla-Nova"" is an overwhelming ""white catholic school"". They definitely fit the stereotype. It can be a little frustrating if you are a minority because Villanova does not have very diverse activities. If you want that, you can create one. It is a VERY homogeneous school and can get on your nerves a little if you like a diverse environment. However, the school has a good reputation and a strong sense of community even though it is fairly ""white""."
College Freshman,1,"As anyone will tell you, ""Villanofun"" is a common nickname not because of the students, but because of administration and, especially, Radnor police. Since the main line is such an upscale area, the local police have nothing better to do than break up parties within an hour of them starting and citing students on petty crimes."
College Sophomore,1,"No on campus houses, exclusive parties that suck more often than not. Greek life is a joke at Nova. attracts a lot of spoiled highstrung kids. some people become jerks others are good kids. waste of money"
College Sophomore,1,"If you come from an upper middle class family and like wearing vinyard vines, patagonia, duck boots, sperry's, pastels, pants with nautical symbols on them and other such clothing and require little to no financial aid, you will do very well at Villanova. If you come from any other background, you will be fine, but don't expect to be going to bangers every weekend (because you are not getting into a top/ middle tier frat) unless you are an athlete on a respectable team (no offense crew/track and field). Senior year is a good time for most since the bars are now a viable and desirable option, and you wont get thrown out 40% of the time like in previous years. "
College Sophomore,1,The sports team gets the best housing while everybody else get whatever space that is still open. It is usually far from classes and are is bad condition. 
College Freshman,1,Villanova is a very strict school. Don't expect to get away with much.
College Freshman,1,"Unless Philadelphia is included in local atmosphere (which it isn't because its a 20 minute train ride away) the local atmosphere is very poor and not tailored towards college students. Villanova is a college dropped in the middle of a wealthy neighborhood therefore not providing students with lower end options of well, anything. The nearest drugstore is a 15 minute walk away. Due to the fact that we can't have cars as freshman OR sophmores, it is difficult to get anywhere off campus. The locals also hate us. The town refuses to let the University build fraternity houses and the local apartment complex where most upperclassman live has been sued by the town, resulting in cameras being installed in all hallways, a ban on kegs, and the police showing up every weekend night at midnight. On a positive note, this is probably the safest area you could possibly go to school in. There is zero crime (hence why the cops are constantly up our ass)."
College Sophomore,1,The local atmosphere at Villanova is practically nonexistent.  The campus keeps to themselves and does not interact with the outside community.
College Sophomore,1,"The diversity at Villanova is truly lacking.  All white, all east-coast."

There is always some kind of event going on whether it be a play, movie night, or even free pizza out on the gazebo. It makes going to college seem a lot less daunting. I love PSC!"
Niche User,5,"Being a dual enrolled high school student was really a cool experience. I'm glad PSC offered the dual enrollment program to schools in our area because it gave me college coursework experience and college credits. Everyone i have encountered at PSC has been amazing; Professor or student. The things that I wish were different are that PSC should have bigger campuses so that they can house students on all their campuses, they should offer more specialized classes, and they should would with students more with their schedule and classwork if a class is missed."
Junior,5,"The teachers, from my experience, are all friendly and extremely understanding of circumstances. Additionally, there's plenty of opportunities to improve your grades through volunteer work or by receiving on-campus tutoring."

Junior,5,The counselors are really easy to work with. They have helped me set up my schedule and apply all online since I do not have access yet to an online campus. They are also very personal with you meaning you are just not another student. The counselor that you are assigned to actually remembers whom you are. This is nice for a 4 year university.
Sophomore,5,"I have been attending psc since Jan 2017 , I am currently going for pharmacy. My college experience has been fun and rought. Psc allows me to utilize my time with free and or discounted content offered by the school. I enjoy the library and the computer lab. Psc is kept up very well and the environment is always welcoming. The tutoring lab is my favorite, Max is a genius in chemistry. Psc has allowed me to better myself and put me on the right road for sucess."
Senior,5,"I absolutely love this college!! Beginning with the Financial Aid office...yes, there are times that it takes forever to get paperwork approved but compared to Faulkner (now Coastal) they do not take as long! The instructors are great and they will work with you (as long as you tell them what's going on). I've absolutely enjoyed going to this college. I'll choose the 45-55 minute drive going here than the 25 minute drive going to Coastal."
Sophomore,5,Pensacola state provides affordable education along side accredited classes that matter and transfer. It is a great school to earn a degree at or even start with!
Junior,5,"Five, We love you, well to be more specific, I love you. Without you we would not have the right number of fingers- 5. We would have the same problem with our toes -5. The days of the week would be seriously messed up -5. The list could go on ad nauseum but suffice to say you are needed and definitely wanted.
5, we want you to know you are part of us, you matter to us, and without you, well life would just not be the same. So many numbers have tried to be you, but no one ever said "" give a high four, or give a high six no, no we all give a high five"""

Freshman,5,"Pensacola State College is an amazing college. It is full of life and different ethnicities and experiences for new and old college students. It's a new environment and a very welcoming environment too. The professors are very nice and helpful. Always trying to find a way to help their students any way they can.  I've been able to find my way around the campus very easily. I've met very cool and out-going people around campus and in class. Even though, classes are cold, I learn a lot in the few hours I'm in class. I'm also able to help my classmates who, aren't as familiar with some of our assignments, which is ok. Pensacola State College so far, as a college freshman, I think is an amazing way to start off your first year of college at!"
Sophomore,5,As a dual enrollment student at Pensacola State College I have never felt more independent. The professors are very patient and willing to help almost 24/7.

Sophomore,5,"As a first time college student PSC has been an excellent adventure. The advisers are helpful as well as informative. The professors are inspirational and push you to succeed. PSC has published three pieces of my writing over the past two years encouraging me to continue writing on the side and not just for an assignment.

PSC could use more options of food services on campus."
Niche User,5,I have been very pleased with all of the staff I have encountered at Pensacola State.  Everyone I have contacted has been very helpful with any questions I may have. They are all quick to respond to emails and phone calls while also being patient and answering each question fully.

Freshman,5,I absolutely love this school. They are so helpful in anything you need from financial aid to finding the right program for you!

College Junior,5,I love Pensacola State College. It is a very relaxed atmosphere. Professors are very approachable.
Recent Alumnus,5,"From the admissions process to a term away from graduation, PSC has been extremely helpful.  Everyone I have asked for help has either pointed me in the right direction, or they have helped me stay on track for my degree.  The cost for classes is reasonable.  I do not qualify for financial aide, but I have been able to easily apply for in house loans to prevent from having undergraduate debt.  I have also been awarded scholarships to help ease my financial burden of paying out of pocket 100 percent for my college degree."
College Junior,5,The grading process is easy and fair
College Junior,5,"The classromms are very nice and you have enough room to perform your duties, as classwork not like you are stuck bteween peope."
College Junior,5,I enjoy each day at Pensacola state college
College Junior,5,The staff is wonderful in how they teach and respect each student.
College Junior,5,Pensacola State is a very good school. Everyone there wants to see you succeed. They make you feel like you are part of a family.
College Senior,5,Classes are somewhat interesting then other times annoying depending on who you are chosen to work with. Some students are OK or others have their days. The chef in the class is usually happy and a joy to be around. But the overall class experience is like a roller coaster ride. Some days you love it and other days you are like what time is class over? When I go to class everyday I am committed every step of the way just like my teacher is to me. But that's what you have to be regardless of how you feel unless you get sick physically or a life or death situation arises that's the only times you should take off but then get back in the game.
College Senior,5,"The reason I decided to join this field of expertise is because of my mother. Cooking helps me to remember her spirit and helps me to get through life everyday since I lost her 24 years ago on July 31, 1992. Cooking and family time around the table is what I remember the most about my mother because it was very important to her and most of all me. Around the I had a chance to talk to her about her day and learn how to cook too when she was cooking she made the best homemade hamburgers and milkshakes whichb knock your socks off. Oh my god my mom was an awesome cook. So when I gain entrance to the program I expect to learn a ton of different information and skills so I can better perfect what I know. Also when I first started cooking or baking as a child I felt my calling then and have been fighting to be all I could ever become cooking and entertaining others. I hope to someday with all the information and hands on experience in class or working at a restaurant to be a personnel chef for Hillary Rodham Clinton and her family or maybe President Barack Obama and his family. I would love to work for anyone of our world leaders someday down the road but I have to first get the experience. So it's just a joy and blessing just to be in the field I am currently in."
College Senior,5,All I would say is I love the environment of Pensacola State College because when you are there it becomes home to you. You grow and learn in every way for your degree or career interests just apply yourself is all you can do when you attend there. Also sign up for clubs so you can give back to the community and shape yourself into a well-rounded individual.
College Senior,5,"The professors are absolutely wonderful for the most part, of course you have the few duds you want to avoid. I feel like the professors really care about your education and you can tell that most of them are there because they actually enjoy teaching, not just for the paycheck. The class sizes are awesome as well, I have been attending PSC for 3 years and I think the largest class size I have been in is about 25 people tops."
Sophomore,4,The teachers here at PSC really do care about you. They are always here to help and always answer your emails in a very timely manner.
Graduate Student,4,"Is not easy to stay at home for the safety of others. However, taking an online course is very manageable and easy going. All online professors were willing to help their students. Online courses are easy to understand."
Graduate Student,4,Pensacola State College is a diverse and adventurous experience you'll ever have. All of the courses are very straight forward and the professor is very welcome to help any students in need. The campus may seem quite small but is very open for voluntarism and activities everyone can participate in. I enjoy spending my time here.
Sophomore,4,Having multiple campuses is a huge plus. Most everyone is easy to interact with and easy to keep in contact with.
Sophomore,4,"I have taken online courses during the Corona virus pandemic. For the most part they have been very similar to face-to-face classes. Lectures are via Zoom. Homework and quizzes are online. Zoom sessions are recorded which is a plus, because you are able to go back and re-watch them."
Sophomore,4,Overall quality of education is good. Students could be friendlier but are nice for the most part. Most of the teachers I have had have been great. I recommend Pensacola State College.
Senior,4,Pensacola State college offers a variety of degrees and programs. I am currently in the LPN program on the Warrington campus. The nursing program is very complex and offers multiple routes you can tackle and have a high success rate with passing state board exams! I feel confident that I have a well rounded education and looking forward to moving forward with my education at Pensacola State College.
Niche User,4,I am in the early stages of registering but so far the communication has been very helpful. I am excited.
Alum,4,"Small class sizes, with only one class I had to drop because of the teacher. My professors were willing to help me and answer questions, and I learned a lot from my classes. The campus varies wildly based on which one you're at, and which building. The Pensacola campus is huge compared to Milton but Milton is more updated in some areas. Fantastic opportunities to dual-enroll here as a high school student. I'm happy with my experience, but part of me wishes I got more involved with activities. It can be difficult to get the classes you want with times that work for you. Also, I recommend mostly figuring out your class schedule and degree plan yourself with the online resources, because it's very difficult and time consuming to get in to see an advisor"
Freshman,4,Pensacola State College has been a great school! The professors have gone out of their way to ensure my success. The campus is very welcoming and spread out. This school has been a key in my academic success.
Niche User,4,"I enjoy this school. I duel enrolled my junior and senior year of school. The staff is very helpful and it's a community college so there is a lot of diversity. People are here from all ages, careers, and backgrounds. The Pensacola location is right next to the mall, and has housing close by that you could definitely afford with a roommate."
Niche User,4,I kind of wish there were more events for new students to get involved in and hang out with peers. I also wish there were new food places on campus. All there is is a coffee shop and a subway.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Pensacola State College and although I have just entered college I must say so far this school is very good. First, semester I only had 2 classes because I wanted to get use to the "" college life"", but once I got a flow of everything I got a good grasp on things. I had English and Math and both teachers were very excellence I understood everything they taught us and they spoke clearly and loudly. The second semester was a breeze made all A's in my 4 classes! thanks to my teachers. Also what I like about PSC teachers is they don't give up on you they actually believe in you and wants the best for you."
Sophomore,4,"I had the opportunity of attending this college through dual enrollment. As a high school student attending college, this was a good experience and way of getting my feet wet into the whole college experience. It's easy to get around and its not so overwhelming. Overall, I had a really great experience."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year. It's great so far. I really enjoy the campus layout and the great people I've met. My professors are very helpful and I'm enjoying my classes. 
Parking is very convenient and close to my classes and the staff on campus are pleasant."
Sophomore,4,I have joined Pensacola State in Summer of 2019. I loved the environment and how active students and the professors are. The staff encourage students to be more control and alert of their education. Which I found very fascinating because not only they care about the students well being but being able to see the students be successful shows the vale of the school.
Niche User,4,I have been dual enrolled at Pensacola State College for the past three years and have never been disappointed in the professors or quality of education in my entire time of being here.
Freshman,4,I enjoy PSC. The campus is very easy to get around. Teachers are professional and very good at teaching their material. The bookstore has good staffing but yes very hectic with students.
Freshman,4,"Pensacola State College has beautiful campuses. I like that the classes are not too big, offering a more one-on-one learning experience; though, the advisors/counselors in the front office seem to never be there or are too busy."
Freshman,4,For the most part they help you understand all the steps you need to follow; If you're a new student and any questions I've had they have been able to answer me.
Sophomore,4,PSC is a good little state college. It's placed in a good area right next to the mall and a short distance from everywhere.
Niche User,4,Good stepping stone to higher education.  I was always given the financial aide. It is hard to stay in school though. There is a huge lack of motivation but if you can find it the it's worth it.
Sophomore,4,I like the teachers here and the fact that we have a math lab to help with math tutoring was a big help. Multiple campuses so you can go to whichever ones closest and the teachers work with you.
Sophomore,4,"I started at Pensacola State in August of 2017. I enjoyed the school for what it is, the school may feel old but there are some good teachers there. I may have a different viewpoint as I am a full time employee but for those just going to school it's great and affordable."
Sophomore,4,I have attended Pensacola State College for a while. I have always had good experiences at Pensacola State College.
Sophomore,4,"Broadcast classes are pretty awful; there are a lot of technical problems which affect the learning experience. However, lecture classes have always been an awesome experience and I've never had a problem with administraton or staff. Everyone is very nice and helpful and stress less week is something to always look forward to during finals week!"
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the majority of the instructors at the school in my 80+ credit hours of experience. They are willing to work with students who put forth effort early in the semester. Students who work hard get great feedback from the professors, especially in the math department.

What I didn't enjoy about the school was the admissions office. I was told I wouldn't graduate because of a nontrivial change the school made to my degree. I was told that everything would be changed in 2 weeks. I spoke to 4 separate people in over the course of 2 months (convinced they lost the form I filed). They assured me everything would be taken care of in a timely manner. I missed graduation though I was told that I did everything I was supposed to and instead of admissions using the form I filed, they decided to change my degree without telling me. I wasted a total of 16 hours in offices around campus trying to fix an issue that nobody decided to take care of the way was told was ""necessary."""
Freshman,4,I have not officially started classes but I have many interactions with the advisers and financial aid personnel etc. They are all very helpful and want to see you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I love the professors, they teach very well, when you need help they are there for you. When you having problems with the work, the teachers will sit down with you and break down the work for you."
Graduate Student,4,"Pensacola State College is a very nice place to attend, I have done a couple classes on campus, but I have done the majority of my classes online. The teachers and staff are very helpful and always try to find an answer to a question.  The staff is always smiling and very welcoming. It is a great school that actually makes you happy when you look around even knowing you are at school and that is not always the most fun place to be."
Sophomore,4,Pensacola State is an amazing college. Administration is always easy to talk to and works close with students succeed in every way. I would like to see the campuses offer more classes during the summer.
Freshman,4,"Pensacola State College, PSC, is a fantastic school with really good teachers who genuinely care about helping you graduate. This was my first semester and all my teachers were very considerate and were fair. PSC also has a very good drama and theatre program and they have several performances a year. The Pensacola campus is also very beautiful and is the perfect size in my opinion. I always had enough time to walk to all my classes (I had 7)."
Sophomore,4,"I attend the Gulf Breeze campus, which is a smaller campus offered to the main one in Pensacola. The professors and students here are great, very nice and helpful. However someone decided to graffiti the elevator here. Though it was handled very quickly, it does bother me a bit that they were able to come in and get away with it. (No housing offered here, its a community college )"
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere of Pensacola State College is very friendly and welcoming. The teachers care about the success of the students, rather than just getting home at the end of the day. All of my experiences at PSC have been more than acceptable. They also keep the school very tidy, and provide students and teachers the resources they need to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I chose Pensacola State because I had no idea what I wanted to do, I still do not. There was no sense in paying all this money for a college like FSU or UWF and not have any idea what I wanted to go to achieve. PSC has allowed me to pursue my basic AA while still figuring out my goals in life."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed being in the dual enrollment program while in high school. Classes were small and professors were helpful for transitioning from high school to college. The Milton campus did not have as many student life opportunities, but the main campus in Pensacola had more to offer. Overall, I recommend Pensacola State College to any prospective student who is seeking an affordable college education."
Sophomore,4,"In all, I have had a great experience at Pensacola State College. The college has multiple convenient locations around Escambia and Santa Rosa Counties. The professors, from a variety of Universities, have all been very interested in students succeeding. They encourage meeting during office hours and discussing any questions you may have. I feel fully prepared to transfer to a University. The students are some of the nicest people you could meet. They come from a variety of ages and places. The only quips I have are over security and student life. There are not many security officials around, added with having to call the flagship campus  before they can alert other officials. But, I have not heard of any issues that had to be stopped by security of police. The student life of clubs is very minimal at this college. This is due mostly to everyone being busy commuters and trying to hurry through classes. So, I can't complain."
Freshman,4,"I really like PSC. It has small class sizes so you can really get to know your professors. They also are always willing to help when you need it. The buildings are a little out dated but you're still getting a great education. I think it's a great school, and worth the price! Not sure if there's on campus housing. Also the athletics aren't talked about too much, I haven't been to a game."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year, and so far I love it! This is a good place to start experiencing college education. If you're still undecided or want to have a feel of what college is like. This is the place for you."
Alum,4,"I loved PSC. The professors were great, ratemyprofessor is a LIFESAVER. Unfortunately, I had to transfer because they didnt have my major, but i hear it is a great school for nursing and EMT. It was a great stepping stone for me between high school and a major university."
Sophomore,4,I like that it is a decently sized college. You get the smaller class sizes which is ideal for me so my professor can know who I am.
Niche User,4,Pensacola State College had a diverse and easy-going atmosphere that really made for a nice experience. The campus is safe and extremely inviting. Athletics are encouraged and the dorms exceed standards.
College Senior,4,"In Pensacola jobs are everywhere, but it depends on the level of education and connections you have in this town. My degree opens a lot more doors for me and my career."
College Junior,4,PSC has a great career center which helps students locate jobs after completion.
College Junior,4,Many years ago I received the A.S. in Manufacturing Technology from PSC. I was given the opportunity to do on the job training called Co-Op work. It counted towards my degree and paid me.
College Junior,4,I just attended the orientation for the Healthcare Information Technology Program which I was accepted into this semester. Orientation was very helpful. I have also completed a few course towards the degree and they are consistent with what I need to know. Like the Healthcare Law class. I learned a lot about healthcare law and how it pertains to HIT.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't met a bad teacher yet!
College Junior,4,"i have only taken hybrid classes, but they have been my favorite for math classes. they help you to completely understand what you learned in class with as much practice as you need."
College Junior,4,i have really enjoyed most of my time at this school. i can tell that many of my teachers do care about furthering my education and i do appreciate that. many of the classes i have taken have been very laid back and mostly resemble an open forum classroom
College Junior,4,"my specific major is biology, but i am going to classes to finish a general education degree. i will be switching over to a horticulture degree once i get my AA, and i ma set up on an educational course to get into the university of florida after i get my AA."
College Junior,4,I've learned so much that I didn't know.
College Junior,4,"I love PSC. The classes are small, most of the teachers are great, and it doesn't cost a fortune."
College Senior,4,I am not really sure about the post graduate services? All I know I continuing my education by getting a bachelor's degree in nutrition. So I can become a qualified dietician and chef at a hospital or as a personnel chef.
College Senior,4,"Everyone is in this program hoping to reach their highest potential no matter how they have to do it. We all have different opinions, ideas and dreams but at Pensacola State College everyone of my classmates are reaching their highest potential. There are many programs we can all get involved in. There are always internships listed and our chef recommends. We just have many different avenues so we can become our best!"
College Senior,4,My classes and transfer of credits have been convenient.
College Senior,4,The online courses are very simple and easy to use.
College Senior,4,I have had the pleasure to be taught by professors that became my all time favorites.
College Senior,4,I have had a great time in this college and learned many things that helped me grow as an individual.
College Senior,4,The curriculum of the classes worked great for me
College Senior,4,I love my online classes.
Senior,2,The online learning experience online is more difficult than in person. This type of change was due to Covid19 and pushed back our skills checkoff. Our program has shifted to completely online learning. We are doing case studies in supplement to in person clinical and diving deeper into theory.
Junior,2,"Education wise, this college is normal. Expense wise, its cheap. Now I have one questions, where do they put the money back into it? Half of the students can't connect to the wireless internet, buildings that were supposed to be rebuilt over the summer haven't been touched, the AC doesn't work in most of Building 1's rooms, few of the parking lights work at night on campus, the bathrooms are falling apart, and no one in admission calls you back (I've left three message in 2 weeks, no one has bothered returning my calls). If you are looking for a QUALITY college, don't come here. If you want a degree and nothing more, this is the place for you."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty campus. Don't love how the school is set up. Most schools have one portal type program to see grades, get emails, receive assignments, and view transcripts. PSC has not one, but three, all of which have different logins. Sending transcripts to other schools? Also a hassle, it is done online and never works. When you request that they send a paper copy? Online transcripts are sent yet again. Counselors are not very helpful and with my experience, seem to not quite know what they're doing and have no advice or real, helpful answers. The classes are fairly easy if you have an understanding teacher and can deal with the problematic online tools that are usually REQUIRED. If you can't use them or have any trouble? Oh well. They'll tell you that there's nothing you or they can do. This school is definitely on the cheap end and pretty but it doesn't make up for how much trouble you'll go through to save money."
College Freshman,2,since they have just become a state college from a junior college they only offer about 5 - four year programs
College Sophomore,2,"Pensacola State does offer frequent job fairs, but mostly for Business or Nursing majors, of which I am not."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The finical aid process here is pretty bad honestly. I felt like i was constantly jumping through loops to get it done, and just hoping that they would process my information in time."
College Junior,2,"My online course was an uninteresting waste of my time, there was constant trouble with the weekly discussion post, the teacher would mess up my grades or not even give me one on a regular basis, and the tests would usually have questions in it that were never in any of the text or review."
College Freshman,2,"it's just plain, and not very much involvement with the students"
Recent Alumnus,2,Most of the time the resources are broken or gross.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have never had a problem with the using computers at PSC. In the computer lab there are always computers available, and I've never experienced a problem with the network. The library has more than enough computers as well, with a two hour time limit, if you just need to get something done quickly. If you find yourself in need of a computer while in the middle of the registration and student services building, they have a few there as well. Unfortunately, there's only a few, so you might have to wait. The schools wifi is available at all areas of the campus if you need to connect on your personal computer too. The only thing that has ever annoyed me is the printers in the library. Sometimes they think they're out of paper when they really aren't.
Computer use and accessibility is top-notch for the number of students enrolled at PSC, however, as far as their online ""eLearning"" program goes, it's really not the best. It's layout is confusing, and it's gone down multiple times during a semester. The submission form for word documents is very clunky, which forces most professors to require assignments to be uploaded as attachments to the submission. I have heard stories of some students' submission not going through, and sometimes of entire submission for a class being late a few days. The forum for online classroom discussion is also one of the worst forums I have ever seen. It almost feels like the school is a decade or so behind in something so important."
College Senior,2,"For the program I am currently enrolled, there is no such thing as flexibility. My classes are chosen for me and I'm not even allowed to choose the day and time that I attend them. Before hand, scheduling was not necessarily the problem, but the other aspects that go along with it always were. My credits from another college were not easily transferred and there has always been several hoops to jump through for financial aid. None of the requirements by financial aid or the admissions departments have been clearly explained."
College Senior,2,"I havent seen many oppourtunities for graduated students other than carrer fairs, which seem to be more for current students and there doesnt seem to be much interation with alumni"
College Freshman,2,There really is nothing special about this school.
College Freshman,2,"The writing lab and math labs are ok, not the best but sufficient enough to get work done"
College Senior,2,My online classes rocked.  The instructors were as expected and taught their subject well.  It was a great experience and like most schools I have attended.  The only parts that sucked was having to buy expensive codes and use different sites.  The extra expense they give us for taking them online stinks too.  First college I have ever had to purchase these codes and pay extra being online.
College Senior,2,"It is nice they went from a Junior College to a State and offer Bachelor degrees.  The main campus is not as friemdly as the Warrington campus.  It stinks the main campus has the only daycare, but even if they paid me to take my kids there I would not.  The teachers seem to sincerely care about their students, so far in my experience.  Disappointed my appeal got denied, since I am a single mother and need this education to raise my kids.  (Father deceased)  I wrote that in my appeal and wish they would have helped me.  Got straigt A's this last semester, but can not afford this spring semester.  I am so close to my Bach, but can not afford it.  Other schools have accepted my appeals and helped me get this far.  So close, but the financial aid department does not have the compassion to keep us out of poverty.  Once I get my Bachelor I will have so many doors open and get off welfare!!  FA department is not like any I have experienced in the past.  People who take my papers are nice at the Warrington campus.  I have been out of school and getting back in to support my family is looking unobtainable at Pensacola State College.  So far my experience with PSC is it is Not a Single Parent Friendly College."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is small, the classrooms suck they are small, just like high school"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Finiancial Aid – The people are rude, dont seem like they want to help you and a majority of them are students"
Recent Alumnus,2,Not very flexable at all dont offer very many classes and are always cancelling them.
College Senior,2,Not at All What I Expected. During a recent career fair there was very little community involvement.
College Senior,1,I did it once and I hated noticed it wasn't for me!
College Senior,1,"The financial aid advisor is the WORST. There is also one counselor that is the WORST as well, but I cannot remember her name. I have the best luck doing everything on my own and going to the school for help only when absolutely necessary."
College Senior,1,"There isn't anything like that at the campus I attend, I am not sure about the main campus though."
College Senior,1,"There really isn't anything of the sort on campus, but I attend the Milton campus which is about 30 minutes from the main campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,I had a terrible experience with the online system.
College Freshman,1,"I graded this an F due to the fact I did not get my application accepted, but I really need it. I can not pay for my college tuition by myself. I need financial help."
College Senior,1,Most of the people that I am surrounded by since it is a community college are people that really don't want to be in school but their parents are either making them or they just have no other options. A majority of the students work full time and they take that more seriously than they do school
College Sophomore,1,There is no social scene or campus life. I haven't found any unique opportunities.  They do have a beautiful library.
College Sophomore,1,The student body seems to be made up of local people either going back to school or have a family and continuing their education.
College Senior,1,"Because of my EFC (fafsa), I can't get anything! Anywhere! I am so frustrated. The only reason it's not an F is becauseI'm lucky I can squeak out the tuition every semester. The books are expensive, even when bought through a third party, and there's no telling if you'll even use them. I'm only eligible for loans (which I avoid at all costs) and work-study (which goes to the most desperate students first...leaving none for me). I have actively reapplied and searched and talked with advisors - but no change."
College Sophomore,1,"The secretaries and service ladies, aren't friendly"
College Junior,1,"They really need to get their act together. They are disorganized, inefficient, and sometimes downright rude to people. My sister tried to file her information for student financial aid, and because the financial aid office sent her on a wild goose chase following random, unnecessary paperwork, she almost was not able to attend school this semester."
College Sophomore,1,Go Pirates – My first experience with an onlinn class was terrible. We didnt do much work I didnt learn anything and my tecaher rarely replied to emails. Although I did reiceve an A in the class.  We did not have a final
College Sophomore,1,"If possible, avoid the financial aid office at all costs. They are rude, condscending, and extremely unhelpful They refused to listen to my side of the situation and threw documents in my face accusing me of cheating the system. They do not give you any straight answers to your questions and become irritated if you ask more than a few basic questions. You will get nowhere unless you speak to a supervisor. "
College Freshman,1,"I feel that my schools financial aid process is to confusing, and they make it difficult to receive financial aid."
College Junior,1,"Students are working as advisors for new students, but once you have been there for more than a year you get actual counclers good thing I know what I need for my degree"
College Freshman,1,"Don't Wait at All – The longer you wait for trying to get financial aid processed, the angrier you will get with the staff here because it s tedious enough when you did it early."
College Senior,1,"Only Real Flaw! Very, very poor financial aid department. Very hard to get help. That is the main reason I am here seeking help from College Prowler."

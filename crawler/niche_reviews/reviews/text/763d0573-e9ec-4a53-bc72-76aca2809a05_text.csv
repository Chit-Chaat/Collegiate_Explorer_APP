Graduate Student,5,"I love, love, love Plaza College. This school helped me reach heights that I had previously deemed unobtainable.

I am extremely grateful for the experience and opportunities that have been presented to me because of Plaza College."
Niche User,5,A real professional environment with a welcoming staff. This is definitely a top 3 school for me in terms of business.
Niche User,5,Plaza College has the best most helpful staff one could ask for. There are always people willing to help you out whether it is with providing you with information or a tour of the campus! This campus always makes me feel at home and the atmosphere is truly remarkable!
Graduate Student,5,"I am a bachelors student here at Plaza and I earned my associates back in 2015 as well. I was not only hired by the internship that plaza found me, but I also have 3 family members I recommended to plaza. Everyone who is writing bad reviews is salty that A. they did not get in B. can't handle being in a professional environment and probably should never have signed up. They are unemployed and at home just firing off bad reviews because of their poor decisions. Seriously, if y'all would have done what was asked of you, you would be like me. Working 35 hours at NORTHWELL hospital and finishing my bachelors degree in PIM."
Freshman,5,Plaza College is one of the best colleges to get an education. The faculty and staff are genuinely caring and always there when you need them. The class are just the right size to meet other students and learn without getting distracted.
Freshman,5,Plaza college has been one of the best career choices I’ve made. Not only were they super helpful during the registration process but truly encouraged me to succeed. The professors take their time to make sure you fully understand the material and excel in your classes. You always get a warm welcome when you step into plaza. It’s a great environment! It’s very nice to be surrounded by individuals who push you to be the best you could be.
Freshman,5,"I'm in my first semester at Plaza College and I love it. I'm in the dental hygiene program and everyone has been very professional. All my professors are very passionate about the subjects they teach, and even though this program is tough, this school has made it a great experience so far."
College Junior,5,We get homework and class assignments. We can chat with each-other and message our professors for help
College Junior,5,I love my professors. They make class fun and interesting.
College Senior,5,"This is my third semester at plaza college, and I have nothing but good things to say about plaza. Oh boy did I learn a lot thanks to my professors. My first semester I was so nervous, but what new comers aren't. Plaza college its so unique because it's a very small college and we all know each other, we're like a family. The professors really care about the students education and always available when we need them. There's a lot of workshops for students that need extra help on English and other subjects. I would choose my school all over again because its a great school with great professors that want to see their students achieve their goals in life."
College Senior,5,"My experience in the school was so positive. I like all of my teachers, my friends, my advisers, the way they handle things are pretty fast. I'm staying for my Bachelors degree."

College Senior,5,"As much as college might seem like a stress bubble, this one is not so stressful. There's always something fun to do."
College Senior,5,"The Learning resource center is small, but there are a lot of open computer labs in the school, the library offer printing paper, and the clubs in the school are great."
College Senior,5,"The class registration is very neat, they offer medical and business, both associate and bachelor degrees, along with certificate degrees."
College Senior,5,"I think they are way better than Ivy League. My friend went to an Ivy League school and she has problems. I feel like this school is way better than Ivy League. I don't have any issues with this school. My program is up to date with the right technology, they offer internship opportunities. The workload gets hard around exams but you make great friends to study with, and there shouldn't be a problem, you can ask teachers for help. The lessons relate to real life."
College Senior,5,"The school is convenient because they provide an elevator, they offer day and night classes, they keep you up to date with the g mail account, you can find out your award letters from financial aid on a website. The credit transferring didn't apply to me because I was not a transfer student."
College Senior,5,"The quality of the career center is the best because they helped me with my confidence when I was mock interviewed. They provide a professional development class for all graduates. They take the time to get to know each student and help them find a job. They help you bulk up your resume, and they help you build a career folder. The alumni network is great. They return to the school and pass by during the fundraisers, and they know what the new jobs are looking for. They teach things that you need to know for your future job."
College Senior,5,The classes are very informative.
College Junior,5,"The alumni always come back to Plaza College to help and volunteer with bake sales, raffles and other events."
Graduate Student,4,"I only had a couple weeks worth of class online due to COVID-19. But, even though I was only online for a couple of weeks, it was a great experience and the teachers and staff were very helpful and easy to communicate with."

College Junior,4,There is an on campus career center that will help you with whatever it is you are looking into
College Junior,4,I am still fairly new to the school but so far I have been given a great amount of attention and I have learned a few new things. I plan to continue to learn a lot more
College Junior,4,This school has not given up on me and has given me a second chance to succeed. I am so grateful for all staff I have came across
College Senior,4,Bring your own printing paper. The basement needs better wireless access and better internet service. Everything else is tidy.
College Senior,4,Everyone is different in their own way.
College Senior,4,Im enjoying the experience and also the trips we have taken thus far
College Senior,4,I believe the tuition could be a little lower but its okay for what it is.
College Senior,4,The curriculum is very hands on.
College Junior,4,The education I am receiving is well worth the money. I just wish the tuition prices were lower.
Recent Alumnus,4,The school give you a scholarship for good GPA. I did not receive other financial aid.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The workload is as expected for a medical assisting degree. You learn all clinical aspects as well as administrative for medical assisting. You become certified in many things such as FEMA, OSHA, Phlebotomy, First Aid, and many more. The curriculum is all focused on getting you ready to earn both an Associates degree along with taking the RMA exam at the end of your two years.  The facility is small, but you get the attention you need to be successful in this college. We are expected to complete a 180 hour externship (as it is called in this college), as a graduation requisite. Job wise we receive tutoring as to interviews, and our resumes. They help you look for a job when you are in your last semester, in fact they try to find you an externship site that will more likely hire you.  Overall a Great school."
College Junior,4,I feel that the Career Services department is very helpful to the students who seek help at Plaza. They also make it mandatory for all students to seek them for any resume and job assistance in the careers they desire. I am still a student of Plaza for 2 more semesters and they have been helpful for me. I received 2 job offers for the information and help I received from the Career Services department.
College Junior,4,"Very good college, and the education I'm getting is worth the money, but I'm not receiving as much financial aid to help pay for my education. How ever the process to my financial aid is done on time and are excellent."
College Senior,4,The tuition at Plaza can be very expensive if you are not taking financial aid. I would also highly recommend getting used books online rather than the college book store.
Recent Alumnus,4,Tuition is worth to be paid because they provide everything that need to be  use

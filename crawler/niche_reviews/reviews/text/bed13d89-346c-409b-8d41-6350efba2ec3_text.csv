Alum,5,Online classes were easy to follow. The  teachers were great and I knew I could get in touch with them when needed. The zoom sessions I had were fun and made up for not being in person lessons.
Alum,5,Great teachers for the ECS program. I learned a lot and would highly recommend this program. I was very happy to attend this campus. The library is great and the food on campus is a plus.
Freshman,5,My experience online has been very simple. The teachers are able to make the learning fun while also giving us the tools in order to stay on top our self-paced learning.
Freshman,5,My experience at Cal State Channel Islands has become very easy because of the supportive staff and administration that help in the transition from high school to college.
Alum,5,Online classes are a great opportunity to graduate faster and are super convenient. Channel Islands offers tons of online classes and they are offered in a very organizational way that you can pace your work out and not be overwhelmed.
Alum,5,"Channel Islands had so many opportunities from research, to classes to job experience. For a new cal state it’s building up its name really well. The history and architecture is a plus and it is so cool seeing it from a psych stand point."
Sophomore,5,Channel Islands makes students feel like their voices are important and heard. There is a huge team on campus that is dedicated to supporting students academically and with their personal lives. There is support that is always available and so many resources to turn to. There is loads of opportunities to get involved with the campus and peers. The small university really makes the campus feel like a second home.
Sophomore,5,The professors have been doing their best with he circumstances that have forced them to switch to online learning. So far they have been patient and very understanding with the students adjustment as well. They are offering support with technology and have opened up their office hours to any questions students may have.
Junior,5,I loved my experience there I loved the environment they provided. All the professors there are amazing always willing to teach students they help you succeed. They help you in every way they possibly can. I love this school nothing bad to say at all.
Senior,5,"The school atmosphere has to be by far my best experience of attending this university. Being surrounded by nature allows you to appreciate the beauty of it. By being in a smaller campus than most universities, it allows to have more interaction with professors and have smaller classrooms. This is much more comforting since we are given more attention and each student can receive decent feedback from the professors. I’m so thankful that I chose this school to receive my bachelors from. Although the drive may be long, I will never referent choosing this school. It has really been the best place and I have truly enjoyed my time being here."
Senior,5,"I currently only take classes on campus, and have only taken one online course. The one time I have taken an online course I believe the professor did a good job in explaining what was expected out of us."
Junior,5,"I love CSU Channel Islands! I have grown so much both academically and professionally. I have made many great memories and friends and I have encountered excellent professors. I feel that the professors are encouraging and help lead to success. I have also had the opportunity to build rapport with my professors in a professional manner. I have also been able to get out of my comfort zone and network which has led to amazing opportunities, such as job shadows and special projects, that I could have never imagined I would have been capable of doing. The resources available on campus, such as the Writing and Multiliteracy Center and the Career Development center are invaluable to help us succeed.  I truly enjoy studying at this university and the environment is beautiful."
Junior,5,"I really like how the staff and professors are accessible to talk to. The campus is beautiful, isolated, nice and peaceful with security passing by often. The classes are located in different building which helps students walk around a lot. The only thing that I would like to see different is the parking accommodations. I think there should be more available. You really need to get to the campus a whole hour before your class just to find parking and it doesn't really mean you'll find one up close."
Graduate Student,5,"Channel Islands is an intimate university. It has small classes where I had the opportunity to get to know my professors and they knew me by name, and were able to address my individual questions, needs and concerns. I was able to get recommendations from several of my professors and had a close an personal relationship with many of them. They had great office hours and I was able to meet with them when needed. The classes offered were meaningful and diverse and wonderfully engaging. I made many friend with my classmates when working in groups and otherwise. The campus is beautiful and clean, small but spacious. The quads are grassy and open to sit and enjoy the beautiful California sunshine to study and read. They have onsite police and I always felt safe and protected. The library is large and quiet, I accessed it often to study, use the computers and print papers. It was a great experience overall."
Freshman,5,"my overall experience from my first semester at channel islands have proven to be a successful experience. staff and all members at school make themselves available to students. there is much guidance accessible to us as it should be because newly adjusting students have the most trouble adapting to new environments. to have all the resources and help we get I am overall pleased with the system of this school. As a student, I have also been around student life and experienced fully what living in the dorms is like. I am very fortunate to have had a good experience with my roommate and had a pleasant experience with the bathrooms as they are constantly being cleaned and being kept tidy. Its easy to enjoy my time on campus and I will continue to live on campus because of how positive my experience has been.."
Senior,5,"A very great small university that is easy to navigate, really great professors that are easy to get along with. For me personally, has a great art program to get into, has a good variety of art courses to get into, both digital and non-digital art mediums. Classroom sizes are about 30 - 40 students, so it makes learning much easier than being in the large auditoriums that other universities have."
Freshman,5,"I love this university! It is small and secluded so there is no worries about walking around campus alone at night. The professors are so sweet and the classes are 20 people max. Housing is so awesome! The dorms are much bigger than other schools and the bathrooms are always clean. The Cafe on campus to get food is amazing! They have all types of foods whether you are feeling Mexican, Pasta, Asian, American, Salads, etc. they have it."
Niche User,5,"I just got accepted in this school, I have visited it during my last spring break! I love the general area of camarillo due to the fact that everyone is truly nice and the whole area smells so fresh due to the crops and fields of veggies and fruits that surround this school!"
Freshman,5,"The school is a wonderful place. It is located in Venture county, placed in the middle of farmland near the cost of California. It is a small campus, only enrolling around 6,000 students. The class sizes are very small, only around 20 to 30 people in one class room. As for the academics, there are many majors to study, such as computer science, nursing, economics and so on. The campus is very safe, it has its own campus police watching the grounds of the campus. The campus has a wide selection of foods ranging from the fast foods to healthy foods, everything you could want to eat. As for studying, the campus has two on campus study centers that can help answer questions on almost any subject. As for housing, each years housing is different. As for athletics, there are no athletic teams yet in this California State University. However, there are many athletic clubs and even a on campus gym. That really all I have to say about the campus."
Senior,5,"The small classroom sizes allow students to really get to know one another and receive specialized attention from the instructors. Most instructors are passionate, empathetic, and genuinely care about the well-being of their students. The campus is serenely beautiful and it is easy to find a quiet and peaceful area to study wherever you are on campus. The rich history behind the campus makes it all the more intriguing to attend."
Junior,5,I like how connected you feel at CSUCI. The faculty and staff are all very friendly and welcoming. I also like how nice and calm the campus is. The campus is not crazy like other campus’ I’ve been on. I like how open the campus is and how you can find a spot anywhere to study or do homework when you need. The main thing that I like about CSUCI is the fast response you can get about your major or financial issues you have. The schools faculty is great at helping you as much as they can.
Freshman,5,I love how beautiful the campus is and how everybody on campus super friendly. The library is beautiful and and is a great place to study. There is a coffee shop right nest to the library and it is a great place to get a cup of coffee. The housing is nice and there are many advantages when it comes to living on campus. The professors are great and are really helpful when you are having trouble. The classes themselves are great and the small class sizes are really helpful.
Junior,5,"The professors are very thorough and seem to care deeply about educating their students. This is perhaps because of the student:faculty ratio, but it is very refreshing to see educators that care so much about making sure that their students receive the best education possible."
Alum,5,"I really enjoyed both the campus and classroom environment. I was a transfer student to that campus. It was an easy transition. Very peaceful, all my professors were amazing."
Junior,5,"I love that the campus is so small and there aren't too many students. You're not in classes with 100+ students and if you ever need help, it is easy to access. The school is very pretty and located around 5 minutes away from the beach!"
Senior,5,My experience at CSUCI has been amazing! I have had incredible amazing professors and they are also so helpful as well as resourceful. They truly are there for you when you need them whether its academically or in other aspects of your life.
Freshman,5,"What i love about CI is the environment of the school is just feels right, it feels like home. The people are nice and understanding."
Junior,5,The ease of navigating through the transfer process. there is someone to guide you almost every step of the way. With two campuses and an online option there is literally something for everyone
Junior,5,"I'm going into my 3rd year here at CSUCI and I can honestly say I can't see myself on any other campus. The small and hidden feeling of the school allows you to work on your degree and yourself without too many distractions. You also get really engaged with your departments, most heads of the departments are eager to work with students who show the initiative. The professors care deeply about students and go the extra mile to also learn the material and have it stick with you. While there isn't much to do in terms of partying and social outing (Camarillo isn't the best, you'd need to go to Ventura for a night out) the campus has so much more to offer. Diverse clubs and open minded people give you a chance to really discover who you are safely. There are many on-campus jobs in various departments for those who are interested in that and honestly, this place is perfect if you want to turn your life around and focus on school and self-development."
Senior,5,The teachers are doing a great job! They have helped me really get excited about my future in Anthropology.
Junior,5,"Must give cal state Channel Islands a five-star evaluation. The professors and facilities are super friendly and helpful. Like professor Elizabeth Sowers, you must take her class as she really knows how to teach and help students pass a hard time. President Beck is an amazing principle, I took pictures with her! And the food is extremely delicious!  Because of cal state Channel Islands, we will never go back to Northern California! We love Southern California!"
Junior,5,So far I have had an amazing experience with my transfer process and all staff has been very helpful with all questions and concerns. I can't wait to start in the fall!
Freshman,5,"Although I'm only a freshman, I can already tell that CI is the perfect place for me. I love the home-like environment and aura that the school gives off, and I know that I have people to go to if I feel as if I need help with anything. I'm excited to start my journey!"
Junior,5,CSUCI is a beautiful campus and everyone is willing to help each other out. The campus is very clean and well kept and the professors are all always willing to help you out.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience was amazing , the campus felt like home and there was many resources available."
Senior,5,I love the small campus and the friendly faces. The campus is small which is ideal for people who like small spaces rather than bug campuses. The class sizes are relatively small which allows for more one on one teacher/student interactions.
Freshman,5,"very good at accommodating to new and prospective students. tour guides seem to be well rehearsed and very knowledgeable. it seems that the recruitment center at this college through intensive training and is well prepared.i was impressed when i took a tour with my family because every question i had and asked was answered and if it were not, i was always kindly directed to an area which could answer a specific question"
Junior,5,"Channel Islands is the perfect school for a niche group of people. To a lot of people, the ""college experience"" falls under a specific set of criteria. CI isn't a school for those looking to party or have an avid night life in the surrounding area. However, if you're looking for a diverse campus with caring professors that take the time to learn your names and help you succeed as an individual student, not just as another college statistic, then I think CI is seriously worth considering."
Freshman,5,"My experience at this university has been fantastic overall. The diversity at this school if fantastic and the professors are very kind and understanding. The campus is small but it is very nice. many of the  stores are far away form the school. you would need a car to travel anywhere out of campus. the security is safe, the campus police will arrive anywhere in the campus in 1 minute or less."
Senior,5,"I went in the Fall 2018 semester and am currently on medical leave. For added info, I'm a commuter student majoring in History that transferred from a community college in the same county as CSUCI and in fact where I've lived my whole life. I generally really like it here at CSUCI! 

At least as far as what I've encountered as an upper-division History major that was considering becoming a Liberal Studies (Non-Educator) major a few weeks ago, the professors, advisors, etc. are all incredibly sweet, competent, and hardworking when it comes to you doing well in school and your career. 

 I like how much the school puts into trying to have a nice, fulfilling eating, event/socializing, and culture scene. There's a lot of fun campus-sponsored events, both partying (sober) and not partying-which is seriously making an excellent attempt at fostering community among the student body.

It's also very relaxed here politically-no one shits on each other for having different views of things."
Junior,5,The campus is beautiful and everyone is so helpful. Every classroom is set up to feel like the students are the main focus. I can always feel like I can reach out to the professor and speak with them.
Niche User,5,It is actually rally beautiful and fun for everyone to view and it is easy to be seem how someone could fall in love with this school?
Niche User,5,"in my search for colleges, this school was very welcoming and well prepared in showing off to prospective student shwat their school offers"
Freshman,5,"CSUCI overall is a really great school. The campus is beautiful, especially during the warmer seasons. The students are all pretty chill and extremely accepting of everyone. The professors are good, I've only had a few that I didn't like. For the most part, they are genuinely interested in you succeeding in their class, as long as you put in the work. The school offers a large variety of degrees and programs, more than I expected for such a small school."
Freshman,5,I feel that Channel Island is a perfect match for me. The environment is very friendly and everyone is willing to help whenever you need them. My top choice!!
Freshman,5,So far this school has been a great experience. All of my classes that I have taken have been very fun and the teachers have been helpful. Im excited to see what else this University has in store for me.
Junior,5,"California state university of Channel Islands is an excellent 4 year college. The university has tons of resources to help you pass your classes and make college life less of a burden. The university’s environment is safe and quiet. The instructors, students and counselors are friendly and helpful.  What I like about the university is how much they financially assist students, if needed.  The two things I would like to see change is the way the university communicates information to other students about job opportunities and scholarships and the way they evacuate students in case of emergencies."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy how welcoming and secure it is at this University. I never feel out of place nor uncomfortable. Being away from home has never felt so homey considering it’s not my permanent home like it does living on this campus.
Freshman,5,Exactly what i expected! Grateful for the helpful staff. Everyone made my first semester as easy as possible
Senior,5,I enjoyed the close knit environment. I always feel as if im supported by my professors. All of my professors have been a positive influence on my education as well as my goals. I feel that the administrators care about their students. There are so many resources for the students.
Freshman,5,"It’s a smaller campus with really nice class sizes. I can really get 1 on 1 help with my professors as well. The dorms are really nice (and new!) and spacious/nice to live in. Not many parties, but I don’t mind, the people are very nice and I’ve met a lot of friends."
Niche User,5,Beautiful campus where you can easily approach professors with any questions you may have and are looking to help students. Strong relationships with them and are excellent in the way they teach.
Freshman,5,I enjoy this school. It has everything. Student events and activities. Great academic help. Good professors. Also the public transportation is free. The facilities that are offered are amazing.
Junior,5,CSU Channel Islands is a small school but offers the feel of a large university. My time spent here has been beneficial to me in ways such as my academic knowledge and social interactions. The small feel gives off the essence of a home community which is what you want out of a university.
Junior,5,CSU Channel Islands has a beautiful campus and great weather. The teachers and admin are always willing to help guide you and make you feel welcome. The students are friendly and work together. I also love hanging out with my classmates after school at the beach which is only 10 minutes away.
Alum,5,Absolutely loved CSUCI. Class sizes are less than 50. Teachers are understanding and care about your education. One thing they could improve is athletics.
Senior,5,"CSU Channel Islands is a small (but growing) university that provides the opportunity for close relationships with both peers and professors. This school is diverse and also open-minded when it comes to the needs of the students on campus. Also, it is a truly beautiful campus."
Sophomore,5,My experience at CSUCI has been amazing. Everyone there is friendly and super helpful. Classroom are filled with decent amount of students and learn a lot because there’s a lot of interactions depending on the class.
Senior,5,"I really love this school. The student to professor ratio is the best feature to this school, you really feel like they are there to help you personally."
Senior,5,A wonderful college. Small school feel. Wonderful professors that are very supportive. Everyone I have had contact with is compassionate and helpful.
Junior,4,"overall nice campus, good professors and classes, the only downside of this campus is the location and surrounding area."
Junior,4,"Small class size and accessible professors, many research opportunities but housing is pricey and sophomore dorms should be updated."
Junior,4,I loved the small class size and accessible professors and numerous opportunities to get involved in the campus community and research. I would have liked the Santa Cruz dorms to be updated.
Junior,4,I think that my online learning experience has been great because my professors have been well-organized and I have learned a lot from my online experiences.
Freshman,4,"This Spring semester in-person classes switched to online classes, which was inconvenient for some classes. However, my professors reassured and provided me with the tools and information to be successful. My professors stayed in contact with their students throughout the semester and offered additional class time for more questions and help. Furthermore, I am STEM major so I had to take chemistry and math this semester and it was a bit difficult to understand some material. For these classes, I feel that I would have learned it better in person than online."
Freshman,4,"It gave me my terrific first college experience, was everything and more i  could ever ask for. The classes are very well organized, the campus is very beautiful filled with many hikes while being 10 minutes away from the beach. The dorms were very small plus things were very hard to get around if you didn't have a car, the dorms were very expensive for such a small amount of space, the school was very caring but the price was just a little much for certain things."
Sophomore,4,I love this school. This school has a great campus and environment. The people at this school are very nice and care for one another. The classrooms are great with very high qualified professors.
Alum,4,"The campus is a wonderful place tucked into the mountains. It is large enough to house what they need, but small enough that you don't feel you will get lost. The teachers are dedicated to seeing all their students succeed."
Freshman,4,"I loved my experience with the school, it has a lot to offer and a great area to expand and grow. I wouldn't change anything about the school, it has everything you need right there."
Freshman,4,"CSUCI has a very nice and welcoming environment, it is not a big party school and their main focus is academics. The professors genuinely want their student to succeed and give them every opportunity to. The campus is beautiful and from what ive seen the dorms are nice as well. The food from Islands cafe is very good, and the other dining options on campus are good as well. It is not a big party school either. The people ive met are very nice willing to help. their on campus support for students is amazing, there are three different tutoring centers, one that focuses mainly on writing, one that is for STEM, and one that covers everything.But all around it is a very good school"
Freshman,4,It has been so far a great experience and I am enjoying my time here so far. The professors are very passionate about the classes and seem invested in the success of their students
Junior,4,"CSU Channel Islands is a small school. This allows the students more one on one time with professors and staff making it easier to learn. Most of the professors I have encountered are nice and genuinely care for the students. 
The campus itself is beautiful, with lots of nature surrounding it. It is also located near the beach. 
However, its located a bit far away from the city so it can feel a bit isolated at times."
Freshman,4,"It is gorgeous and has so many programs to offer, academic and social. They make sure everyone is taken care of physically, mentally, and spiritually."
Alum,4,"Great School, Small classes friendly faculty and staff. Alot of one on one time with professors who genuinely care about your success."
Freshman,4,So far it is pretty amazing even though the campus is isolated from the city the people at the school makes it a great experience there are resources for each major and professors try there best to teach at there best ability even though it can be better it is good for a first-year.
Junior,4,Many of the students that I meet that attended the college seemed as if they had a good experience and claimed that many of the classes they took helped them excel with their major. To them the experience in the school allowed them to be have better jobs. Personally I enjoyed the view of the beach and how peaceful it was considering that the school was much smaller then others.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at California State University - Channel Islands has been a roller coaster. The energy of the school is overall amazing but there are some things that could be changed.  For example,  I have been followed multiple times by random cars and I notified the police but they did not do much but ask me if I was okay. Other than that I have had a great time living in beautiful Camarillo and enjoy learning from the well-educated professors."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus! Perfect for anyone who wants to go to a 4 year University without the intimidation of a huge campus. 10 minutes away from the coast and is near the Camarillo Premium Outlets. Lots of fun things to do as well such as surfing lessons, parasailing, scuba diving, kayaking, etc."
Niche User,4,"After orientation and understanding the campus life while meeting many people who have some kind of relationship with the school, I was very surprised about what the school really offers in terms. Tuition after financial aid isn't too bad and housing would be a great option for undergrads. You can meet new people, make connections, and still have a social life depending how many classes you take!"
Junior,4,I love meeting new people. The staffs are friendly and helped me a lot on many things. I have good professors and peers who accommodate me for my special needs.
Freshman,4,"Since I am just a freshman I really can't say all the good and bad things but, from what I have seen this school is very good and I am excited to pursue my education through it."
Sophomore,4,"My first year there ended up being a good experience, there are many events for students to go enjoy and make friends, as well as relaxing from stress. The food was good and teachers are open and willingly to help students if the students choose to. The dorms were clean and everything utility worked without there being too many problems. Campus is safe with the campus police being there and the buses being easy to use."
Sophomore,4,"The university definitely has a breathtaking campus. Whenever one is feeling stressed out a walk around campus will no doubt put some ease on the mind. Channel Islands is not known as a party school, or a very rowdy school in general. Your experience at CSU Channel Islands will be determined by the people you surround yourself with as well as how involved you are with on-campus activities. Overall, the professors are great and the atmosphere is fun."
Sophomore,4,"I like the campus, professors, and class size. I wish they offered more courses and more majors/minors."
Junior,4,Channel Islands is nothing quite like the normal college experience. There must be something in the water. This quaint city is very serene and the perfect environment for study but beware the financial aid office.
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere, the student community. the only thing I would change is the way they have handled emergency situations in the past, but i think theyre getting better at that."
Freshman,4,"I love this campus and the Spanish heritage attached to its past really speaks to me, however, some of the professors here on campus is not good in terms of accommodating students and working with you, which is a 5-10% of the professors here, but overall this is an amazing place to study at."
Senior,4,"I like the Psychology program. I think the school as a whole, is a ""good bang for your buck."". There are a lot of resources for students that may need extra help and programs that enhance your experience."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the small classroom sizes and how most professors are able to have one on one time with their students when lecturing.
Niche User,4,"I have not  gone to go visit by I am soon, as I had applied to go take a visit on a specific date and go visit the campus and look around and see if I am really interested in the school for myself."
Junior,4,I enjoy the peaceful feel of this campus. Very quiet easy place to relax and focus. Small class sizes make it easy to connect with professors and peers. I would like to see the campus improve on student life and staff diversity.
Freshman,4,"CSU Channel Islands is a smaller campus, so walking to classes is made easy and students get to know almost everyone in the community quickly. The Islands Cafe has a wide variety of fresh food pre-paired for students to eat at the Cafe or on the go. Students can also use ""flex cash"" to buy food from Town Center, which has a Mexican restaurant, Again restaurant, a pizza and wings restaurant, and a deli which makes fresh sandwiches. The school has on campus dorms which students can live in or students can live off campus and get parking permit, so that they can commute to school daily. There is a nice range of different age groups on campus, making the campus feel like it truly is home to all."
Freshman,4,Such a pretty school the scenery is beautiful. Might not get your classes it is a really small school but it’s close and personal you can y’all with each professor easily.
Niche User,4,"What I liked about the college is that it's very open. So green and big. When I went to visit the campus, I had the best experience. My favorite part was how we needed to go through the library, I believe, to go to the housing department. I would feel more safe knowing I don't have to travel far to get back home."
Sophomore,4,"This school is absolutely amazing. I love this school mainly because of its size. It's a small campus located in Camarillo, where there are no more than 25 students in a classroom. Giving you a lot of one-on-one with your professor. It's a 10 minute drive to the beach, and hour between Los Angeles and Santa Barbra. The reason I'm giving this a 4/5 is because its still a fairly new school. This Cal State was established in 2002. The community is still growing, meaning there are a lot of work that needs to be done in the student life aspect. Most of the clubs are still new and still growing. My first semester I joined the women's soccer club and loved it. We played different soccer clubs from other schools such as UCLA, San Bernardino, Cal Poly, and more. I decoded I wanted to focus on my studies more and stopped playing. My time here so far has been amazing and I am so happy that I chose to go here."
Junior,4,California State University- Channel Islands is a great school to go to college at. The professors are very helpful and they want to see you succeed. They encourage students and push us to do are best. Student life on campus is awesome and there's activities to engage in when you need a break from studying. Great school to attend!
Alum,4,"The campus is beautiful, the classes were the perfect size to get one on one with professors, who we're knowledgeable and very helpful. The only problem I had with CI was the dorms. When I went to CI, we had too many students, not enough dorms and rent was $1,324 for a 4 bedroom two bath dorm for 6 people. The other things was if you didn't have a car you basically needed to know someone who had one or live on campus because the campus is about a 15-20 drive from the closest towns."
Senior,4,"Campus is small and cozy but there is still plenty to keep you busy. There is also plenty to do offsite, the location is amazing. Academics are thorough and growing in all majors."
Sophomore,4,"As a student who lived on camps, I enjoyed the small community that one joins while attending Cal State Channel Islands. This campus is perfect for those who enjoy smaller classes and more one on one communications with their professors."
Junior,4,"Channel Islands is a beautiful campus to live on. It is quiet and quaint compared  to other universities and the outside of town atmosphere makes it east to focus on studies. I have had wonderful professors here and am please to say that each professor has made a connection to their class and the outside world. Considering I am studying to be an elementary school teacher, this campus provides opportunities to network through service learning outside of campus. I have been privileged enough to work one on one with other students at elementary schools and side by side with teachers in the classroom. Student life is quiet here, however the campus puts on socials and events that are a great opportunity to take a study break and relax and enjoy being social. I love the campus."
Junior,4,"The education program is amazing at CSUCI. The professors are very passionate about teaching and encouraging you to succeed in you academics. The Special Education program is great. It is close to the beach and has all you need on campus. Great students, with a diverse campus atmosphere. Many different clubs and programs on campus. We have great food in town center!"
Sophomore,4,"I have truly fallen in love with my school. I appreciate the small class sizes and that it is so easy to pass by a familiar face every day. All of my teachers have been so wonderful to me and I appreciate how connected they become to us and how willing they are to help us achieve our goals. The only thing I would love to see a change in is our food on campus. Being a vegan, it is sometimes very hard to find a substantial meal on campus, I believe having healthier meal options would greatly increase the beautiful vibe we have at this school."
Freshman,4,I love that it is a very tightly woven community. Small class sizes allow for more 1 on 1 time with professors and the cultivation of many relationships.
Niche User,4,"I liked how it was lonely and everyone was doing their own thing, also the people attending the college. I would like to see more activities happen."
Niche User,4,"I like that it is surrounded by nature and very close to the beach. Also the Camarillo Premium Outlets are really close by. The only downside is you cannot walk there, you would have to take the bus or get a ride there."
Sophomore,4,"I really love that I it's small enough to not feel super overwhelmed when first attending as a new freshman. I also think that the professors are passionate and easy to work work with. It is a very small laid back school; however, which can suck if you are looking for a huge party scene. You can find some cool parties though if you look."
Senior,4,"I am a senior and will be graduating CSUCI in 2018, but I can not leave without giving my honest review about the campus itself. It a great campus, great location and great environment! Most all professors teaching at CI are warm hearted, especially all science professors. I give it 4 stars because I feel that advising and counseling could improve, its what most students complain about. It is a communter school, but there are many students and professors that will have the same interest or have great advice to help you throughout your undergrad."
Freshman,4,I enjoy how small and connected our campus is. It's nice when your professors know who you are and care.
Junior,4,"What I loved about CSUCI, is the diversity and student involvement. As an incoming freshman, I found my place right away by joining clubs and organizations that got me connected with the school."
Freshman,4,I love the campus! It's a wide open place where many students seem to enjoy. The staff and the students are very friendly. The campus in general is so clean. The campus is quite orginized and I love how there is a police station on campus. It allows us students to feel safe and you're even able to call them if you have any questions!
Junior,4,The classroom sizes are small and you're able to get more help from your professor. The bad thing about this school is that its separated from the city.
Sophomore,4,I love going to channel islands there is so much opportunity in building an university here. I am part of the oldest sorority on campus (Zeta Pi Omega) and it has shaped my experience at CI to get out of my comfort zone and embrace this school for what it is.
Senior,4,"Class sizes are small which allows you to interact with professors better. The campus looks nice and there are some good spots to hang out at. Also, the weather is really nice almost all the time. A downside is that parking permits may seem a bit expensive."
Freshman,4,I love Cal State Channel Islands Although it is small. There is one soroity on campus and the food is pretty amazing.
Freshman,4,"My experience at cal state Channel Islands so far has been pretty good. I'm not much of a party person. So, I like that I don't feel preacher to party but, for my friends who do like to party there are still parties for them to go to. The school also has a very nice small town feeling that I love."
Freshman,4,"Great college, especially for first generation students. Diverse in more than just culture but in ways that you actually feel like a community within the school. professors and staff are welcoming to the new and soon to be greatest csu"
Junior,4,"CSUSI is an awesome school. I am from Northern California and always thought I would want to go to college in Southern California. When I was accepted at CI, I was so excited. When touring colleges, I knew the second I stepped foot on CI's campus that it was where I wanted to be. Now in my third year at CI, I feel as if it is home. I have made so many friends and close relationships with Professors and learned so much. I have been given so many opportunities at CI and discovered my future career here- a Pediatric Occupational Therapist. I love CI's small campus and small class sizes. It's like getting a private education at a public price!! I have also lived on campus all 3 years and plan to stay my fourth year, I absolutely love it! Overall, I couldn't be more happy with my choice to attend CI."
Senior,4,"Living on campus had been a huge milestone, and the housing staff had been so considerate of all students with their needs. The diversity in food had changed greatly, and is more vegetarian and vegan friendly. There are so many sports clubs, and non-sports clubs to choose but the most humble clubs would definitely be the karate and running club. They are a great group of people, and hearing that the professors and staff could join was really cool actually. It's nice to see that this campus has been growing over the last few years, but with that said the parking situation has to be resolved. The current issue is the commuter parking being taken away for housing, which isn't fair due to more than half of the students being commuters. I hope to see a plan to put in a parking structure or two where the dirt lots are at, because parking in the train station to take a bus is almost impossible due to no parking in that area too."
Freshman,4,"CSUCI is definitely a different kind of school. Most schools are either categorized as completely academic or focused on parties. To me personally, CSUCI actually has a well rounded scene for everyone. There are parties as well dances. Plus you have a ton clubs and other extracurricular activities that you can participate in. 
The teachers on campus are really different. Since the student to teacher ratio is approximately 30:1 (same as a high school classroom),  you can actually learn and absorb information very well. The teachers go out of their way to make sure you understand the material which is definitely a concern for a lot of college applicants. I definitely recommend this school for everyone."
Junior,4,"CSUCI is a very clean and quiet campus, totally awesome if you are trying to get in take classes and get out at an accelerated rate. It is conveniently located between a few world class surf breaks from Malibu to Pitas Point, to name a couple. If you are adventurous and independent, this school is a ton of fun."
Niche User,2,"Recently I did not feel supported by school administrators, it felt as though all they really cared about was the financial aspect and not about me as an individual due to my medical situation. It did not seem as though they cared for my overall safety and well being, and for this reason my parents and I had to take matters into my own hands. But do not get me wrong, I loved the professors that I had, and they have always been so supportive and understanding - more now than ever. You have small/average class sizes which allows for you to form bonds and relationships with professors, take full advantage of that!"
Alum,2,"Avoid this school if possible, especially if you want to stay on campus. Campus living is isolated and depressing for many students, there's just not much to do on campus or in the surrounding area. Many students leave on weekends to ""get away"". I had a horrible transfer experience with this school. They have only a handful of advisors, it's hard to get the help you need and they will argue with you about accepting pretty basic classes like English 102. There's not enough parking. The worst parking I've seen and I've attended multiple schools in two states. Arriving an hour before class doesn't always work. I've missed classes at times looking for parking. Food options are very expensive and the quality is pretty low. Expect to eat from vending machines most days if you can find one near class. Theres a few restaurants on the opposite side of campus from where classes are located. This is your best bet for food and a cup of coffee."
College Sophomore,2,We only have one Sorority on campus.
College Senior,2,I dont see much of the nightlife because I take evening classes and then drive straight home.
College Junior,2,"I have attended a community college the past two years, so it's to be expected that the athletics are mediocre. The gym at the school is laughable and kind of dirty, and the athletic coaches know less than half their students. However, it doesn't make an impact on campus life because no one is really there for athletics, but rather to further our education and ultimately transfer."
College Sophomore,2,There is no actual sports teams. No stadium or variety teams.
College Junior,2,This school is extremely under resources and has no established partnerships with outside existing organizations to potentially intern or counter for to get ready for a job.
College Freshman,2,don't really have greek life
College Junior,2,There is currently no sports program here.
College Freshman,2,There is only one sorority that I know of at Channel Islands and they have no huge affect on the school.
College Freshman,2,"My school is not involved heavily with sports, resulting in low school spirit. However we do celebrate ""Red Out Wednesday"" every week where the students dress up in red, our school's color. There are planned activities nearly every week to attend instead of football games. The athletic facilities are standard; we have two gyms and the bigger of the two offers weekly basketball and volleyball tournaments, as well as dance classes. Every now and then there's even a dodgeball tournament, but if you are looking at this school for sports, it's not the one to choose."
College Freshman,2,We only have one sorority on campus.
College Freshman,2,"not very valued degree from here, very small amount of fields to study efficiently"
College Freshman,2,transferring after my first year
College Freshman,2,lots of girls in one small room
College Freshman,2,"Very quiet on weekends, spend a lot of time with my roommates and you will get to know them very quickly."
College Freshman,2,"There are barely any sports at this school. This is a main thing that they lack. My favorite sport is swimming and they don't even have a pool. Because they school is fairly new, there isn't that many sports in place. We don't get the opportunity to go against other school because there are only intermural sports."
College Sophomore,2,There are little to no sports in our school with no sports in sight but soccer.
College Freshman,2,It's so bad. It takes forever to recoece your financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,"I applied for financial aid early and did not receive any scholarships through fafsa because I did not qualify, but they did give me loans which I did not want to accept."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone I know that went through the financial aid process said it was rough. The amount of paperwork and wait time is so long. Also when you are viewing the costs you owe to the school, it never really says what you are paying for. I feel that more scholarships need to be made available from the school. Also allow more options for payment plans to allow people to earn enough money to pay the tuition instead of having to take out loans and pay right away."
College Freshman,2,There is not a lot of things to do around campus. Located in the middle of a bunch of farms.
College Junior,2,"If you don't know people to party with off campus, of from SB/ventur, there is no night life."
College Sophomore,2,We are in a town where every store closes early.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I think financial aid is horrible at channel islands. With my experience they lost my paperwork multiple times and made me come multiple times, they would also act like i never turned in my paperwork, and after everything was finally turned in i still didn't receive my financial aid until weeks after school had started. The biggest problem i had was not receiving my financial aid on time because i had to come up with my tuition the day it was due because financial aid did not give me the money in time."
College Sophomore,2,mostly every on campus student go home to their parents house. and the campus is dead on weekends
College Sophomore,2,some spanish professors. make you feel dumb. instead of them motivating you if you are doing something wrong. they will bring you down and make you feel alike a failure!
College Freshman,2,There are not enough restaurants around for me to care about dining off campus
College Freshman,2,"I did not care for the program here at CI because most of the time I was talking to someone who could not answer my questions, and I was constantly transferred to another person."
College Sophomore,2,Since the campus is secluded from the city any housing closest is about twenty minutes away. Most of it is expensive and would require to live with many roommates to pay for everything.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is still small but developing so at this time we do not really have sports. However, we do have sport clubs."
College Sophomore,2,"I am living on campus and I don't have a car. However, my friends do and they say parking here sucks especially since the only parking available is on campus."
College Sophomore,2,There is a high population of girls at this school which is good if you want to focus on school. There isn't many guys here so one guy would probably date at least 20 girls. Since it is a small campus word gets around.
College Sophomore,2,There is only three places to eat on campus and they all close pretty early. If you don't have a car or have friends with a car you will not enjoy your stay at CI.
College Sophomore,2,One of the downsides of attending CI is that there is no surrounding dining restaurants. You would have to leave campus and drive for at least 15 minutes to find a place.
College Sophomore,2,There are no sports on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Channel Islands is only 11 years old, so there are currently no fraternities or sororities on campus. However, I know for a fact many students and faculty are planning on setting up the first fraternity next year."
College Freshman,2,They aren't any more strict than they are required to be in all honesty. Don't break any laws and you won't find yourself in any real trouble.
College Freshman,2,Our school is very accepting of diversity and encourages it greatly.
College Freshman,2,Considering the school is basically in the middle of farmland you have to drive  to get to anything exciting. 
College Freshman,2,They don't make an scholarships readily available. You must go search for them in order to find any. 
College Freshman,2,A lot more use of it than i expected to be honest. It is rather abundant. Lots of alcohol poisoning.
College Freshman,2,"Everything is far away, you have to have a car to get anything. There aren't any real late night options other than drive-throughs which are disappointing."
College Freshman,2,Limited availability and slow to respond.
College Freshman,2,There are a lack of intellectuals and experiences.
College Junior,2,Channel Islands is in Camarillo California this is not the place to go if you are looking for a big night life or a huge party college atomism here it is close however to the beach and Hollywood and downtown area where there is more nightlife but it can be about a 30 to 45 minute drive sometimes so all in all it's about average I would say
College Junior,2,Good is average service is average nothing special there are area where vast improvements can be made.  Also the cafeteria is really strict with rules and it makes it an unpleasant experience while we are students we also still customers and some more leniency should be taken
College Junior,2,"Camarillo isn't known for it's transportation, that's for sure. There is the Vista bus which takes you from campus to the train station 10 miles away. From what I heard, Vista has transfer options there to Oxnard and Thousand Oaks. There is also the CAT (Camarillo Area Transit) which takes you from the train station to where ever you tell them to for $2 a trip. The Vista is $1.50 and runs every 15 mins M-F 7 am - 10 pm. Weekends it stops running at 5. I.E if you live on campus, it's not easy to get around with out a car. You will end up walking a lot from the train station if you're desperate."
College Sophomore,2,"The nightlife isnt that 'On and POPPing'. 21 and older drinking is only allowed to those and are now being moved to UGLEN housing .. all underclassmen live in santa cruz and anacapa, however there are block parties almost every month and they each have a theme to get together and dress up with your friends."
College Senior,2,The police force/security officers are really strict
College Freshman,2,This campus does not tolerate any underage drinking and drug use. There are no warnings and you will be put through the consequences.
College Sophomore,2,"The Channel islands is still growing and adding on new things. Last semester they added a pizzeria to eat. With that in mind there are only a few places where you can eat on campus and since the campus is away from the city , you really don't have a choice. Luckily everything is fairly close to your classes and there is hardly any long lines. Another downside is that everything is overpriced."
College Freshman,2,"CI is average in what it offers for campus life. They say you won't have a college experience unless you get involved yet there is not much to get involved with. There are no sports,  very few clubs, and unless it is backed by a student/ school organization any party will be shut down after 10 pm. Only two large events are held at the end of the school year which are basically the college version of prom and gradnite."
College Senior,2,"Parking is difficult!  It's really all about knowing where to park and at what time.  If you arrive before 9:30, piece of cake.  But after 10...it's a nightmare!  I even once scheduled a meeting with our campus chief of police, and in short he explained to me that we have more student drivers than parking spots.  Freshman, sophomores, juniors, and seniors all have equal chances for parking in a certain spot, no priority treatments are given to one over another.  My advice to you: wake up early or walk in very late to class and have your professor get upset with you!  (Class sizes are small here, so you WILL be noticed and put on the spot!)"
College Freshman,2,"There are many different races and religions at CSUCI, but of course the main percentage consists of White people."
College Freshman,2,"We have good school spirit for example on ""Red Out Wednesdays"". However, we have very few sports in our school, mainly intramural activities."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is always difficult especially during the near beginning of an hour and everyone is rushing in and congestion happens.
Recent Alumnus,2,"They need more dining options and late night options for dining, especially for students who cannot drive off campus."
College Junior,2,"There are no sports teams recognized by other campuses, but there is a nice gym facility. CSU-Channel Islands is only 10 years old, and sports was not one of the main focuses when building the school, but the president has promised to expedite the school's sports program. There are intramural teams available to join."
College Freshman,2,"CI is super creepy at night. However, the weather can be beautiful during the day. My one major complaint would be the utter sense of isolation you have at the university."
Freshman,1,"If you don't mind a small commuter school with nothing to do nearby, this is for you. They don't have sports games, good clubs, or nationally-recognized Greek life. All of the activities they attempt to have on campus have low student attendance. The nearest town is 20 minutes away, and since the school is surrounded by fields, the campus tends to smell like manure a few times a day. Additionally, the lack of communication between authorities and students in the event of an emergency (California fires) was scary. Also, when I decided to transfer, I was shocked to discover that almost half of my undergraduate general education classes did not transfer between other California schools (public universities or community colleges), which I find weird since it is a Cal State school. No counselors were of any help when I was seeking guidance in the transfer process. Pretty campus, but that's the only pretty thing about it in my opinion."
Alum,1,I wasted four months of my life in this pitiful excuse for a university. Save your money. Go somewhere else. Join the marines if that's your only other option because you'll have more fun doing pushups for Sergeant Stick-up-his-ass than you will if you go to this school.
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,"We have one ""sorority"" which isn't an official sorority."
College Junior,1,We don't even have any established teams for any sport. They are only clubs. The gym is incredibly small & always packed.
College Freshman,1,It makes people want to transfer
College Freshman,1,Do not expect the dream college sports
College Freshman,1,we don't have many sports (only intramural sport clubs)
College Freshman,1,We don't really focus on athletics.
College Junior,1,I am not aware of any College Sports teams CSUCI has.
College Sophomore,1,Greek Life docent seem to be important to the students at CI. There is one sorority on campus and they don't do much.
College Sophomore,1,"CSUCI dose not have any real sports teams, However intramural sports a popular and very fun. I believe we will get sports teams soon."
College Sophomore,1,We have no Greek life here.
College Sophomore,1,There is only one sorority and they do not have a house
College Freshman,1,We have one sorority and that's it.
College Junior,1,We don't have any sport teams
College Sophomore,1,they take freedom from students and it fells like your in high school
College Sophomore,1,people always do drugs on campus
College Sophomore,1,"people always drink and smoke weed in campus/dorms and if they get caught , they try to get away with it  and do it again if they do"
College Sophomore,1,we do not have a football team . and no varsity  sports .
College Sophomore,1,the sorority girls always have attitude.
College Sophomore,1,We hardly have anything since we are a small school we get little funding making it harder to have sports.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no nightlife worth mentioning, if you are looking for a party school, don't go here. There is absolutely no clubs or good bars near by."
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a Greek Life on campus yet. Maybe later down the road the Greek Life will come to Channel Islands.
College Sophomore,1,Everything is so far apart that dinning off campus without a car isn't easy
College Freshman,1,Not much going on and the few bars in the city are hard to get to. 
College Junior,1,"The parking permit is almost $200. Sometimes you have to park very far away from dorm and if it's at night, it can be scary walking from car to dorm by myself."
Recent Alumnus,1,Not very many options its a very family community that won't rent to college students.
College Sophomore,1,"There is absolutely no nightlife at this school. Our campus is one of the smallest out of the Cal States and has a very good police station. If you are looking to go out to a club , the nearest would be about one to two hours away."
College Sophomore,1,There is  a lot of school spirit because the people at this school are very outgoing and friendly. However there is no major sports at our school. We do not have a football team nor are we known to compete with other schools. This school mostly keeps to itself.
College Senior,1,It always seems as if the professors are struggling with the computers and something always goes wrong. The WI-fi is not fast at all and it could get frustrating opening a page
College Freshman,1,"There is no greek life at CSU-CI. Our campus is very small and very new. The administration is very against greek life , so its very hard to start your own. Even if we did have any type of greek life , there really is no place to make a house for them."
College Sophomore,1,The cafe is limited with options that are healthy and in my opinion they are over priced for the quality
College Freshman,1,"There is no greek life at this campus, it is mainly latinos and Americans."
College Freshman,1,Channel Islands has no athletics.
College Freshman,1,"You can hear crickets on this campus. The fact that this school has no NCAA sports, no Fraternities, and no Sororities makes it an absolute no frills barebones college experience. This school has zero brand recognition and be prepared to explain where the university is because honestly, it seems as if nobody knows. I am very upset I wasted my first year of college at this ex mental institution. My best recommendation is not to go here and if you already are, do yourself a favor and transfer immediately."
College Freshman,1,"I wanted to attend CSUCI because it is a small school in a suburbian town, so I hoped there would be little to no party scene. Unfortunately, students living on campus use no descretion when partaking in drug- and alcohol-related activities. There are regulated quiet hours, for example, but that doesn't stop some residents from coming home in the early morning hours drunk. Many students partake in smoking hooka, which I know is legal, in the South Quad, which is right outside my bedroom window. The campus is considered a clean campus, but the rules only require smokers to be 50 or 100 feet from the buildings. This doesn't stop the wind from blowing all of the smoke into my room and others. It can be overwhelming, smelling the smoke and becoming sick from it, when I simply open my window. There should definitely be regulated smoking areas on campus, far away from the dorms. Also, in the dorms, the air ventilation system is interconnected throughout the building. When one person on the floor is smoking marijuana, the smell drifts to every room. It's an extremely unpleasant and sickening smell, to some like me, and it seems like law enforcement would have a rather difficult time finding the smoker because every room would now smell of marijuana. RAs and other staff don't seem to enforce the rules, either. My floor's RA, for example, does not make the scheduled inspection rounds. This allows a lot of people to have drugs, alcohol, and other things present. For example, a fire inspection employee came to check our fire extinguisher and mentioned that he found a dog in one of the other rooms. This just goes to show that the rules are neither enforced nor abided by in the dorms."
College Freshman,1,"When it comes to good looking straight guys California State University Channel Islands is NOT the place to look for them. The school is very accepting towards gays which is why there is lot of them attending and most of them aren't even cute. There is the rare gem of a cute guy , those guys tend to be surf dudes since the school is close to the beach. Overall there isn't a lot of guys to begin with , the school is overflowing with girls."
College Sophomore,1,Athletics is definitely not a factor for many individuals at my school.
College Junior,1,"There is none. There is a club that you can join, but there is no housing or no rushing."

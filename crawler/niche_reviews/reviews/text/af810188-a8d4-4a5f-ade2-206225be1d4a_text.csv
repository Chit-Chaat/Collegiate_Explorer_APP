Junior,5,My online experience at the University of New Haven is good. I am not a big fan of online learning but the school did a great job with the formatting of its online classes.
Sophomore,5,"Great school with amazing programs and food!
I would strongly recommend this school if you are looking to be a science major."
Sophomore,5,"I unfortunately took some classes online, but they were great. Professors response time was amazing, and they were always understanding."
Freshman,5,It has a beautiful campus and has a lot of options for majors. Also love the energy of the students there and really enjoyed my experience.
Sophomore,5,"After attending for one year so far I’ve enjoyed my time there. Great environment, excellent professors, and all around great campus life."
Sophomore,5,At first it was hard but after a few sessions things got easier. Even though we weren’t on campus it wasn't a big difference doing classes online. It was just as easy to reach my professors online.
Freshman,5,Everyone is kind to one another and it is very easy to meet people. It is also easy to find items and locations on campus.
Freshman,5,The perfect school for someone to go to. Everyone at the school acknowledges you and helps you to succeed in the future.
Freshman,5,"Classic college experience, especially if you are an athlete you can do whatever. Teachers always support you and try their best to make time for you."
Freshman,5,My online experience was good at the university. I took some online classes and they were not bad at all. It was a fairly good experience.
Freshman,5,My experience has been awesome so far. I wouldn't trade it for anything. Such an awesome school and I recommend it.
Sophomore,5,"This is my home. During my first tour, I knew it was the place for me. My decision to go to the University of New Haven is justified every single day."
Freshman,5,Great school! Criminal justice program is out of this world. The teachers help you a lot and are caring about their students. Small classes allow for them to help and know you individually. This is a very hardworking school and requires a desire to succeed to go here.
Sophomore,5,"Overall, The university  is a great place to unwind and hang out with new friends. There are many activities going on around campus that you can participate in and the school really does a lot to ensure a protected educational experience that will make a lasting impact on your life."
Niche User,5,"I have gone on two college visits to UNH already and I have completely fallen in love with the school. I think UNH will be an amazing school to continue my education and help me grow as an individual. For my major, which is Marine Biology, UNH has everything that would make my learning/college experience a great one."
Junior,5,The professor actually care about you here unlike the ones from where I transferred from and they make sure you pass the class.  The campus is beautiful and the college is willing to work with people who are in need for a cheaper tuition.
Junior,5,Great professors very experienced. Nice campus and surrounding area. Feels very safe to be on campus. Buildings are in good shape and clean. Classrooms are big as well. Diversity is not a problem. there is always something going on campus for you to become involved in. everyone is happy to help you and there are various resources to help you out.
Freshman,5,I love living on the campus it’s very enjoyable to be there and can’t wait to be living there. Next i had a good experience with how diverse the campus is and that everyone is accepted for who they are and doesn’t matter based on their gender or race and that they are all accepted for who they are. The last experience I have was how clean the environment is from the dorms to the sidewalk there isn’t random garbage or trash as the student and faculty work hard and diligently to keep the school clean for everyone as it’s a school for everyone.
Freshman,5,I liked that the university of New Haven had a diverse of students from around the world. I also like how the professors of the college go above and beyond to make sure each individual student has what they need to graduate and they help to make sure each student understands their work and knows what they are doing. I truly believe this college does their absolute best to give every student the right education they need in order of them to find a profession in their major once they graduate. I believe this college is the best for my education.
Niche User,5,"University of New Haven is a hidden gem.  It is known for forensic science, but the engineering programs and new health science programs are outstanding.  The campus is growing and every year there are big improvements.  Many of the faculty are accessible and engaging besides being experts in their field.  There are many opportunities to get involved and the administration works hard to continually improve the student experience."
Freshman,5,"in my experience, the university of new haven has helped me open doors for myself. it is so diverse and inclusive. the people are so nice and during the application process they help you with everything even if you have 100 questions. because I am an incoming freshman I cant write about academics and all that from my experience so I would rather not write about it from the perspective of others. anyway, overall its a great university and I am pleased to be enrolled!"
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere and the college experience the school gives. The surrounding area is beautiful lots to do. The people and staff are encouraging and very kind willing to help you navigate your way around.
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere. I met my best friend here. My professors are helpful regarding my future career choice. They are in the field giving me the connections, experience, advice, and whatever else I need.  I also love the people on campus. I've made many friends and a lot of them are in my major and have the same interests so we have a lot to talk about and spend a lot of time helping each other and boosting each other up. I was also able to meet many people through extracurriculars where I met a lot of others who I probably would not have met other wise."
Sophomore,5,"There are endless opportunities here. As a student, you truly get out of it what you put into it. Although there is no lie that this university comes with a high price sticker, this is because of the multitudes of connections it places at your fingertips. Faculty is helpful and eager to see YOU succeed as a student, and will help mold your education however you desire. Adding minors and majors? Absolutely. Fitting in THREE study-abroad session? They can help make it work (most of the time). Want to start a new club sport? Go right ahead. The admissions staff will probably remember recruiting you that one time you met them at a school college fair, the faculty is extremely connected to each other and will contact that estranged department head if you need an extra leg-up, and the student body is engaged and inclusive. I feel honored to be a part of such a special group of people. #chargernation"
Sophomore,5,Started studying at UNH in September. Love the school. Met awesome friends and also started playing of the women's soccer team. Can't wait to continue my studies and athletic career.
Niche User,5,Visiting the University of New Haven definitely made me decide to become a charger. I hope to succeed in a career of forensic science.
Senior,5,"I’m in the business school and its definably worth it. one thing that the University of New Haven is big on is experimental learning. all the professors at the school have had or currently work in the field they are teaching. This way you’re learning from someone who has experience and a better understanding on the subject. Being in the business school you do a lot of projects and in the majority of the cases your working for a real client, which helps you get hands on experience ion your desired field and it can open door for future internships and employment. Overall Great professors and hands on learning through projects."
Freshman,5,"I love it.  It is a small campus and easy to get around.
There are numerous places to get something t eat or drink besides the cafeteria."
Freshman,5,Overall the school is a great place to learn and it’s so diverse in the community and the teachers are very helpful to the students in learning.
Graduate Student,5,I enjoy that the University of New Haven always has events for students. I believe that is one of the best ways to get students involved.
Niche User,5,The admissions staff is super friendly and welcoming they will answer any of your questions and they make the process super easy
Senior,5,"The best college in the world! Perfect for criminal justice majors. Dr. Henry Lee perfectly and effectively designed this program with his genius mind, criminal justice skill set, and talented hands. I am a proud member of this community and am beyond excited to continue this journey."
Freshman,5,"great communication among staff and students,  wonderful school and fantastic criminal justice program."
Freshman,5,"The university make sure you feel like you belong and also everyone is very welcoming 
Other students are very friendly"
Senior,5,"As a transfer student I was nervous about the transition from community college to 4-year institution but it was a very smooth change. The teachers were welcoming and engaging, the courses are diverse and interesting, and I find the course work itself to be the perfect level of intellectual stimulation."
Graduate Student,5,UNH is a great university! Very much recommended. As a graduate student i love how involved the professor are and how much they help
Niche User,5,This school  is very diversed an has alot of potentiale and ovaral great school and I could see my self going to school there.
Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience so far in my first year at this university. All the staff and professors are very open and friendly. They are always available to help you.
Alum,5,"Overall, my experience at UNH was positive and very rewarding.  I was a nontraditional commuter student; therefore, party scenes were not a priority.  My focus was to get an education, earn my degree and move forward.  The professors I encountered provided challenging assignments which geared learning towards my current knowledge of the course subject.  Did they know everything?  Of course not.  Who does?  My academic experience at UNH helped me to research topics and think outside the box, kept me on my toes, and prepared me for the real world.  Since graduating, I have obtained my Masters Degree, and taught as an Adjunct Professor at another university.  And, I must acknowledge that my accomplishments were possible because of my undergraduate success at UNH."
Sophomore,5,I have been exposed to different opportunities that have helped me to grow intellectually and socially.
Graduate Student,5,I loved the classes and the professors in the Forensic Science department. I wish there were more affordable options for on-campus living and for meal plans.
Alum,5,"Great. The people are so welcoming, funny and kind. The professors are helpful and also there when you need help."
Sophomore,5,University of New Haven has an excellent criminal justice program that allows us to utilize our analytical and critical thinking skills to help us excel academically. I do not regret my decision one bit
Sophomore,5,Everyone is so friendly and informative from staff to the students. I’m looking forward to my daughter starting this fall.
Freshman,5,I love the campus. It is a very welcoming environment. Most of the staff here have previously worked in the field that they teach.
Freshman,5,"While being a student at the University of New Haven, I’ve learned so much about my self. Whether it has to do with who my real friends were or what type of food I like better. The people on this campus are very sweet and kind. I can’t wait to finish my years up here."
Senior,5,In love with  it. The things it provides and has available are unique and amazing making you want to go there and not anywhere else.
Senior,5,"The college has been expanding, growing, and diversifying over the last 8 years exponentially.  Most professors and instructors have a Ph.d.  The campus is small, safe, and patrolled."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman here. I had a rough start, I mean a really rough start. My grades were really bad. But the school had a lot of tutors and I felt that I can easily go to their offices and ask for help. So far I love it. I am a part of the Engineering LLC, but I am no longer an engineer. But if you get the chance, join one or become friends with those that are in them, it feels like family.  I have met my closest friends here and the academics are really interesting. A lot of majors and cool programs. There is always something going on. One con which probably happens at every school, they send about a hundred emails a day to your school email. Also, I think some of the professors are not that great, but that is just my experience.

Oh, I live in Westside currently, so the nicest Freshman housing, so I can only say good things from what I have seen. But AVOID BETHEL!!! Often called the projects on campus. Avoid Bixler and Gerber too if you can. If not, choose one of those two."
Freshman,5,"Its a great school! Specially as a criminal justice or a forensic science student, this school has great programs for anyone looking to major in one of those fields."
Niche User,5,i went there for a college visit for my advance drawing class and it was the best I've ever had experienced. I'm currently planning on going there for 2020. This is an excellent art college for anyone pursuing in art. The community is very homely and has a calm vibe to the whole campus. I couldn't think of any other place to go for the arts.
Freshman,5,"My experience here has opened up many opportunities for me in the future. I have made so many new friends here at the university, and many new connections. The campus is beautiful, the people are wonderful, and there is always something happening on campus. There is a whole shopping strip on Boston Post Road, and the shuttle takes us to Yale which is about 10 minutes away. There's never a dull moment here at the University of New Haven."
Sophomore,5,"I love attending UNH. 99% of all the professors I have had have been dedicated to making sure the student is actually learning. The advising center is always helpful and attentive. My only gripe is the lack of inclusion of commuters. Though there are some things in place to make commuters feel like part of the campus, I feel as though more could be done."
Freshman,5,"The university of new haven offers a wide, diverse, and different way of learning. I for one hope to achieve oevrall success at the school. from the research I did before applying to visiting the school, I instantly fell in love, althoughmy mother did not want me to apply i convinced her and now I am commited to start in September of 2018."
Sophomore,5,While it is out basically in the middle of nowhere - the whole campus is very close knit and the professors are more like friends than merely instructors. All students are supportive of each other and the programs are tailored to prepare each student for their specific major.
Niche User,5,"I would love to go here and I have been accepted, I am trying to get scholarship money so that I can go to this school. I have done a handful of visits and had a few friends who have gone through this school."
Freshman,5,I started coming here this year and so far I like it. The teachers put a ton of effort in to help you succeed but only if you ask for it. The food is good. everyone seems to complain about it but i havent seen a problem with it so far. overall good school
Niche User,5,The University of New Haven has an amazing campus. One that is clean and provides a safe and nurturing environment.
Junior,5,This school has excellent programs for the forensic psychology field with a handful of great opportunities! Having the privilege to meet and learn from Dr. Henry Lee himself was truly amazing.
Alum,5,"The University has diverse course offerings, most teachers have previously worked in the field that they are teaching to the students. Additionally there are many extra curricular options on campus to please all interests!"
Junior,4,I am enjoying my experience at the University of New Haven. There is an abundance of things to do while in school. The facilities are outstanding and the people are great.
Freshman,4,I took one summer class online. The proffesor was very nice and had a great attitude. We had a group project which was a little difficult to do online but overalll a great class.
Freshman,4,"The school was very organized and would hold a lot of events for the students to partake in! Quality of classes would vary, but my personal experience was great! I had  a lot of professors who would do their best to communicate with the students and make sure we were all on the same page. I even had professors who would answer emails rather frequently. The overwhelming amount of clubs was also a very big positive aspect as it was easy to find something you liked an could get involved in."
Freshman,4,"The professors were wonderful in accommodating the curriculum according to the circumstances. I was still able to learn effectively. The professors did their best in communicating with the students, whether it be over email or another medium like Zoom. Overall, they were great with the change."
Junior,4,"The professors that work here are very helpful. They are willing to go the extra mile to help students understand the material. They are very friendly and have no problem having a conversation about anything. There have been some recent problems with some of the students that go to the Unversity, but they DO NOT represent the overall atmosphere of the school. It is a very inclusive school that works with the surrounding community well. There is a lot of clubs at my school that range from sports to religious organizations to jedi club. It really is amazing how much there is to do at the school."
Junior,4,"All the professors are very understanding and are okay with talking to students over the phone or through zoom at all hours of the day and night. I also took two summer classes that recently ended and the professors were amazing. Engineering classes are tough as they are and without being in person they are much harder to grasp the concepts, but the professors did a great job explaining and going through example problems throughout the course."
Junior,4,"The classes they offer for my major are amazing. The teachers are all super experienced, hands on, and offer valuable advice. Outside of class it’s a little bit of a boring campus."
Sophomore,4,Professors were very understading during this crisis and were patient and were always there to listen. They took the needs of the students very seriously and made this whole situation a lot easier than it would've been if they didnt.
Sophomore,4,I like how involved everyone is on campus. Students are treated with respect and our concerns are taken seriously by the President.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed my first year at New Haven, the atmosphere is extremely friendly and everyone has their own place where they can fit in. Unfortunately, because of COVID-19 my year got cut short so if I were able to change anything, I would change how early I came home. However, I do really appreciate that the president of our school cared more about our health than having us risk it."
Senior,4,"It is a medium size campus so the class sizes were generally smaller so it was easier to stay engaged in class. Also many of the professors were still active in the field so they provided valuable information. Overall it was a good experience as long as I was involved on campus but, the higher-up administration does not do a good job of managing. it put very good professors in a tough position sometimes."
Niche User,4,I love all the academic choices that this university has. I also love the athletic life at new haven. I will hopefully be attending new haven in the fall and be playing for the softball team. I wish they could lower the price for attendance. I feel as if this school is not as big as some of the other schools that have this high of tuition.
Niche User,4,"I would give the University of New Haven 4/5 stars because as of right now I am not a student, but I will share why I picked this school to further my studies.  I went to a very small high school that did not encourage students to get involved.  Teachers and administrators really did not reach out or care if students were not keeping up.  Sports were practically nonexistent, and many people quit or had a hard time getting noticed because everyone else was so inexperienced.  However, University of New Haven already is showing more care and interest in my success than anyone did in my 4 years of high school.  I've noticed they take pride in their teams, they help each other like family.  They have multiple pages on social media to reach out to upperclassmen for advice so you feel prepared and welcomed.  They try to encourage all students to get involved.  Their major specific programs also made me more comfortable about choosing what career path to take and I'm excited to attend."
Freshman,4,Very personalized and gives you the tools you need to succeed.  There is always help available for you if you need it
Sophomore,4,"The University of New Haven has an extremely diverse and supportive student body. Every individual on campus is welcoming, as well as friendly. It is beyond easy to understand that the staff, students, and president are all in favor of making everyone's college experience beyond exciting and knowledgable."
Senior,4,Small university and you are able to have good contact with professors. Most are very helpful. Tutors are available if needed. Lots of clubs/organizations that you can join.
Freshman,4,I am a freshman here. I am studying forensics and the department is really cool and fun while also being wicked serious about academics.
Freshman,4,My time at the University of  New Haven has been a very positive experience. This university really promotes community and inclusivity. Professors here genuinely want their students to succeed. Most people on campus are extremely friendly and will hold the doors for strangers or simply say hi.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, everything is great minus one or two professors and the housing assignments. Some professors make you question how much the university actually cares about your well-being, honestly I don't know how some of them are hired. And the housing process is a YIKES. I got placed into the worst housing available- i have rust on the carpets and ceiling, mold on the faucets and windows, and stains everywhere. God knows whats been on the carpet before I moved in. I also can't even tell what my money goes into on campus. There's a new engineering building and it is gorgeous.. but how many students aren't engineering majors and aren't benefitting from this? Why isn't any money going into updating residence halls? Otherwise, it's a really welcoming and diverse environment. The student body has a whole is friendly, even without many friends it still feels like a family here."
Freshman,4,"Very welcoming, very understanding. They have incredible opportunities for my major and have already exposed me to job opportunities after college. They have  clubs for everything on campus and anyone can find something they like"
Freshman,4,The University provides support to students so that they have every opportunity to succeed. They also have a solid LLC program for first year students.
Alum,4,My experience at Lyme Academy was an overall positive one due to the very small and supportive community of creative thinkers.
Junior,4,i love  the diversity and how professors push you to do your best. i dislike the fact they don’t give you knowledge about scholarships or how to pay for college
Junior,4,"It was very good for certain programs. Some professors are very well versed on their topics, especially in some of the sciences but some of the other seem to be just phoning it in. Lots of diversity, great gym facilities."
Junior,4,"Great academics, activities, career preparation. Not very diverse, can do more to include commuter/non-traditional students - especially in career advising. Good food and resources."
Senior,4,"The University of New Haven is a great school. The staff goes above and beyond to help the students. Also, the school requires you to get an internship as a graduation requirement, which helps students find jobs after graduation. Since the school is known for their criminal justice, it is great that most of the staff are retired police officers or FBI agents."
Junior,4,The professors are extremely knowledgeable and have real world experience. Many of them have held positions in the fields which they teach. There are constant events on campus that gets everyone involved.
Freshman,4,"They have a large variety of different opportunities to participate at the school outside of their already diverse academic courses, including over 200+ clubs and a number of work study and leadership programs all with much funding backing them up. The staff there are very approachable and open about any topic involving the university and are willing to take feedback and measures on improving their university. They are also very well organized during events such as orientation and it's very visible to they enjoy their job and helping out new coming students and parents."
Sophomore,4,The school offers first year LLC communities for students to meet people within their field. This was a great opportunity to meet new people.
Freshman,4,The University of New Haven offers a really diverse campus and the climate of the campus is very welcoming. Peers are accepting of one another and the university offers a lot of resources to assist alongside your education. The courses are very diverse and specifically geared toward your major.
Freshman,4,"Once you enter the facility, you’re greeted by students, staff and faculty. Everyone is so nice and willing to help you out. The campus is huge and this is the ideal place for people who don’t want to be surrounded by thousands of people. I love it there. There’s diversity, the teachers wants what’s best for you. I haven’t attended the school officially but I can’t wait to start this semester."
Freshman,4,Great school for a variety of different majors but especially for criminal justice and forensic science majors.
Freshman,4,"University of New Haven is everything you could want from a college and more. The academics are amazing. You’re provided with endless opportunities and the connections you make here not only last a lifetime but can help you progress your career exponentially. The campus is very safe, and the administration permits a safety walk where students walk around the campus with campus police and point out things that concern them so the police can address. Professors are kind, enthusiastic and always willing to help."
Freshman,4,"Personally, I really enjoy a small campus. It makes it easier to be involved in extracurriculars and make new friends. Everyone on campus is very nice and they provide you with so many opportunities and resources if you feel like you're struggling."
Freshman,4,"After my first semester at the University, I have experienced so much in just a few short months. The transition into college was stressful but the UNH staff and students made it welcoming and was full of support. I however, like many other students have suffered and still am suffering from anxiety and depression. I made a decision for myself to seek some help by going to the counseling department. I am not too happy with the licensed counselors on campus, I feel like I had to keep reexplaining my life story and my struggles. If I could change one thing it would my their counseling department. If the counseling services were set up differently with more hours for students to go to, I feel as though many more students will want to go and seek help. Overall the University of New Haven has great academics with a great campus student life."
Freshman,4,There are many things to do at the university and it is simple to make a new club if you have enough people. However there is a lot of ideas about the school that are portrayed differently than they actually are.
Graduate Student,4,It's a wonderful school that accept people from all race and their teaching methodologies makes learning beautiful.
Junior,4,I am a transfer student at the U. Of New Haven. The college has dedicated so much time to welcoming all new students and having them become involved in campus. I am so happy to call UNH my new home!
Sophomore,4,"The University of New Haven has some of the regions best educational programs. It has one of the best sports management programs in the nation, it has both an amazing criminal justice and engineering programs, and it has a pretty good music program. Not only that New Haven offers unique majors that many other universities do not offer, for example National security."
Sophomore,4,I like how the teachers there are patient with the students and really take their time to hep the students be successful as much as possible. The teachers take great pride in helping students succeed in school. The only thing I would like to see change at the school is the food there and parking spaces there. The university needs more food options and parking spaces for the students attending the school.
Sophomore,4,"This coming fall I will be a sophomore at the University of New Haven, and from my personal experience the university is really dedicated to helping its students with academics, adjusting to college life, even writing a resume or applying for a job. The university is very inclusive and encourages diversity. The campus is beautiful and there is always something to do around campus. Also getting involved at the university is highly encouraged, as there are many clubs and sports teams to be apart of. The university could use some housing updates, and the food could be better but is not terrible. More tutors are needed in the center for learning resources, because I feel enough aren't available. Lastly, the surrounding area outside of the school is a little rundown, but downtown New Haven is really cool and I would definitely recommend checking it out."
Sophomore,4,Classes are interesting and challenging. Professors are always accessible. Housing is pretty good but some buildings could use some updates. Food is rough sometimes.
Junior,4,"The campus is small but everything is almost brand new. Since it is a small campus, you are able to get closer to your professors and have more one on one meetings to discuss your strengths and weaknesses in the course. The only down part is how expensive the university is."
Sophomore,4,"I love their Forensics program, the staff is wonderful and always willingly to talk in case you need help. I love the classes and the professors for every one of my classes. It is just a wonderful experience at the school."
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere on campus is very accepting and encouraging.  There is a lot of diversity, and there is a club or sport for everyone on campus.  There are always fun events going on.  As for academic experiences, there are so many resources for students to use in order to find help or tutoring."
Sophomore,4,"The University of New Haven is by far the best school for anyone looking to major in Criminal Justice, Forensic Science, Forensic Psychology, National Security, Fire Science, etc. Our programs are unmatched by any other school."
Freshman,4,"As a student who just finished their freshman year at this university, there were a lot of good things, but it also had its areas where it could be improved. For one, they keep contructing new buildings in old parking lots on campus, causing commuters to search for a place to park for an hour and be late to class. There could also be more variety in the food, as it is basically the same things every day. As for the dorms, there is one building that is extremely cramped and uncomfortable, but all of the others are livable and comfortable."
Senior,4,The University of New Haven is a very good college to attend. I am majoring in Criminal Justice and I am very happy with my education so far. There are many great professors that have real world experiences. This enhances the classroom experience for the students and helps me personally learn better.
Senior,4,"While I only gave four stars to the university, it's only because nothing is perfect. Many times I hear some of my peers say ""this school sucks"", ""this school has done nothing for me"", but here is what I have to say to that, you are an adult. The University of New Haven has given me so many opportunities in the real world with internships and volunteer work. As a Sport Management major, the professors in my department are dedicated to making sure that we leave the university with the ability to get a full time job. They really do care about you and it just isn't the Sport Management department. YOU need to put yourself out there and get the help you need, there are plenty of guests speakers, social events, professional events that are going on campus. As I said previously, you are an adult, you need to make things happen for yourself. Yes, there are some professors that are questionably still teaching at the university but, that can go for every college. I would recommend going here."
Niche User,4,What I liked about University of New Haven is they are able to give students an initial start on what they want to major by starting to do hands on. This is a way that can give students and opportunity to experience what there career is about and if it is their calling. I also enjoyed from New Haven was how students are dedicated in their education. New Haven showed how many students have graduated then from other colleges. This comes to prove that professors in New Haven are dedicated in being able to guide their students in their career. Changes New Haven can make is being able to go out to more high schools where low income students attend. This will show students how great of an education they provided. As well being able to provided more financial aid for low income students who desire to attend their New Haven.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently enjoying the graphic design program at the university. The professors are amazing, and they really push you into real life situations in order to prepare you for the real world. As a transfer the process was very easy as the school even offers transfer meetings to discuss the program you are interested in applying for before you even apply. One drawback is the limited parking. As a commuter you have to fight for spots."
Freshman,4,"Academically, the University of New Haven has been amazing! However, they could improve in the campus food and the residential living areas!"
Freshman,4,This is my first semester here and I honestly love most of my classes and my professors. All my classes are great and the experience I've had so far does justice to my choice to come here.
Sophomore,4,"It has provided a great college experience. I have been able to gain the necessary learning that is needed of me for the criminal justice field. I have been able to make quite  numerous amount of friends, which has also been great."
Junior,4,"Wonderful and caring professors who are willing to spend time working with you. There are countless academic and professional opportunities promoted at UNH. Many students are dedicated and focused on academics. The surrounding area isn’t great, but development is occurring and the area is becoming much safer. But if you’re looking for supportive residential life staff and quality housing, that doesn’t exist."
Freshman,4,"As a current student here at UNH, I can honestly say that this university welcomes all guests with open arms. With all the student affairs it impossible to be bored and having nothing to do."
Junior,4,"So far my experience at the University of New Haven has been great. One thing I love at the University are the clubs we have on campus. No one should ever feel left out because there is something for everyone. One thing that I wish could change is, the last minute information for transfer students. I can speak for myself, as a transfer student who came in at the spring semester, there was not much information for me about the campus itself."
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere of family that the campus brings soon as you arrive. The staff and students are all welcoming and inviting which is nice and reassuring. I would love to see maybe some more off campus transportation but other than that, I love The University of New Haven!"
Junior,4,The school is great and they offer lots of programs both academic and not. The biggest issue I have with the school is the cost.
Niche User,4,"I absolutely love the majors that are offered and I'm big on sports so it has the sport at a division I want. The campus is located in a part of Connecticut that isn't the best, but they make do. There's plenty to do both on and off campus."
Freshman,2,I personally did not enjoy remote learning for many different reasons. I am someone that can get easily distracted so when I am removed from the classroom and put into an environment where all the stuff I enjoy is around I tend to procrastinate longer and harder on my work. Our professors also tried very hard to make the online learning experience as easy as possible and were very understanding if things were not submitted on time due to varying circumstances. I know that I had suffered from a power outage a couple days before on of the last papers were due
Senior,2,Not super student focused. Very tuition motivated. They keep accepting more students than they have the room for.
Graduate Student,2,"This college is WAY too expensive. You cannot form good relationships with your advisors or your professors (only a few). Majority are stuffy and they think because they are ""private"" they are all that.  The psychology department as other departments have their favorite ""pets"" though they do not give others a chance even when you ask repeatedly  and have super high grades, they give you a big ""runaround""....."
College Junior,2,Unfortunately the Greek life get all the funding for clubs which limits the growth of other clubs or activities.
College Junior,2,Not enough facilities for all varsity sports or club sports to have adequate space.
College Senior,2,The housing process is the absolute worst. The lottery system is the dumbest idea ever and there's not nearly enough housing for all of the students attending UNH.
College Junior,2,"There are many difficulties in housing, one of which is actually getting housing. Many students especially seniors do not get the housing the need due to space. Also freshman have one of the nicest housing options. Off campus housing is very nice but the options to get to campus are very bad. Cant have a car or anything"
College Freshman,2,There aren't really any parties.
College Freshman,2,"There are two clubs, thats about it."
College Junior,2,Greek life doesn't appear to be a big part of this school. I have seen people wearing letters around campus but haven't seen or heard about any activities sponsored by Greek Life.
College Sophomore,2,"There is definitely not enough housing available. Despite this, everyone has to put in a nonrefundable five hundred dollar deposit if they want to be put into the lottery, which does not gaurentee housing. If you do not get housing then you lose that money. Some dorms are nicer than others. They should update all of them with more amenities such as stairs and elvators in all the buildings."
College Sophomore,2,There is not that much school spirit. Not that many people attend sports games here. I am not a sports fan either. At the football games there is more people than the other sports but never fills up the bleachers except for the homecoming game.
College Junior,2,"If you want to be a part of greek life here, it is available, but not mandatory to feel like your a part of something. Greek life can be very snobby and cliquey here, so I would not recommend it."
College Sophomore,2,Good food is hard to come by most times.
College Sophomore,2,All dorms but 2 are old and gross.
College Junior,2,Nothing is really that appetizing. Unless it's lunch because students have to pay for it and not use a swipe.
College Freshman,2,Greek life here seem to be involved at mostly fundraisers for their own benefits and are widely known for throwing cliquey parties during the weekends.
College Freshman,2,"With the large cost of tuition and board, scholarships are the best bet for getting any financial aid. I received the presidential scholarship and grants to cover just room and boarding. Student loans are going to build up quickly so be prepared to set up realistic payment plans with the high tuition cost. Be sure to know all the deadlines because the due dates are minimally announced throughout the website and campus."
College Freshman,2,parties are rarely ever good
College Freshman,2,Hate the RA's on the lower floors. My RD is no favored among his residence. Cops feel like they are state troopers or something.
College Sophomore,2,I only say its bad because there isn't much diversity of greek life. USGA just made it even more difficult for Multi cultural organizations to be recognized on this campus. Basically they don't support multi cultural greeks unless they're performing.
College Sophomore,2,Departments aren't willing to communicate on a students behalf. They get the job done if your keep asking them to get it done and arguing with them about getting it done
College Freshman,2,Not the best at all
College Freshman,2,I don't want to be here anymore.
College Freshman,2,"I'm trying my best to transfer. I don't wanna be here anymore, it's just not the place for me."
College Freshman,2,The same people go to the same parties all the time and you HAVE TO have a connection otherwise you'd never know and no one would invite you.
College Freshman,2,"The atmosphere is not positive. People do not love being here. The only reason why I am sticking through with this school is because I made many connections. I wish sports were bigger and the school would lower tuition because it is not worth $51,000."
College Freshman,2,You don't hear much about sports around campus. The school does not have much spirit and the athletic facilities are not open to non-athletic students so I am not sure how they are.
College Freshman,2,"We do not have parties. I understand that parties are not why we are in school but it is fun to have the break from studying. It is important on a social aspect, with minimal parties that equals minimal opportunities to meet others not in your organizations or classes. I wish there were more parties."
College Freshman,2,"The rooming selection is not great but the dorm selections are good. The cost is unreasonable and way too expensive, it feels like a college student is living at high school. There is no ease with housing process, it is outrageous and confusing."
College Sophomore,2,"I got quite a big academic scholarship, however financial aid is tough.  It is completely dependent upon filing a FAFSA (which is the government- handled ""need based"" scholarships"". If you know anybody in college, they will tell you how bad FAFSA is at providing the financial aid you'd need to attend university."
College Freshman,2,There is only three or four places on campus to eat. There isn't much variety but it's decent food most of the time.
College Freshman,2,I don't go to parties that much but I do go downtown to clubs. But I always hear about parties being crashed by cops so there's that.
College Junior,2,"The amount of core courses we're required to take is a joke. Of the ~120 credits required for a degree at UNH, ~50 of them are core courses not related to the major at all. It's a waste of time and money. I know for a fact my friends at other colleges and universities take more major specific classes and will be better prepared for a career than anyone from UNH. I love the people here and UNH has a lot of career fairs but for STEM majors, unless you get a great internship of you're one of the professors favorites and they put in a good word for you in the field you're trying to enter, students from other universities will be more equipped and experienced for the job.  I'm very concerned about a career after I graduate."
College Junior,2,Very limited housing. Offices rude & unhelpful.
College Freshman,2,"There are barely any and sometimes, they are not that good."
College Freshman,2,"I do not hear much about our athletics. I went to one football game, and just ended up tailgaiting with friends and hanging out. I did watch halftime though and then I went back."
College Freshman,2,There is no deticated  areas for off campus housing. Difficult to find houses for rent.
College Sophomore,2,My experience was bad. I had a lot of issues going on and I could not get a counselor who was available to save my life. My college adviser was always missing in action as well and I felt alone most of the time. And I had no one to help me get through it as I was supposed to considering their jobs were to assist the students the best way they knew how.
College Sophomore,2,The school seemed to have trouble with giving you your financial aid. They'll take money from you then tell you that you owe then money. I was supposed to receive a refund check and they never mailed it to me because I had a financial hold. I suggested that they use my refund money to partially cover the payment and they refused. I was confused.
College Freshman,2,Received minimal aid after months of asking for it. Financial Aid was a hassle to receive.
College Freshman,2,"Don't get me wrong, I got grants and scholarships to help pay for my education. But as of right now I'm $10,000 short and my parents and I can't get approved for a loan..."
College Senior,2,"Bartels is horrible. The amount of times I've had raw vegetables that were supposed to be cooked and dry chewy meat are too many to count. I generally stick to pizza and French fries (chicken tenders, and mozzarella sticks at lunch) and Sandellas quesadillas for dinner."
College Junior,2,"I do not enjoy the dining services on campus.  First off, their hours are not convenient for my schedule.  Dinner during the week ends at 7:30 pm at Bartels and I think it should be open until 8:30 pm.  Also, Jazzmans is not open on the weekends, so the only place to get coffee on campus with the meal plan is at the Charger Cafe in the library, however, their hours are very limiting on the weekends.  Because of this, students are forced to go to the Dunkin Donuts on campus, but will have to pay out of pocket.  Bartels does not provide students with enough healthy options.  They have a salad bar nightly, but the lettuce and toppings do not appear fresh.  And the main course available on most evenings is a pasta dish.  There is not a lot of variety for students when it comes to campus dining."
College Freshman,2,It is always cold and cloudy here. It makes everyone depressed.
College Freshman,2,We can not get a WiFi signal in our room at all. Most of the time the computers in the library are all being used.
College Sophomore,2,"Its very run down in the area, and i hear nothing but bad things about the neighborhood and the people in it. There is almost nothing to do off campus unless you take the shuttle to downtown and then once you're downtown after a few days you've most likely done everything there is to do in the area."
College Sophomore,2,thursdays through sundays its just a bunch of hung over and drugged up people everywhere
College Sophomore,2,It gets really windy which makes the cold even worse and in the summer it is unbearably hot within the dorms and outside
College Sophomore,2,Shuttles are inconvenient and never run at the right time. Drivers are rude.
College Senior,2,"Greek life is perceived as students who simply need to buy friends. Greeks are super cliquey with each other, but always start drama with one another."
College Sophomore,2,Too darn expensive for what you get.
College Sophomore,2,they need to give out more scholarships.  This school is so expensive they dont help out
College Junior,2,"The housing process is pretty much a mess. The lottery system doesn't make much sense and there are more students than there is available housing. A new residential building is being built, but off campus housing options tend to be better if you can't get something on campus. I believe that on campus housing is guaranteed to freshman"
College Junior,2,"Not much aid is given out in my opinion, and my experience with the bursar's/financial aid department has been pretty awful. Make sure to have all your documents in order, apply for aid early, and get everything in writing in case something goes wrong."
College Freshman,2,"It will be normally seen, as with any colleges, mostly the freshman student body go overboard experimenting with drugs and alcohol. Hospital visits and police action will frequently happen."
College Freshman,2,It is not worth trying to participate in illegal activities and becoming a nuisance; fines are typically consequential. 
College Freshman,2,Finding parking is a major problem for commuters and any students that drive due to the limited parking space.
College Freshman,2,There is nothing special or disguising with the varsity athletics and most students pay little to no attention to any of the sports teams.
College Senior,2,"Trains are expensive, and don't forget you have to get a taxi to get you to the train station!"
Alum,1,"Throw out your money, its a better use of it. They have only one or two professors that are even remotely competent. Most of them know less than you will by the end of your senior year. They have a professor who was fired from a Police Department for falling asleep and then lying under oath. If that's who you want to learn from be my guest. Once you graduate getting them to even get you a transcript is like pulling teeth. Usually takes them a month to even respond. The entire ""University"" is a joke. Go anywhere else if you want a higher education."
Alum,1,Took one online class. Why would you EVER pay these thieves to take an online class here?!?!? Don't do it.
Freshman,1,"It was all a shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam! Left after my freshman year because it felt like you were throwing money away. This school does a very good job at marketing their scam! Every of my friends I know from here either dropped out or transferred out! The outside looks great but once you get in you realize you've been bamboozled.

Did you know the same company that made our food makes prison food? 

Also everyone acts like they're rich and that it's such a good school, like some sort of 'crabs in a bucket' ideology."
Senior,1,"I don't know who is fooling themselves in terms of saying this is a great university. The cost alone is absolutely ridiculous and not worth the resources you receive or the overall quality of the buildings and upkeep on campus. When I saw that the university was the 7th most diverse school in CT my jaw dropped, but that is absolutely ridiculous. The school is roughly 70% white, so diversity is ABSOLUTELY lacking. As a latina student at the campus, I have never felt so out of place and uncomfortable. Housing is by far the biggest issue. The school over accepts students and now housing is a HUGE issue for student this year and next year. The school has gone to accepting just about anyone and everyone. Racial tensions on campus are absolutely ridiculous and not addressed. Overall, I regret spending my 4+ years here and being over $130,000 in debt for a school that provided me with a poor education and no resources for finding jobs after graduation."
Sophomore,1,"2 years later, I wish I never came here. 
Sophomore year (this year) is when the true colors of the school started to show. The dorms are horrible and disgusting, thin walls, mold, and no AC and uncontrolled heat. There is also constant construction, garbage collection at four in the morning, and overall trucks and noise. 
The construction is a whole other thing. We never received a single email or notice about any construction that was going on outside our building or on campus. 
I am convinced they don’t care about the students that are already here, only bringing new ones to campus. There are too few therapists and counselors to effectively help the thousands of students on campus. The food has made people sick and for a while I was afraid to eat because there was no allergen information on food signs. 
If I got the chance to do it all over again, if I got the chance to choose a university with what I know now, I would have never come here."
Sophomore,1,It is not as expected. It is overpriced with a minimal payout. I refuse to recommend this college to anyone.
Freshman,1,"1. As an athlete, having to walk over 10 minutes off campus to get to the workout facilities is a joke! Not the best of areas to walk through either. 

2. Food is horrible! The amount of complaints since the year has started is unreal and there has been little to nothing done about it. There needs to be a larger dining hall with more options or more places to eat for such a crowded campus like this. 

3. The shuttles are unbelievable unreliable and never come after 12 or 1am if you are in downtown NH. Every time I have had to pay for an Uber back to campus. 

4. The housing is atrocious especially for freshmen. I know we are not supposed to be in a nice room but unless you are in Westside or any of the new dorms, then you are shoved into a small cube with low ceilings and no storage. 

5. Surrounding area is 100% not safe. The amount of shit that happens so close to campus is unreal. 

Hopefully, I am transferring soon. Waste of $50,000."
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing very close and mostly everything is shut down by around midnight. You either need a car, or you're walking through the McDonald's drive thru with a huge group of fellow schoolmates"
College Sophomore,1,A good party here is pretty much nonexistent unless you know the right people or the people in frats. Mostly people party responsibly in dorms or bars because they are less intensely crowded than frat parties or others associated with groups of the school
College Freshman,1,"I literally hate most of the campus food. I basically only eat from pandini's, the grill or FoD."
College Freshman,1,The local area is very sketchy. If you walk off campus you might never return.
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman, the party scene absolutely sucks. You need connections in order to have a good time."
College Freshman,1,Greek life should have a house to live in together off campus and the fact that they do not exist on campus seems odd to me.
College Senior,1,"I give this a horrible rating not because I had a horrible internship (my internship actually rocks) but UNH will not give you a internship (at least not for criminal justice). You need to find one and for the most part you need to find it on your own. I interned at the police department, unpaid, and I got to visit review case reports, send letters to  and visit victims."
College Sophomore,1,You can't park off campus.
College Sophomore,1,The wifi is awful. The library doesn't have many computers but the printing isn't too bad.
College Freshman,1,"There are two climate conditions in the West Haven area, extremely hot and humid or uncomfortably cold."
College Freshman,1,Worst food is available and students will spends hundreds of dollars just to avoid eating it. Food is mediocre and frequently causes health problems.
College Freshman,1,"Housing is one of the biggest problems any student at this school has, EXPENSIVE and CRAMPED!"
College Freshman,1,"Cost of the school overestimates its worth. Food, social life, dorm living, weather conditions, and affordability is not worth any prospective students time. However, if a student aspires to come to the University of New Haven, it is some what of a reasonable option to enroll but even so, there are better colleges out there with a better college experience at a lower cost."
College Freshman,1,"Hardly anyone cares to join Greek life and with the lack of interests, all fraternities and sororities are desperate to have ANYONE."
College Senior,1,"The chances are slim, in finding a parking spot ,even if you show up an hour before class to look for parking."
College Senior,1,"Be careful, some students have been mugged, and even held at gunpoint"
College Freshman,1,There are not enough parking spots for the amount of commuters and professors that have to park. 
College Junior,1,"Downtown clubs are overrated and for freshmen. Some house parties are alright, but not worth it."
College Junior,1,Parking after 9 AM is impossible especially since a new dorm is being built.
College Freshman,1,The wifi is pretty bad.
College Freshman,1,It gets really cold over here. 
College Junior,1,parking is hard no too many spotsd
College Junior,1,the food on campus is not all that great its pretty much the same things and it gets old after a while
College Junior,1,it is pretty safe there are lights around campus and buttons you could press in case you get into a situation and need help
College Sophomore,1,The WiFi here is not to reliable 
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid here is not too helpful 
College Sophomore,1,There should be more parking spots on campus
College Sophomore,1,"The campus police is very strict about the underage drinking and drug use. Every time you get caught, you get written up by campus police and sent to alcohol education meetings. Our dorm buildings are rated as dry or moist and if you get caught drinking in a dry building, the penalties are more severe."
College Sophomore,1,"Post freshman year, they don't give a crap about you as a student. I got screwed over like hell come registration time so I got none of my required classes. I can't wait to transfer out of this hellhole. I'm not even getting that great of a degree. Don't come here if you aren't a criminal justice or marine bio student, it isn't worth it."
College Sophomore,1,The network is horrible. Wireless is horrible. They don't care about us. I would not go to this school.
College Freshman,1,"I receive no financial aid, school is expensive and not very generous with grants to students."
College Senior,1,"Parking services is absolutely atrocious.  Not only do they not offer enough parking but they frequently block off available spots for current students for events and for random people that they choose for specific spots.  The admissions office had 10 cars towed in one day and some were in legal commuter parking spots.  But, all the admissions workers are allowed to park directly outside their building and use orange cones to block off their own spots.  The police are constantly scouring for violations even when people get to campus a half hour before their classes and eventually give up not being able to find a spot. The first day of the trimester I picked up my parking pass and while I was picking it up I got a parking ticket."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is horrible. There is not enough parking for commuters, let alone residents. The price of parking permits for residents is way too high considering how bad parking it is. Freshman cannot have cars and sophomores are forced to park far away."
College Junior,1,This really isnt that much parking for the commuters who really need it. They spend hours trying to find parking. Parking for residents isn't much better but there is more space if you look for it. And they are suppose to be adding more parking in the next for years as well.
College Sophomore,1,"There are very few parking lots around campus and the ones we do have fill up quickly. Freshman are not allowed to have cars. And if you don't get a parking spot within the school's parking, then most people will park on the streets but that also gets filled up quickly."
College Sophomore,1,"Due to the school starting as an extremely small campus, the parking lots have been added on as the campus expands. This makes it so that they are poorly designed and can get cramped. Freshmen are not allowed to have a car on campus and Sophomores get the worst parking that can be up to a 10 minute walk from your housing."
College Freshman,1,"Although there are lot of options to eat, the quality is lousy and you always have to wait forever to get your food."
College Freshman,1,"There isn't parties at all on campus. If you want a party college than this college isn't for you. University of New Haven is what you would call a clubbing school. On the weekends, mostly Thursday nights, a lot of people hop, well more like shove and push to get a seat, on a bus that goes downtown and everyone hits the clubs. Most of the clubs don't ID so a lot of people get drunk that way. The thing is, this is mostly a criminal justice school so they are really strict. If you have a red solo cup an RA can just look in it and see what you're drinking. It's not a school with much nightlife. A lot of students go home on the weekend or visit their friends that go to Quinnipiac which is more of a party school than UNH."
College Senior,1,The off-campus housing selection is difficult and expensive. The availability is also bad because you have to compete with other student (many) to get a good selection.
College Freshman,1,"Housing is guaranteed for freshman, but after that you're out of luck. Most upperclassman are forced off campus. There are upperclass dorms but there's not nearly enough space for everyone."
College Junior,1,Parking on this campus is hard. The best time to get a good spot is to get there early in the morning. If you don't want to do that make sure you leave for your class at least 40 minutes early so you can find parking but you may end up walking quite a distance. There is no reserved spots for classes (such as junior or senior) and only a few for faculty so it's really first come first serve for everyone on campus. Also the parking is strictly enforced.
College Sophomore,1,"The parking situation is horrible. Everyone complains about it, commuters and resident students alike. For the number of students that UNH has driving there are not even close to efficient number of parking spaces. Freshman are not allowed to have cars on campus, only upperclassman and commuters are allowed too. The parking permit is very expensive, it is $200 to park for the entire year and the passes you have to display in your window are a nightmare to get off of your windshield at the end of the year however if you do not stick it on, even if you tape it on, you will get a ticket for improper display of your pass. Sophomore's can have cars but have to park at North Campus which is a good ten minute walk from main campus and the road is in a sketchy area of town. Sophomores can only park on campus during the week between 5pm and 7am the next day and all day on Saturdays and Sundays. Juniors and Seniors can park on campus but parking spaces are limited, some upperclassman end up at North Campus because they couldn't find a space on campus because there are designated resident and commuter parking lots are there are way too many commuter spots and not enough resident spots. Campus police are strict about parking and will ticket, they do so often and the fines are outrageous."
College Sophomore,1,"Not nearly enough parking for commuters. You need to get onto campus at least 30 minutes before you need to be somewhere to find parking. It really is a competitive sport. Instead of the University building a parking garage or another parking lot, they're building a new residence hall. Commuters are not their priority."
College Freshman,1,"Worst freshmen experience ever. You will not get what your money is paying. If you value your money,social life, or health go somewhere else"
College Freshman,1,its always cold. classic new england coastal weather. classes never get cancelled though
College Freshman,1,West Haven is not the prettiest town. Kinda run down in some areas. Not very safe last at night.
Recent Alumnus,1,There's never anywhere to park unless youre on campus before 9am.
College Junior,1,"Adult Returning After 30 Years Away from College – As a working adult, it is almost impossible to get financial aid at the school, even though I am paying mortgage, student loans from my children, car payments, etc."
College Junior,1,NO SPACE! You have to show up at like 6 am if you want to actually find a spot. There are way too many commuters and not enough spots. The campus police make no effort to accommodate anyone. If you want the school to grow so badly...you need to have room for everyone.
College Junior,1,Not Happy – I believe my unhappiness with my program was based on the school I chose to attend. University of New Haven should hire a new music business instructor.
College Junior,1,"Terrible Instructor – All instructors I have for music classes at my school (theory, recording, etc.) are wonderful, besides the instructor for my music business classes. These are clearly the most important classes being a music business major, and I feel that the instructor has very bad teaching methods, nor cares about his students' understanding of the subject matter. He isn't helpful and most students do not like him."
College Sophomore,1,"New Haven isn't really the best place to live, since it does have a high crime rate. Actually near the school itself I didn't see any apartments or housing, and if there are I wouldn't know the quality since i didn't visit it."
College Junior,1,"Parking at UNH sucks balls. Don't do it. I beg you. If you have to, park at the ShopRite at the bottom of the hill and walk to campus. It will save you 30 minutes trying to find a parking spot"
